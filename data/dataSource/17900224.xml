                        targets="t17900224-2-off16 t17900224-2-crimeloc18"/>, I met the prisoner at the bar, and two more; I came up just abreast of them; as soon as I came up, one of them knocked me down with his fist; not the prisoner at the bar; I jumped up and catched hold of him that knocked me down, by the coat; then the prisoner at the bar, and the other, ran away: he wrenched himself from me; I ran after him, and caught him about ten yards off the man who knocked me down; then the prisoner at the bar, and one other of them, came up and struck me with a bludgeon across the head, several violent blows: they had both bludgeons; in consequence of which, I was obliged to let go the man; and instantly my hat was taken off my head after I was struck; I did not know by which; but I saw it in the prisoner's hand; I caught hold of it, and then two of them got hold of it; another with the prisoner; and took and dragged me down the street for twenty yards by the hat, I having hold of it all the time; and they tried to drag me into a house in Parker's-lane.</p>
               <p>Was it in Drury-lane, or in Parker's-lane, when you had hold of the man the second time? - I cannot positively say; it was just at the corner.</p>
               <p>Was that a public-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door open? - Yes; and I got up one or two of the steps; there are three steps into it: I received then one or two blows on the head and arm with bludgeons; and the prisoner was then one that struck me; then I let my hat go; I ran as fast as possible back again; and they all rushed out after me to catch me, after I was about three houses from them; and as soon as they caught me, one of them drew a cutlass; not one of the first that struck me; there were seven or eight then pursued me; I did not see where the rest of the men came from; and he pushed it at me twice; and I fell down, and said to him, lord, have mercy on me; then the prisoner at the bar and two or three others, struck me ten or twelve times over the head, sides, and legs, with bludgeons; and having done, they all ran down Parker's-lane. The patrols came immediately, and picked me off the ground, and took me to the watch-house: in about an hour after, the prisoner at the bar was brought in.</p>
               <p>Where had you been? - To Silver-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>What kept you so late? - I waited for to go home with a man to Fish-street-hill, as I had let a man have my bed, who came out of the country: I lodge in Silver-street; and the person came with me as far as Brownlow-street; he told me he would overtake me:

             is his name; and I did not again see him, till I saw him in the watch-house; it was his room I was going to: I was perfectly sober; I did not drink the whole of a pot of beer, not being perfectly well; it was a light night; and when the prisoner met me first, it was close to the lamps; nothing was said to me before I was knocked down; but, in Parker's-lane, one of them said, go it; but I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to you, when they had hold of you the second time? - It was at that time they said go it.</p>
               <p>You had not seen any of these men before, to know them? - Yes; because he had hold of my hat all down the lane; and I took particular notice of the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>How long did the whole of this take? - Not above five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Was that lane well lighted? - There are lights at the corner of the lane: I was not positive, till he came up to me with a bludgeon the second time.</p>
               <p>Where was this? - Just at the corner of Parker's-lane.</p>
               <p>Were the lamps there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you now venture to swear that this prisoner at the bar was one of the men? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240008"/>I am very sure that the prisoner at the bar is the first that struck me with the bludgeon.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after you was taken to the watch-house, was the prisoner brought in? - About three quarters of an hour; they were cleaning me, for I was very bloody from top to toe.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you was picked up, after they left you? - When the patrol came and picked me up, the prisoner and the others had not gone half a moment; they ran off, some people coming down the lane.</p>
               <p>Are the persons here, who brought you in? - Yes; I have still marks of the blows about me: I am a <rs id="t17900224-2-viclabel19" type="occupation">baker</rs>

               <p>Had you described the dress, or the persons who first assaulted you, to any one? - Yes; I had, to the people who came up to me; the other two men had two great coats on, with dark rows of plated metal buttons; and the prisoner had got a close buttoned coat on, buttoned half way up.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see your hat again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you immediately know the prisoner, or was you some time recollecting him? - I immediately knew the prisoner as soon as he was brought in.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday morning: what was done with the prisoner afterwards? - On Monday morning I made shift to go up to Justice Walker's, and the prisoner was examined, and I swore to him; there were three more taken with the prisoner, and brought into the watch-house, but I could not swear to any but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; constable of the night: when this affair happened, the 14th of February, there came into the watch-house many strangers (none of them are here as I know of) with the prosecutor in a very bloody condition, very much cut and wounded. While rendering the prosecutor all the assistance -</p>
               <p>Before this, had the prosecutor given any description of the people? - None that I recollect. The prisoner was brought in with some more; they were brought in for a riot. What the prisoner was brought in for, I am not certain; but he was with the other three in the public-house: the prosecutor got up, and declared the prisoner at the bar was one of the men that cut and wounded him.</p>
               <p>Then the prosecutor fixed on this man as one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The charge against him, being that of the riot in Holborn? - Yes; he had drab-coloured clothes on, and his hair very much over his eyes; he had no signs of blood about him: the prosecutor said that the prisoner was the first that knocked him down with a bludgeon or stick: and he mentioned he struggled with him for his hat. I in consequence took care of him till Monday morning, when he changed his clothes, and had his hair cut, his hair was so much over his eyes; what is called by the appellation of the Tyburn-top.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor offer to know any thing of the other persons? - None of them there: the prosecutor did not speak to any but the prisoner; and of him he never expressed any doubt, or in the least hesitated.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Holborn. On the 13th of this month, Sunday morning, about half past two, or thereabouts, I was in my box in Smart's-buildings in Holborn: I heard a rattle spring below Little Queen-street; I went up: and when I stood there, a man said that there was a man taken to my watch-house half murdered: and for some reason or other, I apprehended the prisoner at the door of the Pilgrim in Holborn, below Little Queen-street; I took him out of the crowd; and three more watchmen followed me, each with a man out of this crowd; we brought them into the watch-house; after that, this prosecutor looked round at all; and he pointed to that man; and said that man struck him with the bludgeon; he was not desired by any person to look at him to my knowledge: I lays hold of him, and says, is there any other man here you can pitch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240009"/>upon? he said, no: the constable then took charge of him. On Monday morning, I conducted the prisoner from the watch-house to the justice's; the prisoner's dress was then altered: at night, he was dressed in a drab close coat; and on Monday morning it was changed.</p>

               <p>I was going home about eleven o'clock: and going home; I went home and knocked at the door; and I could not make any body hear; and I went and had a pint of beer at the Falcon and Castle, Holborn: I had not been in, I believe, five minutes, before there was a trow at the door; I heard the noise, and ran out, as you might have done, Sir; I running out, I was close by the door; there was a parcel of watchmen standing by the door got hold of three men; they took hold of me with these three men; they took me to the watch-house; I had been in about ten minutes; the prosecutor taps me on the shoulder; he says, you are the man that cut me: I makes answer to him, me the man cut you! I never see you to night, that I know of; he makes answer to me, you cut me in Drury-lane! I makes answer, I cut you in Drury-lane; I have not been in Drury-lane to night; immediately he swore to me; and I was taken down in the book, and put backwards: on Monday morning he come to me at the watch-house, and says, if you will tell me you are the man that struck me, I will forgive you. I immediately said, I cannot tell you a thing I know nothing about; then I was fully committed, and sent down to Bridewell; I went to Bridewell: the next day he comes down to me with my mother, and says to me, I believe you are not the man; if you will give me half a guinea, I will file no bill against you; I immediately said, I have not got half a guinea in the world; do you think I would go to give you half a guinea for a thing I know nothing about; I had a long discourse with him; he asked me, Jem, will you eat any thing? I immediately said, no, I have had my dinner; he said, can you drink any thing? says I, I can drink a little drop of beer; he calls for a pot first, and then after that was out, he called for another: he says to my mother, good woman, I will not prosecute your son, for I do not think he is the person: my mother cried, and begged he would not prosecute me at all; and he said, he would not: he says to me, Jem, if you want any thing to eat or drink, send up to the Coach and Horses, in Silver-street, Golden-square; I says, I am very much obliged to you, Sir, and if you have got an old sack, for I lay very cold, I will be much obliged to you to send me one down; he said he would send me one down the next day; he did not send one, nor have I ever seen him since.</p>
               <p>Court to Hall. After you had spoken to the prisoner as being one of those who had knocked you down, when you saw him at the watch-house: did you in the morning say to him, if you will tell me you was the man that struck me, I will forgive you? - No, I never spoke to that effect: I saw him the next morning in the watch-house, but he was one side of the watch-house, and I of the other: I never spoke a word to him that time, till at the justices.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him after he was committed to Bridewell? - Not before Thursday; on that day his mother had been to my cousin, and begged me to go to him, and hear what he had to say in Bridewell, which I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you then say, or any other time to the prisoner, that you believed he was not one of the men? - No, I did not, I never said any thing like it; I told him this, you know you are the person, and if you will tell me who was the man who drew the cutlass, it may be better for you; that was what I said.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him about his giving you half a guinea on the business? - No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Or say that you would not prefer any bill against him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you drink together in any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240010"/>way? - His mother sent for a pot of beer, and paid for it; I believe I did not; I drank once of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You never gave any sort of assurance you would not prosecute him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talk of supplying him with meat or drink? - No, I said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you told him, you knew he was one of the men, of the three, and if he would tell you who drew the cutlass, it might be better for him; what answer did he make to that? - He did not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Court. The persons are not here who took you to the watch-house? - They were strangers to me: I know not who they were, only I know there was some watchmen.</p>

               <p>I am going in sixteen. I live with Mr. Barnett: I remember the prisoner being at our house on the 14th of November; that was on a Saturday. The prisoner desired my master to go with him; I do not know for what purpose; my master said he was busy, and could not; and he told him I should go with him: I did not know where I was to go; the prisoner took me to the water side, and hired a boat; and when we got some distance from the stairs, the prisoner asked me if I had some halfpence in my pocket; I said, I had not; then he asked the waterman to trust him till he came again; he said, he could not; then he said he must have something in hand: then he said he would be down in a few minutes: the waterman said, cannot I go to your father's with you? he said, no, his father would be angry at so many coming: the waterman told him, he must have something in hand first; and the prisoner asked him if he would have his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240012"/>watch? the waterman said, yes, he did not care what it was, so as it was worth the ferry over; so he stood up in the boat and took hold of the chain of his watch, and did not offer to pull it out, and he sat down again; and when we came on the other side of the water, he bid me get out, and go on, and he would follow me; I got out: and the waterman got out of the boat immediately and would not let him go unless he had something in hand; but the prisoner got out and told the waterman he had a chest to be carried over to Iron-gate, and he should return in a few minutes; the waterman still said he must have something in hand till he returned again; then the prisoner called to me, and told me to stop; and he took one of the small weather glasses, the thermometer, from under my arm, to give to the waterman; and he told me he took the number of the boat, and knew the waterman very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take the thermometer by your consent? - Yes; he told me to follow him; and he took me into a publick-house, in <placeName id="t17900224-5-crimeloc35">Tooley-street</placeName>

He took the thermometer and coat from under my arm, and he told me to wait a few minutes, and he should return: he took the things and went out of the publick-house; when he got past the window I went out to see which way he went, and lost sight of him, and did not see him till the 15th of January following, about four in the afternoon, in East Smithfield: I met him, and followed him; and he went into the Cock alehouse, Cock-alley, East Smithfield; I waited two minutes, and he did not come out; and I went home to my master's, and got our young man to go with me: he was coming out as we got there; we followed him; he saw us, and ran into a stable, in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane; the young man took him there; he got away several times; he was very obstropulous: nobody came to assist: he got away from the young man; I followed him, and laid hold of him several times; and he got away; at last we got a constable, and took him; just opposite Well-street, a constable lived: I do not recollect what I said to him: the young man,

I was then several times in the shop where the prisoner was employed; and before I went to breakfast, I noticed that very piece of lead was in its proper place; and between the time of my being in the shop, and his leaving the shop to go to breakfast, he was there alone; and I saw that no one could go where I breakfasted. When I had finished my breakfast, I seated myself in the yard; soon after the clock struck, he came down the stairs of the shop next the yard, and went along the passage towards the street-door; the yard is between the back part of the shop door, and the front of the house. I then ran up into the shop, and missed a piece of lead from the work-shop where he had been; I then desired Mr. Nicholls to follow him, which he did; soon after, he returned, and went along the passage; and I followed him close: he then attempted to go up the stairs into the upper shop; I laid hold of the skirt of his coat, and pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240014"/>him back; and I saw a piece of lead fall, I suppose from under his waistcoat, which piece of lead was marked with my instrument. I afterwards had him conveyed before a magistrate, from whence he was fully committed.</p>

               <p>I manage business for Mr. Clarke; I saw the blanket in the shop at one o'clock, the time I usually go to dinner, and the rug; the piece of cotton I helped him to fold in the morning of that day: the prisoner is employed in the glazing part of the business; and the coat I had put stuff on to take the powder off the neck and collar.</p>
               <p>- NORMANTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was fourteen years old last Thursday, I am Mr. Clarke's apprentice: the prisoner returned from dinner a little before two; he came back as from dinner, and told me he was going to Kensington, and asked me what No. he was to go to with the three blankets and rug I told him, No. 3 (they were brought from there); and that he was not to go before the foreman came in, because there were more things to go that way; he said he must go; I did not see him go, or take the rug, or see any coach; but I found he was gone.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been out with different parcels before in the morning; and I understood that when I returned, I was to go with this parcel; I then took these blankets all folded up, not knowing what they were; and drinking too much, and not knowing what I was doing, I called a coach, and told him, as far as I can recollect, to drive home to my master's house; instead of that, he drove me to Whitechapel, where I had never been before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

In consequence of advertisements from the publick-office, I had information of the greatest part of the plate, and those two spoons the day after I missed them; they were produced at Bow-street by a person of the name of Batt, servant to a pawnbroker; they were delivered to me afterwards by order of Sir Sampson: I can say these are two of my spoons, that were in the care of the prisoner; they are marked with my crest: the prisoner was not apprehended till within this three weeks; some time after, in October or November, I returned from the country; and then I summoned the different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had the prisoner lived with you? - Seven months: I trusted him rather more than I should have done, because he had married a servant of mine.</p>
               <p>Did you know that at that time his wife and him were in considerable distress? - I believe very far from it; if they had I should have been very ready to have relieved them; I have since he went away.</p>
               <p>- HUMPHRIES sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 28th of August last Mr. Wilkinson was going out of town; he desired me to look at the plate, by the inventory, to examine it with the prisoner, that it might be sent to the bankers; I went down into the kitchen, and told the prisoner, and asked him for the key of the plate chest; he said he was going out, but would return presently; before he returned I was obliged to go out; and when I returned he let me in, and begged I would step down to his pantry, for he wanted to speak to me; he said he was ruined, unless I could stand his friend; I told him any thing I could do, in my power, I would with pleasure; he hesitated telling me; and I asked him if his wife or child was ill, or was he arrested? he answered, no, it was worse than that: I then asked him if all the plate was right? he shook his head, and burst out a crying; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240019"/>asked him if he had pawned it? he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Before you asked him if he had pawned it, did you give him any expectations of favor? - No, Sir; and I asked him to what amount? he told me if he had his wages, and if I could lend him ten or twelve guineas more, he should be able to redeem it; or if he could go out for an hour or two, he believed he had a friend who would give him the money; I told him it was out of my power to lend him so much money, but if he would shew me the duplicates, to see what was missing, and give me the duplicates, and then go out and try to get the money; he said, he was afraid his master or mistress might want him; I told him I thought it a very serious matter, and he had better let me see what was missing, and leave the duplicates, and begged him to open the chest; he rather hesitated, and immediately Mr. Wilkinson came in; I told him I had not an opportunity to examine the plate, but that I had every reason to believe it was not all complete, and referred it to him. I went into the city about some business, and returned rather before six or after; when I returned the prisoner was gone; and his father-in-law came, as Mr. Wilkinson sent for him; then in his jacket pocket I found the key of the plate chest; I opened the chest before Mr. Wilkinson and his father-in-law; and there was nothing in it: I never saw the prisoner since, till now.</p>

W. I believe he had been with me from April to August. Two days after I took in those two spoons, a handbill came in; I read it over, and thought it was some of this plate: I shewed it first to Mr. Dixon, then to Mr. Brown: the two spoons I delivered up at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Clark. The bottle had had aqua fortis, and in the bason water, and if any metal is put into the aqua fortis, they then throw it into this water, and the strength of this aqua fortis makes this water all a pickle; I have tasted it, and this is so; by this sort of stuff being put into the aqua fortis, it draws the silver on the surface, and the strength of the aqua fortis turns them black, as some are here, then by being rubbed by sand and water, the black comes off and leaves the white.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Clark rubbed one, as a specimen, about a quarter of a minute.)</p>
               <p>Among the money produced, is there any fit for circulation? - Here are two half crowns which have been fit, but not being kept properly, are tarnished, but by rubbing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240024"/>them, they will be as good as ever in a moment; and I can venture to swear that they have been manufactured in the way I have said.</p>
               <p>Are they counterfeit coin? - Yes; they are counterfeit Mint money.</p>
               <p>Pray what effect hath this on the hands? - It turns them black, as mine are now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have told us, on other occasions, that cork hath been made use of in this business; there is no cork here? - There is not; it appears as if this money hath been in currency, and bought up by the Jews, and coloured afresh, in order to give it currency again; there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you of your knowledge in this business tell us the quantity of silver may be in that half crown? - According to assays made, a half crown hath about four-pence halfpenny-worth of silver in it, and a shilling two penny-worth.</p>

I am very sure to the chisel, because the handle was split by using it with the hammer; the hand-saw my father has had these thirty years; and the brad-all has got a particular ferrel on.</p>
               <p>Quanthrow. This chisel I have had ten or eleven years; and the other I changed the handle; I know the iron padlock by being rubbed over with mortar; and the nails are in a paper which hath a bit of pitch: I suspected the prisoner.</p>

               <p>As I was going my rounds at two o'clock, I found the prosecutor's door open, and went in with my lanthorn; I saw no one there; and seeing some tools lay on the bench, I thought if I left them behind, they would be lost before morning; I put them into my pocket, with intent to bring them to the buildings as soon as I got up; but at going off at six o'clock, I got rather too much liquor; and when this gentleman came, I did not know what I brought home; the gentleman himself knows, I was undrest when he knocked at the door.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There was one question asked you by the Court, to which you did not give an answer; it is a very important one; upon your oath did you not retire from the place where he was, on purpose that he might have an opportunity of taking something? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You said you went for the constable, Shallard; he is an officer, at Bow-street; where did you find him? - At the publick-house, opposite my brother's shop.</p>
               <p>Had not you appointed him to be there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So when this young man came in, and was looking at this shew-glass, it was before you invited him to look at the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240031"/>articles; you left him there on purpose that he might have an opportunity to steal something; and you went to fetch an officer on purpose that you might have an opportunity to take him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner: I was appointed to be there for the purpose, on suspicion that he was coming to rob the shop; I was in waiting just by: I searched him, and found a pair of gloves and a handkerchief, which I put on the table, and Ting shook one of the gloves, and out fell a bracelet; then he shook it again, and out fell another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Had you been consulted as to the manner in which this was to be done; have you explained to anybody what would make this a capital offence? - Oh, no, by no means.</p>

               <p>I am an officer. I was with Shallard at the publick-house, in waiting, about half an hour; then he sent for us, and we went into the back parlour; there was the prisoner and Mr. Lynam; and in his glove I shook out two bracelets, one in one finger, and the other in the other.</p>
               <p>(The bracelets deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Lynam. Do not you know that your brother appointed the prisoner to come that afternoon? - I sent to the constable about four o'clock: the prisoner came in about eight: the prisoner was there the day before; he said he should be there the night following: my brother did not send for him; he told my brother he should come the next afternoon.</p>
               <p>Your brother invited him to come? - No, I do not believe he did.</p>
               <p>What are these bracelets worth? - About twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>How much of that is for fashion and workmanship? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>They are very grim things; nobody would wear them now? - They are not very fashionable.</p>
               <p>What is the gold worth; is it worth five shillings? - No.</p>
               <p>They are out of fashion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What would they sell for? - I do not think they would fetch five shillings.</p>
               <p>If you was to buy them, you would buy them as old gold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have a great many respectable witnesses, but I think it better not to call them; I shall not expose the young man any more.</p>

               <p>Do you believe those to be your canary birds? - I do.</p>
               <p>Now what are these cages? - One is a wainscot, the other is a mahogany, or rattan; both wooden.</p>
               <p>Did not you give him these cages to carry? - Yes, I did with the rest of the goods.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to me with a pair of birds, in a cage, and asked me seven shillings and sixpence for them; I told him I would give you six shillings, at a word; they are here; I would not pay him till I knew who he was; and he said if I would go over with him to a publick-house, he would shew me another cage, and a pair of birds, and so I gave him twelve shillings for the two cages, and two pair of birds; I am sure to the prisoner and that they are the same I bought of him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. This was on the 17th of this month? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was dark? - Yes; and a great number of people in the shop; I had two pieces of the same linen, and both marked alike.</p>
               <p>You would not be able to swear to this piece only? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>You pursued him into Brownlow-street? - I did, and took him; and left the linen, which was picked up by some person, and brought to my shop; but I do not know by whom.</p>
               <p>That person is not here? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. This happened to be about six, or a quarter after six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This piece of linen you say was of a whitish colour, and taken from the outside of the door, close to the threshold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Candles were lighted in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When at the justice's you saw the prisoner: did you know him? - Yes; but I am very sorry to say one of Mr. Thwaites's men pointed him out to me; but I know he was the man.</p>

               <p>I am a single woman. I live at No. 24, Chesterfield-street. I was going to carry a shirt home to Swallow-street, and a linen handkerchief.

               <p>I am a patrol at Houndsditch. On the 4th of this month, at about a quarter before nine, I stopped the two prisoners at the bar, in Five Bell court; I found on them a bag, Bennison had it; he was carrying it across his shoulder; I brought him down to the corner of the court, and asked him what he had got there? he said, shirts. I asked him where he brought them from, or where he got them? He said, from his mother. I made him open the bag, and found he had two shirts and two shifts wet, and I have kept them to this day.</p>
               <p>(The shirts and shifts produced.)</p>
               <p>With regard to Bell, were they together? - He went up to a house in Five Bell-court, and knocked at a door, and Bennison was behind him; this is a house that receives stolen goods; I went and seized them both together, and brought them both to the bottom of the court.</p>

               <p>I am in partnership with my father, in the coal trade. On the 13th of this month I had to deliver a barge with coals, at <placeName id="t17900224-38-crimeloc222">Puddle-dock</placeName>

               <p>- SMITH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to these gentlemen. Being ordered by my master to attend at Puddle-dock, as we had been robbed the preceding evening, I attended, and saw the prisoner at the bar, and another person, who made his escape, at work in the craft; I heard a noise of coals rattling as though it was into a sack; I then came to the top of the dock, and told the witness Mawn, that there was no time to be lost, as I was afraid they would get away; I accordingly got into the barge, along-side that in which the coals were in, and followed another one, who made his escape, at that time in the craft where the coals where; I followed the prisoner, and knocked the person who made his escape down; the prisoner then knocked me down; the witness Mawn then came up, as soon as they saw him they let me go, and threw me over the barge's stretch-piece, into the barges room, where was some loom; I then laid hold of the prisoner at the bar, and delivered him to the witness, Mawn, and told him to take care of him while I looked after the other one; he then got away from me, and jumped over-board, as the other had done before, and I jumped after him; he then ran about thirty yards, and I after him; Mr. Raban's watchman fired a blunderbuss; he said, do not come near me if you do I will murder you: he would not be taken; he would kill or be killed first; and after that we secured him; I saw the prisoner filling the bag himself; I could discover him more plainly, because he had a white jacket on; I immediately found the bag, with some coals in it; the bag was not one of our's; I never lost sight of him all the time, except about a minute, while he turned the corner, besides he was perfectly known to me before.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman. I heard Mr. Eddington's servant say he was going to look after some coals; I followed him; and when we came to the top of the dock, Smith told me there was no time to be lost, as they were at work, and that he would immediately go into the barge; when he got into the barge I saw a scuffle, and heard him call for help, as he was knocked down; I immediately went to him; and saw one make his escape, and the prisoner and Smith rolling together, and he delivered the prisoner to me; and said, I will look for the other; and the prisoner got from me, by giving my thumb a screw, and jumped into the mud, Smith jumped in after him; and he was taken immediately.</p>

               <p>Did he not observe you this time? - He might; he told me he was going to take it home; I asked him to let it go, and he would not; he would insist on taking it away home: I called the watch for some time, and none came; the watch at last came from the end of Monmouth-street; I gave charge of the prisoner, and they took him to the watch-house; he had then the sheep in his hand: I never saw the man before as I know of: it was a ewe sheep; the value of it is seven or eight and thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Had he parted with the sheep when the watchman came? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he go quietly with him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I live at Paddington. On Thursday, the 18th of February, I was in my master's business; and see this man about three o'clock, about Mr. Far's house; the prisoner was on the outside of the garden, near the fence; I saw him walking backwards and forwards some time; I saw him pull down a board to make a hole in the fence; he ran in, and I saw him draw something from the inside of the garden, and he stuck it under his arm, and ran out, and ran across the fields; he was too far ahead to catch him, so I went to meet him, which I did at Tyburn-turnpike; he saw me, and ran across the road, over Hyde-park wall, and made the best of his way for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240048"/>Park-gate; and I, going down Park-lane, met him at the gates; I laid hold of him, and asked him, what he had got there? he said, nothing; I said to him, what is that you pulled out of that garden? he pulled it out, and says, here is what I got; it was a cotton gown; he said, he took it out of the garden: I took him to my master's counting-house; where I took it of him, and him to the watch-house; the gown has been in my possession ever since. He told me that day he came out of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>(The gown produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was this man in your service then? - Yes; I said to him, how came you to have these duplicates of silver spoons in your possession? he cried, and downed on his knees, and said it was mine.</p>

               <p>Court. I am very sorry, gentlemen, I cannot concur in your recommendation. First, he is a servant: a servant is bound to protect our property, and not pilfer it; and we are always strict with servants: but besides that, there is a second indictment against him; though that evidence was not proper to be given in this case: under these circumstances, therefore, I dare to say you do not wish to press that recommendation any farther.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter. On Friday morning I went to work, as usual, and heard a person walk in the cellar; I steps to meet my master, and told him there was somebody in the cellar; and I heard the water flush in it: my master bid me go in; I went in; and the man was creeping through the joists of the cellar; I stopped while he got up on his feet, and then I collared him; a constable was had; and he was taken to justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>Was the cellar dry when you left it at night? - The leaden pipe lay upon the floor, along the wall, where he stood upon the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240056"/>joists over the cellar; that had been broke</p>
               <p>Did it appear to be newly broke off? - Newly broke off, sixteen feet: the long pipe was never found.</p>
               <p>Did you find any leaden pipe about the cellar loose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that any part of what was broke off? - No: none of that was in the cellar; this lead, produced, was found in the house, on the floor of the cellar; these were broke off the back of the house, and it corresponded; I compared it; the prisoner was just under it: I can swear to this one piece, for I made a trough to fit it, the day before.</p>

               <p>Was he near the lead or not? - When I came in with the candle I did not see him nigh, because he was under, in the cellar, and the lead was above.</p>
               <p>You went in with these two men at night; where was he? - Coming out of the cellar: I found the lead just laying by the place where he broke in at; the boards were nailed down at night and broke open in the morning; I saw it nailed myself.</p>

Denton says, I cannot; he holds me; with that, the man got up, and broke my hold from Denton's coat, and tore the coat down the middle of the back: after that, they sawed something across my belly two or three times: I had nothing but only my shirt on, and I cried out murder, for I expected every minute they would cut my belly open.</p>
               <p>Was it the other prisoner who tore the coat from you? - I believe it was not: another person then opened the door: when the door was open, the man set off, and Denton next, and me after Denton; and the other person ran after me, and struck me several times with a stick; Denton turned out of Long-lane, into a turning that leads into Cloth-fair, and ran down Back-alley; I ran after, crying out murder! stop thief! Mr. Campton's men heard it, and stopt him; with that, I said, for God's sake do not let that man go, for I would not lose him for twenty pounds; I never lost sight of him till he was taken: I cannot swear to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you always say the same of the other prisoner? - I never positively swore to him.</p>

I knew both their voices very well; he said, in the cellar; that passed on, and I could hear the blowing of the fire; some time after, I heard her say to her son, Ben, go get the pig ready, the water is hot; my husband at this time was in bed; on this, I went and waked him; I went to Justice Smith's office, and asked advice there directly; Justice Smith said he could not grant a search warrant, but he would grant a warrant for

I told him, as it was but half past eleven o'clock, I would give him leave to go home for an hour, and he should save his day's work; I gave him leave to go; and it is customary to rub every man down that goes out; I felt something in his pocket, and asked him what it was; he said, only some broken china; I brought him into the counting-house, and desired him to let me see what broken china he had in his pocket; and here is what he turned out himself.</p>
               <p>Were they broken in the way he described, or were they all sound? - All sound.</p>
               <p>Did you ever examine whether any were missing of that kind, and are you sure they belong to the East India Company? - Miss we cannot; but so far I am certain, that he was employed on the business where these goods were put, that day; I only know for this reason, that they are the Company's goods, we have a muster box for each ship; and the ships goods are opened and examined by the muster box; this man was on the goods that belong to this ship, in the warehouse which these goods came in, and it is impossible we can tell what is missed, till the ships goods are examined altogether; these goods were gone to be sorted, and he was one of the parties employed in sorting the china, according to the different patterns; and these we were in a hurry to get forward for the sales; and these, which he had in his pocket, were unwashed, consequently could never have been sold, as they were as they came out of the chest.</p>

He made me no reply, but said, what do you want, let go; I had not observed any other persons than these two; I then observed Levi coming out of the window; as soon as he was out, he said, in Hebrew, hush, let me go, we are Jews, you know me; I said, I did not care, and went, in order to get to the gate; Simmons pushed me backwards, against the wall, where the gates were fixed to; I am sure it was Simmons; by the force of Simmons's push I received a blow on the back part of my head; I then called out murder, several times, on that

Levi then turned back, and squared up to me, and said, what do you want? by that time my master had opened the door, and come out to my assistance, with the poker in his hand; my master said, Micke, what is the matter; I went into the house, and shut the gate; and I went into the parlour, in order to shut up the shutters, and my foot kicked against one of the chandeliers; they had been left, when I went out, on the back part of the mantle-piece; and I found them on my return close to the window, where Simmons was standing.</p>
               <p>Are you certain as to all the prisoners? - I knew them all before; I have known two of them this nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Prisoners Counsel. Is this a private house, or a shop? - A private house in Mansell-street, Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>This street is a very public one? - Not very public.</p>
               <p>At what time was it this happened? - About a quarter after five; about dusk.</p>
               <p>You say on your first coming, and seeing a man come out of your master's inclosure, you was very much alarmed? - I should not have been much alarmed, if I had not known him; I was so alarmed, I was not myself till I went to bed; I trembled for most of the whole night.</p>
               <p>Then from that time, till you went to bed, you trembled for most of the whole night? - I trembled for about half an hour.</p>
               <p>How am I to understand you; first you trembled till you went to bed, and then that you trembled for about half an hour; what effect had it on you? - It was a fright, and a shock.</p>
               <p>Was it so considerable as to hurt you very much; did you find it had a very considerable effect on you? - Yes; any body might be alarmed at seeing a thief come out.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was you very much alarmed? - I said, I was frightened but not very much.</p>
               <p>You have said you felt the effect of the fright, for half an hour? - When I found I had lost nothing, I was more easy.</p>
               <p>Till that time then you was frightened? - I was frightened, but not very much frightened; I was then a little more easy than at first.</p>
               <p>And yet you continued in a state of alarm, for half an hour; what kind of a night was this; was the moon arose? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Then not the lighter for that? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did this continue before these persons made their escape? - From the first beginning, it might be about three minutes.</p>
               <p>You tell us when you laid hold of the man, you suppose to be Simmons, you said, you villain, what do you want here; you did not say, why Simmons, I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240067"/>you; you never called him by his name? - No.</p>
               <p>But yet in the struggle, your head was against the wall, and in your struggle your fright did not at all lessen? - I cannot say any thing, either one way or another, to that; I do not know it increased.</p>
               <p>At first when you came up there was but one? - I shut him out.</p>
               <p>Yet your fright did not increase, when there were three? - No, I do not know it did.</p>
               <p>I think you said, that Marks came back, and on your crying out, he came and asked you, if you wanted help? - Marks did not lock it after him.</p>
               <p>When did you attend at Bow-street? - On Monday night.</p>
               <p>When did this happen? - On Saturday.</p>
               <p>And at Bow-street you found that all the three persons had come voluntarily to the office, knowing themselves to be innocent? - On Monday morning my master and I went to give information.</p>
               <p>Did not you then hear, that these three men had been at the office, hearing their names had been called in question, and they came to answer to it? - Yes; Mr. Townsend told me so.</p>
               <p>How long before had you been in the parlour? - I had just shut up the shutters of the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Counsel for Levi. Mr. Levi, do you know a brother of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never seen either the prisoner or his brother, at Clapton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body, since the apprehension of Levi, that you thought the prisoner Levi was innocent, and you was mistaken in him? - No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Did not you acknowledge this, that at the time some prisoner, of the name of Marks, entered, it put you into such confusion, that you did not know the man of the name of Levi? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. GOLDSMID sworn.</p>
               <p>How long has this last witness lived with you? - About a year, or a year and two months.</p>
               <p>What is his character? - I should not have taken him for a servant, if I had not heard a very honest character of him, and I hope I shall find it so. (The chandeliers produced and deposed to.) I sent my servant on the 24th of January, on a message, to Prescot-street, which joins very near Mansell-street; he was not out about five or ten minutes; on his return I heard a great noise; there is a small yard between my gate, and the iron rails: I heard a cry of murder! I concluded something was wrong, and went out with a poker; my door stuck fast, and as it was wet weather I thought somebody held it to prevent me from coming out into the yard; afterwards my servant rung the bell; I came to the door again, and said, Micke, what has happened; says he, I will go and see what is lost; I went to the left hand parlour, and he had shut up one shutter, and carelessly left the other open: I found one of these chandeliers near the window, and the other not far from it, on the floor: the following day I went to give information to Sir

               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was on a Sunday: and your brother came home and sent for some mutton to make some broth; I suppose your people always serve on a Sunday? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then there was nothing remarkable on that Sunday? - Only that I remember it was the day before he was charged with this affair.</p>
               <p>And so he came there the day before, and you had mutton broth for dinner; I suppose you had a few turneps with your mutton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nobody present but you and your mother, and your brother,

               <p>How do you know the time you staid there? - My wife was at her mother's, and I was to go for her at seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went down to Mr. Bullens; I gave him an order for the goods; I asked him to give me change for a ten pound bank note and five shillings, which was all the money I had about me: well, says he, I am not afraid to trust you, you will pay me when you come to town again.</p>
               <p>Court. I am to understand you, that Mr. Bullen agreed to trust you? - He did, he met me, and called me a thief, and took me to Clerkenwell, there I bailed it; some time after, I met him again, and he collared me again, and said I was a thief, and I begged he would not expose me, but I would go where he pleased, and desired we might go to a publick house, there we drank together.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I had a load on my back; and there I would have taken him then, but there was no persons in the tap room, and I could get no assistance, so let him go: the first time I saw him, he was taken and committed to Clerkenwell in February 1787, and he bailed it, and flew from his bail; he was indicted in February 1787, but the prisoner was not in custody, and the Christian name was spelt wrong; he was taken first at the Queen's-head, in Tower-street, then I could not take him: I met him last Monday in Crooked-lane, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor told me, if I could give him seven pounds, and a bond of indemnification, that he should not be hurt, he would not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that true.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said to the poor woman, with a child in her arms, that I should be glad to do any thing that the law would permit me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Matthews. Was you in Newgate to see the prisoner? - I was, I went to see if he was the person I saw at Dark-house-lane, who ordered the goods, but had no conversation with the prisoner, about this business. I, in reality, went to see a debtor, an acquaintance; but I did drink with the prisoner, merely to see if he was the person that ordered the goods of Mr. Bullen.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses, madam? - No, Gentlemen, I have not a friend alive now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, as this poor woman has no Counsel; will you permit me, as Amicus Curiae, to ask Owen a question or two.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Owen. You have heard the story this woman has told, about the disturbances that was on board the ship in which she sailed? - I, with Townshend, was sent down to Exeter, to prosecute a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240073"/>great many, who took the captain at Torbay; they took the ship away from the ship's company; she was afterwards retaken again, by one of his Majesty's sloops of war, and proceeded on her voyage; this woman was delivered on board the same ship; a great many of these men were convicted, and afterwards pardoned, on condition of being transported again.</p>
               <p>Did not it appear, on that occasion, that the captain had, in defiance of his orders, intended to carry these persons to some illegal destination, to the Bay of Honduras? - As I understood, that occasioned the rising of the transports.</p>
               <p>I believe you know, as matter of fact, that none of those persons were executed at Exeter? - None of them.</p>
               <p>The story she has told, you believe to be true? - I believe it was true.</p>
               <p>So that she never was carried to the object of her destination? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit to your Lordship, on Aikles's case; he was tried for the same charge, and the only excuse he could offer, was this, that he was at large; that he was afflicted with a sore leg; miserably poor; without friends; without the means of procuring any assistance; and that really, involuntarily he was in this kingdom.</p>
               <p>Court. The only question that can possibly exist with the Jury, is, whether or no, this woman is the woman that was tried and convicted, and that was in this kingdom without lawful cause?</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we think she was not at large without lawful cause.</p>

I told them I had none; immediately one of the men told me it should be worse for me; and gave me a blow: these are two of the men that were there: in my endeavours to get away, as the blow knocked me down, this Jones jumped upon my stomach, to keep me down; after that, he told me if I cried out, it should be worse for me; after a bit, they abated from me, and let me get up; I got up, and they let me walk on; and Wix crossed the way after me, and says, d - n your eyes, hand over that clout: I told them I had never a one; he directly wrenched off the silk handkerchief from my neck by force; I had two on, a white one and a silk one; and then he struck me over the loins with a stick; I immediately collared him, and called out; and the watchman,

            , came up.</p>
               <p>Was that all you lost? - Yes; I lost nothing but my handkerchief, a guinea and a half, two shillings and six-pence, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you taken observation enough of these men, so as to be positive to them? - Yes; they had followed me so much, that I could not help taking observation of them.</p>
               <p>Where was it you was knocked down? - Just off the bridge, on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Where did the watchman take any one into his custody? - Close by the obelisk in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>So you went the whole length of Chatham-place, and of Bridge-street, before you made the watchman take him into custody; and you and Wix were in custody together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You charged him with the robbery, and he charged you with assaulting him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jones was not in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240075"/>watch-house that night? - No, he was not; he came the next day.</p>
               <p>What coloured jackets had the people on on the bridge? - The same colour they have on now.</p>
               <p>What coloured jackets had they on? - I cannot go to be put on my oath about that.</p>
               <p>Have you never been at such places as this before? - I never was in such an open place as this before; I can safely swear that positively; I never prosecuted any body before, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sneezby, I know more of your history, than you are aware of; how long is it since you was at Union-hall? - Indeed I can hardly recollect.</p>
               <p>About how long? - I cannot really recollect it.</p>
               <p>Try to recollect how long ago it was, you was at Union-hall? - I cannot tell if you keep me here all night.</p>
               <p>I will not keep you there all night: but if you will not answer my question, you shall spend the night in Newgate? - Would you make me answer to that I cannot?</p>
               <p>Is it twenty years ago? - No, it cannot be so long as that.</p>
               <p>Is it five years ago? - No, it is not so long as that.</p>
               <p>Is it two years? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Is it a year? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Is it six months; I do not ask you because I do not know; but I want to see a little of your manner; do not hurry yourself; take your time; we have nothing else to do? - I believe it is three months ago.</p>
               <p>I wonder you could not have told me sooner. What was you there about? - It was for no harm.</p>
               <p>Well then, as it was for no harm, let us know for what good it was, that you went to Union-hall; do not hurry yourself? - I do not come about that.</p>
               <p>I know you did not, but I did; now I ask you again, what did you go to Union-hall about? O Lord! O Lord! we shall be here till to morrow morning, if we go on at this rate! - Why now I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you think I am such a fool as to be satisfied with such an answer as that; or those twelve jurymen, such rogues, as to suppose you was there at Union-hall about three months ago, and you cannot recollect what for? - Sir, I can tell you what I went there for; there was a neighbour of ours had a few words, and I went in her behalf; but I never prosecuted any one before.</p>
               <p>Was no one ever transported on your account? - No, never.</p>
               <p>At first, when the people came up to you, they took you for a woman of the town? - I suppose they did take me for such, by their pulling me about as such; but I told them they were mistaken in the person.</p>
               <p>So these people treated you as if you was not the virtuous creature you are, but as a woman of the town? - They treated me as such.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it put his hand into your pocket, when you lost your nutmeg grater? - I did not say I had.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that in the scuffle and confusion, about their pulling your handkerchief, the money rolled out of your pocket? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>You never did say, in the hustling, you lost out of your pocket one guinea and a half, and two shillings and six-pence: did you lose a nutmeg grater? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How came you then to say, that when you was asked about your handkerchief and your money, you never mentioned the nutmeg grater; how happened that? - Upon my word I cannot tell; I know I lost it, for the guinea and a half were in it.</p>
               <p>You live now at Battle-bridge; how long have you lived there? - A fortnight.</p>
               <p>What part of the world did you live in before? - At Lambeth, in Princess-street.</p>
               <p>How long did you live there? - About thirteen months; and I left it because my husband's business lays at Lambeth; I left it with a very good character.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you was not driven out of the neighbourhood? - No one could drive me out there, because it is my own parish.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240076"/>watch-house, charging any body else with the robbery? - When I was in the watch-house; why they kept me there as well as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not his charge of you, for assaulting him in the street? - I do not know he made any such charge.</p>
               <p>How many other persons did you charge in the watch-house? - There was a man came in accidentally, and they asked me if he was one? I said he might be one for what I knew.</p>
               <p>From whence had you come? - From the Spread-eagle at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Was you in that house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>You was not alone, nor with your husband? - I was with myself.</p>
               <p>Who is the landlord; is it Monro? - No, Cushion.</p>
               <p>You was then by yourself; that you swear? - No; I could not be by myself, because there was people in the house.</p>
               <p>Then there was no other person in company with you? - There was only the watchman as I asked to drink.</p>
               <p>What was this watchman's name? - Monro.</p>
               <p>Did not the man treat you with a glass of gin in Cushion's house? - I would not wish to go to swear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did any body treat you with a glass of gin in Cushion's house, yes or no? - No, Sir, they did not.</p>
               <p>Nor with any other liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any liquor with any body there? - Yes, along with Mr. Monro.</p>
               <p>With no one else? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was you in his company? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you in Cushion's house more than once that evening? - No, I was not; I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go out with the man who had been drinking with you, and come back again, desiring Cushion to take that man into custody for ill-treating you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You never came to the door to do that? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober? - I cannot say but I was.</p>


               <p>Had you had drink? - Yes, I had drink, but not so much as to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Where else did you call in to drink whilst you was out? - I drank no where but there, and at the Cross Keys at Lambeth, with a neighbour.</p>
               <p>How long might you stop there? - I might stop about three quarters of an hour there; I was along with one Mr. Martin; we had a quartern of brandy.</p>
               <p>Then you went to the Spread-eagle, and there had a glass or two of gin? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>After you had parted with Monro, who walked with you to the bridge? - No one.</p>
               <p>Where had you parted with your husband? - At Battle-bridge; we were to meet at Lambeth, but we missed each other.</p>
               <p>Battle-bridge is at least from Lambeth, six miles? - Yes, it may; I and my husband was at Battle-bridge at six: a young woman bore me company all the way; her name is Sarah; she lived at the Bell, at Battle-bridge, as a servant.</p>
               <p>Where did you lose her? - I left her at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Did you see your husband at all that night at Lambeth? - No, I did not; I did not go to the Three Compasses, where he was, he was to meet me at his mother's, close by Lambeth Church.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his mother, before you went to the Spread-eagle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you set out then from your husband's mother's? - It was very near eleven.</p>
               <p>Then you went from Lambeth Church to the obelisk in Fleet-street, in half an hour? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You was at his mother's at eleven; after that, you took your drop of drink at the bar of the Spread-eagle, with Monro, and staid a little while with him? - I did not stay any great while.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you stay and sit a considerable time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was quite sober the whole time? - Yes, quite sober.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses that have searched the register at Whitechapel Church: do you mean to swear that you was married at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240077"/>that church? - Yes, I can safely take an oath.</p>
               <p>At what time? - I was married at the time that the riot was; when the great buildings were destroyed; that I do swear positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it you was to meet your husband? - At the sign of the Three Compasses; he went to his club, and I was to meet him at his mother's house, close by Lambeth Church.</p>
               <p>Did you go to his mother? - Yes, and he was not there.</p>
               <p>Then not finding him at his mother's, what brought you to Black friars-bridge? - Why, Sir, it is the nearest way.</p>
               <p>You knew your husband was at the club; how came you to go home without him? - I heard the club was done, and so told his mother I should not wait any longer for him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where was you coming from? - From Sun-tavern-fields.</p>
               <p>Then when you came to the obelisk, you saw that for the first time, which attracted your notice; you know nothing before? - No, nothing before that.</p>
               <p>Then as far as you know, the woman and these men had met before then? - Yes, as far as I know, they might.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the watch-house with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she sober? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>What did you see she had lost? - Her silk handkerchief was gone, and her white handkerchief pulled much about.</p>
               <p>It is a very populous place this? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>It is just where those people meet who are coming from the other end of the town, all the houses of diversion being just then concluded; where those are passing from St. Paul's Church-yard, who live that way, as well as those coming from Black-friars-road, and are going there-to? - There was hardly any one passing by at this time.</p>
               <p>When you came to the watch-house, I believe Wix charged the woman with assaulting him? - No, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>How many people did she accuse in watch-house, with having used her ill? - I did not hear her accuse any but Wix.</p>
               <p>You did not know her before? - I never saw her to my knowledge before.</p>

               <p>I was a watchman on this night: as I was calling half past eleven, I heard a woman crying out at the bottom of the Fleet-market; and I found this woman had hold of one of the prisoners at the bar, Wix; and in taking the charge of him, he dropped a stick out of his hand: I took him to the watch-house, and delivered the charge to the watch-house-keeper; I found her with her handkerchief half hung behind, and half before; and she said she lost another outside one: I saw the other prisoner Jones go out of the crowd, and go off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember a man of the name of Hitchell coming up? - Yes, I do know something of the matter: some one asked if this Hitchell was one? she said she believed he was.</p>
               <p>Whether at that time, if Mr. Shepherd had not vouched for the knowledge of this Hitchell, he would not have been taken into charge? - I believe he might.</p>
               <p>How many others did she charge besides? - I cannot tell; because as soon as the charge was entered in the book, I went off to my duty.</p>
               <p>At that time of night, there is a great concourse of people just at that place? - Yes; it is very populous; it is busy enough all hours of the night.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the woman say at any time, that she believed she was mistaken, and she would call back the charge? - I cannot positively say; I was not long there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was constable of the night, and was present when the woman gave charge of Wix; she said she had been very badly used by four men, one of which was the prisoner Wix; I asked her how? she told me she had been attacked by four men, and robbed of a guinea, half a guinea, two shillings and sixpence, and a nutmeg grater, a silk handkerchief, a shawl, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Do you state this as a perfect recollection of what the charge was? - I do, I have the minute here. (Read.)</p>
               <p>During that charge, did she ever say, that Wix was not the man? - She giving the charge so very strong, I sent Wix to the Counter; when he was gone, she began to equivocate; on which account, I detained her in the watch-house till the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you mean by her equivocating very much, do you mean she did not stand to the charge so strongly; did she not after Wix went to the Counter, say, she did not know that Wix was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240079"/>man? - She seemed rather to draw back from what she had said before.</p>
               <p>Did she not charge Hitchell as one of the persons who robbed her? - She did, but she gave it up.</p>
               <p>Then her charge to Hitchel, was as strong as to Wix? - I believe it might, but I set him at liberty; because she said, on Mr. Shepherd's knowing him; then I suppose I was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Mrs. Sneezby was dedetained to prosecute this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any charge against her? - No, none.</p>
               <p>In what state did Mrs. Sneezby appear to be, sober or not? - Sober, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>- MONRO sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Mrs. Sneezby from a girl; I saw her come into the Spread Eagle, with a man, the night of this disaster; I was in the house; the man says, you will pay for the glass of gin.</p>
               <p>The man, I am afraid, was not her husband? - He was a carpenter; after they drank, out they went directly together, and had not been out long before she came and knocked at Cushion's door, and Cushion opened it; come here, says she, along with me; go home, says he, you saucy slut, and get yourself sober.</p>
               <p>Was she drunk? - Very much in liquor, and he shut the door against her, I said to the man, get you along about your business; she got up to Mr. Jackson's corner, and I spoke to her; Sal, says I, pin your shawl, or else you will lose it; and told her to go along home; she was very drunk; her bonnet was off, by her tumbling about, and her cap came off.</p>

               <p>I live in Cow-heel Alley; as I was coming down Holborn, on Thursday, the 4th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, a handkerchief was dropped, and I stooped, and another gentleman, not in my company, picked it up, and the gentleman that picked it up, said that if there was any thing worth in it, I should have half; and he asked me if I would walk a little way further with him, which I did, and went with him into Turnstile; where he opened the handkerchief, and there was a purse in it, and in the purse a few halfpence, and he pulled the halfpence out, and put them in his pocket; there was a handkerchief pin in the purse, and stuck in a bit of paper, and some writing on it; and the prisoner was coming by; and this other gentleman asked him to read the few lines, and he read them; with that he said he would see me righted; that I should have half; he read where it was bought, and how much it cost; the prisoner said it cost twelve guineas; and the other gentleman said, he had an acquaintance, whom he should like to make it a present to, and he would give me the half in money; but not having so much about him, he would go to an acquaintance and borrow it; and the prisoner asked me, if he should lend me a guinea, if I would leave my cloak; I said, if I should leave my cloak, I should never see it more; then he took it from my shoulders immediately, on my giving him that answer, and gave it to the other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How? - I took hold of it, and he pulled it from me.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you made as much resistance as you could? - Yes, he then took hold of my arm, and led me against the rails in Lincoln's-inn fields, and asked me, what money I had in my pocket? I told him one shilling and three half-pence; he said, then give me the shilling; with that I gave him the shilling; he asked me if I had a pocket handkerchief? I had not, I told him; then says he, never mind it, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>You told him, you had a shilling in your pocket, who pulled it out? - I pulled it out.</p>
               <p>In what manner had he hold of your arm? - He took hold of my arm, and drove me off the curb stones, to the rails; I hallooed once or twice, and I thought it was no use going after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240084"/>How come you to give him the shilling? - Because he frightened me, when he took hold of my arm, and dragged me against the rails; I went as far as Moor-street back again.</p>
               <p>At the time he did this, was the other man present? - At the time he took the cloak he was, but not when he took the shilling; I went back again into Moor-street, Seven Dials, and I told my master and mistress that I had got a place, and went back again concerning my character; I am a <rs id="t17900224-83-viclabel458" type="occupation">servant of all work</rs>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You was not frightened before he laid hold of your hand? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might you have parted with your cloak then? - Five minutes.</p>


               <p>The prisoner offered you a guinea to pay for the pin? - Yes, he did, but I never see him pay it.</p>
               <p>And you was to deposit your cloak; the cloak was taken off without your being frightened at all? - Yes, I was not frightened then.</p>
               <p>On that you went away, in order to get some money from your friends, and you went to Moor street, at what distance is that from the place where the cloak was taken? - A good bit; I was gone about an hour.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the place where you had left him? - Twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you not leave your cloak with the man; to wait till you returned to reimburse the money, and take the pin? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not this man committed first for obtaining this money under false pretences? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now I happen to have both his commitments here; on the 4th you had not Mr. Treadway examined as a witness, and on the 6th both Treadway and Scandling were examined? - Who is Mr. Treadway?</p>
               <p>A thief-taker, attending the office; you know they were not examined on the 4th, so on the 4th, the man was charged and committed for a fraud; on the 6th, when you had the assistance of Treadway and Scandling, you had him committed for a highway robbery: now, did not Treadway desire you to make that charge? - No.</p>
               <p>Who did? - No one, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard if this man was convicted, there is a reward of forty pounds? - No, I have never thought of it.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard it? - I have never heard it.</p>
               <p>How often have you attended with Mr. Treadway at the Justice's? - The first night was Saturday, once before the Grand Jury, and three days here.</p>
               <p>And you mean to swear now positively, that you never heard till this moment, that there was a reward? - Sir, I have heard the people talk of it.</p>
               <p>When did you hear of it? - Long enough ago.</p>
               <p>Who might you hear talk of it? - I have heard people talk or it, when I have been out of doors.</p>
               <p>Where? - If I have been any where and there has been any body that has been cast.</p>
               <p>How dare you to tell me not five minutes ago, and your answer was taken down in short-hand, that you, who knew it long ago as the town talk, as a common thing, that you never heard of such a thing, that you never thought of it, and did not know that there was any such thing existing? - I did not think any thing of the reward.</p>
               <p>So this man comes in just as you were dividing what did not belong to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought no harm in that? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole, of the parish of Giles's in the Fields; on the 4th of this month, coming up out of Newtoner's street, into Holborn: I head a voice calling out murder! stop thief! I saw this girl have hold of the prisoner by his coat; I laid hold of the prisoner; the girl said, she was stripped of her cloak; my friend, says I, to the prisoner, come along with me before a Justice; he said take me out, do not let me be ill used; accordingly I took him out from the throng of people, and took him into the Justice's; I was there the first time, at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>What did the woman charge him with, before Mr. Walker, the first time? - For stripping her of her cloak, and one shilling in money; that was the charge I heard at the Justices; I saw nothing of the fact committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she explain at all how that stripping was? - Yes; but I cannot say in what manner.</p>
               <p>It is impossible that the magistrate should not have enquired further about it? - He did; but there was such a throng, I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Did you take him to the prison? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Treadway there the first time he was committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was so good to assist you with his advice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave instructions at the office for the indictment? - I will not swear whether he did or not, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I will make you say; did you attend with Treadway and this woman at Clerkenwell-green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who with? - Treadway.</p>
               <p>Who else? - Why he got the bill of indictment out.</p>
               <p>Now before he got it out, he gave instructions? - He went in; I heard that the girl should be satisfied; there was no money mentioned; but that she was to have her cloak, and be paid for her time, and then she would be satisfied.</p>

               <p>What was the charge? - The charge was for taking a cloak, and giving a guinea, I think, in the lieu of it; then on the second hearing, a letter came from Mr. Justice Triquet, to be kept till the next day; the girl first said, she had been robbed of a cloak, by the prisoner: I went to him, and said, have you got the cloak? She said, yes, but if you will pay me for my time, and the cloak it shall go; and if not, it shall be a street robbery; oh! says I, if that is the case, I will keep the cloak.</p>

            ; why I did not call on her? and my answer was, that I visited her sister: the play was near over: I was stopped by the crowd near the middle of the lobby: a gentleman, Mr. Williams, who is not here, stood on my right hand; and fronting me, close against me was the prisoner; I felt a pressure on my thigh; soon after that, I drew back, and found my breeches pocket unbuttoned, which I had buttoned just before: I immediately seized hold of the prisoner, and said, you have taken my purse? the prisoner said, who, I? I insisted it was him; upon which, the prisoner said he had not: about that time, I heard a purse drop on the ground; I stooped down and picked it up, and seized the prisoner; the prisoner avowed his innocence; I again seized the prisoner as the person who had taken my purse; he continued to assert his innocence;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240086"/>but as I was convinced he was the person that had taken it, I called for a constable, and gave him in charge: there were three ten pound notes, and three guineas in the purse: I have the purse here; I am sure it is mine: upon his calling to a woman,

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it for granted, there were a great many ladies of the same sort, in the lobby at that time? - There was: the prisoner was close up to me: the lady was standing near me.</p>
               <p>And I think you described before the magistrate, a sort of a tremulous motion that you felt on your thigh? - I did.</p>
               <p>Nothing of your's was found on the prisoner? - Nothing but his own property: I took Mrs. Green to Sir Samson's, at the prisoner's request.</p>
               <p>Upon the first representation of your story, if I understand you right, you went without Mrs. Green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon that, the prisoner alledged that at the time he was charged, he asserted his innocence; and applied to a lady (that was Mrs. Green) by saying, Madam, did you see me? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Then Sir Sampson thought it necessary Mrs. Green should be sent for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the production of this witness, who was out of town, and who has occasioned the prisoner to lay in gaol since last sessions, was occasioned by the prisoner himself? - Yes, it was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the lobby of Covent-garden Play-house, speaking to Mr. Beby; and I saw the prisoner put his hand in Mr. Beby's pocket, and take out his purse; I do not recollect the colour of his purse; I cannot positively tell; he let the purse fall instantly.</p>
               <p>Was his eye upon you at that time? - I do not know; I was too confused.</p>
               <p>Was you near the prosecutor at that time? - He was standing almost on one side of me; and that man came from one side to the other, and came between us both: I did not observe any friend with Mr. Beby.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you acquainted with Mr. Beby before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you make any out-cry about this? - I just nudged his shoulder.</p>
               <p>That would not have conveyed any important information? - I thought it would.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the same box with him? - I had been in different boxes, just as I pleased.</p>
               <p>We had not the pleasure of seeing you last sessions? - No, Sir, I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Was not you bound over to attend? - I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Did not you enter into a recognizance to attend? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Shall I take the liberty to ask where you was? - I was at Bath.</p>
               <p>It was suggested that the prisoner had procured you to abscond: had he so procured you? - No, upon my honour, not at all.</p>
               <p>Then your absence was merely matter of accident, and not design? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner asking you if you saw any thing of the kind? - Yes, he did; and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Do you live now where you used to do when this happened? - Yes, I do; I always live in the same place when I am in town.</p>
               <p>God forbid I should restrict your liberty? - I should be sorry you should, or any body else.</p>
               <p>No, the public would be very much injured by it, to be sure? - You must judge about that.</p>
               <p>I have not the pleasure of going so often to the play-house as you do? - How do you know, pray, how often I go; I go to the play-house when I please, I dare say; I do not see why you need ask me about it.</p>
               <p>Do not be angry; it does not become you to be angry: if you knew how much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240087"/>pleasanter you look when you are in good humour, you would not. You did not attend at Bow-street the first time? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>No, not the first time? - I do not know; I went when I was asked to go by the gentleman.</p>
               <p>What was you talking to Mr. Beby about; was not you upbraiding him for not calling to see you? - No, I was not: I had no occasion to do that.</p>
               <p>You know the least chiding from you, one should consider as an upbraiding: had not you been hinting it to him? - You must excuse my telling you what I was asking him about.</p>
               <p>No, I cannot, nor the Jury will not? - Mr. Beby had been in Ireland, and I was asking him about friends in Ireland.</p>
               <p>You had some friends that he was acquainted with? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no complaints on your part, that he did not call so often as you wished? - Good God! I never thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Of course, you did not say any thing of this kind: why we never see you now; you never call upon us now; why do not you call? - No, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you saw him since he came over from Ireland? - No, it was not: I had no occasion to complain of his visits, for I was very glad to see him.</p>
               <p>And his visits were not unfrequent? - I declare I cannot tell any thing about that.</p>
               <p>But however, you felt that you had no reason to complain that he did not visit you so frequent as you wished? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Now, though I am a very unfashionable fellow, I should like to know how it was that your eye was fixed on Mr. Beby's breeches pocket: you are not one of the bashful sort, that do not look people in the face: how happened it in such a conversation, your eye should be fixed so much on the breeches pocket? - Why, Sir, his making such a squeeze, made me look down; when I saw his hand in his pocket, I looked down, because I saw the man make such an uncommon bustle.</p>
               <p>You have talked a little about this since it happened? - Talked a little.</p>
               <p>Have you never said now, that you expected Mr. Beby would be a better friend to you than before? - No, Sir, I have no friend in Mr. Beby; you are quite mistaken in that, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you a sister? - I have.</p>
               <p>Does she live in the same house with you? - She does.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. A sister by the same father and mother? - We call relations now and then.</p>
               <p>Which was acquainted with Mr. Beby, you or your sister? - Why he was both our acquaintance; we were in company together.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I will speak if you please. May it please your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury: in addition to the misfortune of standing here, accused of a crime I never committed, I have also the misfortune of being incapable of doing myself justice equal to the prosecutor, however deceived and mistaken he has been: and my lord, as this circumstance happened at the play-house, in a great crowd of people, where the first gentleman or tradesman might be laid hold of, it is not impossible that the prosecutor might be mistaken in what he has sworn: I trust, my lord, that my inability and ignorance to defend myself against such a charge, however false, will not be construed into guilt: I shall therefore rest my defence intirely on the justice and candour of this honourable Court.

               <p>On the 28th of January, a draft was presented me for payment at Mess.

When Dorr had mentioned that he found it, Rapley then walked about the office, and said, for Christ's sake! speak the truth? then they were both secured.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the partners of this house: on the 28th of January, the prisoner at the bar, Rapley, came into my inner room to me, between nine and ten in the morning: the first thing that passed on his entering the room was, Mr. Woodhouse asked him how he would receive the draft? he said, fifty pounds bank, and the rest money; and then he asked Rapley from whom he received the draft? he said, from a person at the door; I then desired him to go to the door, and bring in the person, which he did: Mr. Woodhouse went with him, and returned with Dorr; I then asked Dorr his name? he told me: I then asked him his business? he said a master carpenter; and that he worked in the Temple. I then asked him from whom he received the draft? he said from a gentleman in a coffee-house in the Temple; I then asked him if he knew him? he said, Yes; I then asked his name? he said, Manley; he then said, I am much frightened.</p>
               <p>Had Rapley interposed all this while? - He had not; he said he found it on Black-friars-bridge: they were then desired to walk into another office, and were secured.</p>
               <p>How long bath Mr. Joseph kept cash with you? - For seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to look at that paper, and see if any part of the hand-writing is according to Mr. Joseph's? - I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt in your own mind, that it is a forgery? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>You do not know the state of his account at that time? - I do not.</p>
               <p>If he should chanced to have over drawn, should you have paid it? - I should.</p>
               <p>I observe the word Manley is written on the back of the note? - I understood it so, and as such wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. You wrote on the back of the draft yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All this transaction had taken up a small space of time? - Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>When Rapley came into the shop, what was the first thing said within your hearing? - Mr. Woodhouse asked him the first thing, how he would have the draft.</p>
               <p>You said, the only question you yourself asked of Rapley, was how he came by it? he immediately told you he had it from a man at the door. Did you go to see if there was such a person at the door? - The man was brought in.</p>
               <p>Then you repeated the question to him, but varied the term: you asked him of whom he received it; you did not ask him how he came by it? - I understood it the same.</p>
               <p>Your question was, of whom you received it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was, he gave you the name of a person, and told you the profession he followed, was a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then nothing more passed between you and Rapley; and the man appeared much confused? - Yes: Dorr immediately on uttering the name of the person, appeared confused, and instantly said he had found it: and Rapley said, son Christ's sake! tell all you know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have already told us that untill Dorr had mentioned the name of the person Manley, Rapley did not interpose? - Not one question.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time afterwards, hear from Rapley, whether he had previous to this, received any information how Dorr came by the note? - No, not till I came to Bow-street: then Rapley said that Dorr came to his house in the evening of the 27th, and told him he had found a draft.</p>
               <p>The question I would ask of you, was, whether Rapley interposed any observations<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240090"/>Dorr said he had found it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Rapley had no opportunity of hinting to you the falshood of Dorr's assertion, till he did? - No, none.</p>
               <p>You asked Rapley how he came by it; but when Dorr came in, you asked him how he received it, supposing he might have received it from some body? - Certainly; it seemed to me to be a proper question to ask, and as such I asked it.</p>


               <p>Mr. Fielding to Woodhouse. You was at the examination at Bow-street? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>I believe some circumstances you heard there; and after that, you examined into the truth of them, and found them true? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding to Wolfe. What persons is Mr. Joseph's family composed of? - There are two brothers to Mr. Joseph.</p>
               <p>Of what ages? - They are grown up; one of them has a family.</p>
               <p>Is there any young man who has access to the place where his checks are kept? - He admits strangers never, and very seldom his brother.</p>
               <p>Where are the bankers checks kept; are they kept under lock and key? - To the best of my knowledge they are.</p>
               <p>Have you any real ground to doubt of the hand-writing of the word January? - No, none in the least; it is not like any one's about our house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hollingsworth. Are the checks delivered in a book, or how are they delivered? - They are given in whole sheets mostly, but sometimes cut.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Joseph. Are they delivered to you in sheets, or some ready cut? - Some one way, and some another.</p>
               <p>Could you lose any of these checks without knowing it? - I suppose I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Every other customer has the same checks, my lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Joseph. Do you know when you received the last checks, previous to the 28th of January? - At the beginning of January, after settling of the book: I took home a new book, and a parcel of checks.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether these checks are of the fresh supply, previous to the 28th of January? - All the checks I then received, were delivered to me this way. (Some produced.)</p>
               <p>Have you had occasion to have your checks altered? - No, not lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Woodhouse. When your checks come home, they do not come home cut in this state in which they are now? - Some do; some do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the check is engraved over five or six times, or only once? - I believe only once.</p>
               <p>Court. It is obvious they make but one drawing of a sheet.</p>
               <p>Court to Hollingsworth. When was your name first introduced into the business? - About two years ago.</p>
               <p>How long has this firm been in use? - About a twelvemonth, to the present time.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I cannot say any thing but what I said at Bow-street; and as to the rest, I leave it to your lordship and my counsel.</p>
               <p>PRISONER RAPLEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday evening, the 27th of January, Dorr came to my house about the hour of nine in the evening: after the usual ceremony of how do you do, he told me he had been lucky in finding a draft for a good deal of money; that he had been over Black-friars-bridge to fetch something, and that on his return, nearly facing the Albion Mills, he saw a paper lay, and picked it up, and looked at it as well as he could by the light of the moon; that he proceeded on his way home; and on this side of Black-friars-bridge, he stopped and looked at it by the light of a paper lanthorn; that he took it home, and thought upon consultation, he would call upon me, which he did, and asked me if I was going into the City the next day? I told him I was; and he said he would get me to get it cashed for him: I asked him again in particular, to tell me the manner of his finding it? and he described it exactly as before; I told him I would call on him in the morning, and hoped he had told me the true state of his coming by it; I called on him in the morning, and went with him; he said, if you will be so kind as to receive this for me, as I never was at a banker's, you will do me a great deal of service. The truth of this story of his coming to me, remains with my counsel; I believe they have sufficient witness of his being there; and also of his telling the story in the hearing of others. I observed the draft was dirty at the time he presented it to me; and I asked him whether the draft was off the pavement, or not? he said it was a little off, on the horse road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Dorr. After I had left work, I went home and had a dish of tea; after that, I went over the water to redeem a cloak which was pledged; and not having money enough for that, I took a gown of my wife's, and pledged it for five shillings, at Parker's; the cloak was in for three shillings, and the interest was one shilling more; so the cloak was brought down, and I gave them the four shillings: as I was going home, before I came to Black-friars-bridge, just by the Albion Mills, I saw a piece of paper lay, which I stooped and picked up; and read it by the moonlight as well as I could; from that I went to the first light I saw: I stayed at an apple-stall, and read it; from this I went to my lodgings, and gave it to my wife, to look at it; I asked her if she thought it was proper for me to go to my brother in law's? she said, yes, by all means; so I called at Mr. Rapley's, who agreed to get the cash for me; and that is the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Rapley. After Dorr was gone, some gentlemen (acquaintances of mine) came to my house; I told to two of these gentlemen, separately, the circumstance of the draft being found, and by whom; and asked their opinion of the business; the gentlemen are attending to prove this; to prove my shewing it them, and asking them their opinion; their answer was, if I could place an implicit confidence in Dorr, and thought he came by it by no improper means, they could see no great harm there could be in tendering it for payment: and this each of them said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am thirteen: I think that is the man (points to Dorr) that stopped at the paper lanthorn, I believe four weeks ago, yesterday.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - The watchman was coming half past eight.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - He held up a piece of paper, and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Who was keeping the stall at this time? - I and my sister.</p>
               <p>Which side of the way is the stall? - On the right-hand side, this side of the bridge, by Chatham-place; and that man came up, and held up a little bit of paper to the lamp; it was a paper about that size: I am sure that is the man that read the paper.</p>
               <p>Your sister was there at that time? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told my friend it was four weeks ago, yesterday; do you reckon by the weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it this happened? - It was the middle of the week: the man took the note.</p>
               <p>Now this is Monday: if it was yesterday four weeks, it must have been on a Sunday? - It was not on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Now recollect yourself as well as you can, and tell me what day of the week it was? - I am sure it was in the middle of the week, because my sister was going to place the next day.</p>
               <p>She is older than you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that the day the man came to the stall, was the day before your sister went to her place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon was it you was asked to remember this circumstance? - The next week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who was it came to you? - It was a man; I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Was he a labouring man? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He said do not be frightened, I only want to speak a word with you.</p>
               <p>Where was this he came to you? - He came to my father's house: I live in Crown-court, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Then the first application they made to you, was at your father's house, Crown-court, Fleet-street: they did not come while you was at the stall? - I believe my sister told them at the stall: I, myself, saw them at the house first.</p>
               <p>Was there no one at the stall, but yourself and sister, when the man read the paper? - Yes, there was a gentleman buying some oranges.</p>
               <p>No woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of the paper: do you think you would know it if you was to see it: do you know whether it was wrote upon or no? - There was some writing upon it.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you about it? - He said nothing to me about it</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to take notice? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the man before? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How long did he stop? - He staid about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>I wish you would recollect yourself, how many days it was after you saw the man at the stall, before you was asked any questions about it? - I believe it was the next week; I am not sure of it.</p>
               <p>How early in the week? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, or at the latter end? - In the beginning.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper, and see whether it was such a paper as that? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>And it appears to have as much writing on it, and as clean? - I did not take so much notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He did not desire you to look at it? - No: there was a man buying oranges at the same time.</p>

               <p>Court. It seems to me very sufficient, the defence they have set up, and especially by their calling of children, and they agree in the fact, which it is not likely they would have called children to attest a forged story.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When was it you saw this pocket book between the prisoner's legs? - When I came up to the prisoner, Macmanus had been thrown down. I believe he was got up again then; when I saw the pocket book between the prisoner's legs I was very near him.</p>
               <p>How long did you see it before it fell? - A very little time; the prisoner swore he had it not; he was struggling with Macmanus and the other.</p>

D - n your eyes, says he, how did I serve you? Why, says I, very dirty; that was about going over Mr. Weatherhall's ground, and I said, remember you was over in Mr. Weatherhall's ground; says he d - n your eyes, you lie, I was not; then I retired to my watch box. Two nights after, I was at my watch box, he and somebody came there, and said, d - n his eyes, let him alone, we will watch an opportunity, and rip him open, and wash our hands in his blood; he left the neighbourhood that very night; I did not attempt to take him, he was so bloody minded; I waited to tell Mr. Weatherhall the consequence of it, and ask him what I should do.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any attempts were made to take this man before last sessions? - Yes, there were, and he was taken at Kensington Gravel Pits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. He staid two days before he absconded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The way you knew him first, was, only by the long blue coat and trowsers? - Yes, and I saw him twice; twice the length of this court.</p>
               <p>Was it a cloudy night? - Yes, and light withall.</p>
               <p>What state were his legs in, was he able to run? - I take my oath he was able to run as I am, and did run faster.</p>
               <p>Court to Hudson. After he came over the pales, did he talk to you that night? - Not a word, after he came over the pales.</p>
               <p>- RILEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am gardener to Mr. Weatherhall; I saw these plants the day before; I missed seven on the 22d of December, there were seven picked up, cut up, and destroyed.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the roots gone? - Some were cut off and some were picked up, but entirely destroyed.</p>
               <p>What do you value these plants at? - I value them at one shilling a piece, but I have asked the advice of some nursery men, and they say eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>How many plants were picked up? - There were two cut up.</p>
               <p>What would be the value of them? - Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Were the other five cut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would not they grow again? - No, they were cut so low, that they were not worth anything, they were the same as if plucked up.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that they were worth a shilling to sell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Weatherhall? - A gentleman.</p>
               <p>Were they worth a shilling a root, as the property of a gentleman? - They were worth a shilling a piece if they had been sold.</p>
               <p>What were they worth being in the garden? - Why they must be worth that in the garden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, on the part of the prisoner a question in point of law occurs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240096"/>to me, and I think it my duty to take the objection: This act of parliament creates two distinct offences upon the face of the first, whoever shall, in the night time, lop, top, &amp;c. any plant, or shrub, of the value of five shillings, standing, growing, or being: the second part makes it a felony, to break, or deface, or spoil, any of the plants, without mentioning the taking, or carrying them away: my objection is, that this indictment charges, that he plucked up so many roots, value 5 s. whereas the offence proved is, that there are two roots only plucked up, and that the others have been broken and spoiled in the nursery ground.</p>
               <p>Court. It is pluck up, dig up, break, spoil; if he plucks up and spoils, I take it he is within this act of parliament; according to the evidence, two are plucked up by the roots, five have been spoiled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place, on the face of the indictment, it is charged, that he unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously, did pluck up, dig up, and carry away seven young plants, called rosemary plants, value seven shillings; the evidence goes to two, I agree, on the face of the indictment, but it does not go to the five others.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a great deal in what that gentleman says, there were only two plucked up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit the evidence perfectly supports the indictment; it is material to see what is the charge in the indictment; it is, that he feloniously did pluck up, dig up, take and carry away; and I submit that this particular part of the charge is perfectly well sounded; I submit, first, on the evidence, it is perfectly clear, that all this was, at least, plucked up; then I submit, that the other words, dig up, &amp;c. may be rejected, as surplusage.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Knapp's objection is, that he must be guilty of either plucking up, digging up, breaking, spoiling or destroying, or carrying away shrubs, or plants, value five shillings: Now, says he, your indictment is only for plucking up, digging up, taking and carrying away, to the value of five shillings, and the digging up goes only to two shillings; and then, he says, that with respect to the other five, it is not included in your indictment: but if the Jury are of opinion that they were taken and carried away, what do you say to that Mr. Knapp? for if he is guilty of either plucking up, digging up, or carrying away he is guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Look into the indictment, and see whether it says, then and there standing, growing, and being in the garden ground? - No, it does not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit it is a question of fact, for the Jury, whether this man has dug, or plucked up these plants; I say, that the plant growing in the ground being torn from its root, is plucking it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is plucking off, but not plucking out; but there is a much stronger reason which weighs in my mind, on the evidence, that the watchman was at a distance, and it was a cloudy night, at the distance of this room, and that he did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are satisfied.</p>
               <p>

Field's and Brown's chambers; I went into the shop to enquire for him; and in consequence, I went after him; but however, I did not see him till I saw him at the Stamp-office; on seeing me, he immediately ran out; I followed him; and as soon as he got to the top of the steps in Somerset-house-square, he turned round, and asked me if I was following him? on which I answered I was not; after that he went up to the gate that leads into the Strand, and came and asked me which was the way to the Strand? I informed him it was on the left hand; he walked a few yards on this side of the way, and then crossed over, and went through several courts, and enquired for somebody at one or two places; I proceeded, and never lost sight of him; he turned round several times to ask me if I was following him? I said not; in a court leading to Clare-street, he turned round, and said he would knock me down; upon that, I desired several people to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Now, I would ask you whether the prisoner is the same person you saw on the 9th of January, at the Stamp-office? - It certainly was; I have no doubt about it; not the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. What time of the evening was it that the young man came to your shop? - About seven o'clock on the 9th of January.</p>
               <p>It was candle-light? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Was your shop a shop of considerable custom? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>How long after this was it, before he was apprehended? - It was about the beginning of March, or the latter end of February, that he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>And this person had not been in custody till then? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him all this time? - No.</p>
               <p>There are a great many young men who are clerks to attorneys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You attended at the lord mayor's when this young man was taken: did you point to a young man who was clerk to the sitting alderman then? - I did not.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether he did not go voluntarily to the office? - Yes, he did, very quietly.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether it has happened to you, as it has to me this afternoon, that you have taken one person for another? - I might have done so; but I am certain as to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. On your cross-examination, you said he went quietly: what day was this? - On the day he went to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>On that day he was taken; was he taken to your shop? - He was.</p>
               <p>Jury to the witness. You have told us that the prisoner came out of the Stamp-office, and asked you the way to the Strand; and that you followed him? - In Clare-street there are two courts; from Clare-street he went through the market; and was going into Vere-street; he was going to turn towards the dead wall, but did not go; he did partly go, but returned; he went afterwards up a court, and then he returned from that court into Clare-street, and went through Clare-street quite into Vere-street, through the market; on this side of the market, which leads to Wild-street.</p>

            , another witness, swore, that he was acquainted with the prisoner, and that he was not Mr. Heath. The jury found the prisoner guilty. But the Court doubted whether under all these circumstances, the crime amounted to felony; and therefore did not pass sentence upon him; but referred the case to the opinion of the judges; and I understand that the verdict that is entered, is in general terms, that he was guilty. My respected and learned friend, Mr. Recorder, acted with very great consideration in a case which had excited a variety of opinions, to have this point settled by the judges: and the first day of the last term, ten judges were present, all the judges that could possibly attend; and they were unanimously of opinion that this conviction was right; some observations have occurred to me to support that opinion; and if in any thing my learned brothers who are here, who were present at the time of this unanimous opinion, doubt whether I carry this matter too far, they will be so good as to give any explanation that may arise: I state it, that the exact case in point of fact, has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240103"/>not, as I apprehend, ever come before the judges; yet the principle on which I think it depends, has been more than once recognized, and resolved; I mean, that I hold, that it was taken from the possession of the owner: the true question then is, whether in consideration of the law, the prisoner did not take these stockings from the possession of the prosecutor, though not from his actual or personal possession? I am of opinion, that by law, the possession of mere personal chattles follows the property; for this purpose I refer to the case reported in Latch, 214, Hudson and Hudson: that was an action in the nature of an action of trover; the declaration was, that the testator was possessed of them; and after his death, they came to the hands of the defendant: there was a verdict for the plaintiff: and it was objected, in arrest of judgment, that the plaintiff had not proved that he was possessed of the goods; for the goods coming from the hands of the defendant, after the death of the testator, it was nugatory for him to stile himself executor: the Court was of that opinion, that it was unnecessary and improper to have stiled himself executor: but all of them, lord chief justice Hyde, &amp;c. agreed for the plaintiff; for they said, upon the matters in the declaration, the law says he was possessed, because the property draws with it the actual possession of goods, upon which you may have trespass: as if a man in London gives me these goods that are at York, if another takes them, they shall have trespass; that seems to have been the solemn opinion by judges of high character and reputation: and that principle that I have asserted, is true, that the possession follows the property. In the next place, the possession of the owner cannot be divested by the thief; and therefore, it is determined, that if a man steals my goods, and then a second thief steals them from the first thief, I may indict that second thief, and in the indictment alledge them to be my property; because that second act of theft does not divest my property. I carry this farther in my judgment and opinion; that the same doctrine will hold when goods are obtained by fraud, that the possession shall not be divested from the true owner by it: and it would be very extraordinary to say, that the man that exercises that fraud by deceit, shall derive an advantage by his own wrongs. Heretofore in the antient times, there were extraordinary opinions, whether servants having the custody or care of their master's goods, embezzling them, were guilty of felony: there was an act of parliament, the 21st of Henry VIII. chapter the 7th, which recited, that when goods were delivered by the owner to his servant to keep, and the servant embezzled them, that it was doubtful whether it was felony by the common law: it did not recite that it was not felony, but only that it was doubtful whether it was felony by the common law: that act therefore, provides, in the case of servants being at the age of eighteen, and not apprentices: so that it left the matter intirely open to servants that were under the age of eighteen, having money, goods, and chattels delivered to them by their masters, that it was an embezzling with intent to steal; but this act of parliament, in my judgment, did not mean to weaken, but to assist the common law; and ever since that act, the opinion of those who held it felony before that act, has been confirmed: therefore, in the case of a butler who had his master's plate, and other instances of servants in the house, and about the house, having the custody of their master's plate or goods, and running away with them, and embezzling them, it has been held to be felony; on this ground, that they have not the possession of them, but the possession continues in the master or employer: and therefore it has been held, that those persons are guilty of felony, if they take them away: and it is not confined to them only; because, in the 21st of Hawkins 83, Lord Hale, 1st volume, 506, says,</p>
               <p>"That my shepherd that has the care of my sheep (sheep must of course be out on the pastures) who takes away any of my sheep with intent to steal them, though he has the custody and care of them delivered to him, and is intrusted by me, is guilty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240104"/>felony, just as much as any stranger." Now with respect to servants who steal their masters goods from their masters, not intrusted with any dominion over them, but to convey them to any place, or to do any particular act with them towards their convenience; it has been determined, that that servant running away with the goods, is guilty of felony. Very soon after I had the honour of being in this situation, I tried a man at Salisbury, whose name was Purdock: he was the foreman to a mercer at the Devizes; his master delivered to him bills to the amount of 1200 l. to put them in covers, and send them by the post to his correspondent in London; it was on the Saturday; the master had great confidence in this servant of his; the next morning, he desired his master's permission to visit a relation four or five miles distant, and should be at home in the evening; but he did not come; the master's mind misgave him, and he sent, and found the man had not been there: he sent pursuers, and the next day discovered he had changed one of those bills at Salisbury; they overtook him at Topsham in Devonshire, going to set sail for France; they seized him, and very fortunately recovered great part of the bills: this man was tried before me, and very eminent counsel were concerned for him: one, now no more, very well known, which was Mr. Dunning, was counsel for this man: they contended, that he having received those bills from his master, it could not be a felony: they resembled it to the case of a carrier, which I thought bore no similarity to it; but the man was found guilty: my idea was, that the possession of the master was not at all removed, and that it was just the same thing, as if he had stolen it out of his master's desk; however, at the request of those gentlemen, I reserved it for the opinion of the Judges, and they unanimously concurred in the opinion I had given: In Michaelmas term, 1782, one

             (and I have the case here) was indicted for stealing a quantity of goods, value eighty pounds; the prisoner was porter to the prosecutor, who delivered to him a parcel, containing the goods in the indictment, to be carried to the customer; in his way, he was met by two men, who prevailed upon him to go into a public house; where they persuaded him to dispose of the goods, which he consented to; and one of the men then brought a person, who bought the goods, and the prisoner received eight guineas of the money: the question was, whether this amounted to a felonious taking; then follows a note, that the goods were taken out of a sack, and that they were delivered to the prisoner, and put into a brown bag; it was tried by the late Recorder, Mr. Serjeant Adair. Now, I should observe, that the last case furnished a colour for a distinction, which has been taken, in the case of a carrier; that if the carrier runs away with the whole bale, he is not guilty of felony; but if he opens the bale and takes out a part of that, then he will be guilty of felony; indeed, after he has got to the place of destination of the bale, then if he takes away the whole, he is guilty of felony; the case of a carrier stands on a peculiar bottom of its own, that the carrier acquires a sort of special property, to protect those goods against every one; that he is responsible to the owner, for the value of them, in every respect without excuse, excepting publick enemy or tempest: but on the consideration of this case, the Judges did not at all see that, as a material circumstance. Upon my return from Lord Mansfield's chambers, the same evening, I set down by myself, and made a memorandum, that all the Judges present held the conviction right, the possession being as they held, still in the prosecutor, the prisoner being his servant; and I put down a memorandum, Purdock's case, tried before me at Salisbury; so also resolved upon the same principle. I am confirmed in this also, by having seen a note of this case, of

I am sure, if that is right, that is a determination, that the possession still remained in the master; now, these two cases, that I have referred to, the case of Purdock, and the case of Bass, were of servants themselves; the deluders (the persons that drew in

            , to go to the public house, and then to defraud his master, in the manner as has been mentioned) they were not taken, they were not brought to justice; so that two instances are mentioned of servants, of immediate servants, taking goods from their masters; but it seems to me, that that should bear harder on the deluder, on the deceiver. Bass, in all probability, would have been innocent, had he not been drawn in by those two wicked persons: and in the present case, the boy that was sent by his master, to deliver those goods to Heath, he is perfectly innocent; it is the prisoner alone, that is comprehended in the guilt. Now, I conclude, that the goods were stolen from the possession of the master; this man's obtaining them by this fraud, that I have stated, from the boy, is just the same thing, as if he had obtained them from the master himself. I hold this to be the same, as if he had come into the gentleman's shop, and taken these goods from his counter, or from his window, and immediately ran away with them; it is just as much a taking from the possession of the master, in my apprehension, as if it had been done in the shop. There was a case of one Fisher, reported in Sir

             was of opinion, that it was a felonious taking, and was exactly the same as if he had snatched it from the counter, and run away with it. The famous case here of a man in Smithfield, that desired to try the paces of a horse, the owner let him mount, and he immediately set spurs to the horse, and ran away with him. And not to enter further into the case of obtaining goods under false pretences, meaning at that instant to steal the goods, which has been often held to be felony; I take it, that this case is stronger than that; that it is an actual taking fraudulently from the master; just in the same manner, as if the master himself had been present, and the man had snatched them away. These are the reasons I offer in support of this judgment of conviction.</p>

               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Alphabets, and two Extracts by way of</p>
               <p>"Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>

               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this Plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last thirty-three Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, have may a Copy of it at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
