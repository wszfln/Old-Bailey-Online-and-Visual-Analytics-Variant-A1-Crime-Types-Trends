I am the wife of Frederick Morley, and live at Pimlico—in May, 1903, we lived at Old Compton, Chatham—on May 16th, 1904, I had about £6 6s. in the Post Office Savings Bank—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my book, with my signature in it—I have known the prisoner for about six years—my daughter Elizabeth has been living with the prisoner as her servant for some time—on Monday, May Kith, I went to see the prisoner, and went with her to the Rob Roy to have a drink—I had a skirt on which had no safe pocket in it, and I handed my bank book to the prisoner to mind for me—I also gave her a purse with half a crown in it and the key of my room door—she went and spoke to her husband—I went away to her house to wait for her, as I thought she would not be long—she returned between 9 and 10 p.m.—I stayed at her house all night—I saw her again about nine next morning, when she took me to a public house, I cannot remember the name—I had a drink there—she gave me my key back before she left me—I did not ask for my book, I never gave it a thought—I thought she was coming back after doing her hawking—I next saw her in custody—I did not say to her in the Rob Roy that she could have my money because she had been good to my daughter, or that she could be me and draw the money out—I gave her no authority that she could deal with my book: all I did was to ask her to take care of it for me—on the Monday I told her I did not think she could draw the money, and I do not think she could—I said so because I thought she might try to do so—I found out afterwards that £3 10s. had been drawn from my account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I did not take the book out of my pocket in the public house and say, "That is for you"—you did not say, "Is this the money you stole from your sister?"—I did not steal any money from her—this money has nothing to do with her.</p>

I told my husband who gave me the book, and that is all he knows about it"—I asked the man in the prisoner's presence for his address, and he said "2, St. Catherine's Road, Notting Hill"—I said, "You can come to the Post Office with your wife if you care to"—he went away—at the General Post Office the prisoner said, "My name is Agnes Unitt; I am the wife of Walter Unitt. a blacksmith's labourer, and live at 3, Bishop's Court, Chatham.

I said, 'I hope this is not the money they say you stole from your sister.' She replied, No, that is all right; you deserve this for your kindness to my daughter and myself.' I said, 'But the name is Morley.' She said, 'Oh, you be me, and give my name and draw the money out'"—I asked her why she gave a false address when she applied at Norland Square, and she said, "Oh, anything you like."</p>

"If you don't pay him to-night look out"—the prisoner said, "If he interferes any more I shall put this into him"—when I heard that something had happened I went and gave information to the police—I did not know the deceased or his wife before this—I have only seen the prisoner once or twice.</p>

I am landlord of the Atlantic, Brixton—in November a parcel was left in the bar—Birch came and opened it in front of me—it contained six tankards and a champagne stand fitted up—he asked me to buy them for £3—when I had finished looking at them Limb came in and said, "Cannot you have a deal? Have a deal if you can"—I told them to take them out again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Limb perhaps three years—I know he was a jobmaster—I knew he had the Royal Oak stables—before the Magistrate I said, "Birch claimed a parcel left over the bar."</p>

I keep the Railway Hotel, Brixton—I remember seeing the tankards and the champagne stand at my house in November—Limb saw me in the passage and asked me if I had seen the pots he had left with me—I said I had not seen any pots—he said they were, in a brown paper parcel—I went into my office, and found a brown paper parcel with these pots and the champagne stand in it—I asked him how he had become possessed of them—he told me he had sold a horse to a retired publican and took these in part exchange—I gave him £3 for them—I told him the champagne stand was no use to me—he said he could not afford to drink champagne—I asked him after I had made the bargain for a receipt, as I could not buy the tankards without one—he produced this receipt, and on the back of it signed his receipt in my presence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant, C.</hi>) I arrested Birch—on May 14th I arrested Limb—I told him who I was, and that I held a warrant for his arrest—I read it to him, and told him I should arrest him for conspiring with Birch in attempting to obtain and obtaining from George Turner, a butcher at Shepherd's Market, £3 15s., and also for a conspiracy with Birch to obtain six plated tankards from Messrs. Loftus, of Tottenham Court Road—he said, "I do not know anything about the———tankards. What another man does, has nothing to do with me. You made a mistake some time ago over the same thing, and locked up one of my chaps"—I do not know what he means by that, "I was not with Birch when he got the money from the butcher. I waited for him in a public house close by; the butcher did not see me"—on May 26th the prisoners were charged together at Marlborough Street police court, and I told them they would both be charged with attempting to obtain and obtaining by means of a worthless cheque £3 15s. from a baker at Brixton Hill—I showed Limb that cheque—he said, "I know nothing about that cheque, I never cashed a cheque with the baker, the cheque you showed me at Brixton police station was cashed by the butcher"—I had shown him a similar cheque.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, City.</hi>) About nood on June 6th I saw the prisoners walking along Cheapside examining the name plates—they walked into Aldersgate Street, Gresham Street, Noble Street, and returned again into Aldersgate Street, where they went into the Post Office Gardens—there Leeck joined a third man, Schneider standing a little way off—after a few minutes' conversation Leeck and the third man walked into Aldersgate Street, followed by Schneider—on the third man leaving a few minutes afterwards, Leeck joined Schneider, and they walked down Aldersgate Street about 90 yards—Leeck left Schneider and walked ahead about 10 or 12 yards—every now and again he would look into a shop window, when Schneider would walk up to him and. looking in the same window, would speak to him—this was repeated on four occasions—the last window they stopped at was No. 141. Aldersgate Street, a tailor's, where they separated—Leeck came back and went up the staircase of No. 146. Schneider following him and standing on the kerb outside—after three minutes Leeck came out hurriedly, and as he passed Schneider, appeared to speak to him—Schneider turned round and looked back in the direction of the doorway of No. 146. and then followed Leeck—after 60 yards or so Schneider caught him up, and they walked some distance into Little Britain—they went up behind a public house, where I saw Schneider looking inside Leeck's coat—on my going up the court both prisoners came out and walked to the Bank, where they got on an omnibus—Detective Wise and I also got on—Wise sat immediately behind them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190406200023"/>
               <p>and I on the opposite side—the omnibus went down the Whitechapel Road as far as Aldgate Church, where Leeck opened his coat and Schneider looked <hi rend="italic">over</hi> it—on their getting off at Leman Street I told Leeck I was a police officer, and asked him for the roll of silk which he had under his coat—he opened his coat, and from a large pocket on the inside he took this roll of silk (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Schneider, when arrested, said, "Me not steal anything"—he made no further answer to the charge that I could under<lb/>stand, as he spoke most of the time in German—at Snow Hill police station., when charged, he said, "Why for am I here?" meaning in the dock—he said he was in company with Leeck, who was going to his address to translate some papers which he had in his possession relative to a patent fire lighter—he gave his correct address.</p>

Rushbrooke—Schneider followed and stood on the kerb—after a couple of minutes Leeck came out hurriedly and walked past Schneider, who turned round three or four times towards the door of No. 146, and joined Leeck higher up the road—they went into a courtway, where Leeck showed Schneider something under his coat—they then went to the Bank, where they got on an omnibus—I sat behind them, and saw Leeck again show Schneider something under his coat—I stood up and looking over his shoulder, saw this parcel (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in a large pocket he had inside his overcoat.</p>

               <p>German papers with reference to a patent—I said I could get a cheaper printer for him than he already had, and we went to the City—I told him I was looking for work, and on reaching No. He I told him to wait outside for me whilst I went up—when I came down, after having stolen the silk, he asked me if I had any work, and I said, "Yes; I do not want to go with you; leave the translation till later on"—he said he would make it worth my while if I would work for him, that he would employ me as a traveller for his new patent—I went on a little distance, and he caught me up—when we got to Little Britain I went up a court to a urinal—I did not show him anything under my coat then—we got on a bus at the Bank—he asked me where the work I had got was, and I opened my coat and showed him the parcel—he is perfectly innocent, and knew nothing about my having stolen it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital, and was present when the deceased was admitted about 1 a.m. on Saturday, May 28th—he was very pale, but conscious—he was lying on a couch, and from his left temple was protruding the end of this knife blade—he smelled of drink, but from his speech I concluded that he was not then drunk—the receiving room officer tried to remove the blade, but was unsuccessful—I had to perform an operation to remove it—it was about 2 1/2 inches in the head—I had to cut the bone away, and the blade was pulled out with very great difficulty—the bone was trepanned to see where the hemorrhage was—there must have been a hard push to make it go in as far as it did—I had to get two of my assistants to hold the head, and then I got it with a strong pair of forceps—they slipped off it twice before I could get it out—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a piece of the bone which was cut out with the circular saw—the blade passed the skull bone—after it had gone through the bone there would be no resistance—the deceased was becoming comatose when we started the operation about 2 a.m.—we had to give him an anaesthetic—he did not recover consciousness after the operation, but died about 1 p.m.—the cause of death was hemorrhage into the brain, caused by this knife severing the vessels in the brain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was the operator—my first attempt to pull the blade out was unsuccessful—I used what we call lion forceps—there were three misses altogether, one by the receiving room officer and two by myself—nobody touched the wound but myself and the dressers, who swabbed the blood away—the two pulls at the blade would not interfere with the deceased's condition in any way. because it did not move—a man who had an accident or a wound of this sort would have a shock—s a rule shock would sober a man—I cannot say what the deceased's condition was before I saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Saqui Lawrence, jewellers, 97, Fleet Street—the prisoners came into the shop on May 21st—they were strangers—Wiedakowch said, "I should like to see some rings about £5 or £6"—I took a tray of jewellery from the window and put it before the prisoners on the counter—Wiedakowch said he would like one or two of the ruby and diamond rings on the tray, but they looked rather more than he wished to go to—one was marked £8 15s. in plain figures—he asked if I could let him have a sapphire instead of a ruby—I said he could have it—he asked me what the extra charge would be—I said, "No extra charge"—he gave me back the ring, and I put the tray back in the window—Tachard was by his side looking at the rings—no one else was in the shop on the public side of the counter—I got another tray out of the window—Hans said, "I should prefer to look at the others again," and I got it out again and put the other back—then he said, "I should like to have a magnifying glass to look at that diamond ruby ring"—I gave him a glass, and he took the ring and glass to the door to look at the stone, and brought it back to the counter—he explained that one diamond seemed rather dirty—he wished me to look at it through the magnifying glass—I took the glass and examined the ring as best I could—it was not dirty—after I had used the glass I noticed two rings were missing from the tray—both men were in front of the counter—then Tachard examined two rings at the door—he came back to the counter and put one marked £2 17s. 6d. and an imitation of a 7 guinea ring back on the tray—I only noticed the imitation when I wiped the tray—I noticed the gold foil at the back of the stone—this is the sham ring, and this the original I missed—it is a three-stone ring, and of a slightly different shape—I put the tray in the window with the imitation ring on the tray—I got another tray of rings out after that—I called my boy to fetch a constable—the prisoners looked at the rings on the other tray, and Wiedakowch said they were rather dear, that they had not sufficient money, but would call another day—Tachard, before the constable arrived, wished to be searched in the shop, and in front of the policeman—the three of us went to Bridewell Police Station, and I charged them with stealing the ring—on their being searched this genuine ring was found on Wiedakowch in the lining of his overcoat, where it had gone from the right-hand pocket—that ring was on one of the trays before the prisoners came into the shop—it has on it a number and a private mark.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statement before the Magistrate. Tachard said:</hi> "I am innocent. I do not know Wiedakowch. I only knew him for two weeks. I met him on Saturday afternoon very casually. and he told me he wanted to buy a cheap ring for his father, so we proceeded to that shop. He saw several rings, and I did as well, and I looked at two rings, one at £2 17s.6d. and the other at £4 10s., which two I put back again after a few minutes. After two or three other minutes the shopman called in the police, without my knowing for what. At the police station Wiedakowch expressed his regret for me being in trouble on his account. I knew him as a respectable person, and I did not suspect before going into the shop that he had a bad intention." <hi rend="italic">Wiedakowch said:</hi> "This man had nothing to do with this thing. I was in the shop to buy a ring, to pay some money on it if I liked it, and to take the ring after a few days when I got the money from my home. He showed me dear rings. He showed me a ring I liked, but it was too much money. I saw another like it. It was nearly the same. After he took a ring out I put one back. I did not know which it was, and I put the other in my pocket, and then he called in the police, and I did not know what for. I asked to be searched in the shop, because I thought I had my own ring in my pocket. I had three minutes to put the ring back out of my pocket if I had known it was not mine. When the ring was found on me I was astonished."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant, 17 N.</hi>) On June 1st I got a search warrant and went to 32, Daleview Road, Stamford Hill—I there saw Paul Hertz, a one-armed man, and the prisoners—I went into the parlour—Weisherg was standing at the table—he had evidently just left off pasting some labels on to some blank cardboard boxes—there were two brushes and pastepots there—there were about 6700 labels like this lying about—there were 3120 cardboard tubes, each containing a mantle, and each labelled with a label like this—on the floor there were 8,040 plain card<lb/>board tubes, each with a mantle, but without the green and red label on them—they were ready for sticking—there were Cas big cardboard boxes for holding a dozen each, printed with the "Welsbach" name—I found 1,127 mantles there; each had got on the words "Welsbach Aur"—I seized and took away these things—on June 11th I went to 102, Church Street, Stoke Newington, Carter Paterson's depot, and seized a wooden case which contained 41 gross of labelled tubes, each containing a mantle marked "Welsbach" and "Aur"—on June 5th I arrested Weisberg on a warrant, which I read to him—he said, "I know nothing about it; I was employed as a clerk by Paul Hertz; I came from Roumania about December 28th last; I was glad of the appointment with Hertz; I worked a month for nothing; he then gave me 22s. a week, and afterwards in<lb/>creased it to 30s. There was no work at Spital Square, so I came to Dale<lb/>view Road, saw they were busy, and lent them a hand"—he said he had no pay for that except his pay as clerk—on June 15th I saw Strauss in Kingsland Road—I said to him, "Are you Max Strauss?"—he said, "Yes, I intended to give myself up on Tuesday."</p>

Werthen Co. Sole Proprietor, Paul Hertz, Manufacturers of Incandescent Mantles, London. E.C., 20, Spital Square, Bishopsgate Street," and an address at Berlin—eight or ten days after, Weisberg asked me if I could do some labels—this is what he showed me—I said I could—he wanted 100,000; he asked the price, and I said I should have to go to a lithographer to ascertain that—I went to Sobel and got a price from him—I came back and saw Weisberg, and went with him to see Strauss, and said I could make the labels at 3s. per 1,000—I received later on from Strauss £3 and £2, which was sent by Weisberg—I asked Strauss at the time why he did not give me the money then, and he said he must receive it—nothing was said to me about the Welsbach Company—I saw the name on the label—Sobel did the work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, Handland Street, Deptford, and am a carman to the London and North-Western Railway Company—I collected some wooden cases at 20, Spital Square on May 17th and other times, and signed this book, which was handed to me by a Miss Mendelson. a clerk there—I have received goods from the prisoners—on June 21st last I went to Broad Street Station, and there saw two cases which were part of the May 17th delivery—I presume they had come back from Leeds—I saw them opened—they contained parcels of mantles in little green and scarlet boxes—on May 24th I collected a similar case at 20, Spital Square—it was consigned to Manchester, but I do not remember the name—this book says it is addressed to Strauss's order at Manchester.</p>

               <p>is January 23rd, from Strauss to Hertz in London, which has in it this passage, "With regard to my idea re making £300, next week verbally"—the next is from Strauss, Newcastle-on-Tyne, to Hertz, of February 19th, 1904, and has in it this passage: "I hope you will arrange everything in Berlin so that we shall soon be in order, because we have the customers, but have not the goods"—the next is February 24th. 1904, from Werthen. Berlin, to the Front Company, signed "Hertz," and has this passage: "We wish for the future, that both of you should write hand in hand, and not conduct separate correspondence"—there is one of April 21st from Werthen Co., Berlin, to the Front Incandescent Company in London (<hi rend="italic">Stating "I hare already sent the 'W' dozen boxes for the</hi> 706"—another on April 23rd to J.

                  </hi>. I am master of the ss. "Waiwera," a British ship trading between London and New Zealand—on her last voyage to New Zealand, the prisoner was an able bodied seaman on board her—the deceased was a deck boy on the ship; it was his first voyage—he was about seventeen years of age—I joined the ship at Wellington. New Zealand, on April 12th—the prisoner came on board the next day—my predecessor had to stay in New Zealand to give evidence at a trial not connected with this case—we started on April 13th—I noticed nothing as to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> behaviour between the prisoner and the deceased—the number of the crew all told was seventy-eight—on May 18th I was sitting in the smoking room, which is above the upper deck, and about seven feet above the ordinary deck—we were about 2 degrees south of the Equator, and coming round the Cape of Good Hope—between 850 and 8.55 I heard a man's voice cry for help on deck—I immediately went to the place where the cry came from, which was on the sheltered deck, a few feet abaft the deck the smoking room was on—I saw Quartermaster Fisher holding the pri<lb/>soner down—I asked what was the matter, and Fisher said, "This man has knocked a boy down with a belaying pin, or something"—it was a moonlight night, but there were a few clouds passing over the moon, and it was dark; I could not see much—close to that spot there was an electric light—T asked where the boy was, and Fisher said, "Lying on the deck there"—I turned and saw him lying about ten or twelve feet from the prisoner, on his back, with his arms and legs extended—he was not moving at all—I went up and put my hand under his head and found him bleeding, and with blood on his face—I said, "He has killed the boy." and I called for the doctor—the prisoner said, "You do not want a doctor; the boy is dead enough; I have knocked his brains out," and then he</p>

               <p>was quiet—the doctor came immediately and examined the boy—I left him and went across the deck, and got a case of instruments and a cup of hot water, and came back to the doctor—I left the boy in his charge, and went to get the prisoner put into irons—he was put in No. 4 hatch—I was in the hatch with him, and he said, "You will find a letter in my pocket explaining all this"—I put my hand into his trousers pocket and found this letter in an envelope (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), addressed to Gumbril, a seaman who is one of the crew—it was only sealed up a little bit; it looked to me as if the letter had been put into an old envelope—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "My last declaration in this world, as I am about to take the life of Dennis Lowthian to-night. I think it right I should give some reason for it. Well, I will start by saying that I have been better to him since the ship left London than hundreds of thousands of fathers are to their children, from the day the ship left London till now. I have washed all his clothes and mended them, and darned his socks, got his boots mended twice. I have on Satur<lb/>days taken every stitch of clothes off him and washed them; that is, coat and vest, pants, shirt, drawers, and singlet, socks and cap, besides washing two or three other times in the week for him. I have waited on him as if I was his paid servant: he would shout for me when he was in his bed at night to fetch him a drink of water; and, before going to sleep, ask me to tuck him in every night, saying at the same time that nobody could tuck him in like I and his father could, not even his mother. I gave him more than a sovereign's worth of tobacco, as the steward's book will prove, as all the soft tobacco I had was for him, as well as cigarettes. I washed clothes for the cook on the passage out, so as to get food for him, as some of the men in the ship can prove. In fact, I could not eat any<lb/>thing any good without he had half of it. Now, the reason why I, a complete stranger to him, <hi rend="italic">done</hi> all this, when we left London he followed me about the ship wherever I went, always telling me that he liked me more than anyone else in the ship, and if I would talk to him and be nice to him, he would write and tell his father from St. Helena that he had a good friend to speak to. Then he brought me his father's first letter to him since he left home, and read it to me by the moonlight, while I was on the look out. His father asked him in that letter to be honest, truthful and straightforward, one of either virtues I said at the time he had not got. However, when the letter was finished I said to him I will try and be as good to you as your father could be if he was at sea with us. Well. I started, and, my God! what poison I had to encounter in that boy! I have found him to be one of the lowest specimens of humanity I ever met, the most audacious liar I have ever met; while he would look at you in the face with a pure, innocent, truthful face on the viper himself. He was also a thorough, accomplished thief. He has stolen the cargo, or some of it, on five different occasions; while we, the able seamen, were getting blamed for it. He has stolen money off a counter in Lyttelton in front of me, and when I have gone into a ginger beer shop outside Auckland he has stolen the fruit in the shop while I got served with my drink. He has also told me that he has broken the church clock at home while his father used to talk to him about the blackguard.</p>

               <p>that <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and he had seen one pound reward in the paper, before he left home, for the culprit. I think I have said enough to prove that he is a liar. I remained up all my watch below this forenoon to wash his two blankets and rug. He went to-night and danced on them on the dirty deck, in front of me, to vex me. He called me all the bastards and cowards he could think of and said that I did not have the guts to doany harm to him or myself. I have begged and prayed of him over and over again to leave me alone and let me get home in peace. I have even told him that something awful would happen if he did not. Well, he took no notice of me, only continually threatening me that he would go up to the captain and tell him some lies about me. The captain, he said, would believe anything he told him, and believe nothing from me. I have reason to believe that that was true. That is now the sole cause of me going to commit this terrible deed, for if I thought that I would get fair play from the captain I would never do this. I <hi rend="italic">hurted</hi> myself inter<lb/>nally and badly that way, that sometimes I could hardly breathe, and now catches me very often just below the breast bone in the region of the liver, through some sudden start coming out of the galley with a bucket of water in one hand; however, the captain said I was shamming, that means loafing, and he was backed up by a half simple thing that calls himself a doctor, who is working his passage home to England as ship doctor; he put me in a small house and locked me up there, and brought me two hard biscuits and water for the night. There was no light in the room, but there was a place to ship an electric lamp, but there was none there. I asked the doctor for a light, and he banged the door behind him, saying at the same time, 'You won't have a light Then, although I knew that I could not work pro<lb/>perly I told the mate I would turn to, and he said, 'That is what we want you to do.' The captain then sent for me and told me that if I was not careful I would find myself in a hole when I got to London. I think this will show what sort of fair play I would get from the captain should I go before him. Now, this same Dennis Lowthian accused me of being in his bunk one night at 3 p.m., and another night of putting * * *, and has often lately accused me of * * myself in front of him. Now, as I expect to go before my God. that is all false. When he has been on good terms with me lately he told me that he was told to say these things by certain people in the ship, and although he <hi rend="italic">know</hi> they were wrong, he said it for those people. He got me seven days in gaol at the Bluff. Well, there, he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> everything to me that the Devil himself could plan out for him, for which he will die to-night. I have not much sympathy with his father and mother for rearing such a dog, but I will say, 'May God help them.' I hope this will be a warning to other boys not to try and blackmail anybody. When I kill him directly I shall think that I have killed one of the worst snakes this world has ever seen as I see. Good bye to this foul, dirty, wicked world.—JOHN SULLIVAN.

                  </hi>. I was quartermaster of the "Waiwera" on her voyage from London to New Zealand and back—we left London on January 6th, and the deceased, with two or three other deck boys, sailed with us—they had a berth to themselves, shut off from the rest of the forecastle—I noticed that the prisoner and the deceased seemed to be very friendly on the way out, and later on that they quarrelled frequently—when we reached New Zealand the deceased prosecuted the prisoner for assault, and he got seven days—on the* return journey they quarrelled more frequently—at 9 p.m. on May 18th I was talking to the deceased close by the bridge deck on the port side of the cargo hatch—I was making a cricket ball at the time, and the deceased was standing slightly behind me on my right—I suddenly heard a dull thud just behind me, and at the same instant I saw a shadow on the deck—I turned round and saw the prisoner striking at the deceased with something in his hand from 18 inches to 2 feet long—I could not see what it was—I saw what must have been the second blow struck on the right side of the deceased's head—I <hi rend="italic">went for</hi> the prisoner, got the upper hand of him, and called for help—I held him standing up—I should not hear the prisoner walking on the deck, as he had bare feet, being in the Tropics—the captain came down from the lower bridge and asked me what was the matter—I said, "There is a boy been laid out with a belaying pin," as I thought the instrument was—the captain attended to the boy and called for the doctor while I held the prisoner—someone in the crowd, which had got round,. said, "Is he hurt?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, he is dead, the little bastard, and if I could get at him now I would cut him to pieces; he has driven me mad"—he then started singing an Irish song—the chief officer came and handcuffed him—the prisoner said, "You, you big bastard you, the chief officer of a ship; I will give you a kick in the guts"—we took him to No. hatch, and while the hatches were being taken off he went into a swoon for about a minute—we took him below and secured him—on searching him I found a razor in his right hand trousers pocket—I have not seen the letter which the prisoner wrote—on May 20th, two days after, I said to him that I had heard he had done it with an axe, and</p>

               <p>I asked him why he had it in his possession—he said that the deceased had threatened to bring the firemen round him, and that they would kill him or throw him overboard, and that he would lay one of them out anyhow, and so he had pot the axe and hid it, but I do not remember him saving where—he said that after he had hidden the axe he had got frightened, and then hid it outside the galley, which is abaft the lower bridge, and about 40 or 50 feet from where the blow was struck—the axe was underneath the steam case, and he would have access to it walking about the deck—he said that he passed the boy and myself two or three times; that once he stopped behind us for two or three seconds, and the boy took no notice of him: that he then went forward and watched us from outside the firemen's forecastle; that he then got the axe, and added, "You know the rest"—he always seemed to be very jealous if he saw the deceased talking to anybody else—I had been talking to the deceased for about forty minuses before this occurred—I was on duty, but he was not.</p>

Commercial Road—on Tuesday, April 26th, between 10 and 11 a.m., the prisoner called on me and told me he had got a customer for a good single stone diamond ring—I showed him a single stone ring, saying that the price was £41—he said that would do, and then asked me for a pair of diamond earrings—I told him I had not any in stock just then, but asked him to meet me at Layman's Sale Rooms the same day—he took away the diamond ring—at 12 a.m. I met him at the sale rooms and gave him the earrings, priced £30—he took them and said he would let me know in two or three hours—I did not see him until he called on me the next day between 7 and 8 p.m., and told me that he had left the two articles with the customer, and would let me know on Thursday afternoon, the 28th, without fail—on the 28th, in consequence of what my wife told me, I went to the prisoner between 3 and 3.30 p.m., and asked him what he had done with my two articles—he said he was very sorry, but that he had been robbed in the night time—I said, "How is it possible that you could be robbed when you said you had left them with a customer? How could you be robbed of my goods?"—he said, "If you do not believe it, you can do what you like"—I then went away, and I have not seen my jewellery since.</p>

You were robbed with my goods?"—he said, "Yes"—I could not understand that, and said, "Who was robbed, you or the customer, where you left the rings?"—he repeated that he was robbed—I said, "If you left the rings with the customer, and the customer would let you know by Thursday afternoon, how could you be robbed of my things? Come, show me the customer where you left the rings"—he said, "No, I am not going to show you my customers"—I said, "I want my rings"—he said, "Do what you like; lock me up if you can; I have given information to the police that I have been robbed; you cannot do nothing to me"—I said, "How were you robbed?"—he said, "I put everything in the safe and went to the music hall, and when I came home everything was gone"—I was not satisfied with the explana<lb/>tion,—and went to the police station and reported the matter.</p>

                  </hi> (280 H.) Early on June 4th I was in High Street;. Whitechapel, when something was said by the prosecutor, who pointed in the direction of the three prisoners and another man, whom I saw standing on the opposite side of the road—I walked towards them—they commenced walking, and then, all of a sudden, started running—I gave chase and blew my whistle—they turned down Mansell Street—at the corner of Mansell Street, O'Brien and Donovan turned and met me—I stopped them, and they both said, "What's the matter?"—I told them they would have to go back to. High Street, Whitechapel—they refused to go—I took O'Brien into custody—Donovan was taken by a constable who came from the</p>

I gave chase and blew my whistle—they turned into Mansell Street, except O'Brien and Donovan, who met us—I shouted, "That's two of them"—I saw two arrested—from the time I saw them I did not lose sight of the prisoners.</p>

What arc you taking me for?"—I said, "I will let you know when I get to the station"—the prisoner was detained at the station—I went back to Cable Street, and behind a stall outside No. 32 I picked up this fragment of a broken tumbler—the prisoner was charged, and the inspector asked him if he had any witnesses—he said, "Yes, I have myself"—previous to that, and after Trollope and Hubbard had spoken, he said, "I defy all what they say."</p>

               <p>this agreement followed (<hi rend="italic">Staling that a flat was arranged to be let to the prisoner at</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">per annum, payable quarterly in advance.</hi>)—I referred the matter to Mr. Williamson, who afterwards made a report to me—the prisoner never told me he was an undischarged bankrupt while he occupied the flat—I did not know it till the petition was filed in October, 1903—towards the end of 1900 the prisoner was in arrear for rent, including the rent due in advance, £50—he had paid one quarter—eventually we came to an arrangement by which I bought the furniture for £225 of the trades<lb/>man who supplied it, and by this agreement with the prisoner of January, 1901, I let him the fiat furnished at £100 for a year, renewable at his option—he remained in occupation eighteen months longer, which brings us to 1903, but he paid no rent—£120 was due to June, 1903—in May, 1903.I issued a writ for £100 for rent due for 1902, and obtained judgment—that not being paid, I was the petitioning creditor in the prisoner's bankruptcy—after that petition I received a communication, when it came to my knowledge that the prisoner had been bankrupt before—shortly afterwards I received a visit from him—he told me there was a previous bankruptcy, and that he did not want us, on his coming public examination, to say more than we could help; that if we did not he would pay us what he owed us, because his father had recently died, and he was interested under his will—I said I was in the hands of my solicitor.</p>

In August, 1903, I was living in Marylebone Road—I was then out of an engagement—one afternoon in that month I was near Oxford Circus—the prisoner spoke to me—I swear he is the man—he said he had seen me on one or two occasions before, and was desirous of making my acquaintance—that he had only five minutes to spare, would I kindly give him my address?—<hi rend="italic">silly like.</hi> I gave it to him—in the hurry I did not think there was any harm in it—about a week afterwards I received a letter in writing, like this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it had "Hotel Victoria" stamped on it—I have destroyed it—it said."Will call upon you at 4.30 in the afternoon to-morrow"—nobody came, but about six weeks afterwards the prisoner called and said, "You remember receiving a letter from the Hotel Victoria'"—I said I did. and asked him in, because he said he was interested in me. and would like to know something about me—I told him I was a housekeeper out of an engagement, but was looking for one—he said he had a large house in St. John's Wood, and wanted a housekeeper—I thought it was a good opportunity—he did not describe the house, except to say that he had a cook and a housemaid there—</p>

               <p>he said I should require sonic dresses, as I was then rather badly off for them—I was to get a tailor made dress—I cannot remember each one, hut he made a list in pencil—the writing was similar to this list, but the amount was different—I was to get the dresses at Madame Hayward's, in Bond Street—he said he thought that would be a nice place to go to, as he had got many dresses there, and was known there—he saw I had little ring on my finger, and asked whether I would like another—I said I should—he asked if the one I had on fitted me well—I said it did—he said he would take it for the measurement—ho did so—it had a design of a shamrock in the centre and three diamonds and a ruby on either side—it was worth about £4—I had had it for some time—he asked me what sort I would like, and I said a diamond and turquoise—he said it should be so, and that it would come from Streeter's in Bond Street—he wrote me out a cheque for the dresses for £74—it was similar to this docu<lb/>ment—he would not let me see it, but sealed it up in an envelope and addressed it to the Union of London Bank, Pall Mall—he would not let me sec the signature—I tried to sec it, and asked him if he would tell me what it was—I tried to look over his shoulder, but he put his arm up and said I was to take it just as it was to the bank—I saw that it was written on a half sheet of note paper which I gave him—I said, "Had not you better write it on a cheque form?"—he said, "Immediately they see my signature they will give you the money"—he took the ring off my finger; I did not give it to him—I cannot say if he did so before or after he wrote the cheque—I should not have let him take my ring away if I had not believed his story—I begged him to be careful not to lose it, because it was a present from my mother—he made a pretence to give it back to me, but did not do so—I let him take it away, as he promised to return it the following morning—next day I went to find the Union Bank in Pall Mall—I asked several policemen, but they said there was not one there; the nearest one was in Cockspur Street—I went there and presented the cheque—before that I had steamed the envelope open and looked inside, and then closed it—that is how I know it was like this cheque—I could not make the signature out—the cheque was not honoured at the bank—I never saw my ring again, and I did not see the prisoner until I picked him out of a number of other men, I believe, at Paddington Green police station, about April 23rd—I gave the police a description of the man who had swindled me.</p>

You come with me to my solicitors"—I said, "I have got somebody waiting for you here"—he tried to make off round the corner, but, of course, Mr. Ward came up and took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WARD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector.</hi>) I was present' at the police court when Grace Campbell gave her evidence in the presence of the prisoner—he had an opportunity of cross-examining her—she signed her deposition as well as the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">Deposition read</hi>): "I live at 123, Quebec Street, Wardour Street. I am single, and of independent means. In February I was in Albemarle Street. It was between February 24th and 28th, between 4 and 5 p.m. I had been to an office. As I was going away the prisoner spoke to me. I was quite alone. I had seen him before I went into the office in the Arcade, between Bond Street and Albemarle Street. As I came out he spoke to me in a most gentlemanly manner, He said, I have seen you somewhere before.' I said, 'Probably you have.' He said he had seen me in Scotland. I am Scotch. I asked him who he was. He said he was a friend of the Sassoons in Park Lane. He said he would like to take me out to lunch, and asked my name and address. I gave it to him. I told him I did not want my people to know I had done so. He said he did not want his to know either, as he was a great lord. He did not tell me what his nationality was. I had a letter next morning, which I at once tore up; it bore the address of the Albemarle Hotel, where the prisoner said he had stayed some months. It was in exactly the same printing as Exhibit 7. He called at the address I gave him, next day as I was finishing luncheon. The friend I was staying with came in for a moment while he was there. Prisoner only stayed a few minutes. He said he had a house at Abbey Road, St. John's Wood, with servants. He said he had a lady friend staying there, and asked me to take her place. I declined. I was wearing two diamond rings. He looked at them and said they were not good enough for me, and he would get ever so many grand rings from Streeter's in Bond Street for me. He asked to let him see my half hoop diamond ring for a pattern, and to how the size. I let him see it, and went and spoke to my friend in the next room. When I returned I did not want to part with it, and he gave it back to me. Eventually I let him take a plain gold ring which I told him had belonged to my mother. He said, 'You don't trust me.' I said, 'Well, I don't, for a gentleman does not usually ask a lady for a diamond ring to act as a pattern.' He took away the plain gold ring. It was worth about £1. He said I should have a great many dresses as a present, and I was to get them from Hayward's. in Bond Street. He wrote out a list of them on a piece of paper, and read it to me. He took one list away and left one with me, which I destroyed. The handwriting it was written in, was exactly similar to that on document marked 3, but my list was much more sumptuous, and the dresses were to cost £250. He wrote out a cheque for the amount, and said I was to take it as a present. It was on plain paper on the Union Bank, St. James's. He left it in an envelope sealed up. He told me not to touch it, but go to the Union Bank, St. James's Street, next morning. I destroyed that cheque directly he had gone. It was in exactly the same writing as that marked He told me to stay in till 6.30 p.m., because he would go to Streeter's and get my rings, and would send them to me by a commissionaire. I never received any ring nor my own back. I never took the cheque to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190406200076"/>
               <p>the bank. I never heard from him again. Last Saturday I picked the prisoner out from a great many other men. I have not a doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At first I believed in him, but when he asked for my ring I suspected him. I never thought the cheque was genuine. I never expected to see my ring back. When I saw him first I only talked to him for a few minutes. The interview at my friend's only lasted half an hour. He had a dark grey overcoat and patent leather boots on, a foulard tie, with a cheap pearl pin. I can identify the prisoner by his general appearance, back and front, from top to bottom. The men he was placed among were all younger than the prisoner. The man he called on me wore eyeglasses and a pair of gold <hi rend="italic">pince<lb/>nez</hi>"</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted.</hi>) In March I was living—at 4, Keppel Street—I recollect meeting a man in Oxford Street who asked if he might go home with me—he asked for a card; as I had not got one, I gave him my address—some days afterwards I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the man called next day, which was a Sunday—he said, "I am very rich, and have got plenty of money"—he wanted me to go to his house—I said, "I am married"—he said, "It makes no difference; I want you as a friend"—we spoke in English—he made out this list—he wrote this cheque for £140 to pay my debts—he said, "I am going to buy you a chain and a watch, and a pair of diamond earrings and a marquise ring"—he said, "Give me those earrings as a pattern"; he pointed to the ones I have on now—I said, "No, I cannot give you these; they belonged to my mother, who is dead"—he borrowed £2 from me—I told him it was given me by my husband—he did not say what he wanted the £2 for—I picked him out at the police court—the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a restaurant at 35, Oxford Street, and have known the prisoner for two and a half years as Adolph Michael Beck—he constantly came in as a customer, and had his meals there—after I ad known him for about six months he asked me if I would allow his letters to be addressed to my place—I said "Yes"—they came addressed to Adolph Beck, except on one occasion, when it was Michael Adolph Beck—he said he was engaged in the City as a commission agent—he had reakfast at my restaurant and sometimes lunch, but not lately, and every evening he had dinner—for the first few months he paid every day, then he told me he was rather short, and I said, "I have no objection; you can go on and pay me whenever you can"—at present he owes me between £40 and £50—I remember some time before April the police coming and speaking to me at my Holborn shop—I saw the prisoner the same day—I did not then mention that the police had been to me—on April 4th, when he came to my place about 8 a.m., he said that when he went to his hotel the night previous somebody told him that the police were after him, and that the proprietor would not allow him to sleep there any longer—he was then sleeping at the Percy Hotel, Percy Street—I said, "I do not think there is anything against you, because the police came to my place, and Inspector Ward said there was nothing against you"—I think the prisoner said, "I am not going to be looked upon as a dishonest man; I had better leave; I shall look out for a room, and I shall leave"—he said he wanted to be free and easy, and did not want to be locked up—he said he moved to 7 or 9, South Crescent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He asked me who the police officer was, and I showed him Ward's card—he asked me to go to the station with him, which I did on Easter Monday—there were several constables there, but Ward as out, so I made an appointment to meet him at 2.30 that afternoon—I saw him about the prisoner's case—the prisoner was not there then, but he afterwards asked me. "Have you been up there?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What did he say?"—I said, "He had nothing against you, but only wanted to know where you lived"—when the prisoner moved, to South Crescent I believe he left his address with me—I knew his address all the time he used my house—I was quite willing to give him credit—I am not complaining that he swindled me; he always paid me before—I remember Miss Scott coming to my restaurant one evening—the prisoner was there having some tea, I believe—he was there for about one and a half hours while she was there—I noticed that she was looking at the table where the prisoner and I were sitting—she was looking at him; there was othing to prevent her seeing him—I believe that was on March 21st, but I am not sure.</p>

South Crescent and took possession of his effects—I made a list of the things; it contains prince nez keys, a box containing visiting cards, pawn tickets, hair dye, two pocket books, an overcoat, a washing book, and some memoranda in this envelope—on April 23rd I placed the prisoner with twelve other men at the police court; some were about his own age, some older, and some younger—I told him he was about to be put up for identification, and that he could stand where he liked—he chose his position, standing with his back to the window—he was going to take off his coat—I told</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting at Bath House, Holborn Viaduct—I have practised for about twenty years, and have given evidence for the Treasury and others, hundreds of times—I have seen the Exhibits in this case—I have compared the lists of dresses, cheques, and letters addressed to the witnesses with the telegrams and envelopes proved to be in the prisoner's writing—to the best of my belief, the writing on those Exhibits is the studiously disguised writing of the same person who wrote the five proved Exhibits—some of the disguised writing is written backwards, some of it straight, and most of it is' dis<lb/>torted in such a way as to suggest that it is intentionally disguised—I see in it a number of peculiarities which I see in the proved writing—I should say the handwriting belongs to the Scandinavian group, Norwegian or Danish—I have occasion to study manuscripts of foreigners, and I have noticed the it and f's of that writing—I have also compared the dis<lb/>guised writing with a pocket book found at the prisoner's lodging—almost all the writing in that book is the same as that which appears on the telegrams, and it is the same writing as the other Exhibits, only they re disguised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The pocket book supplied me with a great deal more material—the style of writing is foreign—I do not think there is any instance in the disguised writing where it is absolutely natural except by. inadvertence—I think it was all intended to be disguised—all the capital P's in the telegrams have the same peculiarity—the umbrella part goes through the main stroke—in the disguised writing there are eight P's, and in most of them one sees the same peculiarity—there are many dif<lb/>ferences in the writing, but, to the best of my belief, they are not material.</p>

I am the wife of George Crudear, of 21, Star Street, Plaistow—we rent the whole of the house—I know the prisoner—he came to lodge there with the deceased, whom I knew as Mrs. Cooper, about the end of October, 1903—they occupied the front room on the first floor—they moved in on a Friday night, and the prisoner went to sea on the following Tuesday—he is a fireman on board ship—the deceased remained in possession of the room—I think the prisoner was away a month—from October to March he was at my house from time to time—he went away on different voyages—the deceased remained at my house all the time—the prisoner last came back from sea about March, and remained for about six weeks—he did no work during that time—he borrowed money from me to keep himself—he paid nothing during that time—he gave me no security—he had borrowed from me before, and repaid me when he came back from sea—he had done that ever since he lived at my house—he owed me £7 at the time of the deceased's death—that was lent to him and to her—after the prisoner came back in March the deceased remained at the house for three weeks, when she went away—she was away for three weeks, all but a day—on Easter Monday. April 4th. before she went away, they had a few words, but made it up again—I do not remember anything he said about her—I remember a summons coming, which I gave to him—he brought the deceased back to the house on Sunday night. May 1st—this happened on Thursday, May 5th—she continued to live at the house till the 5th—I did not notice anything between them during that time—on the 3rd the prisoner told me he had signed on a boat to go away for eight months—I saw them both on the 4th in their room—they seemed to be on friendly terms—they remained indoors—they were both sober—I went to bed about 11 p.m.—the de<lb/>ceased woke me up at 5.45 a.m. by screaming out, "Mrs. Crudear, Mrs.</p>

On April 25th I was outside the West Ham police court about 11.30 a.m.—the deceased and Hart came up to me—the prisoner was on the opposite side of the road—the deceased made a complaint to me and pointed to the prisoner—I gave her certain advice—she went into the clerk's office of the Court—she came out again and came up to me—the prisoner was still on the opposite side of the road—as the deceased came up to speak to me the prisoner, from the opposite side of the road, said, "That is right; I will settle you"—he said that loud enough for me to hear—the deceased then made a statement to me—another constable crossed towards the prisoner, who went away, and the two women went in another direction—I made a plan of the premises at 21, Star Street, Canning Town, showing the furniture as pointed out to me.</p>

                  </hi> (115 <hi rend="italic">K.</hi>) About 5.55 a.m. on May 5th I was called by William Crudear to 21, Star Street—I went there with Rose—we went to the front room on the first floor—I had to use force to open the door—when I got in I found that the prisoner's feet were against the door; he was lying on the floor, his head being away from the door—the deceased was also lying on the floor, and the prisoner had his head and shoulders on her left thigh—he had his shirt and trousers on, and a leather belt or strap—the deceased was dressed in a chemise and a bead necklace—I saw that both their throats were cut—there was blood on her face and head and down to her bust—there was also a great deal of blood on the floor—I sent for a doctor immediately—I pulled the deceased out into tin* light and laid her on her back, and put a pillow under her head, so as to close the wound in her throat—I saw there was not much chance of saving her—the prisoner began to move—Rose and I went to him, and I rendered first aid by putting a towel in water and binding his throat up—I left him and went to the deceased again—just then the doctor arrived, and I loft the deceased in his care—the prisoner was lying at the deceased's foot. Mr. Gill <hi rend="italic">proposed to ask the witness what the deceased had said. Mr. Ward objected on the grounds that the statement was not with regard to what was taking place, but what had taken place; that it was not a dying declaration, and that the prisoner was not in a position to deny the charges, as he was unable to speak, his windpipe being cut, although he could under<lb/>stand what was taking place, and was therefore in exactly the same position</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">as though he was absent altogether, when anything said against him would not be evidence, and that although he did not deny the charges at the time, he did so afterwards. (Reg. v. Mitchell and Reg. v. Smith</hi>, 17 <hi rend="italic">Cox; Reg. v. Beddingfield</hi>, 14 <hi rend="italic">Cox.</hi>) Mr. Justice Grantham said that the very fad of the prisoner denying the charges afterwards made the statement evidence, and ruled that it was admissible the deceased said, "He done it with a razor; he put his fingers in and tore it out"—the doctor was attending to her then—I made a note of what she said as soon as I had washed my hands and after the prisoner was removed—when the deceased said that, the prisoner was lying on her feet—I noticed that his eyes were following us about the room—immediately after' '"he statement Rose crossed over to him, and, with his assistance, I too-v the prisoner down stairs—he was put on an ambulance, with a view to his going to the hospital—I went up stairs and saw Dr. Holton with this razor, which he handed to Inspector Fowlers—I did not see where it was taken from—the doctor had it in his possession when I went back to the room—I was present when the deceased died, just before we took the prisoner away—after she had made the statement about the razor she said to the doctor, "I am dying," and she died soon afterwards—when I had assisted to take the prisoner down stairs I saw this hammer (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) lying between the bed and the wall—I picked it up and gave it to Fowles—when I first saw it there was no blood upon it, but there was blood on the head of the bed nearest the wall, also blood on the wall near the head of the bed, some on the foot of the bed, and some on the wall by the foot of the bed; also smears of blood on the inside of the door, and corresponding splashes on the wall nearly as high as the door, and at the foot of the bed on the right side of the room there was a pool of blood, which the deceased was lying in—I first heard the prisoner speak about 10.30 that night, when I went to the hospital to keep observa<lb/>tion on him—he said, "How is that woman? is she dead?"—I said, "Turn over and go to sleep."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had no boots on—I am positive the deceased said, "He <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with a razor; he put his fingers in and tore it out"—Rose was kneeling by her right side—I should think he heard what she said—I was standing with one leg on either side of her—Rose was in as good a position to hear what she said as I was—I do not know if Rose said that she said, "And pulled it out;" if he has said it I should think he is wrong—the only appearance of a struggle in the room was that the bed had been pushed out from the wall at the foot, and the floor looked as if two people had forced themselves between the bed and the wall—the blood on the hammer came from my hands.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practise at 206, Barking Road, Plaistow—at 6 a.m. on May 5th I was called to 21, Star Street—I found the prisoner and the deceased lying on the floor of the first floor room—the deceased was then alive—there was a good deal of blood about the room—I attended to the deceased first—she said, "He <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—that is all I remember being said then—I asked her age; she told me—a little later she complained of pain in her back; then she said, "I want to do something"—I told her to lie as quiet as possible while I attended to her wounds—I took no note of what was said when the deceased said, "He <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it"—I think the prisoner could hear, and was sensible—the deceased had several wounds about her face and neck, and a very deep wound at the back of her left ear—she died about twenty minutes after my arrival—she said, "I am dying," and died very shortly afterwards—the prisoner was suffering from an incised wound in his throat—it was above his windpipe, and did not sever or penetrate it—I made some re<lb/>mark to him, but he simply shook his head—he was frothing at the mouth, and was in a very low state—it was not the injury itself which prevented him speaking, but the exhaustion following on the injury—I cannot say how his voice would appear immediately after the injury, but after the struggle which he had apparently had it would be husky—I only found one wound upon him—when he was lifted up to be taken down stairs I saw a razor which had been lying under him—I was shown a hammer—on May 7th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the deceased at the mortuary. Canning Town—she was a tall, powerful woman—there were a number of wounds upon her—she had two superficial wounds on her fhroat, and one down to the windpipe, between the thyroid membrane and the thyroid cartilage—the second wound had notched the cartilage itself, and looked as if it had been bruised—a sharp instrument would have causeil them, such as a razor—one of them looked as if it had been rubbed or torn, or something inserted into it—there was a large bruise over her left eyebrow and one along the left side of the face, extending from the lip to the angle of the jaw—there were also several smaller scratches and wounds about her face, and a small one across her chin—there was a large wound over her right temple right down to the bone—it looked more jagged, as if some violence had been applied to it after it had been inflicted—any pulling or tearing would cause it—there was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190406200095"/>
               <p>wound at the back of her left ear, which may have been caused by a sharp instrument or a blow, and two slight scratches on her left ear—there was an effusion of blood under the scalp where the wounds were—there was a large bruise on her left breast, about 3—in. by 2 in., and a smaller one over her right breast—blows would most probably cause those—there were bruises on the middle of her left arm, and three or four on her shoulder—there was a cut along her left forefinger on the outer side and a scratch at the back of her left hand—there were five small wounds on her right thumb, such as might be caused by a razor—assuming the prisoner had had the wound inflicted upon him by somebody else, I do not think he was in a position to carry on a struggle which would have inflicted all these wounds on the deceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not see how the deceased could have been wounded in this way if she held the razor in her hand—I think it is possible that the struggle could have taken place after the prisoner was injured—I was with the deceased from the time I entered the room till some time after she died, and could hear what she said—I did not hear her say anything about fingers being put into her throat or wounds—the prisoner's wind<lb/>pipe was not severed—he could not speak on account of his injury and the exhaustion following it—I signed my deposition, and it was read over to me—it says, "He could not speak because of the several'. of the wind<lb/>pipe"; it was meant for "throat"—I cannot remember saying "I found lie had had a deep cut across his throat, and as far as the eye could judge, it had penetrated the windpipe"—I only examined the prisoner in a cursory way—he did not reply to me; I do not think he could on account of his collapsed state—I was in the room for ten or twelve minutes—I did not go to him at first; it was only in the interval of attending to the deceased that I went to him—the injuries to the deceased were consistent with a certain amount of struggling—I do not know how the body was taken away—the usual way is on an ambulance—when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination I remarked that there was some bruising about some of the wounds, but I did not hear of the statement the deceased is said to have made that the prisoner tore at the wounds until the following Monday—the two wounds on the deceased's temple and in her throat were in exactly the same state—the condition of the wound on her temple might have been caused by somebody putting a finger into the wound and rubbing it about—if she had fallen on anything after she had the cut it might have had the same result—I do not think her wounds could have all been caused by herself—some of them may have been the result of a struggle—the wound above her left ear may have been the result of a fall—I do not think that would apply to the wound over her temple—it was caused by some sharp instrument—it is possible that the wounds in her throat were self inflicted—I do not think that half the cuts might have been self inflicted—the two grazes on her left ear were just as if a knife had very lightly touched her—a fall would not cause them—if two people were struggling with a razor it might cause a jagged wound if it got near the face of one of them, but not so deep a wound as the one in the de<lb/>ceased's temple—it may have been caused in a struggle, but violence</p>

               <p>was necossary—the wound on the deceased's left cheek was undoubtedly caused in a struggle, and I think also the two cuts on the chin—the wound in the front of her throat might have been self inflicted—the smaller bruises looked as if they were linger marks—some of them may have been caused in a struggle.</p>

I got up and put an old pair of trousers on. While I was putting the trousers on she cut her own throat. I then tried to get the razor away, and there was a struggle. In the course of the struggle she said, "I mean putting you away for the b——lot," and then began to shout for Mrs. Crudear. I did not murder her, and I am quite innocent of this charge. I wish for legal assistance at my trial, and I have not the means for providing the same for myself."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, East Hill, Wandsworth, with my parents—I have two brothers, named Henry and Teddy—I have known the prisoner fourteen months—he is a second division clerk in the Civil Service—we had been walking out together—we were not for<lb/>mally encagod—on May 2nd I received this letter: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "4, Spanish Road, Wandsworth Common, Monday morning. Miss Thwaites—After your conduct yesterday it would be advisable for us to part. No doubt you will be surprised that I should suggest parting, but I have at last come to the conclusion that if we were joined together life would be an everlasting source of misery to me. This does not mean that my love for you has diminished in any way. No, on the contrary, I still love you with all my heart and soul, as I have always done and will continue to do, even though we part. But I cannot start again, and cannot endure your company any longer at present. I may, however, return to you some day. As you are well aware, for the last few weeks you have done nothing but annoy me—could anyone endure such treatment? No, certainly not! One minute you call me your 'love,' 'pet,' or 'darling,' and the next minute you say you don't care for me at all. You are an extraordinary girl. You know very well that all that was necessary to part us was a good quarrel, and you did your best to cause that quarrel. For the last two or three weeks, whenever you have roused my anger, instead of letting 'sleeping dogs lie,' you have kept on taunting me and made me all the angrier. Do you call that even 'friendship?' When you see you have angered me you should let my wrath cool down again. But you don't do that; you make it worse. After all I have done for you, I think you might find some other way of showing your gratitude. You say that I go out with you for the sake of making you presents. All your statement amounts to is this, that I go out with you to give you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190406200103"/>
               <p>presents with some object in view. In other words, the presents are to be so much soft soap. Is it a decent thing for any girl to tell her lover such a thing? Is it proper for you to imply that I go out with you for the sake or obtaining the opportunity to misconduct myself with you? That is what you mean. This I shall never forget as long as I live. That a girl who once professed to love me should so under estimate my character as to impute such a thing to me, is almost unreasonable. Neither shall I forget that you suspected me of stealing your gloves and card. Such is your opinion of me Now for my opinion of you. Much as I have loved you, I have not failed to notice that when I am taking you any<lb/>where, or about to give you something, you are very nice to me; at other times you are just so-so. In other words, for the last fourteen months you have only gone out with me for the sake of what I could give you. You can't deny that. You have no more heart than a sparrow. No. not even that much. A girl like you deserves to be left an old maid all her life. A Greek philosopher once said that 'Woman was a fraud, and should be kept at the bottom of the garden in a rabbit hutch.' He had evidently <hi rend="italic">had some.</hi> But to come to the point. We are going to part, so you will carry out my wishes of a previous letter to you—namely, you will return absolutely everything I have ever given you in any shape or form. Fur, gloves (one old and two new pairs), handkerchiefs (four), two photo; 'one of myself and one of savings bank), boxes (glove and handker<lb/>hief with keys), albums, pearls, scent bottle (cards), letters (this one included), and everything I have ever given you except the note paper and envelopes. You will deliver these to me at my door at half past nine in a parcel. I shall expect you, and will return your swish, photos (big and little), cigarette case, and all your letters and cards. I must have my photo. You may either take it out of the frame or give it to me in the frame for 2s. 6d., the price you paid for the frame. But I must have it. If you don't want me, you don't want my photo to scoff at after I have left you. You will return absolutely everything. Bring them here at 9.30 p.m. Why I name this time is because I shall be in then, and want to say good bye to you. You need not be afraid; I shall not touch you, or try to get you to let me stay. I simply wish to say good bye to you; that is all. I think I deserve that much. If you call for me at 9.30 p.m., I can wait at our door for you while you bring the things round, as you cannot bring them at the one time. When you hand me these I will return you your presents, and will also give you your 2s. 6d. for the photo frame. Expecting to see you at 9.30, I remain, my lost love, your broken-hearted Bertie, one whom you once called your little love. You have a little ornament over your mantelpiece that I gave you full of chocolates to give to Johnny or La Roche as a present. You have two. but I only gave you one, I forget which. Don't forget to return it.—Bertie."—the prisoner gave me that letter on May 2nd as I was going to business—I did not read it till dinner time—I took his presents to 4, Spanish Road in the evening—he said I had not given him all—I said, "I have, except your photo, and that I will give you on Wednesday night"—he said he would come down on Tuesday morning—he did not say why he was coming</p>

               <p>—he came on Tuesday night—I did not sec him at 9.30—on the Wednes<lb/>day morning early I was in bed at my home—I woke up about four and see a hat appear behind the door—I called out "Bert"—the prisoner came into the room—I could not see if he had anything in his hand, it was all in darkness—I made a rush for the door—I succeeded in getting out—I could not get the next room door open quick enough, so I ran up stairs to my brother's room, screaming—my brother came down—I then found that my nose and neck were cut, but I did not feel it hurting me—I did not feel myself being cut—I had two cuts on my fingers—there is a scar on my nock and a mark on my nose now—the prisoner had no key to our house—I think he got in at the lavatory window—he had never come into the house with a key—I never asked him to get me a revolver, or knew anything about his getting me one.</p>

My own darling Phyllis,—Just a line to let you know I have done as you requested me. I sent a P.O. for 6s. 6d. to Gamage's for the revolver and fifty cartridges. If they send them you must be careful with them. You say Henry wants it. I cannot see what he requires a revolver for. I hope that it is not yourself that wants it, for you remember that you once threatened to shoot me. Accept best love, from your loving Bertie." "Tuesday. My own darling Phylis,—It would be advisable before giving you this re<lb/>volver and cartridges for you to make me a written statement that you intend it for Henry, as he requires one, and not for my poor head; for it would seem rather silly of me to hand you the revolver in order that you might shoot me with it. If Gamage's send it, before you receive it from me you must make a solemn declaration on paper. When I am fully satisfied that you axe telling the truth, then you shall have it. If Henry and I were on speaking terms, I should ask him; but I do not wish to speak to him. Let me have your written statement by to-morrow night; then when you call round with my photo, as you have promised, I will give it to you, and show you how to load it, so that you can show Henry. Lest anything should come of all this revolver business, I have burnt all your notes on the subject, and request you to do the same with mine, for fear that you or I may be dragged into some <hi rend="italic">rumpus.</hi> Good bye, my darling, for the present. Excuse this hurried scribble, and accept best love from your darling Bertie. P.S.—On second thoughts I think you need not make a written statement. When you see me to-morrow night simply swear on oath to me that what you say is true. That will be sufficient, dearest.—B." "Friday evening. My darling Phyllis,—I am greatly surprised at your imprudent way of writing letters, and also at the con<lb/>tents of the one just received. My darling, fancy you threatening to shoot me 'through the head,' and putting your threat on paper. I think you forget yourself at times. I have only to show your letter at the police station, and you would have the police after you very soon. Needless to say, I have burnt your note, knowing as I do how you make use of many strange expressions when in a temper. You must be more prudent, my love. I have no wish to quarrel with you, although we parted last night ill friends. It would be very advisable for you to burn this note. I really am not sure whether to take your threat as meant, or whether to let it slip by as an outburst of temper. However, my darling, I shall keep my eyes open. With best love, from your loving Bertie."</p>

He struck me when I was lying in my bunk, and challenged me to fight. Wow went in the bottom of the boat, and he struck at me, but missed me. He then said, 'Come out on the bank, and have it out there.' I got on the bank, but he would not come. I then got back on to the boat and struck him, and he fell in the river. I jumped in after him, but could not find him"—his clothes were wet to just above his boots—the water is about 7 feet deep there; it was high tide.</p>

About ten o'clock to-night I was lying on the side of the bed when he came and struck me twice in the mouth, and challenged me to fight.

I am at present attached to the Seamen's Hospital—on May 20th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the deceased, in conjunction with Dr. Rose, who is now seriously ill and unable to attend to his work—the external appearances of the deceased's body were those of a well nourished man; there were no injuries except a slight abrasion on the upper part of the cheek, which was pro<lb/>bably caused after death, probably in the dragging—the air passages contained water and frothy mucus, which would be from the drowning—the heart was quite normal—the stomach contained water and a very lurge amount of food—all the appearances coincided with drowning—there was no smell of liquor—a large amount of water would destroy the signs of spirits—the cause of death was drowning—Dr. Rose agrees with me in that opinion.</p>
