A Publick House, in King-Street, Westminster; I set down with the Landlady's Sister in a Box, about half an Hour, upon which I heard some Words arise between two Soldiers, and the Deceas'd swore that he had won the Game; the other ( the Prisoner at the Bar ) swore that he had not won it fair, and insisted upon its being play'd over-again, the other swore he would not; upon that he came out of the Box, the Prisoner at the Bar insisted that he would not pay, the other Man (the Deceas'd) came out to him, and swore he should pay it; with that they had a great many Words, at last the Deceas'd was in a great Passion, stripp'd into his Shirt, swore he would fight him if he did not pay it. Said the Prisoner, I will have a Knock with you over the Table; the Prisoner did not seem to be willing to go into the House to fight; so after a great many Words, at last they put their Clothes on again, for the People of the House said there should be no Fighting in the House; with that Words arose again, and the Deceas'd swore he would have the Pint of Beer, and call'd for it; the Prisoner at the Bar said he would not pay for it; with that the Deceas'd stripp'd his Clothes off again, and struck the Prisoner at the Bar, and swore he would have the Beer, and in a vast Passion, very forward to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090004"/> fight, he call'd this Man a great many Names because he would not pay, and struck him once or twice, and the Prisoner did not return it, and did not seem to be free to fight with him; but after a great many Words, and many Provocations, the Deceas'd struck him again; at last the Prisoner at the Bar said, I can't fight against four or five of you, or else I should not be afraid to take a Knock or two with you; so the Corporal said, don't make such a Noise here, but if you have a mind to fight, go out, and no Man shall stir out here. The Corporal said to the Prisoner, I will give you five Shillings if any Man comes out to give you any soul Play. After many Provocations the Prisoner at the Bar said I'll go out and take a Knock or two with you, if I have fair Play; so they went out at the Back-Door and went up to Downing's-Court there to fight; I not being concern'd about it, but hearing all that pass'd I had the Curiosity to go out at the Street Door to see how the Battle would go; I might be about 30 Yards behind them: I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw his Coat and Waistcoat off; they were just set to it, they made two or three Blows at one another; presently the Prisoner gave the other a Trip and he tumbled down; tumbling down he did not offer to get up again; so he not offering to get up, the Prisoner at the Bar said, if you will have any more of it get up; with that he gave him a little Pull by the Hand, and it seem'd as if the Man was afraid to get up again; but I saw he began to work at the stomach, and began to heave and froth at the Mouth; and I believe died in ten Minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was you from them?</p>
               <p>Thornhill. Please you, my Lord, I was as near as the Door.</p>

               <p>Terry. I keep a Publick-House just facing this House; I was coming out to make Water? I saw the Prisoner at the Bar and the Deceas'd, they were both stripp'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not in the House?</p>
               <p>Terry. No, my Lord; but when I came up to them I believe there was four or five Blows between them both; I believe a Boy of twelve or fourteen Years of Age could have given a greater Blow than either of them: The Deceas'd fell backward; when he was down the Prisoner at the Bar put his Hand to his Breast, and said, take a good Heart and get up again. Coming back I saw the Landlady of the House at the Back Door, who said to me, Did you see it? Yes, I said, I believ'd it was all over. The Girl came back presently after me and said, the Man is dead, and he was brought down.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him dead.</p>

Agnew's; the brown Ducape Gown was taken out of a Box she broke open, where she took the Things express'd in the Indictment. On Sunday we made the greatest Search we could to know what Part of the Town she was gone into; on Monday we heard of her being in several Places in the City; on Tuesday Morning I went to Capt. Agnew's Servant, and we took her in a Garret in Clare Market, at a Shoemaker's.</p>

I told him to go away, but in the Afternoon he came again: I said Friend, I would have you go away, for I shall certainly secure you. I did not see him go, but the other Evidence, May, stopp'd him at the Corner of Darken-Lane; he took from him two Hands of Tobacco; I told May to let him go, what signified a Couple of Hands of Tobacco; but he said that was not all, for there was more with that; we took more out of his Breeches, which is in all 3 lb.</p>

               <p>Rawlins. Yes, my Lord, for some Years. My Lord, upon the 4th of March last, about Noon, Mr. Maschil detected him in stealing some Tobacco, and he ran away, and threw out of his Hand two or three Hands of Tobacco.</p>

               <p>Rawlins. In Botolph Wharf Gateway, and down Cock's Key Gateway. The Prisoner slung out of his Pocket the Quantity of three or four Hands; and after that, when Mr. Maschil had carried him to the Compter, he ask'd me to go down that Gateway, and said, Perhaps we shall find some Tobacco; With that altogether, there was about 2 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this Tobacco lie?</p>
               <p>Rawlins. Upon the Wharf, it was to be shipp'd off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was only about to take a little to put into my Mouth, and a Hand came out.</p>

               <p>Hoskins. Please you, my Lord, I know nothing of the Man; I never see him with my Eyes before this Time: The Woman I have seen; she came to my House; I keep a Publick House. She ask'd me if I would buy a Silver Pint Mug; I told her, I never dealt in Silver, nor never intended it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. The Creature (So I may call her) she wanted to bring me into a Premunire. My Husband, please you my Lord, was asleep; he had been a Journey, and he did not awake at this Time. She said, I wish you would be so good as to buy the Mug, or let me have a Trifle upon it. I refus'd it; she said she was not in a Dress fit to go out with it, and said, will you please to let your Girl go out to any of your Acquaintance, to borrow as much as they can upon it; so the Girl agreed to go, and ask'd what she must borrow upon this Mug; the Prisoner said she might borrow 20 s. if she could; but they would not give her any thing unless I would come; I went, and told them the People were at my House, and so they gave 30 s. for the Mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say.</p>
               <p>Hoskins. My Lord, there were 18 s. deliver'd into her Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the People by the Mug again?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. When the Prisoner receiv'd the 18 s. she said it would get him his Coat, or something, for she believ'd he was in Confinement; these Words dropping, gave me a Suspicion; I got the 18 s. again, and went directly with my Servant to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090012"/> Pawnbroker's for the Mug, and no Use was paid for it.</p>

               <p>Swannick. The Boy told me his Mother was in want: When I went first into the Place, that Woman ask'd me if I could get any Thing of my Master to make her amends for lying in their House, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Steward. Yes, my Lord; they were my Husband's to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these Goods lost?</p>
               <p>Steward. They were lost between the last Day of October and the 7th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in what Manner were they lost? How came you to suspect that the Prisoner took them?</p>
               <p>Steward. Because, my Lord, I left her in the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you carry on any Business there?</p>
               <p>Steward. She (the Prisoner) came to lie with me, either in the Latter End of May, or the Beginning of July; a Neighbour brought her to lay with me, and I could never get her away; but I never saw any of her Money. In the latter End of October last I went to Hall, to meet my Husband, as he is a Sea-faring Man; she (the Prisoner) comes in with a Paper in her Hand, and said, I have a Paper come up from Cornwall, to make you easy and myself too. I said, I shall be gone before Saturday Night; and I said to Mrs. Brown, I have serv'd you before now, and oblig'd you; Now will you oblige me, in looking after my House while I am gone, as my Maid is so young; I said, if it suited her Convenience? She promis'd she would. I gave her 10 s. and said, Will that be enough 'till that Time you have your Money? I went away that very Night. The next Day after that I was gone, Mr. Canedy and his Wife return'd, (they had been out of Town, and use to lodge with me) she said to them, the Case was alter'd, and she put the Man and his Wife upon a Flock Bed, and gave them nothing to eat. The Prisoner refus'd to let them have the Bed they us'd to lie on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not hear from the Prisoner all this Time?</p>
               <p>Steward. I had two Letters, and no more, and very kind ones they were. When my Husband and I came home, we were surpriz'd to see the House in such Distraction; and she has been an Instrument of making a Difference between me and my Husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Steward. Yes, and desir'd her to tell me where my Goods were. At last she own my Crape Gown and some other Things were pawn'd, and some carried out for fear of Fire.</p>
               <p>Court. According to the State of Things this appears only to be a Breach of Trust. We believe, good Woman, you have been very much wrong'd, and the Prisoner is open to the Law, but not to a criminal Prosecution.</p>

I advertis'd the Spoon, and several People came, but none came up to the Marks of it: After that I saw an Advertisement of Mr. Woodifield's. I went to Mr. Woodifield's with the two Spoons, and Mr. Woodifield compar'd them with some other Spoons, and we match'd the Silversmith's Mark; we compar'd them with some other Spoons of theirs, and found that they tallied exactly. I describ'd the Person I had them of; they said he came to their House very often. The same Day he came again; upon that they stopp'd him, and he own'd he took the Spoon, and said it was pure Necessary put him upon it. When he went before the Justice, he own'd the same, and seem'd very ignorant of the Nature of the Crime.</p>
               <p>Court. That's the Spoon you are sure you had from this Man?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, tell him, is his Time to make his Defence, and call any Witnesses if he can.</p>
               <p>Interpreter. My Lord, he says the Gentleman that keeps the Tavern in Pall-Mall would speak for him, and that several would have appear'd for him, if they had known of his Trial coming on.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor gave the Man a very good Character, and believ'd it was mere Necessity, that he had a sick Wife, &amp;c. and he offer'd to take him into his House himself.</p>

             had endeavoured to throw it upon several of my Servants, in order to excuse himself. In examining him about the Piece of Cloth that he had carried out, I ask'd him how he came by that Cloth; he said he had bought it of an Irish Merchant's Servant about a Month before, and he had it away about a Week before, and I asked him whether he could produce the Piece of Cloth; he said he could. After he produced the Cloth, I asked him how it came to have my Mark upon it; then he said it was a Piece of Cloth that he bought of me a Twelve-month ago.</p>

               <p>Leigh. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. And I suppose he might have had more.</p>
               <p>Leigh. He might have had any Quantity, because we never restrain any Body.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you say you don't believe he would have paid you for it? Did he say that he had stole it? that he had taken it out of the House, contrary to his Duty, and what he ought not to do? Did he confess before the Justice that he had stole it?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Yes, he did confess, Sir; he would not confess any Thing else but this. I found the Pound of Thread, and I found Part of the Cloth in his Box. I found this in Mrs. Morris's House [The Piece of Cloth produced in Court ] We ask'd him if he had taken it out of the House in an unlawful Manner.</p>

I came down, and a Person I saw in the Street said I had left my Door open; whe n I came down there was no Fire, nor no Appearance of Washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the Girl in the House.</p>
               <p>Russel. No. I went up and told my Wife; she ask'd me if I saw any Thing missing; I miss'd several Things. Then I consulted what I should do, as the Girl could not be found; I went to a Broker's and discover'd some of the Things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you discover?</p>
               <p>Russel. I discover'd two Caps and a Shirt. I went about to a great many Places, and heard no more of them 'till Ten o'Clock; a Broker came to me, and he stopp'd the Girl by offering a Cap of my Wife's. When I came to the Pawnbroker's I saw it was the Girl that was with me: She had a Woman with her, and another in the Street.</p>

            . The 13th of March last the Person was brought to me, (the Prisoner at the Bar) but there is a vast Alteration; for she was then dress'd vastly clean. She brought to my Shop one Gown, an Apron, and a Piece of Stuff-Damask, and there was another Woman with her. She wanted 12 s. for it, I told her I could not lend her so much upon it; then when she came again I ask'd her whether they were her own, and she said they were her Sister's.</p>

            , to whom he was a Journeyman. Gentlemen, the Facts we have to lay before you are all Circumstances, and seem to be such as we cannot err in, when they are laid all together. There is nothing of a positive Proof, neither was he taken in Means, as the Law calls it, in having any Goods found upon him; but as 'tis on Circumstances the Affair entirely depends, I shall submit it to the Court, whether they are so satisfactory as to convince you that this is the Man who robb'd his Master. As the Case is represented to me, by Mr. Appleby, Brasier, in Harp-Alley, the Prisoner's Bed, Gentlemen, was placed in the Shop, pretty near a little Room by the Parlour; it lies so near the Doors that 'tis impossible for any one to make the least Noise without waking the Person who lies in that Bed. On Friday Night, the 21st of March, young Mr. Appelby coming home very late, between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock, he look'd about, as he commonly does, to see if all Things were safe, and at that Time they were so. His Father and Mother lay up one Pair of Stairs and his Sisters up three; young Mr. Appelby's Room was up two Pair of Stairs, and only this Servant on the Ground Floor, who was suppos'd to be in Bed close by the Parlour. Some time after Twelve the Watchmen beat their respective Rounds, when the Door was safe, and continued so 'till a little after Four, at which Time the Watchman discover'd it open and went into the Shop, who, seeing the Prisoner at the Bar, ask'd him the Meaning of it; oh, says he, nothing at all, a small Matter, I suppose some of the Family are gone out; though, as the Door had been open'd, it could not be done without his Privity; but he shuts the Door again and takes no other Notice of of it. When the Porter came in the Morning, as usual, to open the Shop, he went into the Parlour and discover'd the Escrutore had been forced open: Afterwards, upon searching the Prisoner's Box, an old Nailpiercer, newly fil'd up, was found, which appear'd to be a very proper Instrument for forcing those Locks and Holts. If any Stranger, Gentlemen, had done this, 'tis extreamly odd that the Servant, intrusted in the Family, should take no Notice of it, not alarm them. There is another Circumstance, viz. a cross, crabbed Dog, as surly perhaps as any in Town, which this Brazier keeps for the Safety of his Shop, and will hardly suffer any Stranger to come into the Shop in the Day Time, and much less in the Evening, without giving an Alarm; and this Dog was then within the House. The Master of the Family, the four Daughters and Son were also within. These can hardly be suppos'd to be Partners with the Man in robbing the House, there being no Maid Servant there at this time. The Noise that must have been made by the Violence us'd in the forcing the Place where the Plate was secur'd, could not but awake any one who lay so near, unless he had been so found asleep as not to be awakened even by the Noise of a Gun. Gentlemen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090023"/> this is the Nature of the Case, and the Question is, whether there be any satisfactory Evidence to convince the Court and you in Point of Law, that the Man is guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a Dog?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes. We have got a good middling siz'd Dog; when any comes to the Door he makes so great a Noise, that the Watchman said he would kill it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Mr. Appelby, are you the Son of Mr. Appleby, the Prosecutor; you know the Defendant; how many Months has he liv'd with your Father; how did he behave during that Time; how did he behave always?</p>
               <p>Appelby. He always behav'd very well, 'till this very Affair happen'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to go out often?</p>
               <p>Appelby. No. He us'd to go out about once a Week. He lays in the Shop; only a Partition between the Parlour and the Shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any Body lie up one Pair of Stairs?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. You mention the Flap of the Buroe broke open, and the Closet broke open: I would ask you whether the Prisoner knew where your Plate was kept ?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes. I don't doubt, as well as we did.</p>
               <p>Council. You say the Closet Door was broke open, and the Prisoner knew where your Plate was: You said there was not Plate usually kept there. Was there any Money frequently kept there?</p>
               <p>Appelby. That Afternoon I took almost 12 l. out of the Scrutore; which no Doubt they would have taken.</p>
               <p>Council. Pray Mr. Appelby where does your Parlour look into.</p>
               <p>Appelby. The one Part into the Shop; the other into the Burying Ground.</p>
               <p>Council. You say there must be a great deal of Violence us'd, but none of the Family heard any Thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant says, that at Four o'Clock in the Morning, when the Door was discover'd to be open, none of the Things mention'd in the Indictment were found upon this young Man at the Bar. Pray do you know any Thing of this Advertisement in the Papers?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes Sir. It was by my Father's Orders.</p>
               <p>Council. And did you find your Journeyman in Bed when you came down Stairs: You say he always gets up to let the rest of the Workmen in; then he was in; was he dress'd, or half dress'd when you came down?</p>
               <p>Appelby. I was in such a Surprize I did not look after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastned the Door?</p>
               <p>Appelby. The Prisoner fastened the Door, and I felt of the Bolt and Things afterwards.</p>
               <p>Council. What Time was you in?</p>
               <p>Appelby. About Twelve, or a Quarter after.</p>
               <p>Council. So then I find the Prisoner keeps better Hours than you.</p>

               <p>Perkins. About half an Hour after Four I was going down to the Watch-house with my Lanthorn, and going through Harp-Alley, I saw the Door a little open. I went in and saw a Man in Bed, and bid him get up. I said get up and fasten the Door, the Shop is liable to be robb'd: I went up to the Bedside, made the Man to get up, and he got up out of his Bed, and fastned the Door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Man awake or asleep?</p>
               <p>Perkins. The Man answer'd me readily enough then; he said he suppos'd there might be somebody just gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any Thing of a Dog?</p>
               <p>Perkins. There was never a Dog bark'd at me.</p>
               <p>Council. You went into the Shop, and made a Knock with the Watchman's Staff just by his Bed-side? You made a Thump with your Staff, upon that the Person answer'd; he did not, upon your coming first into the Shop, Cry, Who is this?</p>
               <p>Perkins. No.</p>

               <p>Cordel. Yes, and when I came in the Morning, a Quarter after Six, as soon as I knock'd, my Fellow Prisoner got out of his Bed, and let me in; and I said this Flap was open for something last Night: I ask'd him for what, he said he forgot: I push'd up the other Flap, then I went my Ways into the Parlour to unbolt the Parlour Window; then I saw my Master's Buroe, and Cupboard, by the Fireside, broke open, and I said to the Prisoner, William, Did my Master leave his Buroe so last Night? he said I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine about the House? Did there seem to be any Force used in any Part of the House?</p>
               <p>Cordel. There was nothing but the Flap hung loose over the Street Door; with that we went down into the Cellar.</p>
               <p>Council against the Prisoner. I am surpriz'd you should lie so near to this Parlour, and not hear any Thing of it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. You would not have the Man hang'd for being fast asleep?</p>
               <p>Council. No; I should be as tender of that as you are.</p>
               <p>Court. The Flap you say hung loose?</p>
               <p>Cordel. He said the Flap was left loose last Night.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have lived with Mr. Appelby all this Time, have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cordel. Yes, but I never saw any Injustice by him, or any Thing of that Kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he up when he let you in?</p>
               <p>Cordel. No, my Lord, he was in his Shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now pray what Time of the Night is Mr. Appelby's Shop kept open?</p>

               <p>Q. Might not a Person be conceal'd there?</p>
               <p>Cordel. No, I believe not; for commonly my Master, or young Master, are near the Door.</p>

               <p>Appelby. Only my Wife and self, this Son and four Daughters; no Servant but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What Part of the House do you lie in?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Two Pair of Stairs forwards?</p>
               <p>Q. Was you apprehensive of any Disturbance?</p>
               <p>Appelby. I knew of none.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell that your House was safe ?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes, all was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any of your Family that lie so near to this Room as you?</p>
               <p>Appelby. None so near as myself.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you whether it was possible for any one to come into that Room, to do any Thing without being heard by the Man in Bed?</p>
               <p>Appelby. I think not; then I think there is another Thing, the boldest Rogue would hardly come by that Bed, which they could scarce get by, and if they did, he might have immediately gone out and call'd the Watch.</p>
               <p>Council. (for the Prisoner.) Mr. Appelby, the Prisoner has liv'd with you four Months: I would ask you whether he behaved in a sober, modest Way?</p>
               <p>Appelby. I believ'd him to be very sober and honest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Reason to imagine that he could be guilty of such a Crime? I would ask whether you look upon the Prisoner at the Bar to be an artful cunning Person, or a low weak Capacity?</p>
               <p>Appelby. He is not so ready in his Business as some People are; but here is a Copy of a Letter to prove that he is not a Person of so mean a Capacity.</p>
               <p>Council. Have you not declar'd since, you believed the Prisoner at the Bar to be innocent?</p>
               <p>Appelby. No.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you whether you have not offer'd any of the Prisoner's Friends, if they would give you any Thing, you would make it up? Did you ever know Mr. Willis? 'twas pretty late for your Son to be out? Does your Son usually keep such Hours?</p>
               <p>Appelby. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Council. I am sorry for your Loss; I wish you may find out the Thief.</p>
               <p>With your Lordship's Leave I am Council for the Prisoner. As the Serjeant has candidly open'd it, that there was nothing but Circumstances, whether they were such Circumstances to take away the Life of a Man. The Person is indicted; it amounts to this. Here is a Person indicted for being asleep. If a Person has any Character to support him, the Jury will never believe them, unless there are some other Circumstances. This is laid as a Crime, that a Person shall not be awaken'd by a Noise, as that at best is but a doubtful Case. We shall call our Witness to prove that he is a most sober and honest Person.</p>

               <p>Willis. Mr. Appelby offer'd to make it up; I told him and his Wife, if he (the Prisoner) was Guilty, I would not give Six-pence to save him from the Gallows. He is second Cousin. He is a Boy of a very shallow Capacity. Mr. Appelby gives but Seven Pounds per Year. I believe him to be innocent; he said so before the Gentleman at my Lord Mayor's Court.</p>

            , jun.) Was you at that Time along with your Uncle, at Mr. Appelby's?</p>
               <p>Willis. Yes, and I saw Mr. Appelby's Wife and three Daughters, and I think a young Man.</p>
               <p>Council. I ask you upon your Oath, what Mr. Appelby said about the young Man?</p>
               <p>Willis. When we went to Mr. Appelby's House, it was upon the Circumstance of the Watchmen. Mrs. Appelby made a great Noise, and said they had never such a Misfortune before; she said Circumstances were so strong, that it was impossible but it must be he: I said I did not know any Thing of the Circumstances, but only I had been talking with the Prisoner at the Bar a great Part of the Afternoon, and I found from his Discourse, that he must be a real honest Man; and what confirm'd me in it, that his Master gave him the best of Characters: One Circumstance was this; one of the Masters that he was with, his Affairs went back in the World, and he could not employ all his Hands; the Prisoner at the Bar was very industrious, and his Master was not willing that he should be dismissed.</p>
               <p>Council. The Question that I ask you, is, whether Mr. Appelby declar'd any Thing at all with respect to the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Willis. I intended to come to it, but I'll answer your Question. Mr. Appelby said they were willing to make it up, if he was concern'd in it, as being drawn in from his Weakness; but Mr. Willis said if he was guilty, if Six-pence would save him, he would not give it.</p>
               <p>Council (to - Norris.) Mr. Norris, I think the young Man at the Bar serv'd you seven Years as an Apprentice?</p>
               <p>Norris. Yes, and he behav'd very suitably.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been out of his Time?</p>
               <p>Norris. Four or five Years, and I never heard any thing against him 'till this Time, at which I was much surpriz'd; I should think him one of the last Persons for such an Undertaking; and if it was attended with any Difficulties, I don't think he could do it, for he has but a very indifferent Capacity. While he was with me he was a very sober honest Man.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose it was in his Power to have wrong'd you very much, if it was his Inclination.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Wade. Above six Months.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he could be capable of breaking open his Masters Escrutore, or such Things?</p>
               <p>Wade. No, I believe not. He lived with me a Twelvemonth, all but a few Days; and I knew him about two Months before he came to live with me.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole Time he lived with you, how did he behave?</p>
               <p>Wade. I never had a better Servant in my Life, for what he was capable of doing; he kept very good Hours, nobody came after him to spend any Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of this unhappy Affair?</p>
               <p>Wade. Yes, but I cannot think he had Courage or Capacity for such a Thing.</p>
               <p>Council against the Prisoner. They have call'd Witnesses to the Prisoner's Character; doubtless Character is a Scale to turn very much; but 'tis a wonderful Thing to me that the Plate is gone. Which way could any one get into this House? This is the only Man that lay below, and was within hearing, and to be so very found asleep! All Men are honest 'till they begin to be otherwise; but they say he is a Man quite contented and easy in Disposition and Temper. We had some Difficulty to prove his Hand-writing; but at last it comes out that 'tis his Hand-writing. 'Tis plain that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090026"/> was restless and discontented, and it went to his very Heart, Blood and Guts of his Body, that he wanted Substance, and wanted Money, and would have his Uncle apply'd to, to set him up.</p>

               <p>Francklin.

Presently she comes out in a Hurry, with something in her Lap, and I said I believe that Woman has stript the Child. She went down a Turning, where she was soon taken with the Things upon her.</p>

            (to Eliz. Brooks.) Have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, a strip'd Cotton Gown, and a white short Cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. When.</p>
               <p>Brooks. The 26th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence were these Things taken?</p>
               <p>Brooks. From my Room in King-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brooks. About Six o'Clock in the Evening I sent a little Child out for a Candle; I went down Stairs and miss'd it, about five Minutes after the Child came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I open'd the Street-Door without a Gown; and when I look'd out, before I had Power to ask any Question, the Prisoner said she had lost a Bunch of Turneps.</p>
               <p>Q. She lives then in your Neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, Sir, facing of me. I said to her, Did you see any body come out of my House? She said, she could not look after my House, for she herself had lost a Bunch of Turneps, and she seem'd to take it amiss that I should ask her about any Persons coming in. When the Thing was talk'd of, she, the Prisoner, said, Mrs. Brooks has been taxing me about it. She said I should never hear the last of it. The next Day I sent for her over, for very dishonestly People use her House; I said to her, if you can tell me any thing of my Gown, I shall be oblig'd to you; but she told me I should never hear the last of it. The next Day I went into Rag-Fair, and I found it in Rosemary-Lane, as I was going along; it was hanging in the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Gentleman that you lost it?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I told him it was my Gown, and I desir'd him not to sell it. I ask'd him, if he had such a Thing as a white Short-Cloak, which they had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they give any Account of the Person that brought it thither?</p>
               <p>Brooks. When they described the Person, it gave me the more Suspicion. Please you, my Lord, this same Woman, the Prisoner at the Bar, was in Rosemary-Lane, and this Woman by; the Prisoner ask'd, if she knew where she could sell a Gown and Cloke; whereupon she carried her to her Master; they told her, they hop'd she came honestly by it; she answer'd, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; but denied before the Justice that she either took it or sold it.</p>

So he stoop'd down and took that Shoe in his Hand, and said, These are my Shoes, I will swear to them; and he said to me, Do you know any thing of this Boy's Character: I said, I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

               <p>Council. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Council in this Prosecution against the Defendant, who is now in Judgment before you for an Offence, we apprehend, he has has been guilty of against an Act of Parliament made in the Time of King William the Third for preventing the Growth of Popery: 'Tis not a Spirit of Persecution, but Self-preservation, that makes us enforce that Law at this time of Day. If our Ancestors thought it necessary, at that Time, to put a further Restriction upon the Attempts of designing artful Men, who endeavour to seduce and inveigle People away from the Religion in which they were brought up, I believe it will be the Judgment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090037"/> of every one that observes what Times we are fallen into, that we ought to oppose the Designs of our cunning Adversaries, who are endeavouring to seduce the People from the pure Religion exercised in this Kingdom. The Indictment on which the Defendant stands accused is grounded on an Act of Parliament made in the 11th and 12th Years of his Majesty King William the Third, which has expresly prohibited the Exercise of the Popish Religion, in any Degree whatsoever. If the Protestants abroad should attempt the publick Exercise of their Religion, they would be try'd by Rage and Fury, not left to the Judgment of twelve Men, but to the Inquisition, &amp;c. But we permit all to come to a Trial fairly and upon Oath. This, Gentlemen, I thought proper to mention to you; because 'tis extremely necessary some Stop should be put to Men that endeavour to draw away People from the true Protestant Religion. 'Tis evident that the Defendant has endeavour'd to seduce People by celebrating one of the Sacraments, in baptizing a Child in the Popish Way. Gentlemen, it seems the present Defendant, Mr.

               <p>Q. Had you any Goods stole out of your House?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any Goods?</p>
               <p>Pile. My Husband and my little Boy sell Stockings, Handkerchiefs and Caps; and he takes a Licence and walks abroad. This Woman, the Prisoner, she comes to my Door to beg a little Small Beer; I said I had none, my Children must drink Water; the Door was a-jar, open, and she came in; give me a little Water, says she, I am troubled with the Heart-Burn, it may do me good; says she to me, you are born to vast good Fortune, let me see your Hand. Said I, are you a Fortune Reader? She reply'd, I know, and by God's Assistance to help me, that where you are worth a Penny you shall be worth a Pound: Did you never hear of hidden Treasure in this House: There is hid a great deal of Money, and by God's Assistance and my Help you shall enjoy much of this: She told me she desir'd but so much in the Pound. But don't you deal with the Devil, I said: Says she you must pull your Rings off; said I, I have been a Wife these 18 Years, and have had eight Children, and have never pull'd them off. Says she, there is Gold and Silver hid in this House, there is 400 l. of King William's Gold hid in this Place ever since King William's Time, and shall be your's within an Hour, if you will follow my Directions; and where you are worth a Penny you shall be worth a Pound. I trembled and shook, I said, sure the Woman deals with the Devil, I said, do you? No, said the Prisoner; but only cast a Figure. All the Gold and Silver (says she) you have in the House, you must bring to me: She said, God must be her Saviour, and I should have it; And I was in such a Condition, in a Trance, or some such Thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull off your Rings?</p>
               <p>Pile. Yes. And they were put into a Paper, and she said, as God should be her Judge she would have but 12 d. to the Pound; she put my Rings and Spoon, as I thought, in my Bosom, but I could not find them any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think you had them in your Bosom?</p>
               <p>Pile. Please you my Lord, she put me into such a Condition, that I thought I should have died.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the Rings and the Tea Spoon?</p>
               <p>Pile. In the Paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she put them into your Bosom?</p>
               <p>Pile. I thought she did, but I never had them in my Bosom, tho' I thought I had: So she went out, and was to bring this Money to me in a Quarter of an Hour; but she did not return again; and I could not find her 'till Monday. I went into Whitchapel, there I found her, and she run away from me a Mile or two before we took her.</p>
               <p>[Prisoner's Defence] Please you my Lord, I never saw the Gentlewoman before Monday in the whole Course of my Life. I am unprovided, my Witnesses were here, but they are gone.</p>

               <p>Troughton. Please you, my Lord, she came out of Service to my House for a Lodging, 'till she got into Place: She was about a Fortnight and two Days at my House before she was brought to Bed. Sir, the young Woman in the House happen'd to go up to her Room to put a larger Bed there in order that she might lie with her; but taking the Bed off the Bedstead they call'd me up, and we saw a Child had been born. The Prisoner said there had not; but I said I was sure there had: She said she was about six Months gone with Child, and had miscarry'd; that she had left the Child in a Place where she could have it again; and afterwards, that she had dropp'd it in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; but upon Enquiry there was no such Thing. Her Mistress and I went to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is her Mistress?</p>
               <p>Troughton. Mrs. Moseley. She told her Mistress, after some time, that she had thrown the Child down the Vault in Woodstreet-Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Child?</p>
               <p>Troughton. I saw it after it was taken out of the Vault, but never before. She carried it out of my House in a Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive that she was with Child?</p>
               <p>Troughton. She always had her Apron tuck'd up that I never minded it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you perceiv'd it?</p>
               <p>Troughton. On Friday between Ten and Eleven o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Woman appear?</p>
               <p>Troughton. As well and as hearty as she was before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you look upon it she was deliver'd?</p>
               <p>Troughton. She was deliver'd between Two and Three o'Clock on Wednesday Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was deliver'd on Wednesday Morning?</p>
               <p>Troughton. She said so herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she kept House from that Time to Friday?</p>
               <p>Troughton. No, my Lord; she went out on Wednesday Morning about Eight o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep out all Day?</p>
               <p>Troughton. 'Till about Eight o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge near to her ?</p>
               <p>Troughton. She could not go to her Bed without going thro' my Kitchen, and she went out on Thursday Morning as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. And did she go out on Friday Morning?</p>
               <p>Troughton. Yes, and back again at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go up in her Room on Friday Night?</p>
               <p>Troughton. The young Woman took her Bed off from her Bedstead, to put a bigger Bed on to lie with her, or we should not have found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to let this Woman out of a Morning? Did she use to carry out something?</p>
               <p>Troughton. I saw her carry out something on Wednesday Morning in a Handkerchief, that look'd very full; but I had no Suspicion of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any Provision she had made for the Child? Any Childbed Linnen?</p>
               <p>Troughton. No, my Lord; but she said she had some a making.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married Woman?</p>
               <p>Troughton. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. So you never had a Suspicion of this Thing 'till Friday?</p>
               <p>Troughton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never keep her Company, nor converse with her?</p>
               <p>Troughton. But little; she generally had her Apron tuck'd up, that I never minded her.</p>
               <p>Court. So you say this Child was taken out of the Compter Vault.</p>
               <p>Troughton. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any Marks of Violence upon the Child?</p>
               <p>Troughton. I can't say that I could. The Rats had eaten one of the Arms and Hands, and one of the Arms was left whole.</p>

               <p>Prichard. Please you, my Lord, I know no more of it, than that I lay in the next Room to hers that Night, and the Night following she was to lie along with this Woman; and when they went to make her Bed, this Woman call'd to me, and shew'd me the Things that I thought was usual on those Occasions; upon which I went down to call my Landlady: When she came up Stairs, she said there had been a Child born.</p>
               <p>Q. What Things?</p>
               <p>Prichard. I don't know, Sir; Things as usual at such Times. When the Prisoner came up there was Company in the House, and she tax'd her with having a Child. She said, there was no such Thing. The Landlady said, as sure as ever she had a Child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090040"/> in her Life, she had one. Then she confess'd that she had miscarried; and the Landlady insisting to know what was become of it, she said it was very safe. The Landlady desired to know where it was. She said, if she would give her Leave, she would go and fetch it. My Landlady said she did not chuse she should go to fetch it; but if she'd tell, she would send for it. With a great deal to do, she said she had left it at the Duke of Newcastle's House. My Landlady said, she could never leave such a Thing there in the Morning. She desired the Landlady to let her go; for the Prisoner still insisted she had left it on the Stone Wall at the Duke of Newcastle's that Morning. They charg'd the Constable with her, and they sent the Beadle of the Parish to enquire if there was any such Thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the House during the whole Time of the Prisoner's being there?</p>
               <p>Prichard. Yes, the whole Time, I believe. She was about a Fortnight.</p>

               <p>Moseley. The Prisoner was my Servant, my Lord; she lived about 14 Months with me, my Lord; I perceived she was with Child, and I turn'd her away upon the same Occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you turn her away?</p>
               <p>Moseley. About a Fortnight before she was brought to-bed.</p>

               <p>Moseley. I went to see her at the Compter. I asked her what she had done with the Child; she said it was in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; but I told her it was a Story, and she should tell me; then she took hold of my Cloaths, and said it was here: I ask'd where; she pointed to the Vault, and it was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any Marks of Violence?</p>
               <p>Moseley. The Arm and Leg, and the bottom Part was knowed with Rats, and sadly mortify'd, that we could not tell what it was; but as she said herself that it was a Girl, for no-body could tell what it was.</p>

            ) What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Jane. I live just by the Compter. The Church-warden and the rest of the Gentlemen were pleas'd to send for me, and when I came, there was a little Bandbox stood upon the Table, and the Coroner swore me; they took off the Lid of the Box, and it was such a shocking Sight, that it almost took away my Senses: After I was recover'd, I examined it as well as I could, but it seemed to be so knawed and destroyed by Vermin, that it was not to be discerned. Whether it was Male or Female, I don't know, but she said it was a Female Child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Child you saw in the Bandbox, the same that was taken out of the Vault? Did this appear to be a full-grown Child?</p>
               <p>Jane. I cannot tell, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Opinion?</p>

               <p>Jane. I really can't say, my Lord, whether it was or was not; if it was not at its Time, I believe it must be very near, it was wasted, there was but one Hand left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there Nails upon the Hand?</p>
               <p>Jane. Small Nails, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Hair?</p>
               <p>Jane. No, my Lord, I did not apprehend any Thing of that; but I was so shocked with the Sight of it, that I was almost dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the Woman to the Compter?</p>
               <p>Jane. She used to go to a Man that she had lived with, and had three or four-Children by.</p>

               <p>Levi. Yes, my Lord, she came to a Man that she pretended was her Brother; but I find it was a Man that she had lived with before, and had some Children by him.</p>
               <p>Court. She called this Man her Brother, did she? Do you know any Thing to the contrary that he was not her Brother?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she tell you whether the Child was alive when she threw it in?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was a Servant, and would not disgrace myself: I was making Prepara tions for it: I did it to hide Shame, and to be sure I got more. I got a Hurt on Saturday as I was Washing, and the Child was dead-born, it was never born alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any to prove that you got any Hurt?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I never spoke of it to any Body. I had made some Preparations, but the Woman that made them for me is now sick a-bed, and sent them to me Yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get this Hurt?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was hanging up of Cloaths, and the Stool I stood upon, slipt from under me, and I had my Arms up, and I fell down on Saturday in the Afternoon.</p>

               <p>Council. You must not talk of She's, there's five thousand of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner make these twelve Shillings?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't say but I did help her?</p>
               <p>Q. Let us see what Part she did, and what Part you did, in making these Pieces. Who made the Mould of the Plaister of Paris ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I made the Impression by a good Shilling. The Prisoner held the Mould while I pour'd in the Metal.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the next Step to making them?</p>
               <p>Jones. She and I put them out, and I not being well that Night, when I went to Bed I desir'd her to get them ready, and she scour'd them and went down with one of the said Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, she held the Mould made of Plaister of Paris, while you took the Impression off the good Shilling. Who cast them in the Mould?</p>
               <p>Jones. She and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you did cast them?</p>
               <p>Jones. In the Morning, at Four o'Clock, Sir: We were both concern'd together; I held the Moulds, and she pour'd the Metal in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that these twelve Pieces you produced, were produced by the Metal she pour'd into the Mould.</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know?</p>
               <p>Jones. These Pieces were ne'er out of my Custody before I gave them to the Justice; they were not, upon my Word and Honour.</p>

               <p>Q. Who fil'd these twelve? How came you by them?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sir, she was with me; we were both together when they were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Who scour'd them?</p>
               <p>Jones. The Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had scour'd and finish'd them, what did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Jones. She and I used to go out together; she used always to take a Hand-Basket, and I used to go along with her: Sometimes she used to go to Market, and sometimes I. When I came to her, I used to give her the Change.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had put it off, what did you do then?</p>
               <p>Jones. Why then, Sir, I used to give her the Change; then I took another Shilling to put off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174604090042"/>Q. Now I would ask you, for how long a Time you went on in this Way ?</p>
               <p>Jones. Ten Years we have gone out together in this Way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that you discover'd this iniquitous Practice to?</p>
               <p>Jones. I was very uneasy about it; for sometimes she would get drunk, and then she would threaten me. I first sent to the Gentleman, Mr. Buckman, within these three Weeks, and I said, I am very uneasy now my Children are grown out of the Way; and I am frighten'd and threaten'd by a Person what she will do; and I will now leave it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what Impression had the Moulds?</p>
               <p>Jones. King William the Third.</p>

               <p>Buckman. My Lord, I never saw her in my Life, 'till this Affair was discover'd. The Evidence, Mrs. Jones, sent for me: When I came she said, I am something concern'd I did not send to you before; I have sent for you for something besides the Coat. When she sent to me she was very sober, and under a great Concern; and I was very sober myself. She said, I do assure you, Mr. Buckingham, I have something upon my Spirits that concerns me; I am determin'd to make myself a voluntary Evidence. An Evidence, In what? I said. Says she, I have been concern'd in Coining, and putting off bad Money. I said I would go and speak to a Person that I knew, who was one Vernon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Vernon?</p>
               <p>Buckman. He is an Officer belonging to the Marshalsea Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Buckman. I am a Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. So when you came to her about the Coat, she mention'd something to you about Coining, did she?</p>
               <p>Buckman. Yes; and she nam'd one Wilson.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you would send or go to one Vernon, Did you meet with him?</p>
               <p>Buckman. I brought him along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what past in the Presence of Vernon, you and her, altogether?</p>
               <p>Buckman. She said, To be sure I am guilty of a very heinous Crime; I'll make myself a voluntary Evidence: I have two Children, and I am willing to discover the Thing. Said Mr. Vernon, Where does this Woman live ? So she sent her little Boy with us to the House where the Prisoner was; the Boy pointed to an elderly Woman, and the poor Woman fell a crying. I said to Mr. Vernon, this poor Creature looks like an innocent Person. The other Woman facing the Chimney-Corner seem'd to be sideling to get away; I said, I fansy that Woman must be the guilty Person; send for Mrs. Jones, to see if this is not the Woman. When Mrs. Jones came, she declar'd that was the Woman.</p>

I was drinking a Pint of Beer in Whitecross-Street; Buckman, the other Witness, came to me, and ask'd me to go with him, to be concern'd in taking a Coiner: I went up along with him to this Woman's, the Witness. When I came up she seem'd to be afraid, and said, I have been concern'd in Coining, but am willing to leave that Trade off. Said I, How many is concern'd with you? she said but one; which is the Prisoner at the Bar. Her Boy went along with me to shew me the House; but when I came in I made a little Mistake; I said, Madam, you must go along with me; you have been concern'd in Coining of Money. The Woman fell a crying; I saw the Prisoner at the Bar make a sideling about; I said, Don't you run away, for I fansy you are the Woman. So when Mrs. Jones came up, she said, that was the Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was going before the Justice, had you any Talk with her?</p>
               <p>Vernon. I cannot say I was very curious to have much Conversation with her; but I said to her, that Coining was a very bad Trade; you have coin'd yourself in Rags. Said she, I wish I had been a little sooner, I would have turn'd Evidence: I wish I had been an Evidence myself; but now 'tis too late.</p>
