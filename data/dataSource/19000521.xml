Woodman, Grover, Limited, and also of Mr. Taylor, the prosecutor—I saw the three prisoners—I was with two other officers—I said, "We are police officers, and I have a lad named Edwards in custody"—he had made a statement to me in reference to some carpets which I had arrested him for stealing—I read this state<lb/>ment he had made to the prisoners: "Percy has had two carpets, for which he has paid me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I am not certain whether he has had one or two pairs of lace curtains. Joseph"—that is, I believe, Huskinson—"has had one carpet, for which he gave me 6s. 6d.; he has had either two or three pairs of white curtains; these two have had the silk curtains and the quarter carpets between them; Jack Hargill has had one carpet, for which he has paid me 6s. 6d."—Huskinson replied, "I have everything at home which I have had; I gave him 5s. 6d. for the carpet I had on Saturday"—that was the 28th—Woodman, Grover &amp; Co., are carpet manufacturers and designers, I believe—Edwards' employer, Mr. Taylor, is a carpet agent—I believe Rushton and Huskin<lb/>son are apprentices, and Hargill a warehouseman—I went to all the prisoners' addresses, and they made statements which were taken down by the other officers—I attended to Huskinson.</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of 29, Bow Common Lane—about 10.30 p.m. on April 12th I was called by the police to 2, Eastwood Street, where I found the deceased suffering from a wound under her eye—in my opinion she was intoxicated, and in a condition of mild shock—she was not fully conscious when I arrived—the wound was 2 1/4 in. long, and extended down to the cheek-bone; I did not know how much further it had gone—I probed it, but it is a difficult situa<lb/>tion to probe; one dare not go very deep—there was some contusion—I attended her till April 20th, when she died—on the 15th she became very much worse and delirious—I could not tell then why, but I had a sus<lb/>picion that there was something the matter with the brain—on April 21st I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the wound on the cheek had traversed the tissues round the eyeball—it had glanced off the cheek-bone, it did not injure the eyeball itself—it went from the cavity of the orbit through the roof of the cavity, and passed in a backward and inward direc<lb/>tion, through the left frontal lobe of the brain, cutting it slightly, then through the substance of the right lobe into the right lateral ventricle—after we had removed the brain we passed a knife in from the wound in the cheek and traversed it through the track of the wound and found the distance to be 3 in.—this table knife would produce the wound and the results—this is not the knife we put in; we used a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> knife—the wound was the cause of the woman's death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion the deceased was intoxicated—she was rather above the height of the average woman; she was about 5 ft. 4 in.—she was a heavy woman—it is possible that the wound was self-inflicted, but not probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the deceased had been holding the knife like this, and had been pushed forward, the knife could have gone like that—somebody must have pushed the woman from behind, or the knife from the front—the top of the knife is not sharp—it is an ordinary table-knife—it would not require a great deal of force, there were not many resisting structures against it—it did not strike the cheek-bone, it glanced off it—the only bone it passed through was as thin as a piece of paper—when I saw the deceased first I did not know there was any injury to the brain.</p>

I live at Howgood Street, Bromley, and am a widow—I knew the prisoner and his wife—on April 12th, about 10 p.m., I met the deceased in Furze Street, close to her home—she went with me into the Earl Devon public-house—she seemed sober—she had two penny<lb/>worth of whisky—I had a glass of ale—we stayed five or ten minutes, and went out together—she walked straight—then I left her.</p>

               <p>I went to Eastwood Street—I saw the deceased in bed—she had a wound under her left eye—she said something to me, and I went into the kitchen, where I found this knife on the floor, under a chair near the fireplace—there was wet blood on it—I also found two aprons on the floor with blood on them—it was a small room, with a table in it and some boxes and a chair—I went to the Police-station, where I found the prisoner—I took the knife with me and laid it on the desk in the charge room—the prisoner said, "I never used that knife"—he was charged with wounding—he made no reply—I did not then notice anything about his mouth—on April 21st I saw him at the Police-court—I said to him, "Lay, your wife died yesterday; you will now be charged with murder<lb/>ing her"—I cautioned him, and be made no reply—I read the charge to him—he said, "I only <hi rend="italic">done</hi> like that," throwing his arm in a horizontal position.</p>

Caspary asked me to go with him to 46, Prince's Square; he asked a man named Toddlevitch to take charge of the property. On Monday, April 16th, I met Konallick in Lombard Street. He asked me where I was employed. I took him to my master's place at 8, Aldgate. Konallick said, 'I am going to break into that place'—I left him outside the premises; I did not see him till next day, the 17th, about 9 p.m.; he was then at 90, Leman Street, with a man known as <hi rend="italic">Hamburg Willie</hi>—Konallick said, 'I have broken into your master's place,' and showed me this property, and said, "This is what we have taken"—I then left him—I saw them again at 8 p.m. on Thursday; they told me they had not sold the pro<lb/>perty—on Sunday, the 22nd, I met Caspary in Lombard Street; he had the property, and asked me to come with him to Prince's Square, where we saw Toddlevitch; Caspary gave Toddlevitch the property from the bag, and put it into a box handed to them by Toddlevitch"—Griebel counted the teeth as they were taken from the bag, and placed them in the box—we then broke the bag in pieces—Konallick made a statement in the presence of Griebel, after Griebel had made his statement.</p>

I am overseer at the Acton Post-office—the prisoner was employed there as an auxiliary postman—a letter posted at the East Strand Post-office at 5.15, addressed to Gunnersbury Lane, Acton, would arrive in the ordinary course of post about 9.45 the same evening, which would be the last post there—on April 26th the defendant was the post-man to make that delivery—at that time he lived at 92, Avenue Road, Acton, according to our records at the Acton Post-office—up to May 4th he had not given any notice of having removed, nor did he make any report with regard to the letter addressed to Mr. Ashley—this is the rule with regard to undelivered letters—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that on no account were postmen to take undelivered letters home, but to return them at once through a post letter-box, and to endorse them with the reason of non-delivery</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secretary's Office of the General Post Office—I saw the prisoner at the Acton Post-office on May 4th—I cautioned him, and told him my name—I had been to his address at Avenue Road that day, but could not find him—I asked him where he lived; he said, "92, Avenue Road, Acton"—I said, "They told me there that you had left on May 1st, and could not give me your present address"—he then said he lived at 11, George Road, Acton—I described the letter sent by Mr. Ruck, and said that the addressee had not received it, and told him that the order enclosed in it had been presented for payment by Mrs. Beer, who stated that she had obtained it from him—I asked him where he obtained it, and he said, "I had the letter in question on April 26th, last delivery, it was the second in the packet, and I tore the letter as I took it from the packet. I knocked twice at the door, but got no reply. I took it home, thinking to have it sealed up in the morning. I went home and had my supper, and showed the letter to my sister-in-law"—he then said that he put the letter in his hat on the table, and went upstairs to bed; that he came down about five minutes afterwards, and took the hat and letter upstairs; that, going upstairs, he put his hat on his head; that next morning Mrs. Beer said that she hoped he would forgive her, but that she had found a letter and cashed an order, and said that the prisoner had given it to her; that he said, "Good God! woman, what have you done? that is the letter I lost"—I went and saw his sister-in-law, and then told the prisoner that she had seen the letter which he had brought home, but did not recognise it—I subsequently obtained a warrant for his arrest.</p>

Mayer &amp; Co. in Kensington for orders—Leon afterwards called on me as Mr. Mayer—I supplied him with goods from 1896 to 1898 at 174, Pentonville Road, and once in St. John's Road—I called for an account, and saw Benjamin—I asked for my account—he said, "My brother is away in the country, and as soon as he comes he will send a cheque"—from April 29th to December, 1896, the account was £84 15s. 5d.—they paid by bill up to 1898—the account then grew bigger than usual—in six months they had more than in the previous year—the last order in July was £33 11s. 2d.—in the six months it was £381 5s. 6d; in June</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190005210020"/>
               <p>it was £102 17s. 10d.—at the bankruptcy £244 was due—these are letters giving orders and postcards that I received—when Leon was ordering goods I told him the account was larger than usual—he said, "I am now doing a larger business; I am travelling myself, and have taken other travellers, hence the account is larger"; but if I did not want to give him very much credit, he would not order more—that gave me more confidence, and I gave him credit—I found my name was given as a reference for B. Mayer &amp; Co.—I spoke to Leon about it—he said, "If you do not like it, I will not give you more orders"—still he went on giving orders.</p>

I am one of the firm of Poppleton &amp; Appleby, chartered accountants, at Barbican—my partner, Mr. Poppleton, is a trustee in the bankruptcy of Benjamin Mayer—I did the active work of examining the books, and so on—this cash account was filed by the bankrupt under an order of the Court—it runs from January 1st to August 11th, 1898—between April 18th and June 24th B. Mayer is represented to have paid loans amounting to £252 2s. 6d. to C. Mayer—from the examination I found that C. Mayer stood for Camil Mayer—I have tried, but have been unable, to trace Camil Mayer—I find by the passbook the amount drawn out between May 13th and August 5th, 1898, by cheques to self or order, is £303—in the examination those were represented to be payments made to Camil Mayer—those include one for £30 on July 28th, 1898—there were 19 cheques—other cheques bring the amount up to £352—these are the bankrupt's dates of cheques to Camil Mayer: June 2nd, £3; 8th, £40; 11th, £50; 16th, £50; April 18th, £1; May 9th, £5; 13th, £2; June 7th, £20; 10th, £5; 16th, £14 9s.; 23rd, £5 10s.; 23rd, £4 13s. 6d.; 24th, £6 10s.; and June 22nd, £45—those amount to £252 2s. 6d.—some cheques are drawn to G. Mayer—£364 represents the total cheques drawn out to B. Mayer between May 13th and August 5th, 1898—£350 represents cheques payable to himself—there are also payments for wages, petties, and travelling expenses—some entries for wages are as payments to L. Mayer—altogether the cash payments to L. Mayer between March 31st and July 9th, 1898, amount to £200, including June 14th, £35; 30th, £40; July 9th, £100—in addition, Leon has failed to prove in the bankruptcy for sums still due to him for wages and goods amounting to £117 4s. 6d.—there is an item for goods and cash of £363 16s. 6d.—the amount set out for wages is £396—petty and personal expenses are frequently put down—then there is a separate item, "Travelling on the Continent," and then a lump sum for personal expenses from January 1st to August 11th of £224 9s. 5d.—£251 is unaccounted for.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In Answer 172 of Benjamin's examination he says that he paid his brother £5 a week out of £50 capital, and drew £3 a week—the entry of £50 in the cash-book was never pointed out to me by the bankrupt as his mother's loan, only that the £54 17s. 1d. was a repay<lb/>ment to his mother.</p>

I am serving three months' imprisonment for the theft of this clock—I took it on May 1st from Colonel Finch's—I kept it where I was lodging for a week at 50, Bran Street, Marylebone—on Mon<lb/>day, May 7th, I took it to a jeweller's shop in Middlesex Street in a silk handkerchief—I unwrapped it, and asked the prisoner if it was any good to him—he said, "What do you want for it?"—I replied, "As much as you can give me"—he said, "Half a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—he gave me four half-crowns—he asked me if I had anything else—I said, "No"—I did not know the prisoner—he asked me no questions—I was afterwards arrested, and the four half-crowns found on me—I pleaded guilty before the Magistrate—De Jullet was with me there—I had not seen him in the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, C</hi>). On Tuesday, May 8th, in consequence of information received from Oliver, I went to 21, Middlesex Street, City, a small watch and clock maker and jeweller's shop—in the presence of Detective Sergeant Miller, of the City Police, I said to the prisoner I was a police officer, and wanted to speak to him respecting a clock that he had bought from a man the day previous, to whom he paid four half-crowns—he said, "What the f——g hell do you mean? Who are you? I have seen no f——g clock. Where is your b——warrant? What right have you in my shop? You had better get out. I have not bought a b——clock from no one"—I said, "The man who stole the clock has stated that he sold it to you for half a sovereign"—he said, "If I tell you where the clock is, will you let me finish my work?"—I said, "Yes"—that was a pair of spectacles he was repairing for a man who was waiting in the shop for them—he said, "Will you put that on paper?"—I said, "Yes"—I wrote on paper, "I promise you that you shall finish your work"—I gave him the paper—he said, "My man has taken it out to sell it for me, I bought it for 10s., and if you wait till he comes back from dinner he will bring it back"—I remained in the shop till 2.30, when the pri<lb/>soner's workman, whom I know as Ralph Azulayf, entered and said to Byrne, "I have sold that pin for you, Pat; it fetched a good price"—Byrne said, "What have you done with that clock, Ralph?"—Azulayf replied, "What b——clock do you mean? I have seen no b——clock"—Byrne said, "This is a detective, and the clock is stolen; do get it back for me"—Azulayf replied, "It is impossible; I bought it from you b——straight; I did not know it was <hi rend="italic">crook;</hi> I gave you 25s. for it; I don't care for the f——g <hi rend="italic">'tec</hi>"—I then told Azulayf that I was a police officer, and should take him into custody" for being concerned with Byrne in feloniously receiving the clock, well knowing it to have been stolen—Azulayf replied, "Good God! I am an honest man; if you come home with me I will give you the clock; I have not sold it yet"—I then went with him to 2, King Street, Tower Hill, where I found the clock produced on the mantelpiece—I took him back to the prisoner's shop, and took them both to the Police-station—when charged they made no reply—from inquiry, the value of the clock and case is £7 10s.—this other clock was in the window—it is not new—a part is missing—on searching Oliver I found four half-crowns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The clocks are by the same maker—Byrne was excited—both may have been drinking—you can see the front part of the shop through the window—there is a passage and a glass door—it is impossible to see over the shop till you enter—Byrne said he bought the clock for 10s.</p>

Bird Brothers, a printer's, in a street off the Strand—it may be Villiers Street—it is near Charing Cross—he went in and brought out cards like these—then we went to the <hi rend="italic">News of the World</hi> office—I did not go in—then we got on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> and went to London Bridge, then to the Fish Market, and had dinner at Neale's restaurant—then we all three returned to Ludgate Circus—I had an appointment, and left them there about 7 p.m.—I was with the prisoner on the night of May 3rd, when he was arrested—I do not know the name of the hotel—a gentleman or a lady was with me—I could not swear to the name.</p>

               <p>and went back to Guildford Street and gave the notes and gold to the person who gave me the cheque—he gave me a sum of money, and wanted me to go to Richmond—I got into a cab, and he said he would meet me at Waterloo, but he did not—I never saw him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a money changer, in partnership with my brother, at 9, Wardour Street, Soho—on April 11th someone, whom I believe to be the prisoner, brought, £237 in French notes; that is about 6,000 francs—I gave a cheque for £237 on Drummond's, and he said he would call next day, as he should want some French money—he did not speak like a foreigner—I gave no memorandum—the same person came again on the following Tuesday, April 17th, and said that he wanted to buy 76,000 francs, and made an appointment for the next day for him to transfer the money to me—I made this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—"25.17" is 25 francs 17 centimes, that is the rate of exchange for £1, which, added together, made £1,032 19s. 6d.—the exchange covers the profit—I cannot remember giving him that paper; he may have taken it off the counter—I did not see it again till the police showed it to me at the Mansion House—that was after April 19th—£5 was deposited with me—I asked him his name—he said, "Taylor," and I made a memorandum of it—he made an appointment with me at the Constitutional Club for 3 p.m. next day, but he came to my place about 2 o'clock, and said that I should have to make the hour 3.30—I told him I should not be able to get the whole 76,000 francs, but I had got some German money—he said that he would take German money to make up the amount, as he was going to Heidelberg—the German money was 4,000 marks—that would be £200 English, roughly speaking—the rate of exchange was put there—that would make £1,070 14s 2d.—I went to Northumberland Avenue and asked for Mr. Taylor, and after I had waited some time he came forward and beckoned me to the reception-room, and said, "Have you brought the money?"—I said, "Yes," and presented him with that memorandum—he said, "I am sorry I shall not be able to take the whole of the amount, as I have been expecting money to be brought here; I shall only be able to take half of it," and gave me the half in notes and gold from his waistcoat pocket; a £500 note, three £5 notes, and the balance in coin—I believe they were in a bag, I am not sure—he then went into the hall, and returned with a bag similar to this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and said, "I have got the rest of the money after all; it has been here all the time; they are very careless here"—he took the money out of the bag and gave me a £1,000 note, and received the £500 note back, leaving the three £5 notes and the odd money with me—I made the account correct by deducting 1,000 marks—I wrote "Taylor, 18-4," on all the three £5 notes, but I have not seen the third note since—I then left, and paid the same £1,000 note into our account, but did not take the number of it—I did not pay in the £5 notes, they would go into the till, and we should pay them out—I have not often had such a large transaction as</p>

               <p>£1,000; not this year—a £1,000 note is not a usual thing—he had on at the Constitutional, a hard felt hat, and had a cape attached to his coat—he wore spectacles on all three occasions; these steel ones, I believe—this is the style of coat, and this hat is what I call a round bowler—I fetched my cheque for £237 back from the bank—I saw the prisoner in the dock at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor on the day but one after the transaction, Friday, the 18th, and recognised him, to the best of my belief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I will not swear to the prisoner being the person I saw on any of those days—the police called upon me to describe the person next morning, and I spoke of him as between 35 and 40, wearing an Inverness cape—I did not mention any colour—he wore a hard felt hat and spectacles, and he was carrying a parcel—I cannot remember the height I gave—I accompanied Mr. Sidney, Mr. Bosanquet's clerk, to the Mansion House on the next day—nothing was said to me before I looked at the prisoner in the dock about his being much younger than the man I described—he was not put with other men; he was in the dock—I was there all three days, but was not called as a witness till the 25th—the deposit I made was five sovereigns—this is a very ordinary bag, but I remember it being produced at the club, by the colour—I remember my customer taking the £1,000 note out of that bag; I am sure of that—the £500 note was taken out of his vest pocket—this was in a different pattern, but the same colour—it is the same shape—the man's upper lip protruded, but that did not make his teeth prominent—he wore a moustache, but not a beard—I did not give any description of his eyes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 4th Batt. Essex Regi<lb/>ment at Colchester—the prisoner belongs to my battalion—on Wednesday, May 2nd, I saw him outside the library at Warlie Barracks—I was talking about a watch and chain that my friend Dolder had lost on the Sunday before we went down—I showed the prisoner a bit of paper with the description of the watch on it—he said, "Wait a little while, and I will fetch someone else to see you, because I think I know who has the chain"—a couple of fellows came up—one of them was Hayden, who belongs to D Company—he gave me the chain—the prisoner said to me, "Will your friend accept an apology?" and he asked me if I would write a letter for him—he said he did not have a hand in stealing it, but he reckoned he knew who did, and it was handed over to him to sell, and he reckoned he got about 1s. 6d. out of it—we went to Colchester that day, where the prisoner asked me to write a letter for him, at his dicta<lb/>tion, to Abbott—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had found out all particulars about the watch and chain; that the chap who helped in the job told him (the prisoner) that he would not have done it, only he was very hard up; that ne wanted to see Abbott, and asked him to go down to Colchester, and that he (Abbott) was to take the matter out of the hands of the police at once; that the fellow was at Colchester, and was very much worried about it</hi>)—I posted that letter, and on May 7th I saw Sergeant Eustace at Colchester—he asked me if I had the chain—the Essex Battalion was paraded, but the other man was not on parade.</p>

I know the man. I never sold the watch to anybody"—I took him to West Ham Police-station—I said, "I am going to put you up for identification I will borrow some clothes"—he said, "I know Abbott,</p>

I live at 27, Burgoyne Road, Blackheath—on May 4th, about 8.30 p.m., I was with Kate Ready, a friend, on the pavement at the Broadway, Stratford, doing some shopping—having taken my purse out to pay for some things, I had put it back with£1 gold and about 5s. 6d. silver, and some pence in it—I put my hand in my pocket to get my handkerchief, and found the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I took her by the cape and asked her for the purse—another woman was with her, who crossed the Broadway and ran away—the prisoner was then trying to get away—she said, "Come across the road in a dark place; I will give you the sovereign, and here is the silver"—a crowd gathered—she gave me the silver—a policeman came up—I gave her into custody.</p>

I am the wife of Arthur William Ready, of 48, West Road, Putney—I was with the last witness when the prisoner, who was with another woman, got her hand in Gallagher's pocket—Gallagher caught hold of the prisoner's cape—I said, "Cling to her, and I will go for the police"—the prisoner offered me some money, but I said, "No; let the police take it"—she asked me if I would feel in her pocket, and I said, "No; the police will do the same with that"—the other woman went away as fast as she could—the prisoner said, "For God's sake, take this, and say nothing about it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the National Society for prevention of Cruelty to Children; I was called to 38, Villa Street, Walworth, by Mr. Monk, and went there on April 10th about 10 p.m.—I heard the statement made by Archer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Archer.</hi> You told me that you knew it would come to this; that was up in the room; at the workhouse you said to your wife, "This means imprisonment for us"—at the Court you said you had not seen the things for a fortnight, because they had been, round at your mother's; I took that to refer to the furniture—you said you had intended to take the children to the workhouse to have them properly cleansed, and pay for them—on the 18th you said that you had no idea that the things were so bad as they were; that every Saturday you used to take home groceries, and that the children had plenty of food on Sundays, and that you left enough money on other days to carry them through the day.</p>
