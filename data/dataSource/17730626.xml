               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Williams. About two months ago. They were not brought by Monk the prisoner but his brother; I desired the prisoner Monk to pawn them, which he did, but did not know where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Lushby live?</p>
               <p>Williams. He told me somewhere in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Monk lodge?</p>
               <p>Williams. In Castle-street, Oxford-road. I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Lushby bring the cups and saucers to you?</p>
               <p>Williams. It was to the best of my remembrance on a Monday afternoon; I believe in the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Grubb. I found the cups and saucers in Monk's lodgings, Castle-street; these are the gloves (producing them) that I found in Monk's pocket; they have two shot holes in them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the gloves I lost the night my house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these shot holes in them when you lost them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know of any shot holes.</p>
               <p>Monk's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had the gloves from my brother the day before I was taken; Mrs. Williams saw him give them into my hand, and she gave the neckcloths to pawn.</p>
               <p>Williams. I saw him give them into his hands.</p>
               <p>Lushby's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought the cups and saucers of a woman in the street; they were odd ones, and one of them had these marks on it; I had been to tea with Mrs. Williams several times, and broke a cup; I said I would make her amends for it, so I gave them to her.</p>

            . The two prisoners, and one that is called the Captain, who is not taken, and I, agreed to go to one Mr. Paxton's, in Titchfield-street, Oxford-road; the scheme was, Paxton was to knock at the door; and was to knock the maid down as she opened the door, and so rob the house; we went there; a person over the way saw us knock at the door. Then we agreed to go to Mr. Fox's, and I was to secrete myself in the house and let them in; we went to the house and had a pint or two of beer; I let them in about two o'clock; we went into the tap; the Captain went into Mr. Jeffereys's cellar and broke open the door which parts the two cellars; then he went up stairs and opened the bar door with a key; then Evans and Plastow came up into the bar, and then the Captain shoved the sash back and got into the compting-house; after that we went into the tap room and broke open a box, and took out some wearing apparel; we took away some table linen and silk gowns, and some money; Evans told me the Captain had taken about 20 s. out of the till in silver, and some small pieces of gold; the Captain gave Evans about 4 s. We went to the top of Little Queen-street together; after which I went to a night house in St. James's; then Evans and I went and breakfasted at a house in St. George's-fields; afterwards we met with Plastow in Long-lane. The Captain gave Evans a guinea; I had half a guinea out of it, the Captain gave me the hat and bid me get it altered; Evans took it from me and pawned it. I heard they got two or three silver spoons and some buckles, but I did not see them; Plastow took a pair of new shoes to his lodgings; some children's petticoats were found at his lodgings; I think his wife said he brought them there.</p>

I went next day to see a friend at Smithfield; going up Long-lane I met Wilson: as we came up Catherine-street, Wilson said he had a hat making for him, he must call for it; this was Saturday night; I went to the Crown and waited for him; while I was waiting for him, the people at the Crown told him there had been some constables after him; he came in with the hat; I told him of it; he seemed frightened and went out; as soon as we came out of the door he asked me to carry the hat; he asked me to pledge it for him; I did, at Murthwaite's, for 5 s. 3 d. and brought him the money; he went to my lodgings and slept with me all night. As to the dark lanthorn, going to Plastow's lodgings to call upon him to go and play at skittles, I found the dark lanthorn in Holborn. I have been in a gentleman's service.

I had the prisoner taken before my Lord Mayor: upon his examination he fully acknowledged that he and his partner went into my field, killed a weather sheep there, and carried away the mutton; he mentioned who his partner was. In consequence of that we went and searched that man's house; there we found great part of another side of a sheep, a leg, shoulder and neck tied up in a basket, and hid under the bed; the prisoner said he had put the sack into a pond; we searched the pond but could not find it.</p>

I went up and found the prisoner on the two pair of stairs; the people in the two pair of stairs had stopped her, and the things were dropt; she said she had been up stairs to one Mrs. M'Carty with these things to wash.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before; what sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Crussell. Star-light, but light enough to discern his face; I looked very hard in his face before I was knocked down. I went and gave the information in at Justice Sherwood's office; it was some time afterwards when I was sent for by Justice Sherwood's men; about six weeks after I was robbed when I was sent for; they shewed me the prisoner; I knew him; we went before Justice Camper and he committed him.</p>

               <p>Crussell. I said he was the man.</p>

               <p>Crussell. He was shewn to me; it was at a publick house; I went there; they asked me if I knew the man in the box; there were fi ve or six there; I said yes, I should know him if I saw him; they bid me look in the box; I said that is the man.

When I was sent for by Justice Sherwood's men they shewed me the prisoner, and I knew him; he was dressed as he is now; there were about ten or a dozen in the tap room where I was taken to see the prisoner; there were five or six in the box with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he hand-cuffed?</p>
               <p>Crussell. No.</p>
               <p>Edward Hall. I took the prisoner up: I suspected him by the information I had read at Justice Sherwood's office; I did not know him before: the description of him was a tall man, in his own hair, blue clothes and jacket.</p>

               <p>I was sent to Bartholomew's hospital, by order of my Lord Mayor, some time in March; I believe I was there at the time this robbery was committed: my disorder was a bad leg and the bad distemper.</p>

The fact was committed on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury to the Prosecutor. Was you quite sober?</p>

A Mr. Bullion came to us, and asked if the gentleman in the chaise did not tell us he had been robbed; I said yes, and that is the man that robbed him, we are going to him; we came up to the prisoner; I asked if he saw the chaise robbed; he said no; I said you did you scoundrel, and are the person that robbed it. and have a pistol in your pocket; he said he had not; I said he need not make any resistance for we would see; he then made a run; I rode after him and struck at him, and knocked him down, either with my whip or horse I cannot say which; we took him to Cranford-bridge; I took the pistol out of his pocket, and drew four slugs out of it; I searched the lining of his coat and found this knife in it (produces the knife and the pistol).</p>

             touched him on the shoulder, and said, swear against the prisoner, swear against the prisoner, you will not be hurt; the man was dubious; Flanagan stooped down to him, and said, swear against him, I will give you a guinea. I know nothing of the robbery. I have several people to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elliston. Was you at the Justice's when this man was examined?</p>
               <p>Elliston. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Flanagan there?</p>
               <p>Elliston. White and Smith were there; the Justice asked me to look round if I knew the prisoner; I said I believed I could swear to him; I looked round and swore to him; he swore he would take his oath he never saw me in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner saying any thing to the Justice about Flanagan?</p>
               <p>Elliston. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Wright. Was you at the Justice's?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner complain to the Justice of Flanagan's wanting men to swear against him?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Chapman gave Wright written down what he had to swear against me; he has it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Chapman. Did you write any thing for him?</p>
               <p>Chapman. No.</p>
               <p>Elliston, the constable. I heard Chapman say that he would give these instructions to White, what he should swear to your lordship, for him to clear himself concerning being an evidence against this Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say this?</p>
               <p>Elliston. At the first public house beyond the blacksmith's shop, towards Clerkenwell-green.</p>
               <p>Court. Examine his pockets and see if he has any thing or no.</p>
               <p>He is searched but no paper is found.</p>

On Friday morning the 30th of April, as I was coming to town from my country house, about six o'clock, I received information that my house was broke open and robbed; when I came to town I found my drawers in my bed chamber broke open, and my bed burnt down; that is the back chamber of the first floor; the wainscot was burnt through in several places; it had been on fire all round the room. I searched my drawers and missed the things mentioned in the indictment; several bank notes and a great deal of cash; I examined the window, in the chamber which looks into the back yard, and I saw no signs of a breaking in; there was no door or window with any marks of violence upon them; from which I concluded that it must be done by somebody that knew the house; I immediately suspected the prisoner; he served his time with me; he has been gone from me about two years; he was at my house a few days before, and I was informed he was drinking at a public house in the neighbourhood that morning at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing lost out of any part of your house but your bed room?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; the things were took out of the double chest of drawers; the key of the back door hangs in the workshop; the prisoner knew very well where the key was; he could easily get over to the work-shop and take the key, and let himself into the dwelling house. I have a dog, but he knew the dog, and the dog knew him I suppose better than he does know me. I enquired where he lodged, and after some difficulty I found that he lodged in Tripe yard, Petticoat-lane; I got a search warrant, and a warrant against his person, and went to his lodgings; that was the same morning about ten o'clock; I took with me, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Jeffs the beadle, and Mr. Plant an officer; we found him at his lodgings; his wife was gone out; he was alone; I told him I had been robbed and suspected him; we searched, and the first thing I believe that we pulled out was a rusly black pocket book; in that I found a copy of a certificate that we have when we export goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made out in your name?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; it was made out in blank.</p>

            , April 29, 1773; which was the night my house was broke open; I asked him when he wrote his name upon it; he said a fortnight or above ago; I shewed it to Mr. Hawkins; I looked on the inside his pocket book; there was wrote the same; I asked him when he wrote that; he said at the same time as the other; I looked particularly at the certificate seeing that writing upon it; I asked him how he came by it; he said my son gave it him; I asked him if he had got any money; he said no; we searched further and found a new guinea upon him; I asked him how he came by that; he said he had sold some of his clothes for it; I told him he had no clothes to sell; he said it was for clothes he had bought; I asked him where; at last he said at Golden-square; I asked him when; he said last Monday; that there were two coats, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches; that he gave 11 s. for them, but they did not fit him, and so he sold them again. He was taken before the justices at the Rotation at Whitechapel, and was upon these circumstances committed; it was upon Monday he was committed, and he was discharged the next Wednesday: in consequence of some intelligence I took the beadle, and the officer, and another gentleman with me, and went to search his house again; his wife said she had no money: the prisoner was not at home. Then that gentleman with me searched the chair, and found sixteen guineas tied up in a piece of linen rag, and stuffed in under the bottom of the rushes; I asked her where she got them; she said one Gibbons gave them to her; there was no such man as she described to be found; at last she said she received it as a pension. She had on a pair of new stays, a pair of new cotton stockings, and a new crimson sattin bonnet. The prisoner came home while we were searching the house; he had on a new pair of pumps and new stockings; we searched him and found very little upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him of the money in the chair?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I do not remember that he made any answer.</p>

            . When I was a little at leisure, I began to examine my drawers narrowly, and I recollected perfectly that certificate that I found in the prisoner's pocket; I missed it from the drawers; there was such a one in some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not say that certificate but such a one?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No; I lost a pocket book that I had thrown aside some time like that I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it that you had thrown that pocket book aside?</p>
               <p>Langfer. It might lie there two or three years; I frequently saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you have worn it in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Ten or a dozen years: he was then removed to Newgate; I w ent there to him; I told him I wanted the pocket book which I saw the first morning he was searched, and described it; he said he knew nothing of it; we searched him but could not find it; I asked him where the certificate was; he said he did not know; I asked him how long he had had it; he said near a year: my son has been dead about two years and a half. Upon the Wednesday he was committed, two or three men came to my house; one of them is Barue: he said if he was admitted an evidence, I should get every thing back again; some of the plate that was taken was brought me next day, tied up in a handkerchief, which was found in a neighbour's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever traced any of the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What recollection have you of the contents of this certificate? repeat the words.</p>
               <p>Langfer. These are to certify to the Honourable Commissioners of the Customs, that the duty of (blank) pound of candles are paid at this office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a blank certificate or filled up?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Blank, for the number of candles, the ship's name, and the captain's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I think it was, I will not be positive that my name was in it; I am positive I had that or such a one; it was my son's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the certificate you found upon him had you son's hand writing in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I am positive it was his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these blank tickets are printed?</p>
               <p>Langfer. No, we write them ourselves; I had that form from the office to write them down, not to give them trouble; my son copied the form in short hand, and afterwards wrote it out in long hand, and I kept it by me for a form.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time you saw the certificate upon the prisoner take notice it was of your son's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Langfer. Yes, I said so; and he said he had it from my son; as he said that, and I not knowing that I had lost one, I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you should have stored up this blank certificate?</p>
               <p>Langfer. It was always a form I kept by me to make the entries by.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that it did not immediately strike you, that this was your certificate lost out of your drawers?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I did not know it then, nor for some weeks, till I examined the drawers, and then I found it was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the loss might hurry you for a day or two; then as to this pocket book you say you had wore it ten or a dozen years, and then laid it by in the drawer, I should have thought that would have struck you directly?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I did not think of it; I was in search after things more valuable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in that pocket book, that upon recollection, you can swear to?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I scarce recollect any thing in it but the certificate and these remarkable dates in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pocket book or a case?</p>
               <p>Langser. A case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any papers in it?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your recollection can you venture to swear that that pocket book you found upon the prisoner the day you took him up was your pocket book?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I will not do that, but I believe it was; I did not take so much notice of the pocket book as the certificate. Barue came to me and said my notes were buried, and should he and rot if Solomons, the Jew, was not admitted an evidence, and since, he said if Williams was discharged the things would come into his hands, and I should have them again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many of them certificates your son wrote?</p>
               <p>Langfer. I believe he did not write more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177306260020"/> one, and the copy he had was first taken at the office in short hand.</p>

On the 30th of April my house was broke open; I discovered it in the morning: I have a man lodges with me that is a watchman in the city; he came home about four o'clock, and informed me my house was broke open; I came down and found a pane was taken out of the casement, and it was undone; the pulley of the door that leads into the passage was cut; there were two bolts and a spring lock to the front door; it was unbolted and the shutters put to. I went to bed at eleven at night; I fastened the house myself. I lost the liquors and goods mentioned in the indictment ( spealing them). I had some suspicions from some information I had of the people at the house Meakham was at; I saw him with a basket with about 30 lb. of pewter in it, in Montague-street; we brought him back to his lodgings near the Cock and Hoop; we found at his lodgings a cask with rum in it, a cask with shrub, and a cask of Holland's gin, and there four lumps of pewter melted down in earthen dishes ( producing them) and a bag of linen, two casks of wine, one Malaga, the other tent; we found this pistol and a dark lanthorn (producing them). I believe the hat to be my property, but having no particular mark I will not swear to it; this cask I can swear to; it is marked I K; I had it of my brother at Gravesend. I asked the prisoner whether all the plates and dishes were melted down; he said I should never see them any more in the same form they had been in; I asked him if he had ever been in my house; he said he was two days before.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor: between two and three in the afternoon. I carried down the spoons into the kitchen after dinner; as soon as we had dined the maid washed them, and they were put, after washed, two into a silver pint mug by the chimney window; the other was put into the seat of the window. The prisoner was acquainted with me; he called upon me; I took him down stairs about half after one: I am sure the spoons where there at the time the prisoner went down; when he had been there a little time my mistress knocked with her heel; I was called up stairs and left him in the kitchen by himself; I was detained there about twelve minutes; when I returned the prisoner was sitting on the chair near the window where this pint mug and the spoons were; as soon as I went down I missed the spoons; I thought they might have been mislaid; I had no suspicion of the prisoner so I let him go; that was about four o'clock; the next day I went to enquire after the prisoner finding the spoons could not be had again; I met with him at his lodgings, and charged him with taking the spoons; upon that he made a kind of a cry, and said necessity made him take them; I desired to know where they were; he said he would shew me where; we went out together that he might shew me where they were, but when we got into Devonshire-street, he ran away; I did not see him for a week after, and when I did, I took him up.</p>

They run down the work-house passage; she got up, put her hat on, and walked down the street, and looked down the place where they run down but did not go after them, but went safely down the street; then they came out and looked at her; the evidence then ran after her; she turned short about and looked him in the face, and said she would follow him till tomorrow morning to have him taken, for he had robbed her; he turned back, and another man, I suppose the man that is absent, came out and took her in his arms, and pushed her into the passage; they came under my window before that, and one said what was that that dropped; Duncumb pulled it out of his bosom and said it was only 6 d.</p>

            . I am a plaisterer by trade. On Monday morning a quarter before four o'clock, I heard a cry of murder in one of 'Squire Dodd's empty houses that were repairing; I went down into the house and saw the prosecutrix on her back, in one of the rooms, with her clothes over her head, and a man, not the prisoner, endeavouring to use her ill; I took this man by the collar and led him into the street, and called watch! but nobody answered. I met the prisoners; there were five or six in number; I let the man go; the prisoners did not attempt to use me ill; I met them at the end of the court after I called the watch; then I went into my own room to put my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. from Duncumb. Did not you ask me to get the woman out of the house?</p>
               <p>Bradburn. I did ask somebody, I do not know whether it was him or no.</p>

            . I am a silversmith and jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Masquerier: the two prisoners on the 3d or 4th of December came to our shop, and asked for gold watches; before they gave any trouble they desired to know whether I would take a good bill for 100 l. I looked at it, and not knowing Mr. Martin or Mr. Moulson, or the indorser of it. I did not care to take it; upon which Johnson, who was the acting person and principal speaker, said he was very willing to leave the bill for a day or two, that we might enquire about it; they agreed the bill should be left till Saturday; this was Thursday or Friday. On Saturday they called again; in the mean time I made enquiry and had reason to think the bill a very good one; I gave them to understand that I was satisfied; they looked out two gold watches and a gold snuff box, which came to 53 l. 7 s. there was a balance of 46 l. 13 s. I offered them a draught upon my banker for this 46 l. 13 s. Johnson objected to taking the draught, and asked whether he could not have cash; he wished to have cash; I told him if he would call again he should have cash; they appointed an hour when to call again; the prisoner, Gahagan, came alone next time, about four in the afternoon, and wanted to have the watches and the ballance of the cash; I remarked to him I considered him only as the friend of the person who was the real buyer; that I thought the other man was the buyer and wished to see him; Gahagan said he was not well, and could not come; I said it was necessary that he should come because he had not indorsed the bill; Gahagan then said he should come in an hour; both came about seven o'clock in a hackney coach; Johnson seemed not well; I suspected he was in liquor; the things were looked out; Gahagan took them up, and the money as Johnson was not well, and then Johnson indorsed the bill in Gahagan's presence, and wrote upon it

               <p>On his cross examination, he said he thought the indorsement was made before the goods were delivered; that the bill remained in his hands from the time it was left with him; that Gahagan seemed to be a stander by, a sort of an assistant to a man that was not much acquainted with the country; that the occasion of Gahagan's taking the goods was his suspecting Johnson was in liquor; that he called upon him to take the goods of his friend; that he does not know whether Gahagan saw what Johnson wrote, but he remembers he asked Gahagan where Jackson lived, which was a circumstance that he did know what Johnson wrote not having heard the name before.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Miller from the prisoners counsel You said you remembered Johnson, do you know Cranion.</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg to know at that time whether he was not a man of considerable substance?</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of him?</p>
               <p>Miller. He is hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Cranion houses of his own?</p>
               <p>Miller. I know one old one he had of about 18 or 19 l. value. I do not believe he was a man of substance before this fact was committed, because he was not able to pay his rent, and his salary in the office was stopped once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a good place?</p>
               <p>Miller. Eleven shillings a week, and his perquisites might be more.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence.</p>
               <p>All I can say is I did not forge it with any intention to defraud Mr. Perrigal or any body else. If I had known there was any thing evil or bad in passing these bills I should not have gone again to Dublin. I told him I should want such and such goods, if he thought proper to examine the goodness of that bill, and I would leave it with him; he had it two days; when I came to him he gave the goods into this man's possession before he ever asked me to indorse it or what my name was. I had no intention to defraud him or any body, as I was only a servant I did not think it material what name was upon the bill, as they were satisfied with the acceptance of it; they said I could not expect any goods upon my own credit being a stranger.</p>
               <p>Gahagan's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Perigal when I went there desired me as being a friend of Mr. Johnson's, to take these things in my possession as Johnson was in liquor; which I did, but had no act or part in any of them. I heard that Mr. How, a gentleman I am particularly acquinted with, was come to England; I thought getting over with Johnson, with regard to these bills, would defray my expence, that I might have the pleasure of seeing my friend; that was my chief motive for coming over. Mr. Perigal must be mistaken; I never changed my name; I said I lodged at the Black Prince Chandos-street; I did not say I owned it; I lodged there eight or nine years ago; I had been there two or three nights drinking, and Mr. Johnson with me.</p>

As I was walking backwards and forwards in Welbeck-street, I heard the child cry thieves and murder; I put the child into his lodgings; then I went to his mother; I found her just at the end of Wimpole-street, turning to Great Marybone-street, which runs across the end of Wimpole-street; she said she had been robbed of seven-pence, and described the prisoner to me. I went and brought her to the watch-house when the prisoner was taken.</p>

I went to the next house and enquired what lodgers they had, and the prisoners were working at the top of the house. They were taken before the Justice; they denied the fact, but were committed for further examination, and when they were brought down the second time, Warwick confessed he had sold some of the aprons to

            . On Thursday the 22d of April the prisoner came to my house, the White Lion, at Dover (I keep a hatter's shop likewise) between half after seven and nine, and asked for a lodging; he asked if there were any watch makers in the town, or any pawnbrokers; I told him there were no pawnbrokers, there were two or three watchmakers; he said he had walked all the way from Stroud; that he stopt at Canterbury, and called upon a watch-maker, and asked him whether he would buy this watch; he put his hand in his pocket and took out this watch (producing it); the man said he would not, for he had paid a fine for taking in silver without a licence; he gave me the watch to look at; he desired me to keep it till morning for he had no money; he told me he had a rich uncle at Paris, and was going over to see him; I told him he might depend upon it he would be a French soldier as soon as he got to Calais if he had no money. In the morning he asked me to lend him something on the watch; the watch-maker said he would lend him 15 s. upon it if he would draw a note; he came to my shop and said he would be glad to have his watch again, for he had something else to dispose of; I asked him what it was; he said my uncle will not like to see me in such coarse linen as I have got on; he took out a Manchester note for 7 l. 7 s. and asked me to change it; I told him he might go to a Mr. Law, a draper, in the town, and that if it was good he might change it with him; he went there: as he was a stranger Mr. Law would not change it; he told me he went to Mr. Farley, Mr. Factor's clerk: he came back and said d - n the notes, I wish they were burnt or lost; he said pray get me a horse that I may go back again, and trembled, and seemed frightened; I thought there might be more than this by his saying notes; I said lend me that note I will get it changed; he gave it me; I said upon second consideration I could not change it, but I had dealings with Mr.

I told him I would endeavour to get him cash directly; I slipt out to the Mayor, and shewed him the two notes and the watch; the Mayor got two Justices to the Court-Hall; I had the prisoner up there, and they examined him; he said to the Mayor that he followed a gentleman through a street, and saw his pocket book fall out of his pocket; that his brother took these notes out and sent the pocket book back to the owner; he was committed to gaol.</p>

On Sunday se'enight, about two o'clock in the night, I heard somebody go by my door along the entry to the street door: I lie in the back parlour; he then rattled off a large chain that hung a-cross upon a worm, and threw it on the ground with great violence, lifted up the latch of the door, went out, and pulled the door hard after him; I got up directly, and as soon as I opened my door, I saw the entry door open; I went further and found the kitchen door open, and the poker bent almost double; I went further and the window of the kitchen that goes into the church yard was open, and propped up with a piece of stick; it was a sash window. I then saw the desk was broke open, and a bag was taken out of it containing 100 guineas; the desk was in the kitchen. I suppose he had concealed himself in the church yard, and so broke in out of the church yard. I suspected the prisoner; I went and informed the watchman of it; an alarm was given at the watch-house, and the prisoner was taken, and brought to me about seven o'clock that morning; they found the bag upon him with 99 guineas in it; one he said he had taken out, which was found in his breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the fact. My landlady gave me warning to remove my lodgings; I was up betimes moving my things, and the two men came into my room, and said I was their prisoner.

I served him eight years duly and truly, and never lay out of his house, and never disobeyed his commands we had a dispute after I was out of my time, which gave rise to this prosecution.</p>

I called to him to assist; the prisoner seeing somebody else in the house, threw the watch down upon a chair; I saw her throw it down. She denied the fact, and said she would not run away but would go readily with the constable. I sent for a constable and followed him to Guildhall. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix). When I had taken her into the parlour she dropped the apron upon the floor; I left it somewhere in the parlour when I went up stairs.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two years; he lodged in Cloth-fair, in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great; he has since taken a house by Clerkenwell Green. I never knew what business he was of; we were concerned together in the diminishing way.</p>
               <p>Q. What connections had you with him?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. Only a little in the diminishing way; the first I believe was the beginning of last February: we used to diminish guineas; we cut them round with scissars, then filed them round, and then milled them; sometimes I did ten or a dozen, sometimes more.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was this done?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. Five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this house his own?</p>
               <p>Bacchus. He had only a lodging; two little rooms up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the landlady see you and him together?</p>

               <p>Q. When did he take the lodging?</p>
               <p>Hansell. On the 26th of March I think; they were unfurnished; there was him and his wife; it was one room forward upon the ground floor, and another room forward on the one pair of stairs; he came in on the Friday following; he was some time down in the country. He was taken at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no furniture in the room?</p>
               <p>Hansell. There were some images there three days before they brought their goods.</p>

            . On the 22d of April, after Bacchus had made his information, I went to Bennet's, knocked at his room door, in Aylesbury-street; I believe they call it Red-Bull-yard; that woman can tell; it was next door to a public house, the Noah's Ark.</p>
               <p>Hansell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Clarke. Searching the room I saw upon the mantle-piece three images; the middle was what they call an angel; I believe I found a paper there; I shewed it the prisoner; I asked him what it was; he said he did not know; I shewed it him and told him it was gold; he said if it was he did not know who put it there; I searched his pocket and found 23 guineas and two half guineas, a 30 l. bank note, and a 10 or 20, I am not certain which, was found in his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of searching these images?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Bacchus said the gold was concealed in an image upon the mantle-piece. I have preserved two of the guineas. Then he was carried before a magistrate; he was asked whether the furniture belonged to him; he said the furniture of the room was all his own; after he found it would injure him, he denied the images, and said they were there before he came there. Here is the gold dust and clippings, with the millings upon the edge of it (he produced a paper with gold dust); some of what was in the paper I delivered to Mr. Chamberlayne.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this the original paper?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; I have put it in another because the paper broke; this is an original paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Stainsby Alcorne. I am assay-master in the Mint: I received some clippings and millings of Mr. Chamberlayne last Saturday; I examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177306260047"/> them carefully, and upon examination with my eye, they appeared to be clippings of coin, and upon trial with a fire, I found both clippings and millings to be of the standard of the current gold coin of this realm.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they clippings of English or foreign coin?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. I believe them to be English; I believe these to be clippings of guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe so?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. By the milling on the edging; all the milling is preserved. (Clarke produces the two guineas).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two guineas, have they been diminished?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. Both have been diminished by cutting or filing the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Done by fraud or wear?</p>
               <p>Alcorne. By fraud; there is an artificial edging put on.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clarke. What did you do with the other 21 guineas?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Delivered them to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two now produced selected from the other as being the smallest and most diminished, or the first that came to hand?</p>
               <p>Clarke. That new guinea was selected particularly.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any money transactions with him?</p>
               <p>Bates. Yes, he has paid me money very often, sometimes gold, sometimes silver; I never took any bad money to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>

               <p>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Bates. A publican, and keep an eating house; the prisoner has dined at my house ten or twelve times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had he occasion to take change; five or six times out of the times?</p>
               <p>Bates. May be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever change him a guinea?</p>
               <p>Bates. Yes, and once or twice half a guinea perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh your guinea?</p>
               <p>Bates. I often do when I doubt them; I send them over to a neighbour and have them weighed; once or twice I had his weighed, and when weighed found no deficiency.</p>
               <p>Edward Taft. I have known him three years; when he came to our house he dealt in horses; he used it three years; the Bell in Smithfield: I am an ostler; he has had four or five at our house at a time; I sold one or two for him.</p>

               <p>Taft. He has dealt in horses ever since I knew him; I have had some pounds of his money, and got banks for him when he went into the country for 60 or 80 guineas at a time.</p>
