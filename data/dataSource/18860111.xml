I am the son of the last witness—I was present on the 10th March when this cheque was brought to my father's shop by Morris—I took it to my father and asked him if he would take it—my father told me to go and ask him where he had it from—I asked him, and he said he took it from one of his tenants at Finchley, and it was as good as gold; that he had had several, and he had had one only last week for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was perfectly good, and I might depend on it as much as if I had the gold—I cashed the cheque which Morris endorsed—I next saw the cheque at 3 o'clock on the 1st April, when it was returned dis<lb/>honoured marked "N.S."—I then went with my brother to Morris—I did not see him the first time, but the second time he was just going into his house—I said "I have come about this cheque; it is returned dis<lb/>honoured"—he appeared rather surprised, and said he would come down to the shop the same evening—he came but brought no money—he said his son was outside; he was just going to send him to Finchley, as he had two good tenants there who owed him rent, and he would let us have the money that night or next morning—he did not keep that promise—there were about 20 promises to pay I should think between then and the 13th April—on the 13th April I went to 12, Crown Court, Threadneedle Street, with my brother, being asked to go there by Morris for an explanation of the matter—Morris said Morton and Letts would be there, and I expected they would, and that there would be an explanation—at Crown Court I saw Morris and Letts but not Morton—Morris and Letts said Morton was very ill, poor fellow; that he had a severe attack of bronchitis, and was at home ill in bed—Morris said he had got property, and could not get in his rent, and had not received half-a-crown out of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it being holiday week, but he would make up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Wednesday—Letts said the same thing, that he could not get his rents in on account of Bank Holiday week, but he would get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was all the explanation we could get, and I and my brother left, and we went across to Morton's office, Leadenhall Chambers—he came out smoking a cigarette—I said "I have a cheque drawn by you for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what are you going to do about that?"—he said "I will pay you by Wednesday certain"—that was the day the others had mentioned—he seemed in perfect health at the time—as I and my brother came out we met Morris and Letts going in at the other door of Morton's office.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. Morris said he had had several previous cheques from the drawer, and they were perfectly good, and one the week previous for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say if he said he had had several previously from Letts and one from Morton the week previously—when the cheque was returned and I saw Morris he did not say he would go and see Morton; he said nothing about Morton then—the following day I received a letter by post—I don't know from whom it came; there was no signature—I think it was from Morton—it had a City post-mark on it—in consequence of that letter the cheque was paid in a second time</p>

               <p>the same evening, 2nd April—it would reach the bank on Saturday morning on account of Good Friday coming between I suppose—I can<lb/>not say if I said at the police-court that Morris seemed much surprised when I told him the cheque was returned—I think Morris only hires the office at Crown Court now and then to suit his own purposes, to meet people there—I cannot say how long he has had that office; no one seems to know him there—I found him there according to appointment—Morris and Letts confirmed one another about Morton being ill; I cannot say who said it first; both said it—I cannot say if Morris's name was up at the door of Crown Court—I have seen another man's name on for that office—I have not seen Morris's name.</p>

I live at 162, Highbury Hill, and am a booking clerk in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company—I have known Morris for some time as a season ticket holder on that railway—on 24th February he came to me at the booking office, and at his request I lent him a sovereign—he promised to come and repay me that evening; he did not come—I called at his place several times without being able to see him; I never saw him again till 2nd April—I called at his house in the evening about 7.15, and asked him for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then showed me this cheque.

(<hi rend="italic">Stating it should be paid to-morrow.</hi>) It did not come—I then got a judgment summons against him at the County Court on 18th September—on 25th September I went to the police-station at Kentish Town and lodged a complaint there—on the 28th I received this letter: "Dear Sir,—Will you attend at the Mansion House to give evidence as to the cheque you hold from Francis Morton that was paid by me to you? Shall I take out a subpoena summons for your attendance, as I am determined to show the world who is the thief? Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">MORRIS</hi> "—on 6th October I went and saw Morris again—I asked him who this Smythe was that had endorsed my cheque, that I might see him—he said he was the stepson of Letts, that Letts had passed the cheque on his fraudu<lb/>lently—I said, "You have taken proceedings?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Then it is useless my going on"—he then took a copy affidavit that he said he had sworn at the Mansion House, and read it out to me—on the 8th I went with him to Cannon Street to see Morton—we did not see him there, and we went'to his house, 64, Elm Park Road, South Kensington—he was denied at first, but after a lot of inquiries he came out of a room close to my elbow; he could have heard all the conver<lb/>sation—I went in and said I had come about the cheque, and asked for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Buzzard's 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my expenses that I had paid at the County Court, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he promised to pay it if I would give him two days' grace—I said, "Why do you want two days' grace when you have had seven months?"—he said he would procure it by Saturday, and he gave me a letter to that effect, and he handed me an American, share certificate, but I thought I had already too much of his paper in my pocket, and I handed it back—he then wrote this memorandum undertaking to pay on Saturday at 3 p.m.—on Saturday, 10th October, I went with Bassett and Hicks to 64, Elm Park Road at about 3.25—we did not find him—the servant said he had waited till half-past 3, and then went out to keep an appointment—on 12th October I received this letter in Morton's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he would call on Thursday at 12.30 to take up the cheque.</hi>) I never saw him afterwards till he was before the Magistrate—on 27th May I met Morris accidentally in Finsbury Park—he said, "How about Your cheque.?"—I said, "It is in the hands of my solicitor"—he said he had nine cheques of Morton's to the amount of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had heard nothing about him, and he had indicted him because he had served him so badly.</p>

On 29th October I arrested Morton on a warrant at 64, Elm Park Road, Chelsea—I read the warrant to him, and told him he would be charged with being concerned with Morris, who was in custody—he said "Have you got Letts?"—I said "No; his name is not on the warrant"—he said "Oh, I thought it was"—on Saturday afternoon, 5th November, I received a warrant for the arrest of Letts—I went to 33, Millbrook Road, Brixton, where he was residing—I could not find him, and I have not been able to find him since; I have made every endeavour to do so.</p>

I live at 1, Coleherne Road, Earl's Court, and am an assistant to the official agent to the Exhibition—on 9th December I was in Mr. Humphreys' shop—the detective came in, and in conse<lb/>quence of what he said I and Humphreys went and assisted him in taking Allen—Humphreys afterwards left me to go and assist in taking another man—I then went across the road with Allen and met a constable, and asked him to take him in custody—as I went to the constable I heard something jingle on the stones in the gutter, and lit a match and found these two shillings there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Allen.</hi> I first saw White when I turned round and saw him struggling with Sellers before I crossed the road—between the time of my leaving go of you and giving you to the constable I heard the shillings drop—I looked on the ground with the constable and could see nothing; he did not wait a minute, it was so dark, so I lit a light and found two shillings—I did not see any lamp on the opposite side of the road.</p>

I am a silversmith, of 52, Seymour Street—what the last witness has said is correct—I had hold of Allen's right hand—he had a small ticket-pocket on the right side of his coat, and was fumbling in it—I said, "Keep your hand out of there, old man"—he said, "I only want to get my pipe"—I said, "Well, get your pipe"—he got it and put it in his mouth—I had hold of his coat sleeve—he still fumbled about there, and I said, "I wish you would keep your hand down, I won't let you put it there again"—at the cor✗ner of Nutford Place I heard Sellers shouting, and turned round and saw him on the ground with two men—the first man, or rather boy, got away, and I said to a man who was passing, "Take hold of this man's arm, he is in custody"—he did so in a very casual way—I ran to Sellers's assistance, and saw the other man run away—I then assisted to arrest the one on the ground, but he was very violent although he had the use of only one arm—we got him on his legs and walked him up the street after the other prisoner—when we had got about 60 yards I said to Sellers, "There is money dropping"—I did not then know what they were arrested for—I saw Plunkett give Allen into the custody of another constable just before that—we looked about the ground, but it being dark we could see nothing, but Mr. Plunkett remained behind and got a light, and came on afterwards and brought two shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on 22nd November I was living with my mother, Mrs. Hall, at 1, Liddiard Road—my husband had been away from me for about six months—on 22nd November, about 10.50 p.m., I went out for the purpose of getting some milk and beer—I went for the milk more especially for the baby—I had two jugs in my hand—I had parted from my husband that night on very good terms, but he had expressed a wish that I shouldn't come out again that night, and I said I would not, but I did to fetch the beer and the milk—after I had got the jugs filled and was returning from the Whittington public-house, as I turned the corner I saw my husband—I did not see where he came from—I went up to him—he said "I thought you was not coming out again"—I said "I had to come out"—he said "I am afraid you are deceiving me"—I said "I am not"—we were standing still when that was said; we then went on—our house is in the brickfields, which I had to cross—he continued to walk with me there—he seemed suspicious of me, and said he thought I had been talking to a man at the Whittington—I said "I have just left Mrs. Cashbold at the Whittington"—we con<lb/>tinued to walk along the brickfield, and he hit me with his hand, and I</p>

I am a widow; the last witness is my daughter—on 22nd November last she was living with me at 1, Liddiard Road, Archway Road, Highgate—on that day between 1 and 2, as we were going to see a little girl at the hospital, I saw the prisoner standing near the Railway Tavern—on that same night, about 10 minutes to 11, she went out with the prisoner—I gave her two jugs; they were then on friendly terms for anything I know—she went to fetch some milk for the baby—some time after she had gone, when it was quite time she was back again, I heard a noise as of dogs barking or a man shouting, which attracted my attention—I went into the brickfield, and heard my daughter's voice, and went towards the place, which took a very little time—I saw her lying on the ground, and the prisoner either kneeling down or stooping down close to her, and I heard her say, "He is killing me," or something to that effect—I said "Oh, you villain; it is you, is it?"—he said "Yes, it is me, and I will serve you the same," and ran towards me—I ran away, and called "Police"—the prisoner turned and went Highgate Hill direction—my daughter was still lying on the ground covered with blood, which was streaming from the head down the side—I assisted her home, and afterwards got a cab, and took her to the Great Northern Hospital—I then saw the police, and they went and saw her in the hospital—I saw a white hat and jug near the place where my daughter was lying, but took no heed of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a broken jug lying alongside of her—I can't remember whether I told the Magistrate about her saying "He is killing me," nor did I say that he said "I will serve you the same"—I did not wish to say it, but I was told I must.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Sheridan Street, Weston Street, St. George's-in-the-East, and am a net-maker—the prisoner is my son, and is 18 years old, and works at the same trade; he has been a volunteer between six and seven months—he followed his trade up to the time this matter occurred—I had also living with me a daughter Ellen, aged 16—we three occupied the same back room, on the first floor—on Wednesday afternoon, 2nd December, about 5 o'clock, my son went out—he went out in the morning and brought home some bags to work—when he went out at 5 o'clock he was all right—he returned at 20 minutes after 12; he was then drunk—I was in my room, but had not undressed—my daughter was in bed—he said, "Are you waiting up for me, father"—I said, "No, Jimmy"—he said, "Go to bed, father"—I said, "No, you go to bed"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188601110028"/>
               <p>—with that he began to undress himself—he again said, "You go to bed, father"—I said, "Did you bolt the door when you came in, Jimmy?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Mr. Warby is not in;" that is the landlord—he said, "I don't know whether I bolted it or not, you had better go down and see, father"—he was then undressed, and when I came up I undressed myself—the door was fastened—the prisoner was sitting at a table writing on a piece of paper—he said to the deceased, "How do you spell Casen?"—that is the name of the lodger downstairs—she said, "Oh, you know better how to spell it, Jimmy, than I do"—he said, "Hush, there is somebody in the passage"—I said, "It is Mr. Warby"—the prisoner then went down in his shirt into the yard to see who it was—he was away about a minute or a minute and a half—he then said, "Are you going to bed, father?"—I said, "No, Jimmy, I am not going to bed yet"—he then picked up a rifle from behind the door; as soon as he did so it went off—I sung out, "Murder, murder; you have killed your sister; Warby, Warby;" and got hold of the gun and wrestled with him, trying to get it away from him, but he was too strong for me—he said, "I have shot my sister, I know I have shot her, and if you had been in bed as you were on Monday night I should have shot you first, and then Ellen, and then have done for myself"—I held the gun till Mr. Warby came to my assistance and pulled it out of his hands—I took this cartridge from his left hand, and took it downstairs—the prisoner said, "You have got it"—I saw three cartridges in a drawer five or six weeks before this, and afterwards I saw only two, and I said, "Jimmy, you have been shifting these things out of here, there is only two"—he said, "Yes, I gave one away to the man who gave them to me"—the rifle was never loaded—the prisoner and the deceased used to play with it, and she used to help him clean it—after the landlord came he was taken to the station—this was the second piece of paper he had written on; the first one he tore up—my daughter was taken to the hospital, and died at 8 o'clock the same morning—she never spoke from the time she was shot—a letter came for Williams on the Tuesday morn<lb/>ning before this happened, and I took it in and thought it was for me, and said to the prisoner, "Here is a fine order here for some work"—he read it to himself—I said, "Jimmy, who is it from?"—he said, "It is not for you, it is from Cork"—with that the deceased sat up in bed and said, "It is my letter"—I said, "Well, if it is I will have it read first," and took it down to her sister, and afterwards gave it to her—when she was dead I took it from her pocket with another letter—I could not read them; I put them in the cupboard, and afterwards gave them to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Her Majesty's gaol at Clerken<lb/>well—I first saw the prisoner on the 3rd December; I have seen him daily since; in my opinion he is a man of sound mind and understanding—I was present when Dr. Bastian examined him—I have asked him to describe the occurrences of that day and he has told me that he came home and remembers firing the rifle, but nothing more than that—he has always said he was drunk at the time.</p>

I live at 87, Weston Street, Haggerston, and am a waterside labourer—the Treasury have seen me and taken my proof—I was with the prisoner on the Monday night before this occurred, we were crossing London Bridge; the prisoner was drunk—when we were about the middle of the bridge he suddenly ran away from me and tried to get on the parapet; I pulled him down; he then made a second rush and got up there again, but I pulled him down—it was all done of a sudden—there had been no quarrel between us.</p>

I am medical superintendent of Bethlehem Hospital—I have had great experience in insanity and mental diseases—I have examined the prisoner at the instance of the defence, and I have heard the evidence in Court to-day—I have formed a judgment of my own from my examination wholly independent of what I heard from others—my judgment is that without being actively insane he is dis<lb/>tinctly of a low intellectual power—excess of drink would probably disturb him rapidly and unduly, more so than a person of average intellect.</p>

It was to the effect that he lodged with Clare and Jones at 66, St. Ann's Road on 16th November; that Jones said he could get into any house with a knife; that he (Boswall) borrowed one, and bought a few matches, which he gave to Jones; that they then went to Blenheim Crescent, that Jones opened the window by pressing the catch back, that the constable came into the kitchen as soon as they were inside, and Jones got out through the window; and that he (Boswall) would attend and give this evidence as he had stated it to Morgan.</hi>) I put my mark to it; it is the truth—the prisoner is not the Jones—I had never seen the prisoner before he was in the dock before the Magistrate—I said then the prisoner was not the man—he is a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at 65, Poland Street, Oxford Street—I have know the prisoner personally for some four or five months; he was introduced to me by Mr. Glanville, an engraver, carry-on business at 13, Tottenham Court Road—I gave him several jobs to do for me as an engraver—he is a silver heraldic engraver, and is very skilful—on Tuesday, December 8th, he called upon me, and asked if I could give him employment—I told him I could not—he said "I am in great distress, I don't know what I shall do, I am almost tempted to commit a forgery"—I said "What for?" meaning for what reason—he said "For 1,200<hi rend="italic">l.,</hi>" and said "I will bring the drawings down, and show you"—I told him I could not be bothered then, and he said he would come another time—the moment he was gone I communicated the facts to Mr. Glanville—the prisoner came next day about 1 o'clock—Mr. Glanville was there; he seemed rather confused—he had a portfolio under his arm—Mr. Glanville went out of the shop—the prisoner then produced from the portfolio this plate, and four copies of notes of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw they were copies by the texture of the paper, otherwise I should not have known but what they were notes—I thought they were samples—I said "What are these?"—he said "They are bank notes," and said "I have drawn them with a pen and ink"—I said "This is a very mad trick you have been doing"—he, whispering, said "They are worth 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said "They are worth nothing, they are simply a specimen of penmanship"—he said he should like to put them in a place of safety—he said he had made them to make up deficiencies of money he had been robbed of by his lawyers—I, wishing to get hold of them, said "You can place them in my iron safe if you like"—he did so in the portfolio, and went away—when he had gone I showed them to Mr. Glanville and then locked them up in my safe again—on the next day, Thursday, the 10th, when I came home I found the notes had gone—my wife had the key of the safe, and she had given them to the prisoner—I then went and saw the prisoner at Mr. Glanville's shop, and we took him to the Bank of England—he went willingly—we said "We had better take these to the Bank of England"—he said "Ah, yes, perhaps we shall get some money"—we saw Mr. Bailey, the deputy cashier, there, and I showed him the four notes in the prisoner's presence, and told him that the prisoner had brought them to me, and I thought that he seemed very strange in his manner, and it was a very danger<lb/>ous thing for him to have them in his possession, and thought it to be my duty to take them to him—Mr. Bailey then asked the prisoner if he had any tracings to give them up and he would have the notes destroyed, and would forgive him, and he would hear no more about it, and asked me if I would undertake to deliver up the tracings to him and get them from the prisoner—I told him I thought it would be better if he sent some one with us and save me any further trouble—he then called in Wolsey, a police officer, and showed him the notes, and told him to proceed to the prisoner's lodgings and bring away anything appertaining to them—the prisoner had given his address 7, East Street, Theobald's Road—we four then left the bank together; on the way to his lodgings the prisoner said "Will they destroy the notes?"—I said "It is just possible"—he then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188601110041"/>
               <p>commenced crying, and said "They will never have another engraver like me in the Bank of England"—at his lodgings he produced of his own accord these three tracings, one of which is of a 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and two of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then asked him to produce the tracing for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he couldn't find it at first, but after a little delay he found it amongst about 30 other tracings in this book—Wolsey then asked him if he had any more about him—he answered "No"—we then told him if he did not deliver every<lb/>thing up we would get a search warrant, and they would search them<lb/>selves—he then went to a box and produced this plate—we asked him when he had done that—he said "I engraved that three years ago when I was in my father's house at Murray Street, Hoxton"—we then asked him if he had taken any prints from it—he said "No, it has never been out of my possession, I have taken a rubbing from it"—that is simply filling it in with ink or charcoal and then seeing how the engraving comes out—he said the rubbing had got destroyed—I found no tracing from this plate—the officer took possession of all these things, and we then returned to the Bank of England—on the way there the prisoner said "I did the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales"—I know the prisoner's writing—this "J. Green, 90, Murray Street, Hoxton" on the top of this cancelled 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note is in the prisoner's writing to the best of my belief.</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard the last witness give his evidence; it is quite correct—I have known the prisoner for about eight years—four or five years ago I lost sight of him, and then six months ago I saw him again—two or three days before I went to the bank with him he said he had been robbed of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by his lawyers—on the Wednesday when I spoke to him about these printed notes, the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I asked him to write down what he thought he was going to get for them, and he wrote these figures: 1,000, 100, 50, 50, summing it up as 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted to get ten 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't recollect what was for the two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I had got possession of these notes I told him to go and fetch Mr. Edwards—he went out, and ran back in two or three minutes and told me if any one asked me where I got the notes from I was to say they belonged to the West London Imperial Benefit Building Society—they had offices at my establishment at one time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at 17, Hatton Wall, Holborn—on Christmas night I went to bed about half-past 8 or a quarter to 9, having locked up my house safely and put my dog down below in the workshop—outside my place I had two long ladders reaching up above the top of the house, 60-step ladders—next door to my house is the Hat and Tun public-house—I was sleeping on the first floor—I was awakened by my wife, and jumped out of bed—the gas-jet was just alight—I saw the prisoner stooping down on the couch as if he had just come in through the window—there are two windows in front of my house, which open both top and bottom, and are about 2 feet 6 inches by 6 feet—I ran and caught him by the throat, while my wife turned the gas up—I had a good look at him, I knew him well—we had a scuffle, and he got out of the window—his coat came open because the pin gave way and scratched my hand; I saw the pin—I had seen the prisoner every day before for months—he escaped down the ladder at the front of the house—he got jammed between my name board and the ladder, and I tried to get hold of him, but he slipped down like a boy with his legs—there was a new lamp outside the public-house, and I had a good look at the man I am positive he was the prisoner—it was 20 minutes to 10 when I looked at my clock—I afterwards gave information and a description of the man to the police, and I went in company of Bendell to one or two public-houses, and then to the Hat and Tun public-house, where we found the prisoner—that must have been about 10 o'clock—among other places before that I had gone to Mrs. Gobie's, where the prisoner was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188601110044"/>
               <p>employed; we did not find him there—on the road to the station the prisoner said, "You have made a mistake; it ain't me at all"—he hesitated till the policeman put his hand on his staff, and then he went—a little boy ran out of the public-house and two women, who said, "You have got the wrong man, policeman; there is a little boy that has seen all about it"—the policeman said, "Come along with me, my little man," and the boy went with us—at the corner of Hatton Wall and Hatton Garden the policeman said to the boy, "What do you know about it, my little man?"—the boy said, "A big tall man with a black coat ran out of the front door"—the policeman said, "You don't know anything about it, my little boy, for the man came down the ladder"—the man in my room had on a low hat and a long overcoat with no buttons on it, which came down to his knees, and long pins—if it had buttons I could have held him when I caught him in my room—one of the pins ran into my hand; my wife saw the wound, and gave me a handkerchief to wrap round it—I did not show it to any one at the station, but I said, "See what he has got in his coat, something has run into my hand"—subsequently I was present when the policeman examined him at the station, and this pin was found in his coat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hatton Wall leads down to Farringdon Road—four days out of the week the ladders are in front of my house—I instructed a solicitor to prosecute, and gave him certain instructions—the pin was not in the prisoner's coat-tails—I did not mention to the Magistrate about the pin in the prisoner's coat, I was not asked about it—the first person I spoke to about it was Inspector Oulet at the station—I forget if I spoke to the constable who took the man into custody about it—I prosecuted a man named Brownie for an assault on me—the Hat and Tun is about the distance from here to the wall from my shop—since I prosecuted Brownie I have not seen him twice in four months—I have not seen him since this burglary—previous to it I did not see him con<lb/>stantly about the yard—he has not worked for me—I have not driven him—the boy gave the constable his name and address, the constable asked for it—a woman and a boy both cried out that I had got hold of the wrong man—the woman was half drunk—the constable did not get her name and address, she ran back into the public-house again—as the prisoner got down the ladder I said, "I know you, I will have you"—I afterwards found him in a public-house within 10 yards of my house drinking—I know nothing about where the prisoner works; he was always sitting in Mrs. Gobie's stable, and I naturally supposed I should find him there; he is always there, and has been for six or seven months—some person tried to break into my house about six months ago—right opposite to my house are model dwellings—the prisoner slid down the ladder into the front of my house.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—on Christ<lb/>mas night I went to bed and to sleep, and was awakened by a noise; I heard the window slid up and saw the blind move, and I called out to my husband—we jumped out, and I turned the gas up—there was a very short struggle between my husband and the man—I did not see his face, only his form—he was dressed in a long coat and a sort of Oxford low hat—I saw him as he twisted round the ladder—my husband was at the window too—I know the prisoner and Brownie—it was not Brownie, he</p>

I know you, I will have you"—I have known the prisoner a long time about the neighbourhood—I only know Mrs. Gobie as living in the neighbourhood, I do not visit her.</p>

At 10 minutes to 10 on Christ<lb/>mas night the prosecutor came to me in Hatton Garden, and I went with him to his house, against which two ladders were lashed—he made a communication to me and gave me a description of a man—in consequence I went with him to Mrs. Gobie's and to one or two public-houses, and afterwards to the Hat and Tun public-house, adjoining the prosecutor's house—there is a new lamp there and a good light—I found there the prisoner, another man, a woman, and a little boy in the front of the bar—the prosecutor picked him out as the man that had entered his house through the window—the little boy came up to me, but the woman and man stayed behind and shouted out "You have got the wrong man"—I told the boy to follow me to the station and tell the inspector all about it, but he did not go there, but followed close behind me and shouted "You have got the wrong man, policeman, he was a tall man with a long coat"—I saw the prisoner's hand after the charge was taken the same night, it appeared as if it had been pricked by a needle—I examined the prisoner at the station, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pocket-knife, and a large pin which he had in the breast of his coat to fasten it together, as he had no buttons on it—the pin was two or three inches long—it is the same coat as he has on now—at the station he said he did not know what they wanted to bring him there at all for.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A good many of the crew were present when Captain Kennerley struck me—he struck me severely, and my face was marked—I do not think he can strike hard—I was treated by the doctor in Gibraltar afterwards—he never complained of my conduct as purser on the passage out—I had charge of all liquor and spirits on board—I do not remember Captain Kennerley complaining of my supplying his chief officer with drink while on duty, but I may have done so—it was not my duty to look after the officers—the captain was very particular about liquor—I had charge of it until he broke the bond and broke into the spirit-room, and there was no way of locking it up—I do not know that I ever saw the chief officer drunk on that ship—liquor was always supplied by a wine card—I do not know who supplied liquor to officers on duty—there were several stewards on board, and I supplied it to them—Captain Kennerley did many funny things; he told me to stop all drink, and he told me 10 minutes afterwards not to do so—he never said that he had 70 lives on board, and he would not have drink given to his chief officer while on duty—I believe the goods were bought by Mr. Mills, and I believe I said "I object to say to say whether those goods were paid for by Captain Kennerley's acceptance"—he made use of my name, and there is an action pending—he said he did not want me to ruin him—the acceptances were not backed by me; I mean that Captain Kennerley signed my name, and he had no authority whatever—there had been an arrangement between us previously, but we both signed our own names—he paid back 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my nominees when he owed me about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say that he owed me that as purser; I was half owner originally with Captain Kennerley—he paid me my money back after using it, but not my full money—he did not complain to me on the way out, and tell me that he would leave me at Gibraltar—after I was landed there I saw one of the passengers, Mr. Arthur Fitzroy Somerset—he was not left behind in the same way that I was; he was too late for the ship—the ship was there some days, but this was all prearranged—the Tyburnia is not a steamer—I did not look after the wind—I do not know that if we had not sailed at the last moment we should have been bound up for five or six weeks—the port captain sent a steam launch after the vessel, seeing her make sail—Tangier is some considerable distance down the Gut of Gibraltar—I received a verbal roundabout message late on Saturday night about 10.30 when I had gone to bed; I was then under orders—I did not state after I had been left ashore that no assault had been committed, but that I intended to make an assault out of it—Mr. Arthur Fitzroy Somerset was one of the passengers, and I believe he is part owner—I never made such a statement to him—I swear to-day that I was very badly assaulted and marked—there was no possibility when I got that message, of my joining the Tyburnia—there are not two lines of steamers running across daily; there is constant communication between Tangier and Gibraltar, but there is no regularity; they are only tug boats—Mr. Barstow came there, and I saw him purchase some paraffin oil, but I swear he did not tell me that he had been sent by Captain Kennerley—I did not go with him because I was not ordered by the captain of the port; how could the captain of</p>

I live at Hammersmith—I was storekeeper on board the Tyburnia; she is a British ship—on 13th November, while lying off Gibraltar, I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor "You must leave the ship," or something to that effect; "will you go by force or peaceably?"—he said that he would elect to go by force, and Captain Kennerley asked the boatswain to remove him, and the boatswain said "I beg your pardon, Captain Kennerley; it is not my duty"—Captain Kennerley said "I must do it myself," and placed his hand on Jones's collar and led him to the gangway—that was the last saw; I did not go ashore in the boat—a steam launch afterwards came alongside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice any mark of violence on Mr. Jones—I did not see Captain Kennerley assualt or strike him—I heard the captain complain to Jones on the voyage, of his supplying his officers with drink, but only once—I have said that I saw Jones drunk at Gibraltar; that was before he was put off the ship—I said "Captain Kennerley did not use any force, but merely put his hand on Jones's collar"—I gave seen the chief officer drunk in charge of the ship—Captain Kennerley was a most careful captain; I never saw him touch liquor—I know that he sent Mr. Barstow across from Tangier to bring Mr. Jones back—I cannot say whether he gave him his fare; all I know is that Mr. Barstow left the ship and came back without him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passenger on board the Tyburnia—I was on board at Gibratlar on November 3rd, and occupied the same cabin as Jones on that night—the door was closed, but Captain Kennerley came, and I heard him say "You must get your things together, Jones, as we are going to sail"—Jones said that he had no intention of leaving the ship unless force was used, but eventually he got his things together, and they went out of the cabin together, and I afterwards saw them on deck together—the captain ordered the first officer to put him off the ship, to treat him as gently as possible, and not use force—the chief officer went up and said that he had such instructions, and he hoped he would comply and not give trouble—Jones said he would not leave, and the captain ordered the boatswain to put him off, who said that he had done something of the kind before, and got 14 days' imprisonment for it—it the captain advanced to Jones, put his hand on his shoulder, and they walked to the boat.</p>

               <p>I received a letter from Mr. Permayne, who is connected with McLean's, asking me to call at the gallery, which I did on 20th November, and he showed me the picture as it now is, with the whole sentence "B.W. Leader 1881"—I afterwards saw Mr. Salmon, and told him I had seen the picture and identified it as mine, and given a memorandum to that effect to Mr. Permayne—I do not think he said anything, but he seemed annoyed—I did not see him again till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi>. If this picture was in the Academy I should charge 75 or 100 guineas for it; it is difficult to say the price—I have a picture now in the French Gallery, and I have sold pictures at 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. smaller than this—I suppose 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be a fair price for it—I say that the date was 31st October because I have looked at my book; the entry is on page 51, "Repainting Welch landscape on the Gladys, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I wrote the first part of that up to the price, on the 31st—that meant that I had done the work and returned the picture the same day—that was the day the picture was delivered and when the money was due—that entry was made that day—I did not get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day—the entry was not all made at the same time; I remember writing it perfectly well—this is the only book I keep—I put it down as having delivered a certain work; the payment would be on the other side—I got a cheque on the 31st—when Mr. Salmon began to talk to me about Mr. Leader's signature I thought it might be that he was going to buy a picture; I did not inquire, but made it out—I should think the signature on this picture was copied from my paper—I know Leader's signature very well, and on the paper I did my best to imitate it—I had not the slightest notion that there was anything wrong in what I was doing—when I was asked to go upstairs and see how it was going on I said "What?" and he said, "Come up and see," and when I got up I saw Mr. Meadows sitting at the easel—he had done "B.W. Le," and my presence did not prevent his going on—I saw what he was doing and went away; I did not stop to look whether he was copying from the paper which I had written, but I have not the slightest doubt of it, and never had—this is my signature to this information—I suppose it was read over to me—I was sworn before I signed it—the latter part of it is not true—I swore that I did not know who painted the name on the picture because I did not want to get Mr. Meadows into trouble—I am sure the picture did not go back on the 30th, it went back on Saturday and not on Friday evening, the 30th—I do not know who let me in when I called at Mr. Salmon's on the 31st, bat very likely a man called Sillito, junior—I don't remember his going upstairs, but I went up—I had not had a conversation with Salmon in Mr. Meadows's presence as to a gentle<lb/>man requiring a copy of a Leader—I do not remember calling at Mr. Salmon's and seeing him with four of my pictures before him, Mr. Meadows being present—he did not say <hi rend="italic">"Bob,</hi> I want a copy of a Leader, which will make the best of these pictures?"—there was no conversation of that kind, nor did I sit down on a chair and point to this picture, nor did Mr. Salmon say "That is the one Meadows and I thought"—Sal<lb/>mon did not ask me if I knew Leader, but I said that I did—that was on the day I took the picture home—he said "Will you put the name on?" and I said "I know Leader, and I will not have anything to do with such a thing as putting the name on"—he did not ask me if I could get one of Leader's pictures in order to make a copy from it; nor</p>

               <p>did I say "No, I know what I can do, I can go to M'Lean's, in the Haymarket, where I have several pictures, and there is one of Leader's there"—I do not know whether there was one of Leader's pictures there—I had no picture there, and I was not in the habit of going there—I did not go there shortly before 30th October and see a picture of Leader's there and examine it before I did anything to the picture—I did not take the picture away with me on the first occasion from Mr. Salmon's, because I had to go elsewhere—it was sent—I did not leave it at Mr. Salmon's, go to M'Lean's gallery, and then go and fetch it away myself—if my information states "He asked me to brighten it up, I took it away with me," I suppose I swore it, but it is not true—I made a mis<lb/>take, I had a picture which I took away, but not on that date, and I mistook it; I took away a picture from Mr. Salmon's a short time after, and when I took the picture down on the morning of the 31st it was wet, and it was packed with another canvas, and when I was at Mr. Salmon's I unpacked the picture in question and wrapped the other canvas which I took as a protection, in paper; and when I said I took the picture away it was the recollection of having taken the canvas away; that is the only explanation—on Saturday, the 31st, I went to Mr. Salmon—I can<lb/>not say whether Sillito let me in; I did not go straight up to Mr. Mea<lb/>dows's painting-room immediately I entered the house, nor did I produce to Mr. Meadows a piece of paper with Leader's name on it, and the figures 1881—I will not be sure whether the picture had my name on it when I brought it on October 31st; my name was on it when I received it on the Tuesday before, when I began to brighten it—in the course of brightenning, my name may have got out—the picture was not in the room when I was talking to Mr. Salmon, and when I went upstairs I did not stop to look, I went away at once—brightening up is putting on lighter and darker colours, and my name might have been painted out in the process—I will not—I did not ask Mr. Meadows to put my name on the picture as I had not got my colours with me—I certainly did not hold the paper I had written, while he copied it—he did not begin to write it slanting, nor did I correct him—I do know that Arthur Gordon, a nephew of Mr. Meadows, was painting in an adjoining room—I know him by name.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Tulls as auc<lb/>tioneers at 17, Fenchurch Street—I have known the defendant three or four months—our first transactions with him were a sale of furniture privately, and another by public auction—he called at our office early in October, and said that he had purchased some pictures and marble statuary and bronzes from the collections of the Recorder of Essex, and Colonel Constable, and asked if I would sell them; I agreed, on the usual terms, and the sale was fixed for November 5th and 6th—he sent me the advertisement of the coming sale and this poster (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Leader's name is not in it. (<hi rend="italic">This mentioned pictures by Gallon, Meadows, &amp;c</hi>. ) On October 23rd we received this letter: "Gentlemen,—Please advertise in the Cannon Street sale a fine landscape by Leader. Yours truly, J. <hi rend="smallCaps">SALMON."</hi> In accordance with that letter I caused Leader's name to be inserted, and it appears in this draft—I received this document from Salmon for the purpose of preparing the advertisement—that was after the preliminary advertisement appeared; it mentions the names of the artists—Salmon prepared the catalogue; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Lot 60 is "B.W. Leader, A.R.A., A Stream in Summer Time, in South Wales"—that refers to this picture—he gave me some figures which I have in the margin, saying that those were the prices he paid for them, and he could not let them go for less—the figure against this lot is 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he gave me with other sums, as the cost of the various articles, including pictures—the sale took place as advertised on November 5th and 6th—there was much bidding for this picture, and before it commenced I read the description of it from the catalogue, and then the bidding commenced—I know Mr. Meadows; I cannot say whether he bid—the picture was sold to Laporell, a broker, who I had never heard of before—I did not then know that it was not a Leader—this is the delivery note for it, and this cheque for 154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid—that included other lots, as appears by the delivery note.

               <p>for a Leader picture, which do you think will make the best subject?"—Gallon said "That is the best subject for it," or words to that effect, and Salmon replied "That is the one Bill picked out," meaning myself, "I think I will send it up for him to make it as much like Leader's as he can," meaning sending it to Gallon's house—he said "Can you get a picture of Leader's to copy?"—Gallon said that he could not do that, but he could see one at McLean's gallery—McLean is a picture dealer in the Haymarket—I am not acquainted with him—Gallon said that he had several of his pictures there hung on the line, but that Leader's picture was in a corner, and that either McLean or the manager made the observation that it was not a good picture, and that Gallon's pictures were worth more money in proportion than Leader's—I think I was there when the picture was sent to Gallon's, because I remember it by taking it—I was at Salmon's on Saturday, the 31st, and heard Sillito bring a picture upstairs, but I did not see him—when I went into the room Gallon set the picture up somewhere, I forget whether he put it on the easel—this is the picture—Gallon handed me this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced, with "W.B.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I have paid attention to the evidence in this case—I have never before heard of having a copy of an artist's picture, and afterwards having his signature put on it—I have seen seven or eight pictures with my name on them—I never knew a respectable dealer sell a copy with the name of the real artist, and when a picture is sold with another artist's name on it it is always pronounced a forgery—I should no more think of putting another man's name on a picture than I should of putting another man's name to a cheque—the name on the picture indicates the actual painter—a copy of a picture means a copy of the style as well as the subject, and sometimes the style is the important thing—I do not see any resemblance in this to the style of my pictures; it is similar in subject but not in execution—it could not be called a copy of a Leader unless the signature was there—it is not a copy of any work of art of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The execution is very much below mine—I do not always paint my signature in quite the same colour; if it is a light picture I use a light colour, and if it is dark, dark colour—in a grey landscape I should not use a tint which would warm the picture—I generally use the left-hand corner—the practice of most artists is to write their name in dark brown or black, and that will harmonise with all colours; a brick red was used some years ago—some of the old masters, such as Durer, worked their signatures or initials into the landscape, and it was part of the picture; therefore you could not copy Durer without painting the signature; but I know of no modern instance—I have never painted copies since I was a student, and then I never put the signatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> With regard to living artists, I should say that the name is never put on a copy, except for the purpose of frau✗d—Albert Durer painted 400 years ago.</p>

I said that I never knew of copies being made and the original names put on, but I do not call this a copy of a picture of mine, it is somebody else's picture with my name on it; it is like mine, and some people say that there is a similarity, but I do not see it—it would be a stretch of the imagination to say that it was after me—it would be noticed that it was not by the artist, but a picture painted to imitate it; just as a man might write a literary work in imitation of Swift.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of a gallery in the Haymarket—the word "copy" is applicable to cases where there is no original to copy from; they imitate the style from recollection; but the actual artist's name in the corner is only imitated when a fraud is intended, no respectable dealer would do it—Mr. Gallon never had any picture at my place before this matter, here is a catalogue of all the pictures that were in my gallery at that time, nor had I any of Leader's—it is all imaginary about my having a row of Gallon's on the line and a Leader in the corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I thought Mr. Gallon's picture rather clever, and I bought one and sold it, and he left another—I understand what is meant by a copy of an artist, although it is not a copy of a particular subject and there is no actual original—it would be signed by the man who painted it, but it would not be after Millais—as a rule with the old masters a copy of a Tintorelli would be called "After Tintorelli because they are in our public galleries—artists usually choose colours for their names in keeping with the tone of the picture.</p>

I am quite certain that the interview was on Saturday, the 31st; it was not on Friday—I do not remember being there 10 days before, when Salmon had four pictures before him—at no time before or after the picture was bought at Johnson and Dymond's was it put with three others and submitted to me—Salmon did not say, <hi rend="italic">"Bob,</hi> which do you think will make the best Leader? I have got an order for a Leader"—he sometimes called me <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>—he did not say that he had an order for a Leader, nor did I say "That is the best subject nor did Salmon say "That is the one <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> picked out meaning Meadows—he said he would send it up to me, but nothing about making it like a Leader—I did not say, "I have several pictures at McLean's hung on the line, and there is one of Leader's in the corner;" that would not have been true—Mr. Meadows was sitting in the roon when I went up, and I did not go up when I first went into the house—this is the piece of paper—I did not have it in my hand at all while Meadows was painting—it was about 10.30 on Saturday morning when I went there—I have never known of copies of pictures having artists' names put on them.</p>

Burgoyne's premises—in about five minutes he joined Michaels—Brett then joined them; they went into the Wool Exchange public-house, Moorfields—Brett looked very bulky when he came out—he then went into the Plough—I continued to watch the prisoners with Austin on succeeding days from December 1st to the 15th, and on the 15th about 9.20 a.m. I saw Brett come out of Mr. Burgoyne's yard—he looked very stout—I followed him to the Wool Exchange public-house, where he had a drink and came out and I followed him to Blomfield Street to the City Arms, where he joined Moss and Michaels—I saw Brett communicate with them through a window, and about five minutes afterwards Moss and Michaels came out—I followed Moss across the Road—he was carrying a parcel—I said "I am a police officer; what have you got there?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Where did you get it?"—he said "I picked it up"—I said "Where?"—he said "Round the corner"—I said "What were you going to do with it?"—he said "Take it to the station"—I said "What station?"—he said "Great Eastern Street"—I said "I shall take you to the station, where you will be charged with others in custody for stealing drugs from Mr. Burgoyne"—Sergeant Wright examined the parcel at the station—it contained 1 lb. 10 oz of saffron—on the same day when Brett came out I said to him "I am a police officer; who are you looking for, <hi rend="italic">Horney?</hi>"—that is a nickname I used—he said "Who is <hi rend="italic">Horney?</hi>"—I said "The man you gave the parcel to this morning; I shall take you to the station"—Austin was with me.</p>

Burgoynes, in Coleman Street—Brett was brought in by Smith about 12.30 and charged with stealing; he pointed to Michaels and said "That man has drawn me into this, some time ago I had some betting with him and could not pay him"—Michaels did not contradict that, but he said "Some time afterwards he gave me a piece of paper to take into the warehouse, to the two" men referring to Cutler and Brett, "and another man"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "Charley"—he afterwards pointed out Bill the porter—I charged Cutler at the ware<lb/>house with stealing the saffron and the bottle of peppermint—he said that he had stolen it and given it to Brett to take out, and he ought to have brought the money back—I have known Moss eighteen or nineteen years and Michaels six or seven years.</p>

I am one of the firm and Jones and Son, of St. Paul's Churchyard—the prisoner was our porter up to 15th December, we had a character with him when he came about nine months before—it was his duty to take out things which were given to him—he slept on the premises every night—we began to close on Saturday at 4.30—we have three establishments—we had a stall at the Inventions Exhibition, which closed on November 9th, and on November 10th a portmanteau containing among other things this little brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to the prisoner—it is worth a guinea—it is exactly similar to the ones in the parcel—he had no authority to deal with the portmanteau in any way, he was a mere porter, he had no right to open it—it was strapped but not locked—I have a brother in partnership with me.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Mead, of Newgate Street, manufacturer of fancy goods—I know the prisoner by sight—I occasionally take my lunch or dinner at the King's Head, Gannon Alley—I was there on 10th November, the day after the Inventions Exhibition closed, and saw the prisoner there at lunch between 1 and 2 o'clock—he had a port<lb/>manteau full of jewellery with him, and before he left the table he opened it, took a portion of the contents out, and put them on the table—there was a general conversation—he said that he had brought the portmanteau from the Inventions Exhibition as the stock from Messrs. Jones's stall—I knew Messrs. Jones by name—I saw some bracelets and brooches, a large number of guitars, and other articles—I purchased this brooch of him for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took it from a parcel containing a large number of brooches in white tissue paper, which he produced from the portmanteau—I paid him for it—he said that the portmanteau contained jewellery to the amount of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>brought it there that day about 5 or 6 p.m.—it was strapped up—I examined the contents and checked them the day after—I did not find this brooch there—I took the articles out and put them into stock—this was the only one of these brooches we had in stock—the prisoner slept on the premises—on Saturday, 21st November, we closed at 4.30—this is a plan of the premises (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are open, with a gas light inside—there is a Hobbs lock on the door, and this bar was up, and a brass disk covers up the keyhole—the prisoner was in when we closed, and the padlock and bar would go over the lock of the door, but when he was inside, the padlock would not be on—he had full charge of the premises from Saturday night till Monday morning, and had strict orders to let no one in—he was allowed to go out, but I said, "You must be home by 10.30 every night, and if you are found out a minute after 11 at night you will be immediately discharged"—he ought to have been there at 10.30 on this Sunday night—when he went out he would put on the padlock and bar, which would show the policeman that he was out—the gas in the shop would be left alight—the door is always locked, and the bar is padlocked with another Hobbs lock, and then the police have to look out—there is an electric apparatus behind the counter, and a trap on the floor, which is covered with linoleum, and in walking over that spot a person would strike the electric apparatus, which would set an alarum going which would go on for 48 hours, and there is no way of stopping it unless you know where the little handle is which is called a switch, the handle of which is also concealed—the handle is at the side of the trap, and in setting it we have to step over the trap—the same alarum is also attached to the glass case of the window, so that if anybody steps over the carpet and goes to the window that would also give an alarm—the window has a casement, the door of which must be opened to get to the goods, and directly it is opened off goes the alarm—I left between 4.30 and 5 o'clock on Saturday, leaving 20 gold watches, 28 silver watches, 70 gold chains, and 56 gold brooches safe and in their proper places, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment, amount<lb/>ing roughly to about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 30 gold watches hung on brass rods—there was a tray containing some bracelets in front of the window and inside the second alarm—one case was made just too high, and it reached over another shelf, and this tray of bracelets was put so, and the easiest way to bring that tray out was to draw it, but this one was too high, so we had to reach over the window to get it, because a glass shelf on top contained jewellery, and if it was lifted up it would upset all the articles—the prisoner was in the habit of cleaning the windows, but h✗e had not to deal with that tray—he had heard me say that there was a particular way of removing it without disturbing the stock—I found the tray con<lb/>taining the bracelets had been removed on the Monday morning in the only way in which it could be properly removed, therefore it must have been removed by some person who was well acquainted with the mode of doing it—I saw the prisoner on the Monday morning before I saw the premises—he was brought to my private house by a detective—he said, "You have been robbed of a lot of jewellery, Sir"—I at once went with him and the detective to the shop—we got there about 7.30 or 7.45—the large padlock was then missing which was on the bar, and I found the bar not in its place, but in the shop—there was not the slightest sign of tampering with the street door; there was no forcible opening or</p>

               <p>signs of chisels or anything of the sort—the first thing I saw on going inside was a hammer, a screwdriver, and a file belonging to me, which had been taken out of a drawer—I went to the safe and found that perfect—I then went to the electric apparatus and found that in perfect order, but the switch had been turned off so that the bell would not ring—I always looked to see that the bells were set; it was Hennessey's duty to set them—I examined the window case and the bracelet tray—that had been taken out of the window in the way that it is usually taken out, and all the bracelets were gone—just behind that tray there was a glass shelf which had held studs and other things; they were left, the goods were in order as when I went away—I found the brass rods left, on which the watches had hung, but the watches were gone; the little hooks were all in order; three or four watches were left.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi>). On Monday morning, 23rd No<lb/>vember, I was on duty about 100 yards from the prosecutor's premises and heard a noise, and saw the prisoner, as I thought, in the act of closing the door; he then came towards me and said "Where is my padlock and bar?"—I said "I don't know, what about it?"—he said "I put it on my door this morning about 11 o'clock"—I said "You mean Sunday morning"—he said "Now I have just come home and find it is off and gone"—I said "You were not here at all last night," meaning Saturday night—he said "No, I slept out by the Elephant and Castle with a woman"—I went with him to the prosecutor's shop, and on the way I said "Have you been inside the shop?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you find anything wrong there?"—he said "No, but there must be something wrong because the padlock and bar are gone"—I said "How did you find the door?"—he said "That was fast and all right and I unlocked it"—we then got to the shop, and Wilson, who was on the beat, came from the opposite direction and met us there—I said to Wilson in the prisoner's presence "Do you know anything about the padlock and bar being off, Wilson?"—he said "Yes, sergeant, I found the bar off and standing in the corner of the doorway"—the prisoner said "What time was that, Wilson?"—he said "A little after 10, just as I came on," meaning 10 on Sunday—the prisoner said "I was not near here then," and unlocked the door with the key and went into the shop—the gas was alight in the usual way—when we got in I said "Where do you usually keep your padlock and bar when you take it off?"—he pointed to a glass counter on the inside of the door on which I saw this hammer, and said that was where he usually said it when he came in—I said "Now do you see anything wrong?"—he said "No, but the padlock and bar are off"—he was going behind the counter, and I said "Stop a minute, you have an electric alarm bell there, we don't want to spring that bell now to cause an alarm outside"—he said "That won't spring, it was out of order on Saturday night"—I looked behind the counter and said "There is no one there"—I found the door of the show case unfastened, and found this little brass bar on the floor which fixes four doors at the corners, and there in a padlock—I said what is this?"—he said "That goes on here"—I said "What fits</p>

               <p>this?"—he said "A padlock" that was lying on the floor close to the show case from which a large quantity of these articles were taken—some rods were lying on the floor, but the watches were gone—I had previously been into the back room where he pushed open the mirror door and said "Oh, my God, what is this?"—I said "What is the matter?"—he said "Oh, my poor master; he will be ruined"—a small gas jet was burning—a number of jewellery cases were lying on the floor and on a table empty, and mixed up with a quantity of papers about the floor was a shirt, and some collars, socks, bed clothing, and a counter<lb/>pane—two jackets were lying on a table on top of some of the jewellery—I said "Do you know anything about these jackets?"—he said "Yes, they are mine; they have been taken down from a peg," and he hung them up again—he went to some folding doors, pulled them open, and said "Oh, good God, all my things are gone"—I said "What have you lost, then?—he mentioned socks, collars, shirts, and a pair of trousers—I asked if those were his things lying on the floor—he said "Yes; but I do not see my trousers"—I went down to the basement with him, and he said "Some one has been down here and turned out one of the gas jets; I left two burning when I went out"—we then returned to the shop—I said "Where is this bell situated?"—he pointed to the left, to the side of a case, and said "The bell is there, and part of the battery is there, and the other part is under the counter," pointing to the place—I said "It is a pity it should have been out of order"—he then showed me the floor, where if a person stepped on it it would ring—he stepped on it, and said "If it was in order it would be ringing now"—he put his hand under the case and made it ring—I said "It is ringing all right now"—he said "Yes, when I put my hand there"—I told him to stop the ringing as it would alarm people, and he stopped it—I then said "Now will you show me your case?"—I picked up this chisel, file, and hammer from the floor, and said "Do you know any<lb/>thing about these?"—he said "Yes, they belong to the place," and showed me where they were kept—I also picked up a gold watch and other jewellery—he gave me a door key and padlock key tied together; they were both patent keys—I then examined the front door, and locked and unlocked it several times—I looked with my lamp but could find no marks of any forcible entry—I said "Have you not been here since you left yesterday morning?"—he said "No"—I said "Then who has had your keys?"—he said "No one; they have not been out of my possession," and he undid his waistcoat and showed me the pocket where he kept them—I said "Just tell me where you have been, just account for your time since you left yesterday morning"—he said "I left here about 11 o'clock and saw a sergeant in Paternoster Row and spoke to him, and he saw me get on an omnibus; I rode as far as Chancery Lane, and then walked back and went to my brother's house, 12, Omega Place, Ford Square; I arrived there about 4 o'clock; I had a steak for my dinner there, and we then went out for a walk and met Jim Berry, and walked about till we met another friend called Charlie; we spent our time walking about and in public-houses; when I came home I found the padlock and bar off"—I said "What do you think is the cause of its being off?"—he said "I thought the governor was here, as I ought to have been in by 4 o'clock"—I said "When you came in did you expect to see Mr. Jones here?"—he said "Yes; I stamped with my foot on the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took no note of the conversation, but I paid parti<lb/>cular attention to what he said—I did not know that he would be tried; he was not accused, and I was endeavouring to find out something about the robbery.</p>

Ambrose Jones and Detective Palmer at St. Paul's Churchyard, and sai✗d to the prisoner, "I am a police officer; what do you know about the robbery?"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "Did you sleep here last night and Saturday night?"—he said "I came home between 12 and 1 midnight on Saturday; I left again about 1.15 a.m.; I walked down Ludgate Circus and met a prostitute; I stopped with her in a street near the Elephant and Castle, and left her about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, and came to the shop, and arrived here about 10.15; I left again about 11 a.m. and walked up Paternoster Row, and met a sergeant of police; I spoke to him, and walked to Smithfield, and then to Holborn Circus, where I took an omnibus, and got down at Berners Street or Newman Street, Oxford Street; I went to several places in the neighbourhood, and then to 12, Omega Place, Blandford Square, which is my brother's address; I had something to eat there; I then met a man named Charley, with a man named Burke, who lived next door to the Perseverance public-house; my brother was with me; we walked to various public-houses and ultimately arrived at the Duke of York, at the corner of Circus Road; we then went to the Duke of York, Portland Town; I saw Johnson and his wife, who keep the public-house; I do not remember where I was afterwards, I was very drunk; I left my brother and Jim Berry; I had some coffee from an old woman who keeps a stall; I walked and got home about 2 a.m."—I put several questions to him—he said "I cannot account for the bells not going off; I do not know the name of the woman I was with"—Jim Berry is a fighting man; Mr. Jones gave him in custody—I found on him at the station 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said to the prosecutor in answer to the charge "You say this jewellery was worth 1,000 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and you charge me with stealing it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at Messrs.

               <p>not be found, and afterwards, it was found, and instead of going in for small things like that he would go in for a large one—I asked him if he intended doing anything in the matter, because there was a row about it, and his character would be affected—he said that he would let it drop, and would not interfere, as the bracelet had been found—he said that he should get less imprisonment for taking a large quantity than a littlel—I said "What is the use of that? you must be found out before you get to Australia or New Zealand"—he said "I shall stop and face it out, and then go to America," and that he would get somebody to mind what he took-after hearing of this robbery I made up my mind to communi<lb/>cate with the prosecutors—I shall have been there 12 months in February.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made the communication on the evening of the robbery—I was not called at the police-court—I was first asked to make a statement yesterday morning and it was taken down—the police did not see me with regard to this matter—the bracelet was afterwards found at the customer's house—the firm was about to charge him with stealing it, but it turned out that it was a mistake of the customer, and the bracelet had duly reached him—I was on friendly terms with the prisoner—it was in a sort of chaffing way that he said "I should go in for something big"—we were chaffing and joking.</p>

               <p>Marony cautioned Andrews, and told him we were in search of two cases which had been brought there on Friday evening, and he produced samples of the contents, a lady's companion, a purse, a memorandum-book, and a card case—I said "Have you received the cases?"—he said "No, I have not, and I have never seen similar articles before"—Marony looked under his work bench, and pulled out this empty case; it only had some loose paper in it—I searched Andrews's overcoat, which was hanging on a nail, and took from it this cigar case, which he said was given to him by a man named Oliver—Smith is known as Oliver—it corresponded with the missing property, and has been identified—we also found a lady's companion, a tin case, and nine articles in all, which Andrews said were given to him by Oliver and another man—they have been identified—I went into the adjoining room occupied by D'Algnew, who is here—Andrews went with us—we found there a quantity of common card boxes broken up—I found a number of pieces representing 150 boxes, some of which bore the name of Marcus Ward, but not Delarue's—I asked Mrs. D'Algnew how she came by them—she said they were given to her husband by Andrews to light the fire with—Andrews said "That's right"—these card boxes correspond exactly with the boxes missing from the case; here is one which not only contains Marcus Ward's label, but inside "New patented Mascoid process"—there were a number of cases in the consignment—Andrews was taken into custody.</p>

This was a front room on the ground floor, directly off the pavement—there was no shop front; it is like an ordinary dwelling-house, a small room with a workman's bench in the middle—the other room in which I found the boxes was occupied by another lodger—the only part occupied by Andrews was a workshop—Marony spoke first—he said "We are police officers, and we are come to ask you about two cases left here on Friday night"—Andrews said "I know nothing about it"—Marony said "Now, Andrews, be careful, because we have information; this is the chief inspector of the railway company's police, and he will show you the goods which those cases con<lb/>tained," which he did—Andrews said "I have not seen similar goods before"—this is all the property I found in the workshop, but there are other articles to be produced—this tin case was on his work bench, and some other articles upon it.</p>

On the evening of 8th December I went with Crawley and Boultby to Andrews's shop—I said "We are police officers, and have called to see you respecting two cases of goods brought to your place here last Friday"—he said "I don't know anything about it"—I repeated the question several times, and advised him to be very careful—seeing this case there I said "I believe that to be one of the cases"—he said "Two cases were brought here by a man named Oliver and another man who I do not know"—I know Smith as Oliver—Crawley produced some articles, and I told Andrews that they were the kind of goods which the case contained, and said "Have you any of the contents of that case in your possession?"—he said "No, I have not"—Sergeant Bailey produced several things which he found in a tin box and in his great coat, and I said "We say that these goods are the contents, or part of them, of this case; what account have you to give of these?"—he said "Oliver gave them to me"—I was present at the finding of the cardboard boxes—Andrews was taken into custody—on the morning</p>

               <p>of the 10th, at the police-court, Andrews said "After the goods were brought to my place Lee went out, the other two men remained, Oliver and the man whose name I do not know; about three-quarters of an hour afterwards Lee returned with a man whom Oliver called Brown (Lee is Morris), both these men then passed by Oliver and Lee; Brown gave Oliver 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver, which he shared with the other two; Oliver gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then they all left; Brown returned about half an hour after, and put the contents of the cases in a bag and a parcel"—he was about to say some more, but I was called into Court—I took that statement down in writing—I have also a statement on blue paper, that is not what I have been reading from—that statement was made in Andrews's workshop—Oliver's statement is attached to the depositions; that was made at the police-station on the night he was arrested—I reduced it into writing, this is it—he said "At 10.20 p.m. I went to 20, Pitfield Street; I called on Andrews nearly every day; I was in his place about 12 at noon last Wednesday, just as I was going out I saw a man on the opposite side of the street, his name is Lee or Morris; he asked me if I had a stable or any place where he could leave some cases; I replied that I had not, but a back store room, that I would ask Andrews if he had any place; I went and asked Andrews if he had any place where he could put any cases, he said 'I dare say I have if I am paid fer it;' while I was in Andrews's shop I saw a barrow pull up the court opposite, Andrews opened the door and let them in; they were left there, and the two men brought the cases and went away; I stayed some time with Andrews and then left; I went to Andrews again the same morning, he owes me money; I then saw a lot of empty cardboard boxes lying about the place, which he was burning; I stayed there with him I think about three minutes; he gave me no money; I called last night and he was out; I called again to-night, he gave me no money; I believe the young man who pulled the truck up the court, is called Jack, and lives down the court, in Wynyard Street."</p>

On 26th December I was assisting at the bar of the Dolphin in Tonbridge Street, Euston Road, about 9.30—I am a friend of Mr. Groom, the proprietor—the prisoner came in and asked for a small lemon; the barmaid served him—I said "Twopence, please;" he put a penny down—I said "Come on, captain, it will be another penny"—he felt in his pockets and brought out two halfpence; he finished the lemonade and threw the glass down on the floor—I said "You will have to pay for this"—he said "I shall not"—I lifted up the flap, walked to the sixpenny half-penny glass, and you will have to pay 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he said "I shall do nothing of the kind"—I said "You don't wish to get yourself into trouble, why don't you pay me the money?"—he said "I shan't"—I said "Then I shall have to lock you up, that is all, if you decline to pay"—he appeared to fumble underneath the edge of the counter—I turned towards the door to fetch a policeman, the prisoner rushed at me and caught me in the ribs with his left hand, and with his right hand, in which he had a knife, he stabbed me under my left bladebone—I turned round and saw the prisoner coming at me again with the knife in his right hand still—I knocked him down—he got up and made another attack on me; I knocked him down again, and then just had sufficient time to back out of the doors and close them on the centre post—I held them tight till assistance came—I was then taken in a cab to the Gray's Inn Road Hospital, where I was for five days—I was bleeding considerably—I believe the wound has healed, but I am</p>

I live at 13, Ratcliffe Gardens, and on 30th December was house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—I examined Brown's back, and found a wound about two inches below the shoulder-blade, on the left side, about an inch long, and on examination I found it went nearly an inch deep, struck against one of the ribs, and did not go between them; it went in a slightly slanting direction—if it had not struck against the rib it might have gone into and injured the lung—I dressed the wound—it might have been caused by either of these knives—this knife has stains, I cannot say if blood or rust—I have never seen it till now—I should say the blow which caused the wound must have been given with force; it went through his clothing and body—the wound bled a good deal—he was an in-patient up to the Thursday—the wound had not healed when I last saw him 10 days ago.</p>

                  </hi>. On 23rd December I lived at 19, Station Road, Camberwell—I am now a foreman shipwright, working at Chatham Dockyard—on the evening of 23rd December, between 9 and 10 I think, I met the prisoner near the Royal Exchange—she said "Good night; it is rather cold?"—I said "Yes, it is"—she said "Will you stand a liquor?"—I said "I don't mind"—we went into a public-house three or four minutes' walk off—I stood her port wine, and had whisky myself—I paid with money out of my purse—I caught her hand in my right-hand trousers pocket in the public-house, and said "What are you doing with your hand in my pocket?"—she pulled it out, and I held it with my left, and with my right felt that my purse was in my pocket—I used an expression, and said "You have robbed me"—she opened her hand and said "I haven't got anything belonging to you"—there had been between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in the purse—I could tell by the fell that it was</p>

               <p>safe when I took out the purse to pay for the drinks—I said "You infernal thief"—she said "I have not got anything belonging to you"—she went to move away—I caught hold of her and threw her down in a corner, and said "Turn it up"—two constables were sent for, and when they came I said "If you turn it up I won't expose you at all"—she said "I won't have anything to do with you"—one of the customers said to me "If you want your money you must give her into custody"—I tried to coax her, but could not get my money, and so gave her into custody—this comb is mine, and was in my left trousers pocket with this pencil case—I gave neither of them to the prisoner—I first knew I had lost them and she had them was when the constable came—I had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what I was about—I was a little fresh—I knew perfectly well I had lost my money—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know what time it was when I met her—I said afternoon at first before the Magistrate, and then rectified it and said evening—it was dark; the gas was alight—I had had a little more than I ought to take—I had been to High Holborn and the Strand that day, starting about 2 o'clock—I had nothing to drink till 5.30, when I left books at Ludgate Station which I had bought—between 5.30 and 10 I had been to two public-houses before I met the prisoner—I looked at the shops and got up to the Royal Exchange about 7 o'clock, and between there and Leadenhall Market I met the prisoner—this public-house was the only place I went to with her—I did not go to a house of accommo<lb/>dation with her—I did not give her the comb, the value of which was sixpence, to comb her hair with, nor the pencil, value about sixpence or fourpence, to write her address with—I did not give her a sovereign for herself—I don't know what time I went into the public-house—I dare say it was 10 or a quarter-past—I can't say what time the constable came—after he came I said to the prisoner "If you give me my money I will not give you in charge"—she said "I haven't got anything belonging to you"—I would have let her go if she had given it back to me; I did not want the exposure—there was nothing in her hand when I caught it in my pocket—the purse was in my pocket empty—I said before the Magistrate I paid for the drink with loose change I had—I meant that was in one of two fobs I have in my purse—I had not felt her hand in my pocket before—the sovereigns were in the purse by themselves, and the purse was folded up—I suggest she took the purse out, took the money, and put the purse back again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cashier to Mr. Sheffield in March last, and am still in his employment—the prisoner was his managing out door clerk—it was his duty to pay into the Bank of England at the Royal Courts, any moneys that had been received by him—he would come to me when he wanted cheques drawn or money to be given for such purposes—this cheque was made out as it now appears on March 22nd, 1885, but not signed—it is an open cheque, made payable to A. Leving, another clerk in Mr. Sheffield's employ—the reason it was an open cheque and payable to a clerk was because money only is taken at the bank—the prisoner was away in March, and Loving was taking his duty as to paying money into the Bank of England—on or about the 22nd July the prisoner came to me and asked me for that cheque of Elwin's, or words to that effect—this cheque had been signed by Mr. Sheffield the day before, who put a stroke through "March," and put "July"—he signed it on the 22nd, and it was the 23rd when Hunt came to me—I then tore it out and gave it to the prisoner—Mr. Elvyn is our client in the suit <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> Baldock, and quarterly instalments had to be paid into the Bank of England—Mr. Sheffield signed the cheque for that purpose—Leving sits at a desk close to me; I saw Hunt go to him and heard him say "Endorse that cheque"—I did not hear him say where he was going—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a diary kept by the prisoner, in which he enters the work, or some of the work of the day, as a reminder of what he has to do; it is all in his writing—the bills of costs are made</p>

               <p>prisoner was my clerk; he commenced at two guineas a week, and went on to three—he had no other remuneration—he entered my service about June, 1884—on 21st March I ought to have paid into the Court of of Chancery 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I did not do so because I expected to have a counter claim for delivery of abstracts to the vendors in the same matter, and I proposed to set off that claim against the other by the permission of the Chief Clerk, and I had already made an advance to Mr. Elvyn—it is the fact that my balance at my bankers' was overdrawn; they were permitting me to overdraw, and were honouring my cheques—I should mention that up to that point two small cheques were returned—the Chief Clerk's order to me was to pay it, and to come in afterwards for my costs—I had Mr. Aird's undertaking to pay me part of the amount; 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it became necessary about 22nd July that the money should be paid, and the cheque had been drawn as a memorandum, and I then signed it, and it was handed over to the prisoner for the purpose of handing it to the Court of Chancery, and for no other purpose whatever—it was his duty to pay it to the Court of Chancery—he would have to get it cashed first at the bankers'—some considerable time afterwards I saw the entries in his diary, and in the sheet, and also in my ledger, and I entertained no suspicion whatever: but about 29th or 30th August when I was away on audit business in Wales I received a letter, and I asked the prisoner if the money had been paid in—he said "Yes, long ago; why do you worry yourself about it?" and I fully believed that he had paid it in—on 20th August the prisoner had to go to Bordeaux in the action of Wynans and Wynans—Mrs. Wynans went with him—I gave him 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay their expenses, and I subsequently heard, but not from him, that he had borrowed 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Vice-Consul at Bordeaux in my name—it was a ten days' commission, and there were two Sundays—when he returned I requested from him the account of the moneys he had expended, and after some difficulty I got from him this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he had then been discharged and had left my employment—I had lent him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his promissory note, and he had borrowed 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd from my cashier, which is still owing—the railway fare from Bordeaux to Biarritz is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have often gone, but they get a reduction by going to Cook's—the total expenses for two persons for four days are two guineas a day—I have not been able to get them—there are also incidental expenses at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—I have not been able to get that—he gives me credit for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this account—there is no mention of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed in my name in this account—Mrs. Wynans was my client—I did not authorise Hunt to deal with this cheque in any way except to pay it into Baldock's account in Chancery—I did not know of his doing so till some time after<lb/>wards—I had not the slightest suspicion.</p>

               <p>her business, coupling with it the stipulation that I should re-employ Hunt, and I declined to do so—she wanted him to be the person to conduct her business—I had no quarrel with him, I dismissed him on account of his irregularity, and wrote him a letter—I met him once—I had not a great many quarrels with him on account of not allowing sufficient money to meet the expenses of the commission, it was not a matter that rested with me—I only had one discussion with him as to allowing money for the expenses of the commission—I declined to allow him more than 70<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> I said that if more was required, and the commission was extended, he could telegraph to me, and I would send the extra money at once—I received this telegram from Bordeaux, "Don't send money. Hunt, Aug. 31st, 1885"—I returned from Wales on Wednesday, Aug. 29th—the application for money was by telegram, and I think I was in Wales when I received it—I was there three or four days—I made no reply, but I got this telegram, "Don't send money"—he had been written to to send an account of his expenses—the gentleman he borrowed money from lives close to the Grand Hotel, Biarritz—I do not think Hunt left on the day he says he did—he put down "Aug. 21, left for France"—I do not know the date of the commission, as it was changed from time to time; the original day was not before he left—the discussion I had with Hunt about costs was not some days before that, it was on the afternoon of that day, by which I understood that he was going to leave by the night train for Paris—I received 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this very commission; that contemplated costs allowed, subject to taxation by the Chief Clerk—I didn't consider that that was for expenses only, as I paid, I think, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Counsel's fees—I have paid 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a little margin for taxing costs—that was not part of a larger sum which I had received in the matter of Wynans—I did not receive 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not from the husband—all I have received from the wife is about 70<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> more than which I have paid cash out of pocket—these are my books—I kept the diary after Hunt left, and looked at it from day to day—I saw a number of very con<lb/>fidential matters in which he was engaged on behalf of Mrs. Wynans—all these divorce suits are important to the client, there is nothing particular in them from a solicitor's point of view—Mr. Wynans is not a very wealthy man; he has not 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—according to his own evidence, when Mr. George Lewis repre<lb/>sented him in the Divorce Court, he had 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; for the alimony I should have said—Mr. Hunt did not repeatedly during the commission send to me for money while he was absent, nor did Mrs. Wynans—I am not aware that I found any fault with him when he came home for going to Brussels, I have only heard it from Mrs. Wynans quite recently—this account of the approbation is in Mrs. Wynans's writing—when she left me there was the ordinary application upon a change of solicitors that the papers should be handed up, but it was dismissed with costs—there was an application to hand over the accounts; they were not taken into the Registrar's office; you are acquainted with the practice; the Registrar has the power to tax costs between husband and wife, an order was necessary—I cannot say whether Mr. Hunt received one of these instalments of Mrs. Elvyn's—I do not know that Captain Elvyn paid an instalment to Mr. Hunt; he has received large sums to pay to the cashier, and has paid them correctly—it is not important that the instalments should be paid in direct—there are three instalments in</p>

               <p>would telegraph to him—he had dealt honestly with the money in his hands until these matters, but he had no business to borrow 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he alleges rightly or wrongly that I owe him a sum for commission, and I deny it—I have not the slightest doubt about it—I have said "I do not think the defendant has robbed me in any way except as I allege—the defendant had to negotiate liabilities of mine; he might have run away with the money; he did the duty of a managing clerk.</p>

On 26th October, 1885, I went to Liverpool Street—I was shown up to the first floor, and arrested the prisoner on a warrant which I held—I read it to him—he said, "I have a perfect answer to the charge, it is only done in spite."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. St. John Wynans—I am the petitioner in a divorce suit against him—in August last I was a client of Mr. Sheffield, and Mr. Hunt, his managing clerk, was managing my case—Mr. Sheffield had nothing to do with it personally, he always referred me to Hunt, and as far as I know he has conducted my case quite to my satisfaction—the original date when the commission was first to start was the beginning of July, I think—it was postponed to suit my Counsel; it started on 21st August—I remember having a conversation with Mr. Sheffield about the money for going on the commission—he refused to pay more than a certain sum then, but he said he would send a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque as soon as we were out of England—there were several unpleasant discussions between Hunt and Mr. Sheffield about it—this is a fair account—I am liable for it to Mr. Sheffield if he has not received it—if there is anything more my husband or myself are liable for it—Mr. Crisp spent 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, and there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my hotel expenses and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Hunt—I do not think we ever expended less—I have been accustomed to travelling in a <hi rend="italic">coupe</hi> all my life—we had the best hotels and the best dinners—Mr. Wynans has been living at the rate of about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—his brother is the millionaire—I have been accustomed to live in the best style—Mr. Crisp stayed at the same hotel—Mr. Hunt disbursed all that money for himself and me, so far as I know—it was a condition six months previous that Hunt should conduct my case as the condition of my going on with Mr. Sheffield—it was a very important suit for me, and Mr. Hunt knew all about it, and I had every confidence in him and still have—I con<lb/>sidered my interests would suffer if he did not attend to the case after all he knew about it.</p>

I am a journalist, of 8, Treherne Road, Mortlake—early in September last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard,</hi> and called at 1, Great College Street, Westminster, and saw the prisoner—he signed himself "Reginald Cromar, C.E."—I have destroyed that letter—I addressed him as Mr. Cromar—he said he had a great deal of correspondence, and wanted me to conduct it, and I was to advance 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a premium or security—my wages were to be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. weekly, and he said he could get any number of clerks, but if he paid a man he ought to get something for doing it—he said that Mr. Hiscock, who was with him, was about to leave—on 2lst September I entered into this agreement with him. (<hi rend="italic">Engaging the witness as secretary at 2l. weekly and 10 per cent, additional; the witness to advance 100l., which was to be returned, and for which a bill was given at three month after date</hi>).

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188601110100"/>
               <p>London, and when I came back I found the prisoner was gone, and I never saw him again—I afterwards received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he should be back in a day or two, and asking the witness to feed the birds, and enclosing a bill for 54l., payable at the London and County Bank, Charing Cross Branch</hi>).

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. It was a small garden at Twickenham, about double the size of this Court—there were some fowls and 30 pigeons there—he had also three fine-looking dogs, which I thought were prize ones—I once went to Jamrach's in the East End, for Graham—he is a dealer in wild beasts and other animals—I went there to get some parrots—Graham had some white sparrows; I don't know how many—I did some correspondence, but not for the bird trade; it was about chambers in London—all this bundle of papers is in my writing—I don't call that correspondence; it is copying—I did not do much writing for the bird trade while I was there—I understand the bird trade—one or two persons asked for price lists of birds, and we sent them—I lived there, and had my board not quite two months; I had the same board and beer as the prisoner, and I was satisfied—I had also a comfortable bedroom—the furniture of the house was left when I left, and some birds, but the more valuable had been taken away—he did not take the fowls and pigeons—the agreement says "In the event of the failure to repay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you are at liberty to take possession of such stock belonging to the said Graham," but I did not take the fowls and pigeons, because I was told they belonged to the landlord—I unpacked somewhere about 50 or 60 birds that came from Jamrach's, some of which were sold, and some sent away to shows and took prizes—when they came back two pieces of paper came with them saying that such and such a bird had got a first prize—I only know of birds being sent once to an exhibition—I saw a ticket like this: "First for a silver turbit"—that is a pigeon—the prisoner told me he had paid plenty of money for these pigeons and dogs—I don't recollect seeing so many cards as this about the premises; only one or two—I only sent birds away to shows once—I wrote out this price list from the prisoner's directions of all the birds on the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He did not tell me that on 15th June he had dissolved partnership with his late partner and given up the birds—when I came back from London, everything was gone except the pigeons and fowls and some canaries, which the landlady claimed for the rent due to her by the prisoner—I copied a lot of documents informing people about exhibiting birds, &amp;c.—while I was there one or two persons came to the house, for birds, but none were sold—birds were sent to exhibitions, but came back again; there were about 10 sent while I was there—I went to Jamrach's to get some birds; I had a letter and a cage with me, which I left there, and when I came back the prisoner was gone.</p>

I live with my brother, George Simpson, a tailor, of 245, Pentonville Hill—on 21st December, about 2 a.m., I was dis<lb/>turbed by a noise like a door breaking open; we were sleeping in the shop—my brother ran through the next shop, and went out at the front door—he then called me; I went in my shirt to the front door and saw the two prisoners—I went after them down North Street, calling out "Police"—I saw them taken—I had not lost sight of them—I found marks of a jemmy on the shop door, and the bar at the top had been forced clean off.</p>

At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 8th I was called by a constable, and finding from inquiries that Cain had gone up Wellington Street with two companions I went to several brothels, and then to his mother's house, in company with Rutherford, Griffin, and Tomkins—I knocked at the door; there was no answer—Griffin had knocked several times—I heard some one coming up the passage evidently with his boots on—he said, "Who is there?"—I recognised Cain's voice—Griffin called out "Police"—at the same time I heard footsteps hurrying towards the back door—the prisoner was fumbling with the bolt—I called out "Johnny, if you don't open this door instantly I will smash it in"—he unbolted the door, and Griffin and Rutherford rushed up the passage into the back yard—I pushed Cain back into the room on the ground floor, where I found a large fire burning—a young girl, Lizzie Winter, who cohabits with Cain, I believe, was there fully dressed—I left Winter and Cain there in Tomkins's custody, and went into the yard, where I saw two figures two or three back yards from me—the constables were pursuing them over the walls—I heard Griffin shout out, "Stop or I will shoot you!" I assisted in searching for them—we lost them—there are several walls there six or seven feet high covered with glass—the constables were some two or three yards between me and them—I went back to Cain and Winter and said "You will both have to go the police-station: there has been a robbery committed in Artillery Place; you (addressing Cain) were seen going up Wellington Street a few minutes before with two companions"—Wellington Street is in a straight line with Arsenal Place, and runs into it—he said, "I own that; that does not prove that I know anything about any robbery; if they done anything I don't know anything about it"—I asked</p>

On the morning of 8th December I was on duty with Rutherford, Brenchley, and Francis, and went to 9, Collingwood Street about half-past 3 a.m., where Mrs. Cain lived—I knocked, Cain said "Who is here?"—I said "Police"—he said, "What do you want?"—I said "I want to come in"—there was some little delay in opening a bolt—I heard footsteps making towards the back of the house—when I got in I rushed through the house to the back yard with Rutherford, and saw two men on a wall six to eight paces from me; while sitting on the wall they turned round, and looked me full in the face—I turned my bullseye full on them—Hennessy was one of them to the best of my belief—I said "If you don't stop I will shoot you"—I had no pistol—they dropped off the wall and made their escape, after I had followed them over six or seven walls five to six feet high, Rutherford gave me a lift up—on the 21st, about a fortnight afterwards, I went to the police-station, and picked out Hennessy from eight or ten men as having been one of the two I saw on the wall—I had not seen him before that night to the best of my belief.</p>

               <p>the eight or ten men during that time—it was a fine day to my recollection, I had no cape on—we can only ask for volunteers to come in from the street in these cases; the police got in ten minutes eight or ten men about the same height and of fair resemblance as near as they could—none of them were policemen I swear; they were all strange people to me—I could not swear Brenchley came into the yard of Cain's house while I was looking after the men—he came into the passage—I could not swear he was in the yard with me at any time on that night—there were a number of small back yards at the back of Cain's house, and the men scrambled over these and got away—it was a dark night—when I turned my lantern on the men they looked at me for some few minutes—the light shone distinctly on their faces—Marsh Lane is about three and a half miles from Woolwich Police-station, it is in the Greenwich district, being nearer Greenwich than Woolwich—Hennessy was not taken into custody till the 20th—I did not circulate a description of him; I did not know his name—I gave no written report, but I told my sergeant he was a young man about 18 or 20 years of age with no whiskers—that was the only descrip<lb/>tion I gave of him—I do not swear Hennessy is the man, but to the best of my belief he is.</p>

I went to Cain's house on this morning in company of the other constables, and on going through the back door saw two men getting over a garden wall about two walls off—it was a very dark night—Griffin put his lamp on their faces and shouted if they did not stop he would shoot them—we chased them over several walls, and eventually they got away—Hennessy I believe was one of the men, but we only saw their faces while the light was on them—about a fortnight afterwards I picked Hennessy out of seven or eight other men in the station yard.</p>

On 8th December I was on duty in Green's End, Woolwich, with Inspector Mackey, and saw three men, one of whom was Cain (I believe Hennessy to be another, but I could not say certainly) pass in the direction of Artillery Place up Wellington Street at 12.55, about 700 yards from Mr. Walker's shop—about 20 past one on that morning I was in Artillery Place, and saw Ilsley outside Walker's shop—I saw a shutter there lying across a small grating under<lb/>neath the window, and the other shutter was pulled down—the glass of the window was broken, and I found a watch and some chains lying on the pavement—I went to the station, and also to Mr. Walker—I know Cain perfectly well.</p>

On the 19th I saw Hennessy and two other men in Deptford Broadway, about 9.30 p.m.—I took hold of him, and told him I wished to take him into custody for being concerned with Cain in a burglary at Woolwich—Morgan took hold of his other arm; he walked a short distance, and then tried to wrench himself away—he became violent and called on his companions to rescue him—I was in plain clothes—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him these two watches, one in his trousers pocket and one in his watch fob in his trousers; nothing was attached to them—I said "How do you account for having these watches in your possession?"—he said "I picked them up this evening in Marsh Lane tied up in a handkerchief"—I said "Where is the handkerchief?"—he made no answer, and did not produce it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am assistant to Dr. Cavanagh, at 122, High Street, Deptford—on Sunday, 20th December, I saw the deceased at the police-station about 1.30—he was sitting on a form; he was suffering from an incised wound on the forehead in an oblique direction down to the left side—it was a clean cut down to the bone, a trifle over two inches long—more to the right was a contused lacerated wound of an irregular shape, about half an inch long—he made no complaint with regard to other injuries to me—blood was about his face; hæmorrhage had ceased when I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BLACK</hi>. The large wound was a very serious one—I did not notice any brickdust about the wound; the wound was unusually clean—I attended Mrs. Sullivan also—she had some wounds on the head as well as a contusion on the face—the wound on the left side of the deceased's forehead must have been caused by some sharp instrument and with great force—I do not think it could have been done by a broken bottle—a heavy sharp stone or flint might if thrown with great force—a brick would have caused a more contused wound—I should not like to say whether a kick would have done it—the second wound may have been caused by a fall, or a kick, or a rough-edged stone—the deceased's skull was very severely injured—the bone was cut; there was a wound in the brain—the instrument did not go into the brain—at the post-mortem examination the skull was shown to be un<lb/>usually thick—in my opinion the wound was not caused by two indepen<lb/>dent blows—a hatchet might have caused one wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police, residing at 186, Lewisham High Road—I made a post-mortem examination of the deceased on the 28th December—I found several contused wounds; two on the right side and five on the left side of the back; there were several small abrasions, such as might be caused by finger-nails, on the back and on the right side under the arm; they were insignificant abrasions—on the scrotum was a contused wound—on the chest were patches of discoloration, but not of recent date—they could not have</p>

               <p>been caused by this scuffle—over the left eyebrow was an incised wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BLACK</hi>. I did not see the deceased before he died—if the deceased had received a violent kick at the base of the stomach I should expect to see most severe wounds—the discoloration on the scrotum was quite superficial—the kicks did not seem to have been severe, as the contusions were superficial—they could be caused by being knocked about, or by the deceased having tumbled down on some bricks.</p>

                  </hi>., M.P. I am M.P. for N.E. Bethnal Green, and live at Hampton House, Ellingham Road—I am the prosecutor in this case; I complain of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th paragraphs—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the report of the London Gas Stokers' Fund; it was issued by the authority of the committee, of which I was a member—on page 38 there is an appeal for subscriptions to obtain a remission of sentence and to relieve the suffering of their wives and families—I believe the committee also relieved the 16 committed for similar offences before the Magistrate—it says "George Howell, Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of Trades Congress"—I should say there were a great many more than six meetings of the Gas Stokers' Fund Committee—I have not brought the books—I was not the official on that committee—I believe there was a sub-committee; I cannot recollect if I was on that—I cannot tell how many committee meetings I attended—I remember attending one specially when a circular was drafted to the Home Office; no doubt I was present at others—I cannot tell if I was present at the meeting for the distribution of the funds, when 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was voted to the Plimsoll Fund and to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Congress—I did not apply for that, and have no knowledge how it was done—I have no recollection of the circumstances—the two sums were voted to the two committees doing analogous work, and were not voted till after the stokers' wives and families had been relieved and the expenses of the defence and obtaining a mitigation of sentence had been paid—I should be very much surprised to hear that four members of the gas stokers' families did apply for relief after the men came out and could not get it—I cannot say how much of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for auditing the accounts I received—I have subsequently ascertained that was voted and divided between all the auditors for 'bus fares and light refreshments when we met, as we did on four or five occasions—this libel was first made at Stafford—I recollect my name on that Stafford placard; I presume it is a letter from me—when I said that we did not receive a single penny, and that the only money paid for services was that paid to lawyers, it was a mistake so far as the services as secretary were concerned; I said it hurriedly, and I meant no doubt I did not myself receive 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for services—I had no opportunity for reference at the time, and the matter was nearly 10 years old—I did not when I got a copy and saw I had stated a mistake, admit by advertisement or supplementary letter that other people had been paid, the matter did not crop up again—the Plimsoll Seamen's Fund mentioned here was for the purpose of obtaining an amendment in the law with regard to British seamen, and one of the points was with regard to hiring seamen—the agitation was continued till the law was amended by Mr. Burt in 1880—Sir Richard Cross's Act did not alter the law of conspiracy as regards seamen, earlier—I had not sufficient evidence to prosecute Kenny as the author of the libel then or I should have done so—Kenny did not challenge me to reply in public or by letter—I heard whilst attending a meeting of my supporters that a</p>

               <p>meeting had been called the same night in the market place where the challenge was made in my absence—news was brought to my meeting, and I went to the market place—I had nothing to do with Mr. Bone, the secretary of the Democratic Association; I know nothing of him—I have a slight recollection of seeing a copy of Kenny's statement at Stafford—I admit my statement that no one but the lawyers had received a penny for services, was a mistake—Mr. Broadhurst was appointed secretary of the Fund at the first meeting, and I believe his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I am not quite sure if I was present at the first meeting—the minutes of each meeting were recorded and read out at the next one and confirmed—I do not know if the books were preserved; I was not an officer; vouchers were given for every amount—some portion of the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for printing, stationery, postage, and advertising was paid to the <hi rend="italic">Beehive</hi> newspaper; how much I cannot tell—whether Mr. Potter was largely interested in that paper is a question for him, not for me—I see here "Rent of office 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" we met in one of the <hi rend="italic">Beehive</hi> rooms—I can<lb/>not tell what "Treasurer's expenses 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." were for; it included his out-of-pocket expenses for 12 months; that was Mr. Guile; he is not alive now—"Imprisoned carpenters' families 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" there is nothing in the appeal about them—I do not know that the Carpenters' Union had refused to do anything for the carpenters on account of their violent con<lb/>duct towards their fellow-workmen—the Maidstone Trade Council in<lb/>curred expenses, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on behalf of the gas stokers; I don't know now in what way—I am not in a position to say whether the Trades Unions of Maidstone arranged for a demonstration when the men were released—253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was actually disbursed—nothing was said about paying for the defence, because the men had been convicted then, but that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. included the attempt to obtain mitigation of sentence, and the defence at the trial—a person often audits funds in which he has not a beneficial interest, although he is on the committee—I was the secretary of the Parliamentary Committee Trades Congress; in that body auditors are elected from the Congress, which is composed of delegates forming part of the committee and others; it is a peculiarly constituted body—I never heard till nine years afterwards that some of the families had to pawn and sell their household effects to keep the wolf from the door—I heard 12 months after the attack made on me at Stafford that a meeting had been held at Woolwich, and I heard it as if it had been held at that time instead of 10 years after—I do not admit such meeting was held; I have my own thoughts about it—I never heard about it till the attack was made on me—I cannot say who paid for advertising; I saw the vouchers when they were produced to me—I don't remember the sub-committee being called into existence—I did not go down to see the families at Woolwich; I was otherwise engaged—I think the 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lumped together as the sum paid to the families while the men were in gaol, and the separate items are those paid subsequently—men who made a protest at a meeting of the Trades Congress against the voting of the money were turned out for doing so by the men who subscribed the money—I resigned the secretaryship of the Parliamentary Committee in the autumn of 1875. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not the men turned out of the Congress for attempting to get up a discussion on fair trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should prefer that question to be put to Mr. Broadhurst.</p>

               <p>when money was to be paid a general vote was made empowering the treasurer to pay it to the secretary—no member of the committee had any power to pay money—Mr. Guile would give it to Mr. Broadhurst, the secretary, and every one would be equally interested in that payment—it was in consequence of a resolution (on page 45 of the report) as to agitating for an alteration of the law as to conspiracy that the committee voted the two sums of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Plimsoll Seamen's Fund and the Parlia<lb/>mentary Committee of the Trades Congress—these two sums were voted in the ordinary way by the committee—with the exception of the wages paid to the secretary and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid to the auditors no money was paid to anybody for services—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to the treasurer for expenses—five gas stokers were first committed for trial, and in addition others were proceeded against at the police-court—this fund was not used for the latter, although they might have had a little incidentally—they were dealt with by other committees—we had nothing to do beyond the five gas stokers; the fund was confined to them—it could not be surpris<lb/>ing if a wife of one of the others did not get any funds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We relieved incidentally those sentenced to shorter terms by the Magistrate, but it was not part of our duty—I never stopped to read one of the bills at Stafford—I cannot say this resembles those bills—every portion of the money expended was approved by the subscribers, because the balance-sheet was sent to every subscriber, and it was inserted in the newspapers, and no subscriber has questioned it up to the present time that I have heard of—the report was not published till nearly a year after the trial—the balance-sheet was sent out with the report; whether it appeared anywhere I cannot tell—it was not advertised; reference was made to it—the entire committee resolved instead of advertising in any newspaper to publish the report with the balance-sheet audited and signed appended—a copy of the report was sent to every single subscriber I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see his face when he kicked the boy, but I did as he turned to run down Rockingham Street—I was 100 steps away when the boy was kicked—it was a dark and wet night—I had never seen the man before—on the Thursday I was near the Elephant and Castle and saw Inspector Marsh—I swear that—he said to Page "It is very hard you don't know the constable," and then I said I could pick him out—I do not think I heard Marsh say at the police court that that was not true—I will swear I saw Marsh on Friday morning at the police-station, and also Saturday morning; three different times—Marsh went into the room with me when I went to pick out the man—I did not go up to the man and say "I think this is the man"—I said at the police-court that was wrong—I heard my evidence read over to me; no one told me; "I think that is the man" was wrong—I never said it—I did not think anything about it till I came up yesterday morning—that was the first time it struck me it was wrong, no one told me then it was wrong—I always said it was the prisoner—I have never said I was not sure about him—I swear that—441 was the number of the man—at the police court I told you it was 401—I heard the number 401 when you were before the Magistrate—Marsh spoke to me about it—I swear Marsh mentioned 401 in my hearing; Page was there then—I first said I heard 401 on the Friday, and then changed it to Saturday—the boy was kicked when on the Causeway side, on the City side.</p>

The prisoner had been a constable in my division only a few days—on this night he was on fixed duty at one corner of Rockingham Street, placed to watch a certain house that was undergoing repairs; he was in uniform—I was on duty in the section, walking from New Kent Road towards London Bridge visiting the men—I heard a cry when 150 yards off, near the railway arch, walking away from it—I went back, and 40 yards from the corner of Rockingham Street I saw the boy leaning against and holding on to the lamp-post, and appearing to be in great pain; a number of people, including a cabman, were round him—I did not see Murphy then—Page complained to me about being injured, and I took him to the station—about a minute and a half before I heard the cry I had visited the prisoner on duty, and he was at the end of Rockingham Street then—I had only time to walk 150 yards—I did not see him when I saw the boy—I did not go back, it would not have been fair to the prisoner—the boy saw the surgeon; he was bruised; I saw the injury myself—afterwards the constables were paraded, so that Page and Murphy could see them, on the Saturday—I was there when Murphy identified the prisoner—the prisoner was allowed to place himself among the men as he pleased, and then after Murphy had picked one constable out the boy was told to pick out the man who had assaulted Page, and he walked down the lane, looked at a man, and then turned and picked out the prisoner.</p>

I was called to the police-station on this night, heard about the boy having been assaulted, and found he was injured; I found the bruise—from what he said I went to the prisoner at the corner of Rockingham Street; it was about 12.45 or 1 o'clock—I found him at the corner, his proper place—I told him a boy had been assaulted, and asked him if he knew anything about it, or had seen or heard anything—he said "No," he had neither seen, nor heard, nor knew anything about it—I returned to the station, and the boy after<lb/>wards pointed out to me the place where it had occurred—I saw Murphy in the charge-room on Saturday morning; all the men were in a row, and I told the constable to bring Murphy in—I told him to walk down the line and see if he could pick out the man who came from Southwark Bridge Road—he went down the line, came back to the first man, and said "That is the man"—that was Smith 206; he was going away—I said "Now go down the line and see if you can pick me out the man that kicked Page"—he went down the line, came back to the third man, and then pointed to the prisoner, and said "That is the man."</p>
