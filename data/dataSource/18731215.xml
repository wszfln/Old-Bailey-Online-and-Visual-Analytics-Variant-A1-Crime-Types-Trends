               <p>as wharfingers, at Millwail—on 26th September I had a person named Barker in our service; he absconded in the early part of October—the course of business is first of all an order from the owner, then an entry in a delivery-book—there is a register of the delivery kept on a file—I have the file here of that day—I have looked through it, there is no register of ten barrels of turpentine on that day, nor any entry in the delivery-book—we have a great quantity of turpentine in different barrels on our premises; there is a note delivered to the Carman, and it is his duty to take the note, with the load of goods, to his employers, he having previously signed for the goods on the counterfoil—on 26th September I was accidentally passing near the West India Docks, and saw a small van upset, containing some barrels; I knew they came from my wharf—afterwards, from information, I saw some barrels at the house of a man named Austin, at Rye Lane, Peckham—Austin was charged before the Magistrate and discharged—I have received back four barrels out of the five, and a tub, which was a portion of the fifth barrel; it had been emptied and cut into two tubs—we mark our barrels with stencil plate, with the letter or mark of the particular cargo on the head, and we cut in the running numbers on the head; that would appear in the order—the barrels are tared previous to filling them from our cisterns—that is specially the duty of Thorogood, but if we are busy it is occasionally done by other men, Jones or Harwood—I have seen some wash tubs—I believe it is a common thing after barrels have been emptied to cut them into wash tuba, but it is more generally done with paraffin and petroleum barrels—the barrels I have seen came from our wharf—I know Barker's handwriting, I found his handwriting on two of the tubs; it is not writing, we term it <hi rend="italic">scribing</hi>—I can tell Thorogood's marks generally, not so well as Barker's, I believe them to be his—I went to Monk's on 21st October, with the detective Norman, 8, Manor Street, Chelsea; he was not at home, the shopman said he was at the other shop—we went on to the other shop in the same neighbourhood, and he came back with us to Manor Street—after we had searched the cellar Norman asked him if he had any other premises—he said no, those were all—the cellar runs under the shop—I noticed that there was a building attached to it—he did not take us into that shed—I saw some barrels in the cellar; I saw one I thought to be mine from the marks on the barrel—I can tell all my lawful deliveries for years past; we are able to detect every one of them by the ship's number, the entry, and the case—I only identify the marks, I can say it was once my property—my books would show every legitimate delivery, but no register or record has been kept of this, it has not passed through my books as if it was a regular transaction—the value of the ten barrels is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts.</p>

I was examined, cross-examined, and re-examined on several occasions at the Police Court; the first occasion was the 21st October, the same day that I went with Norman to Monk's place in Manor Street—on that occasion I swore positively that the one cask that was removed by the police was my property—Monk was not taken into custody then—he did not then produce an invoice of Sir Charles Price &amp; Co., in reference to two casks of turpentine; he searched a file for a long time, I saw him take two papers from the file—when we got to Arbour Square ho was under a sort of surveillance—he told the inspector that some papers were taken from him, or that he had given them to Norman, and he wanted them taken care of—I did not hear him say that this particular</p>

               <p>paper referred to the cask of turpentine which the policeman had taken—I did not hear him say that he had brought the invoice with him for the purpose of giving information to the Magistrate, or for his protection—at the shop, when he took the two papers off the file, Norman said "What have you got there?" and he said "I must protect myself"—those two papers were produced in Court by Norman—I don't know how they got into his possession—I was not present on 28th October when an application was made that somebody from Price &amp; Co. should go and see this particular cask; I heard of it—I believe the cask was then at the police-station; I did not see it there—I was not present when Mr. Archer, from Price &amp; Co., saw it—I said on 28th October that I could not swear what ship the turpentine came from—I said I did not remember seeing them at all before they were stolen, because we take turpentine out of our cisterns, turpentine kept in bulk, and I could not say who was the consignee—I can swear to any casks that leave my premises—if a cask leaves my place unmarked I could swear to it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I have thousands of such casks, I can't swear to any individual cask")—I can swear to individual casks—I think I was asked if I had any book in which these stolen casks were entered—I had no such book—Barker took very good care to keep no record of it—if it had been a legitimate delivery it would have been fairly entered in my books—I do not know from what consignment of turpentine this was, who was the consignee, or the number of the ship, because I store turpentine in bulk—all I know is I shall have to pay for it—we occasionally have consignments of turpentine from Price &amp; Co., of Thames Street—we have done business with them—I am a public wharfinger—I bank goods the same as a banker does money—the casks from ships are not in all cases emptied into tanks—sometimes a mer<lb/>chant won't have it done, and we store it in our cellars—it is coopered by us, that is a very extensive item in our business—when we get a cargo that is not to be bulked whole we tare for average; we tare about every tenth cask, 10 per cent.—when we land the casks we simply chalk the tare on them, when we deliver them to the dealers, we put the pounds on them, not the odd quarters—that is done when the cask is empty with a scribing iron—I cannot swear to any mark but the tare on the cask that was taken away from. Monk's—I have seen six tubs altogether, including Austin's—I identify two by numbers in the head of Barker's scribing, and the tares by Thorogood, and there is no shipping mark upon them, which there ought to have been if it was an honest delivery—I do not know a person named Low, I want to get hold of him—I did not deal with him—I have a person named Bright in my employment—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this appears to be an invoice of five barrels of petroleum, purchased by Low, receipted by Wright—my transactions are very numerous, they do not all pass under my observation—I never heard of the man before—if a man produces a proper order, the goods would be delivered to him, the same as a cheque presented to a banker—petroleum casks, in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, are painted blue in the body and white at the head, and turpen<lb/>tine casks are unpainted in the body and the heads painted red—petro<lb/>leum may sometimes be put into turpentine barrels after being cleansed by superheated steam—I think I went three times to Monk's premises with Norman—I may very likely have remarked that I hoped to give Monk five years—I don't remember it, but it is a thing I should be very likely to say—that must have been after he was remanded—I think I was seven</p>

               <p>times at the Police Court, from 21st October up to 3rd December—I think evidence was given on every occasion—everything was done with my sanction—I attended before the Judge at Chambers, and opposed the application for bail—I thought the ends of justice would be defeated if he got at large—if he had been locked up before, I should have got hold of Low.</p>

Mr. Ingall was with me when I went to Monk's place—I found Monk at King's Road—I believe after we came out of Manor Street he asked whether I should like to look over the premises in the King's Road—after Mr. Ingall had identified the cask, Monk said that he had bought two casks of turpentine of Price's—I would not be positive that he said that the cask so identified by Mr. Ingall was one of those two—I won't swear that he did not say so—I asked him to go down to the station—I did not ask him to go and give evidence—when I left Chelsea I had not made up my mind to give him into custody—Mr. Ingall and I con<lb/>ferred together, and we thought the best thing would be that he should be charged—I took him into custody at the Police Court—I told him he would have to come to the station; he did, and Mr. Ingall charged him—the barrel of turpentine was left at Monk's place—I placed a mark on it and Mr. Ingall did the same—it was afterwards taken to the Poplar police-station and rolled up against the four other casks which had come from Austin's—I have been perhaps nearly a dozen times to Monk's since the 21st Octo<lb/>ber—on 21st October, I saw a man at the Arbour Square Station, whom I now know as the witness Archer, from Charles Price and Co.—at that time the barrels were at Poplar—I did not object to the attorney for Monk seeing them—the inspector did not refuse to let a person from Charles Price &amp; Co. see it—there was no actual refusal—Davis said that two or three barrels were rolled up the court, and two were left in the channel—I would not undertake to say that Davis swore at the Police Court that all five were rolled up</p>

I am a marble mason, and live at 19, New Church Court, Strand—on the night of 24th November, about 9. 15, I was in White Horse Yard, and the two prisoners came up to me; Kelly, when he got within arm's reach of me, hit me a violent blow under the right eye, and knocked me down, and while I was lying down they kicked me on my chest and arms, and took my chain from me—I seized my watch, and McAuliffe caught hold of me, took my chain away, and tore my coat right up to the elbow—they both got up and ran away—I followed, and caught Kelly at the top of White Horse Yard, the entrance to Drury Lane—my wife was at the corner, but I did not know she was there until I was down and heard a voice—I held Kelly, and he threw me in the gutter and punched me right and left—I held him till the police came up—I gave him in charge for assaulting me, and robbing me of my chain—I went to the station, and McAuliffe followed—I asked the inspector if he would search McAuliffe, he said he could not do that as he was not in custody—I was bleeding then from the eye, and was bruised about my body, and not altogether in my right senses, or I should certainly have stated a charge against McAuliffe—the value of the chain was 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

About 9. 15 on this night I was on duty in Drury Lane, and saw a crowd surge across Drury Lane from White Horse Yard—I went up and found the prosecutor lying on his back in the gutter, and Kelly on the top of him—they were struggling very violently together—I took hold of Kelly and pulled him off the prosecutor, who then got up and charged the prisoner with striking him—he had a large bruise on his face, and blood running from it—on the way to the station, the prosecutor said "He has taken my chain also"—I told Kelly the charge, he said "It is only a drunken fight"—the prosecutor showed his watch to the inspector.</p>

               <p>and then it resolved itself into a felony, stealing a chain—that was only against Kelly—the prosecutor said he charged Kelly with assaulting him, and he had a mark of a blow under his eye, and he told me Kelly did that in knocking him down—I hesitated about taking the charge, it seemed to me that it was a fight, from what was said, and then he charged him with stealing the chain—the watch was produced—there was nothing to show that any chain had been attached to it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 22nd November, I received information—I had been watching for an hour, and when the men left I borrowed a fork, and in striking the mould I found this chicken concealed under the turf in this bit of sacking—I took the prisoner and told him it was on suspicion of stealing a fowl; he said "All right, I suppose I must go with you."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN PERRY</hi>. I am a labourer, of Woodford Cottage, Wanstead—I was employed with the prisoner on 21st November in this gravel pit, from 4 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.—the prisoner was at work with us all day; I did not see him bring a fowl in his hand; if he had I must have seen it; I was digging the turf off the top, where I could see him<lb/>well—I never took a fowl of Mrs. Clarke's, and never knew him do so—I got my meals in the pit—I never left it all day, and never saw a fowl the whole time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have worked in this pit from a month to six weeks—I sometimes saw the fowls and sometimes not, they never ran into the pit—I saw them in the fields—I heard some of them were missing, from the policeman Woodley—I did not see Alp that morning—he did not come up and talk to me on the morning of 21st November—I began work at 6 o'clock that morning, breakfasted at 8 o'clock, went to work again, and never left the pit the whole day—I did not see a bit of hop sacking there, but I had my work to attend to—nobody was watching, that I was aware of—I did not hear a clacking among the poultry about 10. 30—I was taken in custody on the Saturday and charged, but it was not true—this subpoena caused me to give my evidence to-day—no one has taken my evidence down—I gave evidence before the Magistrates at Ilford—I never saw a <hi rend="italic">fowl or a</hi> duck in the prisoner's possession—I am sure he did not put any turf over any particular spot when he left the pit that evening—Alp came into the pit between 12 and 1 o'clock—he was not there at 10 o'clock. <hi rend="italic">He-examined.</hi> When I am working in the pit I think of nothing but my work—the prisoner is married—I don't know whether he has children. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received an excellent character.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at 35, Francis Street, Westminster—on the night of 17th November, about 11 o'clock, I was in the Bath Arms, at the corner of Bath Street, London Road—I was sober, but I had had a drop of beer—I went out with George Bowley—when I had gone about 100 yards I heard somebody coming up behind me—the prisoner held up my arms while another man took my money out of my pocket, 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all I had got there, and a knife—about twenty minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner at the Dog and Star, with the other man—I asked him to give me back the halfpence that he had taken out of my pocket, the other man handed him something, and the prisoner said "I will give you some half<lb/>pence," and I received a blow on my cheek from something ten or eleven inches long, that he had up his sleeve—I don't remember any more afterwards, only he gave me a kick in the ribs—he came to me again after that in Mansfield Street, and said "Now are you going home after that," and he turned me round all of a sudden over his legs—I then went home—I did not know till next morning that my jaw was broken—I have been in the infirmary in consequence of the injuries.</p>

I was excluded from the house, me and my wife, and my father, and my two brothers, my brother knocked my hat off, and I hit him, he had his arm up at the time, and I hit him, but the blow was not enough to knock him down had he been sober"—the deceased seemed quite sober when I first saw him, which was ten or fifteen minutes before.</p>

McGaw said that if I repeated such a statement again, he would throw me over. I repeated it, when he caught me round the neck, put his foot behind me, and threw me heavily on my back, falling on my stomach. I felt very much hurt at the time.

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Henry Brown, of 2, Collingwood Terrace, Battersea—on 15th or 10th October the prisoner came there with a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Thomas. Lucas—I asked him who the drawer was—he said there could be no doubt about that—it was the great firm of Lucas Brothers, contractors, of Pimlico—he asked for some goods, and I asked for some further security about the cheque—he subsequently brought me a letter, but I did not let him have any goods.</p>

I am one of the cashiers of the National Bank, Broad Street—this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented in October, but I. cannot give the date—it is drawn by Thomas Lucas—nobody of that name has ever had an account there—the form has been taken out of one of our cheque-books issued to Alexander Werner, of St. Mary Axe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 41, St Mary Axe—about two years ago I succeeded a Mr. Werner, and when I took possession of the office I found the cheque-book there—it was kept in an unlocked place, and the prisoner, who has been alone in the office many times, had access to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had other parties access to your offices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes. I am not aware that a person once got in at the window and took some things—I know a person named Jefferys, he has been left alone in the office, and so has Mr. Marshall, he had a key of the office and of the desk also—Mr. Bias has also been left there—I will swear that I never knew any one named Thomas Lucas come to my office, and I don't believe any one of that name ever came there—I have often left persons alone in my office, and they have had the same chance as you have—you have not worked twelve months for me for nothing; if you sold bricks for me you had a commission.</p>

On 22nd October I received a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "Thomas Lucas," and on 8th November I arrested the prisoner at West Croydon—I said "Steer, I shall take you for forging and uttering a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Mr. Bennett"—he said "All right, don't say anything about it here, I will go with you"—on the way to London he said "You will have to prove the forgery"—the cheque was the one I showed to Bennett and the other witnesses; I gave it to Inspector Striggles at Battersea station, and he put it with the cheque<lb/>book—I have searched for it since, but cannot find it—when the Magistrate was about to remand the prisoner for another week he said "I will plead guilty, your worship, if you will please to settle it here."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector V</hi>). I had charge of this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I placed it in an envelope, with a number of pieces of paper—it was produced in Court on several occasions, but on pulling out the other pieces I must have pulled it out and let it fall on the floor, and, it being very dirty, I have no doubt it has been thrown in the fire as waste paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I served Thomas Lucas, a builder, with five truck loads of bricks and tiles, which were sent to Bricklayers' Arms Station. I afterwards met Lucas, who said that he should have some cheques in a day or two. Two or three days afterwards I received three cheques filled up, but the body was not filled up, and I filled it up. He told me not to pay them away at once as there was not sufficient money there, but to forward him more bricks at once. The bricks were sent to him in railway trucks, to East Grinstead. I am as innocent of the signature as a child unborn, but the body of the cheque I filled up. When I found there was no account at the bank I went to Charing Cross; there was no account there, and then I went to Grosvenor Gardens, and the gentleman there said that he thought I was in a mess. I then went to East Grinstead, but could not find Lucas. Before I left I told a policeman next door to me that I was going. The policeman told me that he could find Thomas Lucas, and he went into the country for a few days, and because they could not find him they try to make out that it is Thomas Lucas of Pimlico, but there is no such firm; there is a firm of Lucas of Westminster. I am as innocent of the forgery as a child unborn, and as to uttering them I did not know any difference till I heard that a party had been to the bank and there was no money there, and never had been. My father went into a fit when I was taken before the Magistrate, and it has been his death.</p>
