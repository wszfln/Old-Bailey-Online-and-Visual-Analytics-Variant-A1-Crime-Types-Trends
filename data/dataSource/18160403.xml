I went in myself, and some of my neighbours were in the house when I went in. I lost nothing; I know nothing of the circumstances of the robbery; I keep one key of the door, and Mrs. Colbey keeps the other; I left Mrs. Colbey at home; I had bolted the back door.</p>

            . I lodged with Mr. Fillison. On Sunday, the 10th of March last; I know the last witness went out in the afternoon, and I heard the door shut about three o'clock; a little while after, I went out; when I went out, I pulled the door to, which has a spring lock, and I pushed it to see that it was safe. When I heard the door shut at about three o'clock, I did not go down to see who it was that went out. I did not unbolt the back door; When I went out, I fastened the front door, and pushed it, and it was fast. Mr. Fillison returned just before me; it was about eight o'clock; when I went into the house on my return, I missed a chest, I don't know what it was worth; I don't think a shilling; I had not seen it just before I went out; I don't know that I had seen it that morning; it was in my bed-room; I can't say whether I had seen it or not that morning.</p>

               <p>RHODA BROWN. I am a servant next door but one to Mr. Fillison's. I was at home on the 10th of March last, at about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two men go out of Mr. Fillison's house, with a chest on their shoulders; I saw them go in, and I saw them go up the steps, and saw them go in, and bring out a chest.</p>

               <p>Q.How did they get in - A. They were not on the steps a minute; they did not remain in a moment; they were out again directly; one had a chest on his shoulder; I can't say which; I believe it, was the tallest, Briant; he had a soldier's coat on; Foreman was with him; I think the tall man carried the chest. I had seen them in the afternoon in the street; there were three in the street, walking up and down all the afternoon, opposite our house, and opposite Mr. Fillison's; that bad attracted my attention; I had particularly observed them; I am for certain enabled to say, that the two men at the bar are the men; I can't say I should know the other man; if I had seen him go in, I should have known him too; I did not see the third man when they went in. I noticed the one with the curls on his face; that is the tallest one; I saw no mark on the face of the other. Afterwards I saw them at the police office; I knew them then; they were then in a different dress; they had other clothes on than what they had on the Sunday; one had a soldier's great coat on; but it was neither of these. When I saw them enter the house, it was moon-light. I told the neighbours directly almost.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The persons who entered the house were only two; no third man was within sight, that I perceived; this was on the 10th of March, it was about seven o'clock. I neither knew Briant nor Foreman before; I did not take such notice of them as to know how they were dressed; I know one man was dressed in black, and the other man, who went into the house, had a soldier's coat on; but I don't say whether this is the man; I can't say whether they both went into the house; one is the man who went to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Which - A. I think Foreman, the little one; I think Foreman went into the house; I believe the small one carried the box. I did not see the faces of both that went into the house; I saw the short one go into the house.</p>

               <p>COURT. Who is the man you saw with the chest - A. The tall man, with a soldiers coat.</p>

            . I live in the neighbourhood of Mr. Fillison's house; I am a cork-cutter. I was passing Mr. Fillison's house, and saw one of the prisoners,

                  Levi

            , I think is his name; I saw him with a bag on his shoulder; it was about one hundred and fifty yards from Mr. Fillison's door. I did not see any body else then. I followed Levi, and lost him. Coming back again, through the same street, I saw the two prisoners Briant and Foreman with a box; I am quite certain to these two prisoners; Briant had the box on his shoulder, and the other had a hold of the rope behind. Upon that, I took no more notice. Foreman was dressed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030004"/>black, and had a patch on his chin; a large black patch. This was about half past seven; it was a moon-light night. I think I could speak to the box they had; I can swear to it. Mr. Fillison's house is in Turner-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was about half past seven when I saw them. They were then a hundred and fifty yards from Fillison's house, and it was full a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes before that I had seen Levi; I did not know Briant before. I saw them at the police office next, I went immediately and gave information at this office. I went into the house and looked over it, and gave information at the police office; I saw the girl Brown standing at the door; she had just then given information.</p>

               <p>Rhodn Brown re-examined. I saw that gentleman,(the last witness) at about half an hour after I saw these men; I was then alarming the neighbourhood, I alarmed it immediately.</p>

            . I am a police officer; the persons of two men were described to me, and in consequence of that description. I took Briant and Foreman. Foreman was described particularly, with a black patch on his chin. I found them both in company the next morning, and Foreman had a black patch upon his chin. They were in Flem-delis-court, turning out of Brick-lane, Whitechapel. When we took them to the lock-up-room; Foreman had a patch on his chin, but before the witness saw him, he had torn it off. In consequence of some information, I went after Levi Abrahams the same morning, the Sunday, at a little after eight, or between eight and nine. We went first to Abraham'e house; he was at home; it is in Chicksand-street. We found him there, but not any property. We did not take him into custody then; in about an hour, or an hour and a half, we went into a house in Little Middlesex-street, Whitechapel, we there found Abraham's and the two women employed in picking the marks out of this property. (producing it) I asked them whose it was, and from whom it came. They all three said they did not know whose it was, nor from whom it came. In the pocket of Sarah

               <p>EBENEZAR DALTON. I went to the house, and found Levi and the two women there; they were employed in picking the marks out of the linen which is now produced; they dropped the things directly from their hands as soon as ever the door was open. I caught hold of the things as soon as ever they dropped them. They said, they knew nothing of them, nor did they know to whom they belonged. Miller and myself went there; we saw them picking something out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I don't pretend to say that I saw any needle, but some of the things had the marks only partly picked out.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I went in company with Dalton, on the morning of Monday, the 11th; I went to a house in Little Middlesex-street, Whitechapel; I found the three prisoners were there, the bed, two pillows, and a bolster. I believe Mr. Jonas keeps the house; the girl, Sarah Levi, is the daughter of Levi Abrahams, I believe. They were all sitting in the lower room, and the bed was in the middle of the room; the bolster and pillows were with the bed. No other persons were in the room but the prisoners. I asked them whose bed that was, and they all three denied all knowledge of it, and did not know whose it was; they knew nothing at all about it. I went between ten and eleven o'clock on the Monday morning; they were picking the marks out of the other property. I took them into custody. I did not search any other part of the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. This was the third day after the robbery; the robbery was on the Saturday. I know Jonas has a husband living, that I believe. I know Levi lives some where else. In these three days, I don't know who might have brought these things there.</p>

               <p>EBENEZAR DALTON. I am a police officer, and went also to this house. I can only speak to the same facts to which the last witness has spoken; his account is correct.</p>

            ; I had employed him to sit in an opposite shop of mine, and in consequence of some information he gave me by a note sent, telling me to come over directly; I went. I then went with brindle; he came out to me; I accompanied Brindle to a public-house; he and I followed Manning; we took him into custody. He had three pieces of calico in a bag. I told him that was our property; he made no reply, except some body gave it to him. It was a quarter of an hour after before Daley was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL BRINDLE. I was employed to watch the shop of the prosecutors; I stationed myself on the opposite side of the way in a shop, a paper hangers just opposite; I sat in the shop; I had an opportunity of seeing all persons who went into or out of the prosecutors shop; about half past eight, I saw Manning go into the premises, he had nothing with him when he went in; he did not stay two minutes, when he came out with this bag; I did not see him speak to anybody in the shop; I did not see any body in the shop; I could not. In consequence of this, I gave information to the prosecutor, and went with him to the public-house. As soon as Manning came out of the prosecutor's shop, I followed him to the White Swan, in Wardour-street; I went in myself, and called for a glass of liquor. I am quite sure that Manning was the man who went into the shop, and came out with a bundle.</p>

             LOPPET. I am warehouse-man to the prosecutors. I recollect the morning on which this was detected. I left the shop between eight and nine; I left the prisoner Thomas Daley in the shop, to take care of it; he was the only one that was in the shop; he remained behind me in the shop I suppose a quarter of an hour. I don't know whether any one came into the shop while I was absent. I look at the property; I know it, it is my masters property; I believe three pieces cost us thirty shillings a piece; I believe that to be the cost price, but I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. There are four persons employed in this concern. When I went to breakfast, the prisoner Daley was left in the shop; there was no one in the shop but Daley; the other porter was below stairs; he was not in the shop; but he could have come into the shop in a moment.</p>

               <p>THOMAS ANSTEY. The prisoner made a disclosure to me; I had not held out any inducement to him; it was at the police office in Marlborough-street, but not before the magistrate; he said he had been robbing us for six wix weeks. I asked him how many pieces of calico he had taken, and he said, about forty or fifty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he mention these particular pieces - A. There was an allusion to these; I asked him how he had disposed of them, and asked him if it was to the man who had the three that morning, and he said, yes, to the same man.</p>

               <p>EDMUND SIMKINS. On the 17th of February last, in the evening, at about a quarter past seven o'clock, I was sitting in my kitchen with my family, at my house, <placeName id="t18160403-4-crimeloc33">No. 24, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, at the parish of St. Dunsten Stebonheath</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160403-4-crimeloc33" type="placeName"
                          value="No. 24, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, at the parish of St. Dunsten Stebonheath"/>
                  <interp inst="t18160403-4-crimeloc33" type="type" value="crimeLocation"/>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18160403-4-off31 t18160403-4-crimeloc33"/>, and I was alarmed by something over me, as if something had dropped; some one of the family exclaimed, there is some one in the parlour; that was the room above. I immediately ran up stairs, and discovered the prisoner with a glass, resting on the ledge of the window; it was a looking-glass; the window was open; the shutters had been put to; the sash was thrown completely up. I was in the room not ten minutes before; it was then down. I have not a doubt but that the prisoner at the bar, who was in the room, had opened the window; the sash is fastened down by a catch, or a window drop. I found this catch forced from the window, and lying on the floor. This is part of the catch; that had been entire, and fastened to the window, and I found this knife also in the room; it was not there ten minutes before. I found the prisoner at the bar getting out at the window, with the looking-glass resting on the ledge; the glass was removed from its place. There is a little wooden railing outside, that he might have rested his foot on in getting out; he might have got out without breaking the glass or damaging himself. When I saw him getting out, I gave the alarm of stop thief; he had got one foot on the chair, and the other on the table. The watch was not set. I gave the alarm of stop thief, and a young man was passing, and saw him coming from the window, and threw him down into the kinnel, and I found him in his custody, when I secured him; this was about a quarter after seven o'clock, it was dark. When I went up, I had not a candle with me, but I knew the prisoner was the same man when I went round, because I have a lamp just opposite to me, and another by me. The prisoner is the same man whom I saw in the room. He begged very hard for mercy, and hoped I would let him go. I am sure the window was down when I went up about ten minutes before. No person could get in at the window, or force it up, without forceing this catch off.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ALTHORNS. I was passing by before the alarm was given, and seeing the prisoner coming out of the window, I thought proper to seize him; I threw him off the rail into the kinnel; the rail is under the window. I held him down a minute or two, when there was a cry of stop thief, and the last witness, Simkins, came out; I did not let go of him until I put him into the hands of Simkins. The prisoner said he had done nothing, he had done nothing, let him go, let him go.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030007"/>Simkins, Re-examined. I took the prisoner to Lambeth-street office, and delivered him into the custody of Ebenezar Dalton. The glass was not taken out of the house, because I had put it back again; he had moved it from its place.</p>

               <p>EBENEZAR DALTON. On the 17th, I was standing in the office, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I heard a bustie in the street, and went out; I saw Mr. Simkins and two or three more bringing this man to the office, and it was with great difficulty we got him in; I took him in, and searched him; but there was nothing on him. The next morning I went to the house that had been broken open, and there I received this knife and catch. The knife agreed with the mark on the window; there was an appearance of force on the window, where it had been broken open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day in the indictment, I was very much intoxicated, and was returning home through Greenfield-street; I had come from Ratcliffe Highway; a person stopped me, and charged me with a robbery, and I knew myself to be innocent, and I made no resistance. It is impossible to break open a house without any instrument; and it is well known that that knife, (even if it was proved to be mine,) could not break open this window; they searched me, and found nothing on me.</p>

               <p>Simkins. Re-examined. The looking-glass had been fixed to the wall. I have not the least doubt that that is the man,(pointing to the prisoner,) who was getting out of the window when I went up stairs; he was dressed nearly as he is now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see my face - A. I did.</p>

               <p>JURY. We should suppose that the power of that brass would cesist the power of that knife.</p>



               <p>Simkins, Re-examined. Q. Your window is in a frame - A. Yes, it slides up.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you see that knife, it does not seem very strong; how do you suppose it could break that brass - A. I don't know how it could be broken off, but I found it broken off, and the window open. He could not open the window without breaking the catch; the glass of the window was not broken at all.</p>

               <p>Ebenezar Dalton, Re-examined. I saw where the knife had made an impression; there was the mark of the knife on the sash.</p>

               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, told them that if the prisoner lifted the sash after it was dark, without forcing the catch, that would constitute the crime with which he was charged.</p>

I got up and I found the window broken, and one of the panes of glass was broken, and a square piece cut out of one of the shutters. It was between three and four in the morning when I got up. I examined to see if any thing was gone out of the shop, and I missed two pieces of sarcenet, five silk handkerchiefs, four silk shawls of various patterns. We found some more articles in the area which had been taken out. I shut up the shop myself on the night of the 11th; I shut it up about eight in the evening; nothing was broken; I went to bed about eleven o'clock. The value of the things was ten pounds, or there abouts; I I have seen some of them again at the office. I had seen the prisoner Coker before; he was in my shop on the Thursday before; he came in and asked me to sell him a waistcoat and a coat; I sold him a waistcoat for ten shillings; he bid me pat it by, and he would call again, but he never called again after that. I had seen these things in my shop on the day before; I then put my shop to rights and set these things all smooth.</p>

            . I am a constable; I saw some of the prisoners on Tuesday the 12th of March, about twelve o'clock. As I was coming down Houndsditch, I met the four prisoners in company together; the two men were walking first, and the two women were close behind them. Knowing them, I turned round to look at them. I saw Elizabeth Henley nudge

I then followed them down the Minories into the New Square, to a pawnbrober's shop, and Coker went on the opposite side of the way.

             and Elizabeth Henley. I asked her what she had got under her shawl; and she said she had got a shawl which she was going to pawn, it was her own. There was a gentleman coming by of the name of Davis, and I asked him to be so good as to take them to the watch-house for me. He was Davis, the ward beadle. I told him I had another person run down Honndsditch whom I wanted to follow. That was Coker; I followed him and apprehended him in Swan-street, pretty near the bottom. I brought him back again into the Minories, and there I met Ann Moore running down the Minories as fast as she could. She did not see me, and ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030008"/>into my arms; I told her she must go along with me, and she exclaimed, for God's sake, let me go. I took her then to the pawnbroker's shop with Coker. I asked the pawnbroker if he had given her any money, and he said no. I saw a shawl lying on the counter, and asked for it. The pawnbroker said that that was the shawl that she came to pledge. I told him, I knew it was; she heard that, and did not deny it. I then took and tied Coker and her together, and took them to the watch-house where the other two were, and after I had been there about a minute, I opened the door and saw my partner, John Ray, and called him in. He came in, and I asked him to search the two women, and I searched the two men. I asked them a great many questions, where they lodged; and both of them said they lodged where they could; one night with one girl, and another night with another, and so on. In searching Coker, I found the key of his apartment, as it afterwards turned out to be, in his pocket. In searching the other man, I found a key in his possession, which unlocks his sister's door, but not his own. I should state to you that I found this silk handkerchief, (producing it) not hemed, round Coker's neck, which is the property of the prosecutor, I likewise found another silk handkerchief in his hat. I am not sure whether there was one or more in his hat. I found on

             had a dog with her; just before they went to the Compter, in Newgate-street, she said she would not know what to do with the dog, without the turnkey would let her take it into the prison. The turnkey refused; then I said I would take the dog to White-chapel, or that way, and lose it. We then took it to Whitechapel, and in Wingfield-street he stopped at some old bones; we waited there a little time, and then we ordered him to go home, and he did so, and we followed him. He went into a little court off Wentworth-street, he went up one pair of stairs, and into the first room, and when we went into the room, there was Henley's sister. Her name is Mary, she seemed very much frightened. I searched the premises and found two silk handkerchiefs, and one silk shawl. In a box just by, I found two pieces of silk. (producing them) There are three pieces now, because they had cut a piece off from one of them. I then asked the girl if she knew where Coker lived, and she went and shewed us Coker's lodging. She took us up one pair of stairs in a house, a little way up Wingfield-street. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out the key I got from Coker and unlocked the door. There I found between the bed and the sacking, two silk handkerchiefs, and one silk shawl, and this tea-pot; but there is no owner for the tea-pot. I found nothing else. Morris and Henley live together; and Coker and Moore lived together.</p>

            , Re-examined. It was there I found the pick-lock keys. Then I went to Coker's with Kinnersley, and there I found a large crow, a centrebit, and a number of other pick-lock keys; there were matches in each of the lodgings; a carpenter had been at work at the shutters of the prosecutor house, and there was a bit of theshutter that matched to this centre-bit; the iron crow exactly fitted with the marks on the shutter, where they had tried to take the shutter down; I also found with the bit and brace in Coker's lodging, this piece of wood, on which they had been trying the bit and brace.</p>

               <p>Emanuel Moses, Re-examined. The shutter had not been taken down; the hole in it measured about six by seven inches; it had been cut away. Nobody had been in the shop. I suppose the things were drawn out of through this hole.</p>

I saw them go out all together; they took something with them; they took a shawl with them, I believe; I believe they also took some handkerchiefs; but I am not sure.

               <p>NATHAN HARRIS. I am a dealer in jewellery, and live at 176, Drury-lane. I was in the eighth row from the orchestre of the Pit of Drury-lane Theatre, on the evening of Saturday, the 17th of February; the prisoner sat two rows in front of me, on my right; I sat on the left of him. I did not see him until the after-piece; his standing up then when every other person near him was sitting down, made me observe him. This was at the first commencement of the Farce; Miss Kelly and Mr. Knight were on the stage; they were embracing each other in the characters of Nan and Joey, two servants in the Modern Antiquities, or Merry Mourners. When this took place, they had parted from each other, and Mr. Knight had retired to the right of the stage, as looking from the audience, and Miss Kelly to the left. When she had got nearly to the stage-door, retreating, with her face towards the audience, I happened to turn round, and saw the prisoner stand up above all the rest, with his right hand pointed on a level with his shoulders, towards the left stagedoor, where Miss Kelly was standing; he was on the right hand side of the Pit, and she was on the left hand side of the stage, as you look from the audience; she was therefore on his left. I did not see what he had in his hand; but I saw a flash, and heard a report immediately after. I did not hesitate a moment, but made towards where he was, and leaned over, and pitched right upon him, and seized him instantly, before he had time to sit down. Upon my seizing him, he said he was not the person that fired the pistol. I saw nothing about him. At that time, I had not seen the pistol. I told him I was sure he was the man, as I saw him. He only said, he was not the man that fired, don't take hold of me. I saw the flash in his right hand; I saw the wadding momentarily drop out of the muzzle, straight from where it was fired; the pistol was no longer than his fingers; I saw the wadding alight. He dropped his right hand momentarily, as if towards his great coat pocket. I took him across the seats until I got further assistance; then he was taken into the avenue, or the lobbey of the pit; there he was searched, and a small black paper pencase was taken from his pocket, which contained gunpowder; there was something else taken from him; but I did not see it, because there was so much confusion and such a crowd.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I never saw the pistol at the office at Bow-street. The prisoner was about six feet from the orchestra; he fired in a slanting direction; I observed he was extremely agitated after the handenffs were put on; he went very peaceably to Bow-street, and never made any resistance. I did not tax him with shooting at Miss Kelly; but I told him, I should not let him go.</p>

            . I was in the pit of Drury-lane Theatre at the time this happened. I was stand-at the corner of the orchestre, on the King's side, the left as you face the stage. I was looking at the performance, and I observed a flash, it proceeded from the right hand side of the pit; I merely saw the flash, it was about twenty-five feet from me. I heard something like shot rattle against the lamps, I mean the line of lamps called the float, between the orchestre and the stage. I saw a man taken across the pit, whom I afterwards discovered to be the prisoner. I immediately made my way out of the pit, and ordered the doors to be closed. Then I assisted in searching the prisoner; I saw a pen-case containing gunpowder taken from him, also a quantity of small shot; the shot was also in his pocket; I also saw the key of a pocket pistol taken from him. I went with the prisoner to Bow-street office, and while he was there, a pocket pistol was produced, by a gentleman of the name of Taylor; Mr. Taylor stated in the presence of the prisoner, that he found it where the prisoner had stood in the pit; the prisoner made neither observation nor answer. I then examined the pistol; it appeared to have been recently discharged. The depositions were then taken against the prisoner by the magistrate.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BIRNIE, ESQ. I am the magistrate before whom the prisoner was brought. I took the examination of several witnesses, they were reduced to writing. I asked the prisoner what he had to say; I think he did not answer at first, and I told him he had heard what had been said against him, and asked him what made him fire the pistol, and he said to make an alarm. I then asked him how he came to point it so, as the witnesses had described, and his answer was, she can explain. He did not mention Miss Kelly's name; I think it had been mentioned;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030010"/>no other lady's name had been mentioned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. He could not avoid hearing what was said.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you had an opportunity of observing his conduct while he was before you - A. I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you enabled to form any judgment with respect to the state of his mind at that time - A. Never having seen him before, I cannot positively say whether there was any thing unusual in him; but there was a sort of gloomness over his eyes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Roraner, Re-examined. After the performance was over, I examined the direction which the shot had taken; I found marks of shot in front of the orchestre, in the direction from where the prisoner stood to the stage door; I found some marks on the stage door itself. I picked up some shot in the orchestre, very small shot indeed; they had struck against the board in front of the orchestre, and had dropped down; those which had struck the stage door, might be about two feet nine inches from the floor. The shot I found in the orchestre were the same size as those found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>

            . I was performing the character of Joey in the Modern Antiquities, or Merry Mourners. I remember the circumstance of a pistol being fired; I was near the centre of the stage at the time; Miss Kelly was on my right hand as I face the audience, if they call that the King's side; but I don't know that it is so. I saw the flash in the pit; it was on my left hand. I did not see the person who fired, nor did I see the pistol. I think I heard the rattling of shot against the tins in the orchestre.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I am not positive that it was shot that I heard; but I now think it was something that made such a noise as I think shot would have made. Neither I nor Miss Kelly have been informed that it reached the stage door.</p>

            . On the night of Saturday, the 17th of February; I was performing at Drury-lane Theatre. In the commencement of the after-piece, when I was on the stage, I indistinctly saw a flash in the pit; but don't know what it was; at the same time I heard what I conceived to be a detonating ball which we have frequently heard, and on former accasions I have been very much alarmed by them. I have no acquaintance with the prisoner in the least. I never saw him in my life until to day, to my knowledge. I did not see him when he was taken up.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to Bow-street. I was in attendance at Drury-lane Theatre on the evening of the 17th of February last, I was in the back part of the pit, and heard the pistol; I immediately made my way to that part whence the report proceeded, when I saw Mr. Harris with the prisoner by the collar; he called for a officer, and I told him, I was one. I took him into custody, and took him to the back part of the lobby, and by order of the public, I searched him; I took from him powder and shot, which I have produced here to day. I immediately took him to the office at Bow-street, and while I was in the office, a Mr. Taylor came there, who produced a pistol in the presence of the prisoner. This is the pistol; it appeared to have been recently discharged; it has been in my possession ever since; nobody has ever seen it until Friday morning last. I afterwards went with the prisoner to Tothill-fields, in company with a man named Dickins. I either asked him was it his intention to kill, or was it his intention to shoot Miss Kelly, I am not positive which; his answer was I will tell you the pistol was not loaded with ball or slug. Dickins asked him if he ment to shoot Miss Kelly, and he said yes. No more passed until we got to Tothill-fields; no more conversation passed that night. The prisoner said, he lodged in Princes-street, Drury-lane; I can't call to mind the number; we went there, and there I found a pistol, the fellow to the one which is produced; I found some papers and shot, which was in that box.</p>

               <p>Q. Do those shot correspond with those you found in his pocket - A.Apparently they do.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL DICKINS. I am a constable of Bow-street. I accompanied the prisoner and Baker in the coach to Tothill-fields; as we were going along Baker put the question. what was his reason for firing the pistol; he gave no answer immediately. Then Baker said to him, did you mean to shoot Miss Kelly; I did, says he. What! with intent to kill her? says Baker. He did not give any answer then for a minute or two, and then he said, I did. What was your reason, says Baker, for doing it; the answer he gave Baker was, she knows perfectly well, herself, what it is for. That was all that I heard. Baker told me to be sure to take notice of what he said, and I did.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Then as Baker told you to take particular notice of what he said, I presume you have given us the correct account, and you mean to adhere to it - A. To the best of my knowledge, I have stated correctly what passed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it you or Baker that used the word kill - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. That you are sure of - A. That I am sure of.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the first question was did you mean to shoot Miss Kelly - A. Yes; and then Baker stopped, and than added, what! with intent to kill her.</p>

               <p>Q. That account you mean to adhere to - A. Yes. I did not hear the subsequent conversation in Tothillfield Bridwell with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>MR. DOWLING. Here requested that the letters which Miss Kelly had spoken of as having received, might be produced.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Conceived that they were not legal evidence, nor did it appear that they were the hand-writing of the prisoner. He would however, waive any objection that might arise as to their admissibility in evidence, and would appose no difficulty in the prisoner's way.</p>

               <p>MR. DOWLING. Stated that he had it in his power to prove the hand-writing.</p>

               <p>The letters were now put in and read.</p>

               <p>Did love ever prompt you to rehearse, The part of honour unessayed in verse; Or passion strive to guard it from decay, Applause to gain, or applause to pay. The works of genius would its charms resign; And your honours praise echo every line. Mistaken girl! ambition would you sway. I assume a part in each concerted play? Your sex's softness endeavour to abuse, And for offence-not even one poor excuse.'</p>

               <p>'I have here madam, defined your character and disposition in a few words; and shall go so far as to say, that you are not a stranger to my name.'</p>

               <p>'Years ago I was your admirer; but always met with disappointment. Coquetry indulged you; although always obtained at the expense of others; without vanity to myself, I think my good intentions towards you have been more trifled than any of my cotemporaries. My claim to your person is therefore greater which determines me to demand your hand, or in other words to make you my wife.</p>

               <p>'You will either consent to this, or accept my challenge. I will attend you at any hour you please, on Wednesday, or before. I have witnessed your dexterity of firing a gun; but suppose a pistol will better suit you, as being much lighter.</p>

You would act wiser if you was to add your name, as I am not sufficiently acquainted with your hand writing, and as I hinted in my last letter, not to subject others to be answerable for your forwardness.

            . I am the prisoner's father-in-law; I am a porter to an orange merchant in Covent Garden. I married the prisoner's mother; the prisoner's own father died before he was born. As he grew up from a boy, he appeared always as a reserved child, and not fond of playing, At times lately, he was very queer. While he was at his meals, he would burst out a laughing, and when we would ask what he laughed at, he would not give any answer. He was brought up as a law stationer. He was first bound to Mr. Edmatis, in Chancery-lane, from whom he was turned over to Mr. Riorder. After he was out of his time, he went to one Mr. Norcroft; after that he went to live at Sevenoaks, with Mr. Clarridge an attorney there, and remained there about nine months. I was sent for by Mr. Clarridge to fetch him home; I went down to Sevenoaks that day; it was on a Saturday. When I got down. the prisoner was opposite a gentleman's house, taking off his hat and bowing to the house, with a mob round him. This was in July, 1813; I had some difficulty in bringing him home from there. He said he would not come away, and I forced him away on the Monday morning. He stopped about a quarter of an hour before the gentleman's house, in my presence. I am certain he is not in his right mind. I don't think he was in London a fortnight or three weeks after his return from Sevenoaks, be-before he went by sea to Yarmoath, with an acquaiance. We thought the sea air would do him good; he staid five weeks to the best of my recollection. After he had returned about a fortnight, he went to write for Mr. Norcrutt. He lodged and boarded with me while he was at Mr. Norcroft's. He remained with me then about three or four months; he was always very low spirited, and kept no company at all. He then went down to Abergaveny, in Monmonthshire, where he remained with one Mr. Jones, a law stationer, about nine months. He returned again, and was very ill, very dull, and melancholy; he was that way about five weeks. He then went to writing for Mr. Norcroft; he boarded with us.</p>



               <p>Q. What was his conduct, for a few days previous to this unfortunate affair - A.He could not eat any thing, and was very unsettled in his mind.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH CROCKET. I am the mother of the unfortunste young man at the bar. He is the son of a Mr. Barnet, formerly a waiter at the Plazza Coffee-house. He was of a very melancholy habit, and very low spirited. Before this unfortunate job, he fell off in his victuals very much indeed On Saturday the 17th, he seemed to go in and out a great deal, and did not stay a minute within doors. In the course of the evening he was in the yard, and while he was there I heard a report, like that of a pistol; but did not see the pistol. I had not time to speak to him after that, for he ran out immediately. That same evening he drank his tea very quick, and ran out immediately after it. He seemed very much agitated. I thought he was going to the play, for he was very fond of going.</p>

            . I live in Chancery-lane. I know the prisoner at the bar; he sat in my office about two years ago. He did not live in the house with me; he was extremely industrious, and attentive to his business, though very dull. I have no doubt, but that this very close application affected his health. He wished me to look out for a country situation for him; and I accordingly recommended him to Mr. Clarridge, of Sevenoaks. Mr. Clarridge wrote to me upon the subject of the state of his mind, and I in consequence, sent his father down.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030012"/>He did business for me a few days previous to this unfortunate affair. He then did that business in a very slovenly manner, totally unusual with him, and spoiled the engrossment, by leaving out the greater part. He seemed in a very disturbed state of mind. I expected he would have come on the Saturday that this happened, but he did not.</p>

               <p>MORTY RIOHDEN. The prisoner at the bar served six years of his apprenticeship to me; he always conducted himself to my satisfaction; he was always very reserved, After he had been with me, he went to Mr. Norcroft's. I advised him to go into the country for his health sake. While in my service, he has frequently gone out for an hour or two, and on his return told me he did not know he had any thing to do, when he had left a great deal of work undone. He would frequently laugh over his business without any apparent cause. From the observations I have frequently made in his conduct, I think he was perfectly out of his mind.</p>

            . I am the son of Mr. Clarridge, attorney, of Sevenoaks. I was at Sevencaks during the time that the prisoner was in my father's service. In consequence of what I had been told, I went out one day in company with my father, and saw the prisoner standing with a crowd round him, opposite to a gentleman's house. He was gazing very attentively at the house, for a considerable time. I took hold of one of his arms, and my father took hold of the other, and we led him away to his lodgings; from what I saw at that time, I thought him out of his senses.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HURLEY. I am a law stationer. I have had an opportunity of observing the conduct of the prisoner, during the latter end of January and February last; I had frequent occasion to be at Mr. Riorden's office, where he was. I have repeatedly observed him laugh when nobody was in conversation with him at all. I particularly observed him one day, burst into an immoderate fit of laughing; I asked him what he laughed at. I knew nothing had occursed to excite his laughter; but he made me no reply whatever. I have frequently seen him very melancholy; in a kind of reverie of thought.</p>

               <p>MARY CHARD. I live at Sevenoaks. The prisoner lodged with me during the nine months that he was with Mr. Clarridge. During that time, I have had frequent opportunities of observing his conduct. He left me in July or August, 1813. He seemed particular in always keeping by himself. He was in the frequent habit of standing on a heap of stones, opposite to a gentleman's house. He would stand there all weathers; frequently with a great mob round him, chucking him under the chin, and making game of him. I remember his sitting in church once with his hat on, and the clergyman was obliged to send to him to take his hat off. I have seen him also, making lidicolous gestures frequently in the church. I was not in the church when he addressed the congregation. I remember his running behind a gentleman's carriage for five miles; at least I saw him set out with it, and he came running behind it up to my door, in a very great heat. I certainly thought him out of his senses.</p>

               <p>MARY HAGARTY. I live in Castle-street, Holborn. The prisoner lodged in my house from the 3rd of October, in the last year, to the middle of January; he was during that time very much dejected, and that dejection would frequently give way to the most immoderate fits of laughter, and violent mirth. I observed his conduct during the illness of my own children. At the latter end of October, he expressed a strong desire to see the child that was ill; he came to the sofa, where she was laying in a dying state; we expected her hourly to die. On my asking him his opinion of her, he made no reply, but burt out in an immoderate fit of laughter to my face. I certainly thought he did not possess a sound mind, and it is my belief that he is insane.</p>

               <p>JOHN WANT. I am a surgeon, and live in North Crescent, Bedford-square. I have had some experience in the diseases of the mind. I have seen and conversed with the prisoner since his confinement. I have an opinion with respect to his sanity, formed on his conduct and conversation on that occasion, and I have not the slightest hesitation in pronouncing him of unsound mind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. I was with him three quarters of an hour, and have not the least doubt that the appearances I observed, were genuine, and not assumed or counterfeited.</p>

               <p>This being the evidence of one side, and on the other, - </p>

               <p>THE COURT, Summed it up to the Jury, and told them, that unless they conceived that the prisoner at the time he fired, was so far a master of his senses, as to be enabled to distinguish between right and wrong, they ought to acquit him, on the ground of insauity, and specify that reason in their verdict.</p>

               <p>NOT GUILTY,</p>

On the 8th of January, in the evening, I went into the Duke of Rutland public-house, in Old Gravel-lane; I was alone, and called for a pint of beer. There was a number of people in the house playing at cards; I was in the tap-room. I sat down, and played with them. The prisoner was there. I went out at about eleven o'clock to go to my lodgings; I went out in company with a man named Wilson; I was followed by four men; the prisoner at the bar was among the four that robbed me. I was knocked down in <placeName id="t18160403-7-crimeloc51">Keppel-street</placeName>

I walked part of the way with Wilson that came out with me; I believe Wilson was the man who knocked me down. I had changed a one-pound note; I had been playing at cards, and had lost the whole of my silver, and I pulled out a bundle of notes to get a one-pound note to change it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030013"/>I had two hundred and four pounds in bank notes; there were nineteen ten-pound notes; one five-pound note; two-pound notes; and five one-pound notes. I had received one hundred and ten pounds from the Bank, and the rest in wages and prize money. I had them rolled up, and tied with a piece of red tape. I took them from my jacket pocket; I was obliged to do so, to get the one-pound note, I had my reckoning to pay, which was four shillings, besides part of my losing out of this one-pound note. I could see the prisoner at the bar among those that knocked me down; the prisoner at the bar took my money; the three who did not take it remained a little longer than the prisoner; he took it out and ran a short distance; I saw him clearly at the time he was robbing me; then the other three got together, and ran towards him. I know the prisoner at the bar took the money out of my pocket; I ran after him, and was within three yards of him, I made for the man who I knew had robbed me. They all ran under the dark of the wall, which was shaded by a small light of the moon, and I could see no more of them. When the prisoner made a stop, he said, I have got it, come along; that was just after he had robbed me. They then ran towards him. I informed Mr. Hewitt I had been robbed.</p>

            . Upon hearing of the robbery, which was on the 9th of January, the morning after it, I went to the lodging of the prosecutor, and took possession of the clothes that he was knocked down in.</p>

               <p>DAVID BRIANT. (Accomplice.) Moven was the first man that knocked him down, and Wilson followed after; there were four of us; we had been at the Duke of Rutland. I mean by Wilson following after, that he struck him next. Moven took the money from him, I was present; Moven ran away, and said, I have got the swagg, come along; he then joined the rest. We all went down to Deptford the same night.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the money - A. It was all divided. I made a communication to Mr. Brown two days after the robbery was done. I was not suspected at all; but I thought it a pity that the man should be a loser of his money; it was 
               <persName id="t18160403-7-person144">Brown</persName>
             I told, he is a constable. There was Moven, Wilson, Fryers, and myself; they were all that were concerned. Edwards was not with us at that time. I had been playing at cards, and saw Ward playing; Wilson is a coal-heaver. When we came out of the Duke of Rutland, I was going home to my supper, when Wilson called me back, and told me that Ward had such a quantity of money, he did not mention how much he had. It was in Keppel-street, Old Gravel-lane, that we came up with the prosecutor; the prisoner knocked him down; Wilson followed him; Fryers put his knee on his throat, and I held one of his legs. When Moven ran off, he said, he had got the swagg, and then we all got up, and ran away; we crossed the River at Shadwell Dock-tiers; we got a boat there; we landed at the strairs opposite, in Rotherhithe; then we went to Deptford, and shared the money that night; we went to the Unicorn, the first house; Moven took out the money and divided it among us in a house next to the Unicorn, where we slept. We first went under a lamp, and he took out a ten-pound note, as he said, he could not stay. I got fifty-five pounds they told me; but I am not a scholar, and did not know what notes they were. I returned to London the night following; I stayed at Deptford the whole of the next day. The prisoner kept the same as I had, as they told me. I told Mr. Brown two days after. I had not been apprehended, I was cleared from it, and when Moven was taken, I came forward again. I had been taken before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I belong to Shadwell police office. On the 10th of January last, Bryant sent for me down to the Duke of Rutland, saying, he was sorry for the men who were taken into custody; there were two young men taken on suspicion, though not concerned. He then said, he was one of them; he said this of his own accord. He said, that he, together with the prisoner at the bar, Wilson, and one Fryers, were the four who robbed the lagger, that means a sailor. I had not at that time seen the prosecutor, Ward. I went, and Bryant with me, to try to apprehend Wilson and Fryers; I did not apprehend them.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of February; I and Hewitt had been looking after him for five weeks. When I took him, I told him I wanted him for a robbery; I knew his person. He said, he knew I did not want him for that, only for leaving his master's employ. I asked him where he had been, and I understood him to have been at Liverpool.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the robbery; that is all I know; I have got no witnesses, my lord.</p>

On the 19th of February, she came into my service, and staid until the evening of the 9th of March following. I was absent in the morning of that day, and when I came home in the evening, I found my house open, with all my doors open. After I got in, I awakened my wife, she was asleep in the bed-room. I asked her if she had sent Susan out. I had a female lodger in the house, but not any other attendant. My wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030014"/>said, she had not sent her out; and asked me if she was not in the parlour; I told her she was not, and she asked me to look on the table, and see if her gowns were there; I looked, and answered no. I then found the watch was gone from over the parlour mantle-piece. I looked in a drawer, in which I usually kept my business, and missed a gold watch-case; I looked farther, and missed several articles, such as trinkets. I then fastened up my house, and went to bed; it might be about twelve o'clock. When I came into the house, there was a pillow-case hanging over the fender alight; I put it out. The next morning being Sunday, I got up about five; I made further search of what I had lost, and immediately went to Lambeth-street police office. I gave information to Freeman, the officer; he and I went in search of the prisoner; she had lodged with her father and mother, but was not there. She was found in Whitechapel, near Essex-street, in the street-walking. I left the officer then, before she was taken, and when I went again to him, he told me he had got the prisoner, she was then locked up in the watch-house; part of the goods were found on her person, for she was dressed in them; they were found by the officer; his name is Freeman; he said he had found them on her person, and he shewed them to me; there was part of a gold watch-case, a tin box with trinkets, a silk scarf, a brown stuff gown, a black hat and feathers, what they call a chip hat, a white swan down ruff, those were the articles produced by the officer, when I called on him at his own house; the part of the watch-case that was found was worth four guineas; the tin box contained a neck-chain, a gold brooch, and a necklace, and I believe that was all the box contained at that time; the gold brooch, is worth ten shillings and sixpence; the neck-chain, is worth a shilling; the necklace is worth ninepence. These the officer shewed me as what he found upon her.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I belong to the police office Whitechapel. I searched the prisoner's person; I apprehended her about twelve o'clock, on the 10th of March; I searched her, and found on her head this hat and feathers; here is a scarf, a gown, which the prisoner was wearing; on searching her pockets I found this part of the gold case. I then asked her where she slept on the night of the 9th, and she told me she had slept in a house in Wingfield-street, Spitalfields, and that she had left her bundle there. I asked her how she came by these things; I charged her with having stolen them, and she did not deny it. When I went to her lodging where she said she had slept; I found a bundle, containing this tin box, containing a ring, a brooch, a chain, and a duplicate for a silver watch, pawned for one pound one shilling, at Mr. Richards's, in Brick-lane; here is also a stone apparently of a seal.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner at the bar came to our house on the 9th of March, in the evening; she purchased a pair of earrings. She pledged the watch for one pound one shilling, and paid five shillings for the ear-rings out of it. She gave me her name as Ann Brown, Brick-lane. I had not known her; I rather think, I had reen she before; but I am not certain; she did not pawn any thing else.</p>

I had no other apartment; the shop was connected with the body of the dwelling-house; it is part of it; my son slept in the shop. On the evening of the 17th, St. Patrick's Day, about half past nine, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, broke open this shop of mine. There were two locks to the door, a padlock, and another lock, which was locked double. This night, about that time, I saw my son to his bed; I generally send one of my sisters with him; but this night, I went myself. When I came in the shop door, I found the padlock was gone; it had been on the outside of the door, and the staple screw was forced out. I kept articles of trade in the shop. I tried the door with my hand, and found it open; the trial I made was to ascertain whether it was open; I then pushed it wide open, and found it hit against some person; I said to my son, there are thieves here. The moment I spoke the words, the prisoner at the bar made an attempt to rush but; he rushed from behind the door; I laid hold of him immediately by the collar; another followed immediately, another man; a vielent scuffing then took place on the pavement. My shop was on the ground floor. The consequence of that was, that there being two to one, I was thrown down in the horse road, with great violence, by the two; but the fall did not break the hold I had of the prisoner. The accomplice, who afterwards made his escape, fell upon me, and struck me, and dragged me, and tore me, and this is the coat I wore; it had been a wet afternoon; those were the small clothes I had on. The accomplice, finding that I kept my hold, had a cudgel, and as I was laying down with the prisoner, straight as a person would lay in his bed, he made a violent blow at me; but fortunately he missed me; still I kept my hold. My son was there, and did what he could. Then the accomplice, when he made the blow, ran away. I then got up, keeping hold of the prisoner, and I never left hold of him until I gave him into the custody of the officer; he is here; the officer is also here who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030015"/>picked up the padlock. I lost nothing out of the house. I saw the padlock after it was picked up; it was considered a safe one, and no picklock could enter it; but they forced the staple out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you catch hold of me inside the door or on the step?</p>

               <p>Witness. Inside the shop; for the door was pushed to, and to a person passing by, it would have appeared fast.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN BRYDGES. I am the son of the last witness. I went to sleep in this shop; my father went with me; it was on a Sunday night. My father pushed the door; the padlock was off; I had put it on at ten o'clock on the Sunday morning. When my father pushed the door, it bounced to again, and seemed to hit against some one. My father said, there were thieves in the place, and my father apprehended the prisoner directly; there was no light by which I could see his face; it turned out afterwards that he was the man. After my father had collared the prisoner, another man appeared; the other man rushed on my father, and the prisoner, and all three fell down, my father having hold of the prisoner; I fell down with them. Then I gave the alarm, and a few people came; and then the other man ran away. I immediately went for a constable to Marybone-watchhouse, and he came with me. My father was holding the prisoner all the time; he never let go of him once; he delivered the prisoner to the custody of the constable, and then he was taken to the watchhouse. We did not find the padlock that night. The prisoner never said a word; he gave no account of his being there, or how he came there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The witness says, his father had hold of me all the time, and never let go of me once. How can he swear that, when he went away for the constable?</p>

               <p>Witness. I mean he had a hold of you when I went away, and he had a hold of you when I returned.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say, I was standing up from the rain on the step of the door?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; but it did not rain when we were there; the padlock was found the next morning, and it was file same padlock that I had locked on the Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>HALL REED. I am a constable of Marybone parish. I was fetched on the Sunday evening, at nearly about half past nine, by young Mr. Brydges; I went with him to the house of Mr. Brydges; I round the prisoner there; Mr. Brydges had hold of him; they were in the shop then; he gave me charge of the prisoner. He asked me if I was an officer, and I told him I was. I found nothing on the prisoner. His coat was all over mud and dirt, as well as Mr. Brydges's, very wet indeed. Mr. Brydges's coat was torn as it is now; it was a very dark night. I saw the padlock was forced off; but could not find it; it was found the next morning by the watchhouse-keeper. Mr. Brydges gave charge of the prisoner, and the next morning he was examined at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>-NEWITT. I found the padlock the next morning, as soon as it was light; I went to examine the premises, and when I went into the middle of the road, I found the padlock; there was a hole of the size of this screw in the door frame. Mr. Brydges recognized the padlock, and claimed it as his own, and produced a key which looked and unlocked it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing up at the door out of the rain, and Mr. Brydges came up to me, and exclaimed, he was robbed; in the mean time, Mr. Brydges laid hold of me, and we all fell together.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARROW. I live in Tothill Fields, Westminster. I keep a place for slaughtering horses. I know no more of the prisoner than when he came to my place, which was on the 15th of March, he brought a brown gelding; he said he brought it from a gentleman of the name of Mardimore, a bookseller, in Bond-street, to be killed. He told me, that his master thought the horse was glandered. I examined it, and found the horse was a sound horse. I told him I should not kill it, unless I had better authority; and he told me then, that he must take it back to his master; I told him I could afford to give his master more money, than the killing would bring. He said he would not leave the horse, unless he saw it dead. I told him he should ride one of my horses up to his master's, and one of my boys should go with him, to know if his master would sell the horse. Accordingly while we were putting a bridle on another horse, the prisoner rode out of the yard with his horse. My lad went with him, but he ran off. The horse was brought back by my son to my yard, in a quarter of an hour afterwards. The prisoner did not come back with him; it is the same gelding; Nightingale has seen him this morning again, over the way. I saw the prisoner at Dyson's the next time, in Park-lane. It was on the next day after the horse was brought back by my son. He con-confessed about it in Mr. Dyson's stable; he confessed he stole it from his old master, Sir

            . I am the son of the last witness; I remember the prisoner coming to our place with the horse; it was a brown gelding. I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030016"/>him say he brought it to be killed, from a bookseller in Bond-street; he said it belonged to a gentleman of the name of Mardimore; my father would not slaughter it for him. When I overtook him, it was in the Broad-way, Westminster; he wanted me to ride on first, or his master would be gone to the city, and my horse could go the fastest. I did not ride on, but staid with him. I rode with him until we came to Dartmouth-street, Westminster. He then jumpped off his horse, and told me to take it back to our yard, and tie it up. He said he would walk up himself; for if he took the horse up, he should get into s piece of work. I took the horse back to our yard and tied him up, and left him there. After that I rode to Bond-street, and could find no such person as he stated was there. I enquired for the name of Mardimore, but could no where hear any thing of any person of that name. The prisoner had said it was No. 35. I don't exactly knew when he was taken up; he is the same man I am sure.</p>

I was down stairs; my lad came down with the list of books that he brought. I went to the shop and found the prisoner there, and the apprentice only. My lad's name is Thomas. I told the prisoner I had two books which were mentioned in his list; and he told me to put the names of them, and their lowest price on a bit of paper. I did so, and he went away, saying he would call again about one. While he was in the shop; I observed a vacancy on a shelf, on the left hand side coming from up stairs. I did not take any notice of it while the prisoner was in the shop, but suffered him to depart. I did not perceive that he took any thing with him. After he was gone, I spoke to my apprentice, and shewed him the vacancy, and sent him after the prisoner. The vacancy excited a suspicion in my mind. My boy went out and returned immediately, and then I went out myself; I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's-lane, and saw a boy with him; I suppose about fourteen years of age. The boy had a bag of books with him over his shoulder. I did not know either the boy or the prisoner before; I gently took the prisoner by the lappel of his coat, and desired him to come back with me. There was nobody with me; he hesitated at first, and then returned immediately. In returning, at the corner of New-street, I saw the prisoner drop on his left knee and stoop; and on turning round, I saw he had placed three books on the sill of the door of Mr. Grane; he stooped sideways on his left knee. I immediately took the books and seiz
               <persName id="t18160403-11-person168">ed</persName>
             the prisoner, and he walked quietly with me to my shop. The boy followed him. When I got to the shop, I examined the three books. They were volumes of Sir John Froittart's Chronicles of France and Spain, There was not room for them in the book-case, where the remainder of the set was, and they had been placed on the shelf close by. The set of twelve volumes, and one volume of plates, sell for seven guineas. Perhaps, if they were offered to me separately. I would not give three shillings for them.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>JOHN SIMMONDS. (A little boy.) The prisoner lodged at my mother's. I went out with him on the morning when he was taken into custody. He asked me to go with him; I took a pillow-case, and went with him; he brought two books out of Mr. Setchell's and put them into the pillow-case. Before Mr. Setchell came up to us, he took them out, and put them into his handkerchief, and when Mr. Setchell came. I saw him drop them on the step of a door; that was when he was going back with Mr. Setchell. I saw Mr. Setchell pick them up, and carry them to his shop.</p>

               <p>Five respectable witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, told them, that the value stolen privately in a shop must be five shillings, to constitute a capital offence; but with respect to value in the present case, though Mr. Setchell or any one else, would not perhaps give three shillings for the three odd volumes; yet the intrinsic value was what they were worth to Mr. Setchell, at the time they were stolen; and certainly Mr. Setchell's loss would be considerably above five shillings.</p>

The prisoner at the bar was taken into custody on the 7th of March last; I was in the upper part of my father's house at about a quarter past seven in the morning of that day; the maid servant, who is not here, called me; I went into the shop; it was open; our shopman, named Back, had opened it. On my going into the shop, I saw the prisoner; the shopman was there also; no other person was there. The prisoner presented to me a list of books, which he said, he wanted. I examined the list, and wrote on a piece of paper the prices of such as we had; it was a very long list of books. I went to the back part of the shop to shew him one of the books; I went, and he stood where he was; he desired me to fetch it. I shewed him some books from the back part of the shop; I did not shew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030017"/>him any from any other place. He staid in all, about five minutes after I came. He did not buy any: he said the books were for the Earl of Kingston, land said, he would call again, and give me an order. After he came, I missed one volume of twenty of a set of books of Cicero; the first volume was separated from the rest. I did not miss any thing else then. I went out, and saw the prisoner in custody of Mr. Setchell, and also a little boy. The one volume I had missed, was found in his bag, and the others which I had not missed also; they were Homer, three volumes, a complete set Juvenal, one volume, complete; Herodotus, complete. Fide took charge of these books, and I knew them to be my father's.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Hayes. I don't sell in the shop; I go out with books occasionally. I remember the prisoner coming to my master's shop; I let him in myself; I went down for some water; I had opened the shop, and shut the door, and when I came up with the water, I opened the door, and let the prisoner in; he shewed me a list with the prices of books, and enquired if we had them, and I said, I would send the servant to call my master. I just went to the back door of the shop for that purpose; I left nobody in the shop besides the prisoner, at that time. When I returned, he was still in the shop, and no other person there; no one else came into the shop before my young master came; when my young master came, I believe I went out to sweep the passage. I returned again into the shop before the prisoner went away. I can't say whether I was there when he went away; I was in and out while he was there. I did not see him take any thing.</p>

I don't know Mr. Hayes's shop; I know King-street, Covent Garden. The prisoner and I went to Covent Garden together. The prisoner left me a little way off from the shop where he went in, I saw him go into Mr. Setchell's; he left me a little way off from the shop where he went in. The books that were in the bag, he brought me at twice; he went away twice at one shop; that was before he went to Mr. Setchell's. I don't know the books he brought me the first time, nor how many there were; he brought some books the first time, and some more the second; he put them all in the pillow-case, and left me a little while, and went to Mr. Setchell's, and brought three more back, and he put those in the pillow case at first, and afterwards put them into a handkerchief; the pillow case was full. He kept the others i the pillow case, until Mr. Setchell came and took me back into his shop.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the evening of Sunday, the 18th of February, about seven o'clock as near as can be, I was in the West India Docks, and saw the prisoner coming up the Export Dock, coming up towards the entrance that leads to go out; on his coming up, he said, was he too late or was the door shut; I said the door is not shut, but it is gone seven o'clock; as he came near, he seemed to be very bulky, and I crossed over, and stopped him; I asked him what he had concealed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030018"/>round him, and he said, nothing, at first. Then I got hold of him by the collar, and said, you must have something here, and then he said, he had got some shirts. I asked him to let me see them, and on unbuttoning his jacket, he burst a string, which confined something round him; I heard the string burst, and he pulled a piece of cotton and linen check from under his jacket, I asked him what ship he had come from with it, and he said, he had come from the Gartland; she was then lying in the Export Dock. I asked him if the mate of the Gartland knew that he had taken that out of the ship; he said, no, he did not; but there was a man in the Gartland that knew it. I asked him if he belonged to the Gartland, and he said, he did not. What ship do you belong to then, said I? he said, no ship at present in the Dock; but he belonged to the Porthumous, and that he had left her, and took this piece of check out of her on Saturday morning, and put it on board the Gartland, along with a friend of his, if he could get an opportunity of getting it away. I then took him over to our night box; then there were three officers more sitting down in the box, and I called them out, and put him in, and searched him, and found nothing more. An officer of the name of Winnel, asked him what ship he had taken it from, and he said, the Posthumous. We then took him to the watchhouse, and then Winnel and I went to the Gartland, and there saw Larkin, the ship's steward. I received from him three more parcels.</p>

I had received them from the prisoner Flowers; I received four at first; the fourth the prisoner had taken away that evening; the piece the officers stopped him with I believe was the fourth; he brought the four to me on Saturday, the 17th, in the morning at about six or seven o'clock; the time he brought then the Porthumous was lying in the West India Docks; I knew he belonged to her. She left the Docks in the course of that day. I don't know whether the prisoner went with her or not; he told me he left her at Gravesend.</p>

            . I keep a lodging-house, in Blackwall. The prisoner at the bat lodged with me one week. On Monday, the 19th, Mr. Gotty came and found some things at my house; those things were partly brought up in the room where I lie myself; the prisoner Flowers had brought them there; he had no chest at my house, so he delivered them into my care; he brought them in two parcels, tied up in his own handkerchief, and having no chest at my house, gave them me to take care of. When he brought them, he turned them out of his own handkerchief on the table where I was working; he told me to put them by; that they belonged to a man who gave them to him to dispose of them for him when he got clear of the ship. I knew to what ship he belonged. I knew when that ship went down the River; he belonged to the Portbumous, and he told me he went down the River with her on the Saturday; he came back from the ship on Sunday, and was taken into custody that same evening I believe; he told me he belonged to the Porthumous; but said he was not going out in h he had got his things on shore! He did not name the person to whom he had disposed of any of these things. He said his friend was on board the Gartland, and he said he was to see him for something very particular that evening, Sunday. He brought these things, one parcel on the Wednesday night, and another parcel on another night; but he brought the two parcels running on the Saturday. He came from the Porthumous on the Saturday; she was in the Basin; he brought two pieces of na een on the Saturday; he brought both when the Porthumous was lying in the Docks.</p>

            . I am clerk to Darby and Davis, in King-street, Cheapside; they are warehouse men. In the month of January last, we furnished the house of Higgin and Whiteby with a quantity of goods, of which these are parts. I have examined them at the Thames Police office; the name of Darby and Davis on them are my own hand-writing. Those three pieces in brown paper are nearly in the same state as when I packed them. I look at those handkerchiefs, which are romotl's handkerchiefs, it is a term given to them; there is something very particular in some of the patterns, it is a red mark.</p>

               <p>JURY. Was any more of that pattern ever made for any other house - A. That I don't know. We had five dozen made for us; one piece of these four is not in papers; that is the one found on the prisoner; it corresponds with the other three.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Have you any doubt that those are part of the goods sold to Higgin and Whiteby - A. No doubt whatever.</p>

            . I am wharfinger at the West India Docks. On the 10th of February I received the goods specified in that receipt; the package was put on board, the Porthumous on the 13th; I I kept them in the warehouse under lock and key until they were put on board.</p>

               <p>JOHN WALTER. In February, I was mate to the Porthumous. On the 13th of February; I received a trunk on board; it was matted and regulary packed; it was deposited in the gun-room. The prisoner was a seaman on board that ship; the ship left the Dock at three o'clock in the afternoon, and she arrived at Gravesend on the Sunday morning. The prisoner went down in the ship as one of the seamen, and he left her in Gravesend; he was to have gone the voyage with us. He told me he was going up for his things, for he had not got them on board. On Monday, the 19th, Mr Butler came on board, he was one of our owners; by his desire, we fetched up this trunk, and examined it; it appeared not to be in the same state as when it came on board the ship; it appeared to have been opened, that was very easy to be seen. We then opened it; we found some swabbs and books in it; books belonging to it; the swabbs were swabbs belonging to the ship.</p>

               <p>MR. BUTLER. I know nothing more than the examination of the trunk, and finding it in the state the last witness has described.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. On the part of the prisoner, took an objection, as to whether a vessel in the West India Docks was entitled to that protection which would be offered to a vessel in the River Thames, by its being a capital offence to steal to the amount of forty shillings on board her; and, whether the West India Docks could be considered belonging to the said Navigable River, any more than any other pond or place watered by the Thames.</p>

               <p>THE COURT. However over-ruled the objection, on the ground that the West India Docks were apart of the Port of London.</p>

On the 26th of March last, I went out at six o'clock in the morning to washing; I left my three children at home; I left them in bed. I locked the door, and threw in the key through a hole in the window. I returned again at half past twelve o'clock. I then went to the school for the key of the house, and the school-mistrees delivered it up to me. Then I went home and found that the door was entirely forced open. I saw my cupboard was open as soon as I entered; it was broken; I missed my purse, containing three one pound bank of England notes, three three shilling pieces, a silver tooth-pick, and a duplicate of a ring. It was a green silk purse. I had seen the property the over night. I locked the cupboard, and put the key over the top of it.</p>

               <p>SUSANNAH SMITH. I am nine years old, pretty nigh. I know my catechism, I know that it is a bad thing to tell a lie. I left my mother's house between nine and ten in the morning of the 26th of March last. I locked the door, and lifted up the latch, and pushed it, and found it was fast. I then took the key to school, and gave the key to my school-mistress, and she laid it on the mantle-piece. I have two little brothers, and they went to school with me. When I and my brothers went to school, nobody was in the house. After school I returned with my mother, and found the door broke open; and that door I am sure I had locked in the morning, and given the key of it to my school mistress.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 26th of March, about one o'clock; I apprehended him at the Nag's Head public-house, in Kentish Town. I searched him, and he had got the purse clinched in his left hand; I then asked him where he got it? he did not make any resistance then. He said he got it at Finchley for work. I then emptied the money out on the table; there were two one pound notes, six three shilling pieces, a tooth-pick, and a duplicate; they were all in the purse. I then proceeded to bring him out of the public house, and the moment he got to the door he ran off. I pursued him and overtook him. He hit me very hard, and I knocked him down. I then se<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030020"/>cured him and marched him nearly halfway up Kentish Town. There we had another bustle, and then I managed him again; then we went a little higher up, and he got away again; and there we had several rounds of blows, and at last I knocked him down and hit him twice across the leg with my staff, and then he could not run any more. I at length secured him, and I had a horse and cart and put him in it, to take him to Hatton Garden. As we were going along, Mrs. Smith followed the cart, and he saw her, and he said, Mrs. Smith need not have done this to me, for I would have paid her every farthing. I had told him what I had taken him for. Mrs. Smith came into the Nag's Head and owned the property before him. He had not another farthing about him, beside this money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. To witness. You called me a bloody thief and knocked me down several times, did you not - A. Yes, I knocked you down, but not till you knocked me down first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not a person who would do such a thing.</p>

               <p>In addition to this, the prisoner put in another defence to the effect following.</p>

               <p>My Lords and gentlemen of the jury, on the 26th of March, as I was going home, after I had been with some food for my child at school, I picked up a green purse, which contained the top part of a silver pencil-case, a duplicate, and three bank notes. I got one of the notes changed at the Nag's Head, and when Mrs. Smith came home, she went to the constable and charged him to take me into custody. He took me and called me a bloody thief, and said I wanted to get away from him, and I was very innocent, and did not try to get away at all. Mrs. Smith has since told a person in Kentish Town, that she lost the purse out of her pocket, and she offered to make it up if she got the money back; but the officer told her there was a reward of forty pounds, and she would have ten pounds of it.</p>

I lost the linen in question on Saturday, the 2nd of March; I had put it on the foot of the stairs in a basket, with a large basket over it; it was linen which I had taken in to wash. I always leave the street door open in the day-time. I was folding shirts not a yard and a half from where the basket was, but in a room, and the door prevented me from seeing any one take the clothes. In about half an hour after I put the basket there, while I was folding the shirts, I heard a small creak of a basket; I opened the door, and saw the empty basket laying on the ground, and the full one was gone. I looked out at the street door, towards Hoxton-square; there were three persons and myself. I went a little further, and saw the prisoner against a chandler's shop, on the other side of the road, in the maket place; he had the basket with him; it was about five or ten minutes before twelve; I hallooed out; but I can't say whether stop thief or not, and he locked over his right shoulder, and seeing me, he went three or four steps further, and dropped the basket. I pursued him, and called out stop thief. I saw somebody lay hold of him, a young man named

            ; he got from me ever so far; but I saw him taken, and went on until he was. I am sure the prisoner is the man who had the basket, and who was secured. He was brought to my house, and the linen was brought back also; it was the linen stated in the indictment; part of it is here; I examined it at Worship-street, and it was the same.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew nothing of the prisoner before, nor did I see him go out of my house; I never lost sight of the prisoner at all. Four sheets are the only part of the linen that is here; my husband pays the rent and taxes of the house in which the linen was stolen.</p>

               <p>EDWARD HARDY. I live about four yards from the prosecutor's house. I was at my own door, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner with a basket before him, coming towards me. Directly he saw me, he threw down the basket, and shewed fight, and knocked me down. I got hold of the tail of his coat as I lay, and he ran away, dragging me after him; I never left go of his coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it; I heard a cry of stop thief, and the lad stopped me, and I know nothing of it.</p>

On the 6th of February last, I went to my landlord house, Mr. Butler, at No. 8, Hackney-road-terrace, to pay my rent, at about half past two in the afternoon; he not being at home, I went thence to the Dover coffee-house, in Bond-street, where I staid three hours, or more, with a person; it was nearly ten o'clock when I left that; it was a little after eleven when I got into Shoreditch, almost facing where I live; just as I was turning into <placeName id="t18160403-17-crimeloc103">Fleur-de-lis-court</placeName>

They struck me with their fists, and cut me in several places with a knife, or some other sharp instrument; they cut me here, and here, (on the right thumb, and over the left eye,) they called me had names; they tore my left hand side pocket away; they took a pocket-book, which contained seventeen one-pound bank of England notes; also a pair of silver mounted spectacles, which were in my left hand side pocket, where the pocket-book was; they took one pound six shillings and sixpence from my breeches pocket, and a new hat from my head; I called out as well as I could murder, several times; I was lying in the kennel. I had an umbrella in my hand, and one man wanted to wrench it out of my hand. The watchman and my daughter came in a moment, and he threw it away. All the men appeared to be about the age of the prisoner; but two taller, and one a little bulkier; I can't swear to the prisoner; nor to the persons of any of them; I could not observe their dress, except that they had long coats.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. My daughter and the watchman are here. It was rather a light-some night; I did not look at the state of the moon; there was plenty of light from the lamps for me to see the party coming against me.

I heard the cry of murder when I was outside with our servant, putting up the shutters; I knew it was my father's voice; I went to the place whence the voice proceeded, and found my father laying under the scaffold in Fleur-de-lis-court; there was a man on the top of him trying to take the umbrella from him. When I hallooed out father, the man ran away, and threw the umbrella away; three men and three women also ran away. The prisoner was the person who was on the top of my father, and who took the umbrella away; I had an opportunity of seeing his person, and knowing him again; he had a brown coat on; I had seen him before in Wheeler-street; Wheeler-street is near Fleur-de-lis-court; I had seen him on the day before; Fleur-de-lis-court leads into Wheeler-street. My father appeared to be much hurt, and bled a great deal. I got up before the watchman; he had just passed our door, which is in Pearl-street; he ran after the prisoner. I saw another watchman, that my mother called, as she stood at the door; but he did not come up. There was only one watchman named Patrick Duff, who came up, and he ran after the people.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the night of the 6th of February; I saw the prisoner that night at about eleven o'clock; he was in company with three young men and three young women; they were all at the corner of Fleurde-lis-court, making a noise, and singing; their making a noise and singing, attracted my notice; I had seen the prisoner before that time, and knew his person. I told them to move on, and they answered me in different words, such as damning my eyes, and the like, and they went down Shoreditch, and up Fleur-de-lis-court, In five or six minutes after they went up the court, I heard some noise, murder, murder, murder, was the noise I heard. Upon that, I ran towards were the noise of murder was cried; I saw the prisoner just drawing from the prosecutor. just about half a yard from him; there were three men stood three or four yards off, and three women to the left of me; as I went to lay hold of the prisoner, one of the young women laid hold of my coat, and I turned round, and struck her over the hand with a stick, to get loose. The prisoner ran, and I ran after him, leaving the others in the court; he ran away from them; he ran up the court towards Shoreditch; I ran after him, and left the others in the court. I followed the prisoner up Fleur-de-lis-court, across White Lion-street, into Spital-square, where he turned up a passage, and I lost him. I had a fair sight of him; all the way as I ran there was a light from the gas-lamps. When I saw him first, I could see him by the lamp at the corner of Fleur-de-lis-court, and by the light of my lanthorn. I had him in my sight about three or four minutes; I had known him before, and had seen him frequently; but did not know where he lived.</p>

            , In the course of September last, I was in the service of Mr. Soppet, of Thames-street, I there became acquainted with the prisoner; he courted me, and it was settled between us to be married after Christmas. He brought some articles of linen drapery to us at different times. It was about Michaelmas; he told me he had bought them of Mr. Man. He brought me two pair of sheets the first time; he next brought me some table cloths, also a pair of sheets again, and some small jack towels? that is, he brought me the linen, and I made it into towels. He brought me a shawl, which he told me he gave Mr. Man three pounds for. There was a scarf of which he made a present to my sister, but he did not say where he bought that. We were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030022"/>to be married after Christmas. He told me about two months after Christmas, that his father was very ill in the country; and he said he should lose two or three hundred pounds if he did not go into the country to see his father. He told me he would rather give my company up, and go into the country up for good; and if I would give him eight pounds for the linen I should have it.</p>

               <p>Q.What reason did he assign for asking you only eight pounds - A. He said he would let me have them for that, as I had the trouble of making them. He told me they stood him in about twelve pounds. Upon this, I went and told my aunt, Mrs. Rogers, what had passed; and in consequence of something that had passed between me and her, I took all these things to Mr. Man's.</p>

               <p>ANNE ROGERS. I am the aunt of the last witness. She came and disclosed to me something which she said had passed between her and the prisoner, and gave me the things, and I called on Mr. Man after I disclosed to him what had passed between me and her, he received the things from me.</p>

I think it was the 23d of February, or a day or two before that, the last witness came to me, and I received from her the articles stated in the indictment. I went to her house and saw them there, and there received them. The greater part is made up into sheeting and towelling,&amp;c. but on the fags belonging to them, there is my mark. I think I may say one or two; but on one, I am certain. I never sold these things to the prisoner. I wondered he never bought any thing for his own use; but he never did. If our men have any thing, we indulge them by letting them have it at prime cost. I never sold these shawls to him, (property produced), that shawl (pointing to one produced.) did not cost me less than five pounds.</p>

I did not examine the window before I went to bed; but my servant will be better able to speak to that, than I am. I am sure the sashes were not up. I rose about five in the morning; I had a house repairing within a few houses, and I went to see the workmen. It was day-light then, I think.

I went to the watch-house; the prisoner was then in custody; I also saw two table cloths and three aprons, and also many other things that are not in the indictment, but which were found, The prisoner is well known in our neighborhood.

I got up at about half past five in the morning; my master had got up before me. I went down into the kitchen and found my things were all thrown about. It was day-light when I got up. I had left the things in their proper places when I went to bed. There was no other person inhabiting the house, but myself and my master. I missed three silver teaspoons, three table cloths, two shawls, two aprons, three caps, one pocket handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and one pair of worsted stockings. The teaspoons had been on the dresser, the over night. Immediately after I went and informed my master. The next time I saw the things was on the 13th, at Shadwell office, between six and seven in the evening; the prisoner was then in custody. I could not see how the person who had broken into the house had got in. But, I think, by raising the sash of the kitchen window next the back yard, which back yard is fenced by a high brick wail; none of these things were locked up. The moment a person got into the kitchen, he might sweep those things off the dresser, and out of the drawers in a very short time.</p>

               <p>Richard Lovett. A person must have got over three walls to got into my yard; the window was secured by a sash screw generally, and something must have been put in between the two sashes, and the screw forced back; one of the walls which a person must have got over is about twelve feet high, and the other two are each between seven and eight feet.</p>

I asked him what he wanted there. He must have got into our yard first, and then into my next door neighbour's and then into Mr. Lovett's; he could get into my yard from the side alley which runs down. He said he had been to sleep, when I asked him what he did there. One wall is twelve feet high, and the other two are seven or eight at the lowest. I did not search the prisoner until after I had done my business; I kept him about an hour in the bake-house; I then opened the door, and called the watch, and delivered him over to Mr. Taylor, the watchman. I took the things from his pocket myself, all the articles named in the indictment; they were all about his person; some in his jacket pocket, and some in his waistcoat, and hat.

In the afternoon of the 16th of March, it was broken open. I went out about four o'clock, leaving nobody at the Lodge. I returned a little before five, and found the door quite safe as I had left it; but the glass of the bed-room window was broken, to turn round the handle, and was open; I had left it shut and whole; that window was in the back part of the house; the person passing the lodge would not pass that window; the lodge is placed to open a gate; a person might have gone through the gate without seeing the window. I walked round to the front of the Lodge, and saw the prisoner there; I saw him in the room through the window plundering my drawers, before I had opened the door. The prisoner is the man; I stood looking at his face for full three minutes; after that, he turned himself round, and stood and looked me in the face; he then turned found again, and bent himself down, and went across the room; he then went towards that window I had seen open; there is only one in that room; he went out of the room in which I had seen him; I then saw him in my yard; he had gone through the window as I supposed. He did not come out at the door. I gave an alarm; a person of the name of Towers was the first that came to my assistance, and he pursued the prisoner. I entered my house, and found the things in a very bad state, some in one place and some in another, and very much disordered; the coats were near the window which was open, four of them, and two pair of pantaloons, they were not tied up in any thing; nothing else was near the window; they were in the drawers when I left the house; they are here; they belonged to my husband. In the front room. upon my drawers, and on the chair, I found some of the children's clothes, four frocks, two petticoats, shirts, and waistcoats, all of which I had left in the drawers; they are all my children's clothes; there were only two or three things missed, namely, a coral, a silver nutmeg-grater, and a shirt of my husband's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should wish to know if she saw me near the house? whether she saw me near it, or whether I was not an hundred yards up the lane before she saw me at all?</p>

               <p>Witness. No; I saw him in the house, and afterwards in the yard, and pointed him out to Towers.</p>

Baker, the prisoner, asked me if I would buy her, and I asked him what he wanted for her; he said, thirty shillings, and I agreed to give him one pound seven shillings and sixpence, as her hide would not fetch much, because she had a bad back. I gave the money to Baker; each held out their hands, and I put into Baker's. The prisoner told me his name was

On his coming, I went towards Tottenham, and described the two men, and they were both found at the Bull, at Newington. I saw a drunken man at the door of the Bull, and told him what business we were upon, and asked him if they were there, and he said if we would give him a pint of beer, he would fetch them out, and he brought them both out; they went home to their own place, up a court just by where we took them. The other man said he would not run away, he said, he had nothing to wear but a pair of slippers, and he wanted to get a pair of shoes; the other man ran away. The prisoner said he would not run away, and he did not.</p>

               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

In November, I directed Trudgett to send a bay horse, which he had let to a gentleman, who broke his knees, and another horse that was down to Thorn's at Ealing; he said he knew a better place; he said it was the Duke of Clarence's Farm, a better place to be turned out at. Dear was not present; that was in the counting-house; then the horses were taken away, and booked out to straw yard. Trudgett brought in his account to me, and I copied that account into my book. In the month of February. I discharged Deare; and on the 2nd of March, I wrote upon a peice of paper, Trudgett, let me know where those two horses are; I want them up from straw yard, and he wrote under it, sir, at Bushey, just other side Teddington. One of these horses is a brown horse and was spavined; the other is a bay horse, that was broken kneed; on the same 2nd of March, when I wanted them up, he wrote let them stop a little longer, for they are doing very well, and I said; be it so. I had occasion to reprimand him two or three weeks before the 2nd of March, about his staying out late, he said he had been to look at the horses, and they were doing very well, and they were up to their collars in straw. In the afternoon of the 2nd of March, I was passing along Piccadilly, and at the end of Bond-street. I saw the bay horse which I called Butcher, because I had bought him of a butcher, in a hackney chariot; I took particular notice of him, and knew him to be my horse, the way he cocked his ear; the man was driving off, and I took the number of the coach, and found that it belonged to a Mr.

            , in Borough-mews; the number was 910. I went there and found the chariot at the public-house-door; I then knew that horse to be mine; I traced it to Mr. Harris's, stable-keeper, Kennington Cross; he relered me to Garland, and Garland to Bishop, and Bishop to Dixon's repository. Both the horses are here, below, and they are both my property. I traced the brown horse down to Huntingdon, and there I found that it also, had been sold at Dixon's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. These horses were not lumber in my yard; they were unable to work when they were with me; but they are now valuable horses; they were by no means useless, or I would not have turned them out. I had told Trudgett to sell the bay horse for twenty eight guineas, but that was before he was fired; I thought I had one of the greatest treasures in the world, in Trudgett, as a servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he not a general authority to sell your horses, when to your advantage - A. I have sent him with horses to Tattersall's to sell; but he never had any authority to sell them of his own accord; I put a price on whatever he was to sell.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon the oath you have taken had he not a general license to sell your horses if for your advantage - A. I don't deal in horses; but when accidents have happened, I have told him if he could sell such and such a horse to advantage, to sell him; but I never told him to sell these horses. He never went out to market to buy my bay or straw; I never yet trusted a man to buy any thing of the kind; I did not allow him to take and receive monies to keep, until I called on him to settle; we settled every Sunday morning. I never gave him credit, except for money I had lent him to get his things out of pawn.</p>

               <p>Q. If Trudgett directed him then, to sell the horses, it would be his business to believe Trudgett, and take them as he directed - A.I should think he would consult me upon it.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Dixon, at the Repository, in Barbican. At the time I was with him, I remember two horses coming from Steel's livery-stables; a hay horse, and a brown horse; they were brought to the Repository for sale, and the clerk not being there, I took the instructions. John Deare brought the two horses; he said he brought them from Mr. Steel's liverystables, by order of Trudgett; one was to be booked in the name of Dean, not Deare, and the other in the name of Clarke; but I am not sure. He wished them to be sold for what they would fetch. At the beginning of the sale, he came back, and told me that they were not to be sold under eighteen guineas the two. I asked him how he laid them about the equal price, and he said that either of them might be sold for nine guineas, but not otherwise, or eighteen guiness the pair; they went to the hammer, and neither of them would fetch nine guineas; in consequence of that, they were sold by private sale, for pounds instead of guineas; one was sold to a Mr. Bishop for nine pounds. On the Saturday Deare asked me when pay day was, and I told him on Monday.</p>

On the 20th of October, I ordered Trudgett, my head hostler, to take the curricle and three horses to Tattersall's, at the top of Bond-street, to be sold; there was a harness and all complete. The horses would not fetch the price, and they were bought in; the curricle was not sold, and it was left at Tattersall's; the horses were brought away; one shilling and sixpence a week was to be paid for the curricle remaining there, as is customary. I saw the curricle when I took stock at Christmas time, two months after it went to Tattersall's. When the prisoners were taken into custody upon another charge, Deare told the officers he sold the curricle to a foreigner; I found no curricle at Tattersall's. I found the harness, the cushions, and the driving seat; they had been left there as security for the standing of the curricle. I had information from the officers where it was sold, and I went to Messrs. Page and Company, coach-makers, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square; I went over their premises, and found the curricle body there, hung upon a one horse chaise carriage; the wheels and axle-tree were my own; but new hung. I found the carriage taken to pieces, as if to be shortened, or as I suppose to be made more fashionable, for I had it many years. I claimed it as my property; I saw both the proprietors; it was then put out of the way. Mr. Page said he would send it; he did not send it; and the magistrate ordered him two or three times to send it, as did the grand jury; it is now down at the door, in its altered state; it is mine. I never authorised the prisoners to sell it; I had fixed a price upon it when I first sent it to Tattersall's, namely, fifty guineas.</p>

               <p>JAMES TADLOW. I am clerk to Mr. Tattersall. I remember this curricle standing in our yard for a long time. Trudgett brought it in the first instance, there was a man with him, and three horses at the same time; the curricle and horses were put up in October, and the horses were bought in, and re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030026"/>moved; but the curricle was left. After that, Deare brought an order from Trudgett, to deliver the curle to him; he left some part of the harness, the cushions, and the driving-seat, as security for the payment of the money due for its standing in our yard.</p>

            . I am a coach-maker, in Margaret-street, Cavendish square. My partner's name is Messer. Deare came to us about December. and asked us if we wanted to buy a curricle. I went to Tattersall's, and saw it; it was booked there in the name of Trudgett; I asked Mr. Tattersall what it was booked at, and he told me ten pounds. Deare came in a day or two after, and asked me if I had looked at it, and I said, I had. He told me the barness, the cushions, the driving box, and the pole pieces, were not to be sold; with that, we told him we would give him four pounds for it; he said, we should have it, provided we paid the money for its having stood at Tattersall's; we told him we did not know how long it had stood there, and therefore we could not think of doing any thing of the kind. He then brought an order for us to fetch it from Tattersall's. We did not fetch it from Tattersall's, because we had not a horse. Deare brought it to us, and I paid him four pounds one shilling. We broke it up, and put the carriage on shafts, and on another carriage; it is down stairs.</p>

We first suspected her by her locking herself up in the bed room, where he had no business to be with the door locked. Mrs. Ball went and knocked at the bed room door, and the prisoner made no reply. There are two doors to the bed room, and she went round to the other door, and there knocked, that was locked too; in about the pace of half a minute the prisoner answered yes, malam; that gave me a suspicion, and I sent for an officer in the evening.</p>

            . I was sent for about nine o'clock in the evening, to Mr. Ball's house; there were two bundles produced to me, that they said, had been taken from under the sink in the kitchen. The prisoner was present when they said so. I came close to her person, and felt something, which I thought was under her top petticoat; it turned out to be two shirts, which I took from under her petticoat; I then searched her pocket, and found four handkerchiefs, three caps, four muslin ribbons, but they call them o -hands, a silk ribbon a black lace veil, nine or ten cotton stay laces, and a small tunbridge box, containing two pairs of earrings, a guard ring, and a morrocco box, with a re nt of nett lace in it. I took the two bundles, and going to the Compter, she said her friend lived at Worcester. She had been in the Guard Society, and had come from there to Mr. Ball's place. The bundles coutained the other articles named in the indictment.</p>

            , a porter, took these trunks to Galley Quay, on the 30th of October. In consequence of information, I went down to Galley Quay, on the 31st, where I saw the trunks, which from the slovenleness of the package, appeared to have been opened; when they went from us, each was locked, and the key fastened to the end of the trunk, and a cord outside the mat. On un-packing the trunk, we missed the property named in the indictment.</p>

I saw them the next day, and they appeared very different in their package then; the mats were not done up as they were before, and the appearance was such as to make me believe that they had been opened, and when they were opened in my presence, the good appeared to be opened out in order that they might not shake about in the trunks.</p>

            . In the month of October last, I was servant to Messrs Jacklyn, Williams, and Co. lightermen. On the 30th of October, I was ordered by Mr. Burton, to take three trunks down to Blackwall, to a ship which was lying off there. I returned at about half past eleven o'clock at night. I left Galley Quay at about half past three o'clock in the afternoon. When I was going down the river, I met Spendlove, the prisoner, and Connell the watchman, with him. I stopped along-side Spendlove's barge. I asked him whether he was going to Limehouse. He asked me where I was going, and I told him to Limehouse and Blackwall. He then said, so am I too. He asked me if I had a tool with me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did he ask you if you had a tool, without any previous reference to any thing that could require a tool. - A. Yes. I told him I had not; and he said he would meet me at the Lower Ship, Limehouse Reach. That was the Lower Ship that I had to go to; nothing more passed at that time. We understood one another without any more. Afterwards he met me at the Lower Ship. It was about a quarter or twenty minutes after four o'clock, just getting dusk. He came on board my vessel first, as I was going to shove her off from the ship. He said he must put the benches up. They are put on each side of the thwarts; that was in order that he might have a covering over, so that the people could not see. I was rowing the boat; he told me to look out to see that nobody was coming nigh. He took the cording off the trunk, and then the matting. He ripped the nails out with a chissel. He then got the key from the handle and opened the trunk, and there was some very dark brown paper that the parcels were wrapt in. He then took the things he thought necessary; they were muslins and shawls. Twentynine shawls, and about nine pieces of muslin. Some of the shawls dark, and some light. He then said he would go to Gates's house, and bring a dark lantern, Gates lived at Limehouse, and a man who was tried at the last sessions. He went down to Blackwall, and said he would take the things to Rammage's, who is a publican there. I afterwards went to Rammage's, aad met Spendlove there. Spendlove took muslins and a lot of shawls, some in his bosom and some in his great coat pocket and his hat. When we were at Rammage's, we went up two pair of stairs. A person of the name of Brown came there. He and Rammage looked over the things, and Rammage said they were rubbishing things, going out to the negroes in the West Indies. Brown asked Spendlove if he wanted any money, and he said he had only a five pound note in his pocket, which he gave Spendlove. The things were left at Rammage's, and Brown with them. After that, I and the prisoner went to the boat.</p>

She brought one first and four more afterwards. I never measured them, she brought seven in the whole; but I bought them for five. She was paid four pounds ten shillings for them by Mr. Smith. I only bought them for five; but they were all left at our house, under a mistake. The seven pieces were all plain; she brought also a striped piece, but that I would not buy, because I thought it would not sell. Mrs. Brown took that away with her. I don't know whether I could recollect that again. It was stri ed and figured. I had the pieces I bought until they were delivered up to the officers.</p>

            . I am a police officer; I searched Brown's house on the 31st of October, in company with Edwards and Woolard, two other officers. Mr. Burton was with us; neither Brown nor his wife were at home at first; it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. While we were there, Mrs. Brown came in, and as she came through the passage she dropped a handkerchief, a piece of striped muslin, a gown piece of blue cotton print, with four pound notes, some silver and some half-pence, (produces the muslin.)</p>

               <p>Mrs. Smith. I look at that piece of muslin. It is like the piece which Mrs. Brown offered me for sale. It is something like it. She bought some blue print when she was there.</p>

There were seven pieces of the same kind in one of the trunks; but I can't identify these. The fag ends being off. The striped piece was in one of the trunks.</p>

I had been looking for him before that, for a month or six weeks. He wears a piece of false hair on his head generally, and his whiskers were larger than usual when I apprehended him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. I did not search for him at his own house; but I searched for him at Stone Stairs, where he used to ply as a waterman.</p>

I jumped upon a hackney coach, and got before them, unobserved. They went into a publick-house, and I followed them in; when I went to apprehend them, Bibby swore he would blow my bloody brains out. I did not see what he produced at that time. I afterwards saw a pistol lying under the seat where he had sat, which was loaded with powder and ball. The prisoners were searched in my presence, and a shawl was found in Key's hat</p>

I sent to Bow-street for Dickins, Two other men came with the prisoner; it was about half past eight o'clock when they came, and Scott requested me to leave them until the following morning. He did not come the next morning; and upon that, I gave information to Dickins.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the habit of going to Roberts's house as an acquaintance, and unfortunately he has conceived a jealousy against me about his wife.

I can prove I never brought any bundle on the 26th of December.</p>

               <p>George Roberts. That boy was not of a good character; he is a notorious thief; he was convicted a short time ago, and if he is now asked how he gets his living, if he tells the truth, he must say by thieving. I never sent him out to shave any one but once.</p>

In consequence of something, I watched him a few days before this happened, and on the 15th of March, at a little after twelve, a customer came into the shop, and I served her, and gave her change, and saw that there were two dollars, two three-shilling pieces, and some smaller silver in the till. In a short time after, a gentleman came in, and bought half a chest of oranges; he paid the prisoner for them with a one-pound note, and a three-shilling piece. The prisoner took the note to the desk, and wrote on it, and put his hand into the till, and pulled it out again shut, and went up to the desk. About a quarter of an hour after that, there was a customer came in, and wanted three pennyworth of oranges, and I went to give her change. Nobody came in during the intermediate time. I then went to the till, and observed there was only one three-shilling piece. I said to the prisoner, Joseph, did not that gentleman give you a three-shillings piece; and he said, yes, and I put it into the till. I said, he could not have done so, for there were two in before; that he still stated he had put it in. Mr. Jolley came in, in a quarter of an hour afterwards. I asked him. (so that the prisoner might hear me,) if he had taken any money out of the till, although I knew he could not, as he was not there; he said, he had not, and the prisoner rushed out of the shop directly. I then told Mr. Joiley what I had observed.</p>

            . On the 15th of March, King began to speak to me in the prisoner's presence about something; the prisoner immediately went out, I had told him to go to Mr. Clarke's, and he staid ten minutes longer than the porter King, whom I sent after him to Mr. Clarke's. On the prisoner's return, I told him if he had been an honest man, he would not have left the shop when King began to speak to me. I asked him what made him stay so long, and he said, he had been for a walk round the market. I then charged him with having stolen two three-shilling pieces out of the till, and he denied it. On his being searched by an officer, he had nothing about him, but seven pence. In consequence of what I had heard, I told him he had another lodging, and that it was very strange, a young man who boarded and lodged with me, should have one. After he was gone to the Compter, he said that he had some keys up stairs which he wanted. I took possession of those keys. After a great deal to do, he told me his lodgings was at No. 3, Liquor-pond-street, he said, at a Mrs. West's. I went to Liquor-pond-street to search for his lodgings. He had described Mrs. West as washing for him; and on my going to No. 3, Liquor-pond-street; there was no such person lived there. I enquired at all the public-houses, chandler's shops, and grocer's shops, with as little effect. As I was returning home, I saw a board hanging out, with a mangle painted upon it, and on enquiring there. I was informed, a person of the name of West lived at No. 3, Bedford-street, which is near Liquor-pond-street. When the prisoner gave me the direction, he told me it was No. 3, Liquor-pond-street, and not in any of the streets or courts leading into it. In consequence of directions Mrs. West gave me, I went to a room in her house, and found a box with the prisoner's name written on a card that was nailed on it, and I think the hand-writing was his. One of the keys I had taken possession of, opened this box. I found in it, a large quantity of silver, silk stockings, and a receipt for gloves he had purchased after having been in my service; the silver amounted to fifteen pounds twelve shillings and sixpence; looking over that silver, I saw two shillings, which I am positive I had put into my till myself, which were missed on the same evening they were put in. The money has been in the custody of a police officer eve since. The prisoner came to my service from that of a person named Kipling, a hosier, in the Po ltry.</p>

I had gone out only half an hour before. The place which was broke open, was a work-shop of mine, a little way from my house, where the lads sleep; two apprentices and my own son. As I was returning home I put my hand against the door as I usually did; I found the top part open, and on putting my knee against the bottom part; it also gave way. The lower part of the door, (it being a hatch) could only open half way, for the bedstead. I asked who is there, and no one answered. I thought I heard something move very slow in the shop, and I requested a man who was going past at the other side of the way, to knock at the next door, which was mine. My wife hearing my voice, came to the door of my house with a light, and then the prisoner made an attempt to come out of the shop. I caught hold of him half in and half out. I took him by the collar, and took him to my own house; some neighbours came in and I left him with them. I then went back to our shop to examine if I had lost any thing. I found nothing missing; but two blankets and a rug were rolled up together at the foot of the bed. I found three pair of half boots, and a pair of man's shoes removed from the place where I had left them.</p>

I fastened up the shop by nailing the upper part of the door with a nail, and a piece of leather; then we come underneath and fasten the lower part, by locking it. I then took the key into the house after I had done, to hang it on the nail. The other apprentice had gone out a quarter of an hour before me. There were only these doors and a window to the shop, and I had fastened the window also. The blankets and rug had been laid smooth on the bed, ready to come to bed. When I went out, there were three pair of half boots lying by master's seat, and also a pair of shoes.</p>

I was sent for between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the day in question, to take charge of the prisoner; and after I had lodged him in the watch-house, I went to this shop the next morning to examine it, I did not find any violence on the door at all. I could not discover how it had been opened. The nail I understood, it had been fastened with, was put into my hands by the last witness. I saw the hole in the door-post where the nail had been driven. I look upon it that the upper part of the door had been pushed open, and then the hand was put in and opened the lock, which was a spring one.</p>

            . On the evening of the 13th of March, I was sitting in my parlour behind my shop and I heard something, as if the door opened for somebody to come in. The door had been on the latch to the best of my knowledge. I immediately went into the shop, and immediately I saw a person handing the till over the counter. He ran off, and I ran after him. I cried out after him. I pursued him near twenty yards; in consequence of which he dropped the till, and I picked it up and carried it home. I heard the constable, whose voice I knew, say, Mr.

At about nine o'clock in the evening of the 13th of March, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030032"/>the prisoner with something under his arm running, aad Mr. Stewart after him. At that time I thought it was a box; I saw him drop it, and I immediately laid hold of him; I took him to Mr. Stewart's shop, and afterwards to the watch-house.

I was then seized by two watchmen, and taken to the watchhouse, and the prisoner the same. The prisoner was searched, and I was searched likewise. While I was being searched, a watchman brought a pistol in, and another brought a paper of powder, which he said the prisoner threw out of his pocket.

            . I am a watchman of Cheapside. I heard a noise, and shortly after a cry of watch! murder! When I came up to the place, I found the prosecutor and the prisoner upon the ground, and when they got up, each charged the other. Mr. George charged the prisoner with wanting to rob him; and the prisoner charged the gentleman with wanting to rob and murder him. A gentleman opened a window, and said, take them both to the watchhouse. Three other watchmen had come to my assistance. We took them to the watchhouse; in going along, the prisoner dropped the bowl of a pewter spoon from his pocket; I also saw him drop a piece of paper, which was afterwards discovered to contain gunpowder; I did not pick it up, because I had hold of the prisoner. When they got to the watchhouse, they were both searched, but nothing found. I then went back to the place where they had been lying, and found a pistol, which I brought to the watchhouse, and gave to the constable of the night; it was loaded.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030033"/>Prisoner. Were you the first that came up?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What was cried first?</p>

               <p>Witness. To the best of my recollection watch! was cried first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When you came up, what hold had the gentleman of me?</p>

               <p>Witness. He held you fast by the collar.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did I say to you when you first came?</p>

               <p>Witness. You said, the gentleman wanted to murder you or rob you.</p>

               <p>COURT. Which gave the first charge?</p>

               <p>Witness. The prisoner; he had hold of the prosecutor also.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me drop any thing; did you see the bowl of the spoon fall?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Had you hold of me?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; I on one side, and another watchman on another.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. And how was there a possibility of my having the use of my hands, in the custody of two watchman?</p>

               <p>Witness. We had only a hold of your collar.</p>

               <p>GEORGE TAYLOR. Another watchman, corroborated the account of the last witness, and picked up the powder.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did the gentleman say when he came to the watchhouse?</p>

               <p>Witness. He said that if you would acknowledge your fault, as there was a God above, he would say no more about it; but if not, he would persist in the Law. The prisoner then wanted the gentleman to go side with him; but the gentleman said he would not, and whatever he had to say, he must say before faces, or he would not hear it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not the gentleman say, that he could not say whether it was a pistol or not?</p>

               <p>Witness. No; he distinctly said it was a pistol. When the prisoner was searched, a thimble was found upon him, and he exclaimed, a very pretty pistol indeed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Fore-street, in the morning, about one o'clock, to go to Old-street to sleep, and this gentleman came up, and asked me the way to Angel-street; I told him it was to the right of Wood-street, and I would conduct him to it. Just as I got into the dark place, the gentleman demanded my money or my life, and came close to me; I struck his hand, from which the pistol immediately fell, and he caught hold of my collar; I called out murder, and the watchman came up, and I gave charge of him. A gentleman from a sash said, take them both, and three watchman came up, and we were both taken to the watchhouse, and searched, and I had neither pistol or powder, nor had the gentleman who is my prosecutor; he sent for his friend, and was liberated, and they took charge of me; I was sent to Giltspur-street Compter, and afterwards sent here for trial.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

            's house, which is No. 11. Hart-lane, Thames-street. On the 28th of February, in the afternoon; I went there about five o'clock, and was stationed there to watch on the 29th, about six or seven in the evening, I was in the kitchen, and heard the street door go; I then got up, and went into the passage, and met the prisoner, with the middle door open, coming in; I told him to walk in, and not stand there, and when he came in, he took a chair, and sat down by the fire. I then asked him who he wanted, and he said, Watson, either Mr. or Mrs. I then asked him what he had got; he then looked at me with a little surprize, and said nothing. I told him that would not do for me, for I knew he had something concealed about him. I told him he had better pull it out; but he did not chuse, and I searched him, and pulled out from under his jacket, fifteen cakes of Spanish juice. I then took his apron off, and found a small bag, concealed in his breeches, which he said, was coffee; but on examining it, I found it to be cloves. I asked him where he got it; and he said, he found it. I asked him where he worked; I could get no answer; at last he said, for no one in particular, but for any one that would give him a job; I told him as that was the best account he could give, I should be under the necessity of taking him into custody; and when I questioned him more closely, after I got him to the Compter, he told me where he had been at work, and that he had taken the juice out of a chest. Nothing farther passed then. I went to where his master lived, and examined his warehouse, and I saw a chest of juice, which corresponded exactly with this; on looking farther, Mr. Lewis shewed me the cloves, and I could see that some had been taken out, for there was the mark of a hand like.</p>

               <p>JOHN LEWIS. I reside in Botolph-lane, Thames-street. The prisoner had been in my employment, as a carman, about nine months. I recollect the last witness coming to my house either on the day or the day after the prisoner was taken into custody. On examination when we looked at a cask of cloves, we found that it had been opened, for part of the head was loose, and some cloves were gone; it had been opened in the usual course of trade; I can't say whether I could have discovered that any were missing. The prisoner had an opportunity of taking cloves and Spanish juice, if he chose; there were two pounds and a half deficient in the cask of cloves, and one pound and two ounces were found on him. I believe the cloves found and the liquorice to have come from my premises, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>GEORGE BARLLY. I am a warehouse-man, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030034"/>conversant with these articles. We took stock, and found two pounds and a half of cloves deficient. The bag in which the cloves were found, is the bag in which the prisoner usually brought his victuals. The cloves found on him exactly correspond with those on our premises.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character from several witnesses.</p>

In consequence of having frequently missed money from our till; on Friday night the 29th of March, three pounds four shillings and sixpence in silver, were marked in my presence, and put into the till. On the Saturday morning when I came to look in the till, I missed three three shillings pieces, four eightteen-penny pieces, a shilling, and three sixpences; but only two of the sixpences were found. I immediately took the prisoner up into the dining room, and charged him with it. After a little hesitation he acknowledged it; I told him it would save a great deal of trouble if he would acknowledge it. He was searched by an officer, and the money found in his pocket.</p>

             SENIOR. I am a surgeon. The child was brought to me on the Saturday, and on removing the cap which it had on, I found a wound on its head of about an inch in length; it had been inflicted by a sharp instrument; I prebed the wound and found neither fracture nor depression, and I conceived the death of the child to be occasioned by the loss of blood prior to my seeing it; it was a merescalp wound.</p>

            . I lost my florentine on the 24th of February, at about a quarter before six, from my shop. I was down stairs in the kitchen, at about a quarter before six, and somebody came into the shop; I went up stairs, and the prisoner at the bar was in the shop; I asked him what he wanted, and he said some florentine for a waistcoat. I shewed him a piece, and he took it up, and looked at it; he took it to the door, and brought it back, and laid it down, and looked at another piece; he took that to the door also, and brought it back, and said those two pieces were rather thin. I then shewed him another, and he took them all three up together, and took them to the door, as I thought to compare them; but he turned his head round to see if I was looking, and stepped of the step, and away he ran, and I being lame, could not well follow him; but I came out, and called stop thief; the servant girl came, hearing me call, and being very active, followed him, and then he was taken, and brought back, and the silks were given to me. He was then taken to the watchhouse, and thence to Bow-street. He turned his head round to look at me, and then stepped of the step in a moment. As near as I can tell, he dropped the silks. He asked me to let him look at them, and I did. I had my eye upon him all the time he was in the shop.</p>

               <p>SARAH HARVEY. I am servant to Mr. Liscomb. The prisoner came into the shop, and I went up first, and asked him what he wanted, and he asked if Mr. Liscomb was at home, and I told him, yes, and my master came up to him, and presently I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner just in the court when I went out, and I ran as hard as I could, and just as he got to the narrow court, he dropped the silks. I am sure that is the man; I never saw him before.</p>

I picked up the silk, and we brought the prisoner to the corner of Rose-street. King-street, and Godfrey came forward, and took him into custody.</p>

            . This happened on the 28th of March. I went out at about nine o'clock in the morning, and came home between ten and eleven at night; I have no family; nobody but myself; I live over the stables; I have a servant, who does my work over the stables; but she does not live there; I am quite a <rs id="t18160403-49-viclabel257" type="occupation">single man</rs>

When I came home, the first thing I discovered was the door open; I went up stairs, and discovered the door of the hay loft open, which goes into the mews; they had come in through the cieling When I opened the dwelling room door, the cieling there, was broken. I discovered some clothes were gone, a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of small clothes, a handkerchief, and two shirts, a gold brooch, upwards of two pounds in silver, and a one-pound bank note; there is a door which opens from that room to another room, which door had been locked; but it was broken open with a poker and tongs. I learned from my man who helps me to clean my horses, that a man had slept in a coach house in the mews all night, and I asked him if he would come with me, and he did. We went to the man who owned the coach-house, and I told him what had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030036"/>happened, and he said, we were extremely welcome to search his place. I asked my man if he had seen the prisoner at the bar that day; I had seen him several times before; he had been a regular servant with a man in the mews for about a month. In consequence of questions I asked, I found the prisoner had absconded. We did not see nor hear any thing of him for about a week; at last, I gained information of him, and we went down very early last Sunday morning, and found him at his father's house; his father lives at the other side of Hockland, by a place called Birchinghall. When I got there, we found my coats in his father's house; two waistcoats on his person, a pair of small clothes on his person, a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pair of boots, all on him. Mr. Lee found the brooch in his pocket; but no note, no money, nor silver.</p>

               <p>JOHN LEPPINGWELL. On Tuesday, the 27th of February last, I was in Shoreditch, at about a quarter past seven in the evening. Thompson passed by me opposite Shoreditch church; I looked at him, because I thought I had a knowledge of him; afterwards I came to an entry which leads down to Cooper's-gardens, and he was then accompanied by Boston; the two prisoners stood before me across the path, and would not allow me to pass; they did not say any thing to me, I put my right hand up to part them to get between them. When the prisoner Boston saw my hand was engaged, he snatched at my seals that hung to my watch, which was in my fob; I felt him get hold of them, and I put my hand down to save my watch, and the chain gave way. We pulled, and then the chain gave way; he took both chain, seals, and key. Boston then ran down Cooper's-gardens; Thompson went back again, towards Shoreditch Church. I have never got my properety again. There must be considerable force used to get the chain away.</p>

               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. On Wednesday, the 28th, I was going down Worship-street and saw both the prisoner; I let them walk on until they got very near our office, I on one side, and they on the other; when I got close to the office, I called out to them halloe, I want to speak to you; one came just halfway across; and said he. and I said and you and all; meaning the other man. They then both came across, and I said, here is a man in our office, I want you to look at, and see if you know him; they both came; and I put them into the office; and I then sent for the prosecutor, and from his descriprion, I found them out.</p>

               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

This cotton was hung on an iron bar just within side the door. A man of the name of Wilson was tried here for this offence, and sentenced to be Transported for Seven Years.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am a patrole of the parish of St. Sepulchre. About half past three in the afternoon of the 9th of February, I was in St. John-street; I saw the two prisoners in company with one Wilson, who has been convicted at the last Sessions. Knowing them, I followed them into Holborn; all the way they were loitering about different shops. When they came to the prosecutor's shop, Smith crossed over the way opposite; Walker and Wilson went to the shop, and in a moment Wilson came running away with a piece of printed cotten in his apron; he crossed over to the end of Brownlow-street, and there I caught hold of him; I took him back to Mr. Houlbrooke, who indentified the property. They were all three in company together.</p>

            . On the 15th of February, I was called up at about half past six in the morning, I came down, and the watchman and patrole told me my yard had been broken open, and my fowls had been taken out of the hen-coop.

            . I lived at that time, next door to Mr. Lyon, at No. 7. I happened to be in my own yard, between three and four o'clock on the morning of the 15th of February; I heard some persons whispering, and what I conceived to be a man and woman's voices; I had a candle with me, and I held it up, thinking they were getting over my yard; when I held up the candle, all was quiet; I put the candle into the privy, and shut the door to, and listened, and then they began again; I heard them then talking and walking, for the snow was on the ground, and cracked. I then went to the front door of my house, and kept it a jar, as I knew they must pass me to come out of the yard where they were. I then armed myself with a stick, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030038"/>went through the arch, down the yard, and found the female prisoner there; I asked her what business brought her there, and she said, she was doing nothing. I looked round; but could see no man. I told her she had better go away, for there was a man there I was certain. In endeavouring to get away, I though; she had some bundle under her. I then went back into my own house, and kept the door a jar, and then she came out of the back square, and passed my door into the front square, and so into the street; after she was gone about half a minute, a man came out of the back square, and called after her Poll three times; the man gave the woman a bundle, which she put under her petticoats. I called the watchman, and told him to secure the man, and I would secure the woman; she made up to the wall and dropped a bundle from under her petticoats. The man got away. I picked it up, and found it was two fowls in a piece of old linen or cloth. The watchman and the man were struggling on the ground about five or six yards from me. I took the woman and the fowls to the watchhouse; but could not get any account from her where she lodged.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN SUGGATE. I was going the hour of four o'clock when Mr. Marks asked me if I saw a man and a woman in Ebenezar-square; I told him I had; upon which, he bid me lay bild of them. I went back, and Mr. Marks came after me; I said to him, you lay hold of the woman, and I will take the man; we came up to them, and the man knocked me down with an iron crow. and cut my head in three places very bad. He got away, and left three fowls and his hat behind.</p>

On Saturday evening last, I was in the back part of the shop, and the prisoner came to a sister-in-law of mine, to ask for a sixpence; she gave him one, and he returned back into the shop, and gave it to the customer that he was serving. I did not see him put any money into the till; but on the contrary, I observed him putting something in his left hand waistcoat pocket; he gave my sister-in-law nothing in return for the sixpence. As soon as the customers were a little clear, I called him to the back shop, and asked him what money he had about him; he said, he had none of his own, and what he had belonged to a cousin of his, who was a performer at the Sans Pareil Theatre, in the Strand, and for whom he had sold some tickets. I asked him to produce what money he had, and he produced four three-shilling pieces, and two shillings. On his producing that, I asked him if he had any more money about him; he said he had not. I asked him how many tickets he had from his cousin, and what they were; he told me he had had twenty pit tickets and fourteen box tickets. I asked him how many he had so; he said, he had sold three pit tickets to a Mr. Hoare, an uncle of his, a box ticket to his father, and another to his mother, and he gave a servant of mine and a young man one each. Out of the whole of the sales, it appeared by his own accout, that he had only received four shillings, I then sent for an officer, who searched him up stairs in my presence, and he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and on its being examined, he had a three shilling piece in it just at the corner of his silk handkerchief.</p>



               <p>COURT. Now the way I should have acted, instead of going this circuitous road to work about the tickets, would have been to ask him to account for the money he had taken from the customer.</p>

               <p>EDWARD MASON. I went into the prosecutor's house, on the 20th of March, in the evening, to get a glass of porter; I saw the prisoner in the bar, leaning with her left arm on the counter, and she was taking the money out of the till with her right hand, and putting it into her pocket, under her apron. I asked repeatedly for the beer, thinking she was the landlady; she kept her eyes frequently looking round, and said, yes, sir, yes, sir, several times. Immediately after the landlady came in, and asked me what I wanted; I told her what I had seen, and she went and pulled the drawer out, and discovered the deficiency, for there was only one sixpence left. The prisoner denied it, and said she had no money at all about her, and it appeared when she was searched, that she had seven or eight and thirty shillings in silver and copper.</p>

            . I lost my tea-chest in the middle of December last, from a yard in the front of my house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SITGRAVE. On the 10th of February, the prisoner and another man with him, who stood a little distance off, came into my shop with a tea-chest, in a blue apron, for sale, He took it out and gave it to me to look at. I suspected him very much, by the concealed manner in which he had it at first, and on examing it, I found it had no sugar glass; and he told me he had broken that just before he came from home; he asked me would I not give him any thing for it; I told him no, I would have nothing to do with it. I saw him go across to the next witness's shop over the way, and the other man with him; they immediately came out of Berry's, and I went over, and told him I considered the caddy as stolen. We went after them to the end of Charlotte-street; I there passed them, and they did not appear to know me again. I then lost them, and after that, going up towards the turnpike, at the top of Old-street, I saw the man who had accompanied the prisoner standing at a shop. I went into the shop, which is a broker's, and there the prisoner was offering it for sale; I told the woman that I thought it was stolen, and advised her not to buy it. I then looked for the person who accompanied the prisoner, and he was gone. The prisoner said the caddy was his; and when I got him to my house, he said it was his mother's; when I asked him who his mother was, he said she was a woman who carried the swagg, which I understood to be a basket of earthen ware.</p>

            . It is possible for a person about nine or ten o'clock in the evening, who knows our premises, to go up stairs without our knowledge. On the night of the 12th of March, I went up stairs about half past ten; and as I went past the door of one of the chambers, I perceived the bed was disordered; a bed which had been before made; a pair of sheets, a blanket, and a great coat were missing; that was from one room, Shortly after, I examined my own chamber, and missed a pair of stays, two sheets, two bed-gowns, two pair of stockings, two pocket handkerchiefs, four cotton aprons, and one linen one. These things had been washed and taken up stairs. I then gave an alarm, that I thought the house must have been broken open.</p>

The prisoner lived at house while our groom was ill; he had left us nearly three quarters of a year when this happened. He was with us for six weeks, and he knew the house perfectly. He slept in that part of the house which adjoins the room from which this properly was taken. It was perfectly easy for a person to get into our house between eight and ten in the evening.</p>

            . In the evening of the 26th of March last, I went out between the hours of seven and eight o'clock, leaving nobody at home. I locked the door; the back door was fast, and bolted with two bolts; the windows were also all fast when I left the house; I left no one at home. I returned again between nine and ten o'clock, I can't speak exactly to the hour. My husband returned first. When we examined the house, we found the drawers were open and things gone.</p>

               <p>MARY HART. On the 26th of March in the evening, I passed the prosecutor's house, near the hour of ten, and saw the front door in the court open. Mrs. Homan gave me a light, and I went into the house; the back door was wide open also; I did not examine the locks; the back door was wide open. I went up one pair of stairs, and saw the the door of a press bedstead open; I dont know whether there was any thing taken from that; I shut the bedstead door; the up stairs drawers were wide open. There is only one room on a floor. The drawers were wide open, and completely empty. The bed was tumbled, and the bolster, and pillows, were gone; the sheets were gone, and the blankets laid on the floor at the foot of bed, as if they had been thrown off. I fetched Mr Fgg, the publican, who also saw the state of the house. I then went and told Mr. and Mrs. Davis what had happened; she was at her mother's close by.</p>

            . I heard that my house had been opened at about half past nine, a young woman of the name of Hart informed me; she found me in a public-house. When I went, I found that my house had been opened, and the drawers were empty, and all the things gone; there was a mark by the lock of the door, as if a chissel had been used to force the lock back. The next time I heard of any of my property was when a man had them on his arm; that was in the afternoon; but I can't tell what time, because I was in a hurry to run to see my property; he had two pair of sheets, three napkins, and a waistcoat of mine; it was Joseph Emanuel; Mr. Gleed, the constable, was with me. Emanuel was in Mr. Cutler's house in Rag-fair.</p>

I immediately sent home to my brother-in-law, to acquaint him that I had detained some of his property. Joseph Emanuel said, don't be afraid that I want to run away, leave me in the care of your friends, and go and get a constable, and go round into Petticoat-lane, and there you find Joseph Myers. I left him with my friends, and the property likewise, and he made no attempt whatever to get away.</p>

               <p>JOSIAH SMITH. The prisoner came to our shop on the 4th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and bought a yard of calico, for which she paid ten-pence, and a handkerchief, for which she paid two shillings. She went away immediately after paying for these things. In about a quarter of an hour after, an officer of the name of Maidment brought her back to my shop; when she was brought back, she had two quantities of printed cotton; one was about nine yards; the other about four yards and three quarters; the cost price of the two was about thirty shillings, and I have no doubt but that they were my property; the nine yards, which cost about twenty shillings, I can swear to; to the other, I cannot so positively. These things had been near where the prisoner stood. I and a neighbour of mine were the only persons in the shop when she came in. My neighbour is not here.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Winfield's, the pawnbroker's at the corner of Compton-street, High-street, St. Giles's; I was in the pawnbroker's shop when she came; she offered to pawn the smallest piece of cotton, and asked eight shillings on it. I asked her whether she had been to treat herself to a new gown? and she said, yes. I asked her how much it took to make a gown? and she said, six yards. I asked her had she six yards? she said, she had, and when the pawnbroker measured it, there were but four and three quarters. That excited a suspicion in me, and I asked her if she had not something else in her apron? she said, she had, and what she had got there, she had brought from her mother's. I asked her if she would let me see it? and she said, no. I thought she had not come honestly by it, and I was determined to see what she had got in her apron, and I found the other piece of print, together with the calico and handkerchief. I asked her if she would take me where she bought them? and she said, she would; and she took me to Mr. Smith's. I asked him whether she brought the calico and handkerchief there? and he said, she had. I asked him whether she had bought the cotton there? and he said, she had not; and it was his property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As soon as I turned out of the prosecutor's shop, a strange woman followed me, and asked me if I wanted to buy a cheap gown? and I told her, no; I had bought all I wanted. She asked me fourteen shillings for this cotton, and I was going away twice, and she offered it for twelve shillings; when I unfortunately gave her my market money, and was about to pledge the cotton again, as I could not do without it; and when I was pledging it, the officer stopped me.</p>

               <p>JOHN EVANS. On Wednesday morning last, I went up stairs, between ten and eleven o clock, and on coming down again, I went to my own room, I pushed my door open, and it recoiled against me, as if somebody was behind it; immediately the prisoner was just coming out; and I asked him what business he had there? he seemed very much confused, and made a great many stammers, and said he wanted to find the kitchen; I shewed him along the passage towards the kitchen, and pointed it out to him; he had a ice-pail and a apron, like a confectioner's man. I just put my head into my own room to see if all was right, and perceived that my coat, which had been hanging up on the other side of the room, and my hat, which had been in a box, had been removed as far as from your lordship to me, to the plate chest, close by which the prisoner was standing when I first pushed the door open; I waited until he returned, and laid hold of him, and then he denied taking the coat and hat. I asked him where he came from? and he said, from Mr. Gunter's, the confectioner, in Berkley-square, for orders. I took him into custody, and took him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Brook-street, about ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, and a young man, like a confectioner's man, gave me that ice-pail, and asked me to go down, and ask if there were any orders from Mr. Gunter. I went down, and went into this room by mistake, and was just coming out when the gentleman stopped me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARNSHY. I am coachman to Mr. Joseph James. On the 22nd of February, I drove the family to Town, and we arrived in the afternoon about one o'clock; I put the carriage in the coach-house, at the Black Lion that night, and about half past seven in the morning, when I went to the coach-house, I found the doors open, and the tea, which was my own, and my master's coffee, both of which had been on the seat, were gone; also the coach-glasses and the rugg from the boot. On the Tuesday following, I saw some of these things at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>ROBERT CROFT. I know the prisoner at the bar. At about half past twelve o'clock on Thursday, the 22nd of February, at night, he was going past me at my beat, and he asked me for a lodging; and he had a white paper parcel in his hand. I directed him to a lodging in Field-lane; but he halted at Falcon-court; that gave me a suspicion, and I thought he did not really want a lodging. I went up to him, and found him in company with two other men; they made their escape, and ran down George-alley; I pursued the prisoner; I took the parcel out of his hand; the prisoner told me it was coffee. I then led him down to the watchho use in going along, the tea dropped from him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030042"/>also. I afterwards found part of the glasses, and the frames, which the two men had thrown away, in George-alley.</p>

On the morning of Tuesday, the 12th of March, I saw the prisoner at my house; he came about half after ten, alone; in about half an hour, he was joined by another person; that other person brought a bundle; they breakfasted, and staid at my house two or three hours. I did not see them leave my house. When they went; they left the bundle to be taken care of; I did not see them go, but I missed them. They came again in the evening; the bundle was left in the room where we have each parcels; they asked me in the evening if there was any conveyance to town, and they went to London at about nine o'clock, by a return post chaise belonging to the Three Nunns at Aldgate. The prisoner at the bar had been to my house at different times before; I have seen him dealing at my house several times.</p>

            . I rent the tap at the Three Nunns. On the night of the 12th of March, the prisoner and another man came there in a return post chaise belonging to our house; it was about ten o'clock when they came. The prisoner at the bar delivered a parcel into my care, and asked me to take care of it for him; he did not say until when. After that, they both went away in company together. In consequence of a suspicion I entertained, I sent for a constable. The prisoner returned in about half an hour, and I had got the constable in the house. I asked the prisoner whether he was going to take the parcel away? he said, yes, he was, and he made towards the door of the room where the parcel was, and seeing the constable there, he immediately turned back, and went out of the house, and the constable followed him, and took him in the yard, and brought him back into the house.</p>

I asked him if the property was his? he said, it was not; that he had accompanied a man from Startford, and that the man had begged him to have the parcel taken care of for him; he mentioned the name of Lynch.

            . I look at this property; it consists of all the things that we missed; it is the properly of my employers.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday morning, about half past nine, I got my goods, consisting of jewellery articles, ready, and went out as far as Whitechapel, to look out for the Coggeshall and Chelorsford coach, to go down the road as far as Stratford. I walked from the turnpike to Mr. Moss's house, and then I called for a glass of rum and water. I took out my goods, and there was a man came in with a bag, and sat himself down by me; he asked me where my goods were made? I told him they were made in London, and I told him I was going to London in the course of the evening, and he said, he would go with me. I went out about my business after that, and returned again in the evening; this man was there then. I stopped a return post chaise, and he and I got into it together, and went to the Three Nunns at Aldgate; I went in there, with a man, and called for a glass of rum and water. This man asked me if I would have the goodness to ask the landlord to take care of the bag for him, and the landlord said he would. I told the man he would find it as safe as in his own house the next morning. After I had returned back, and drank my rum and water, I was going back from the tap-room to the coffee-room, when Mr. Ray came and caught hold of me, and asked me was that parcel mine? I said no, it was not; it belonged to a man who had come to Town with me in a returned post chaise. He asked me if I knew what were the contents of the bag? and I told him, I knew no more than the child unborn.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane, near Barbican, No. 135. I have kept a house there for twenty-one years. I know the prisoner at the bar; he had lodged in my first floor three or four months, and lived there on the 11th and 12th of March, I always examined the house before I went to bed at night, and none of my lodgers are suffered to keep late hours. I am confident that the prisoner was at home before ten and eleven o'clock that night, of the 11th of March. Mr. Griffiths was with him. The latest hour I saw him at home was before ele<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030043"/>ven o'clock, and I am sure he was not out after that; because I always fasten my door at eleven o'clock, and don't suffer any one to go out; if he went out after that, I must have heard him.

            . I know the prisoner at the bar, and slept in his house, on the night of the 11th of March. I had lately come to town, and my mother had no room for me. I was there the whole of the afternoon. I don't know whether I drank tea there or not. I saw Mr. Griffiths there, and he went away about eleven o'clock. I did not sleep in the same appartment with Mr. Phillips and his wife. Mr. Phillips and his wife went to bed a few minutes after eleven o'clock. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning; and went into their room for my bonnet; and awoke Mr. Phillips, who was then in bed. I went to my mother's, and returned about half palf eight o'clock, and saw Mr. Griffiths at Mr. Phillip's then cleaning some seals and a chain. I can't say what Phillips was doing; but I think he was near the fire side; I think he had dressed himself to go out, but I am not possitive. Griffiths went away rather after nine. After Griffiths went away, Phillips got his goods ready, and put them into his pocket and went out.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GRIFFITHS. I am a jeweller I saw the prisoner at his lodgings, on the night of the 11th of March; I went there in consequence of his being in debt with me three shilling and six-pence. I believe it had turned ten in the evening when I went. I staid there nearly an hour; I did not return until the following morning. The prisoner came to me at my residence about half past seven o'clock, and staid with me some minutes; he begged of me to clean up some metallic chains and seals for him, and I told him I could not as I had not the materials, namely, rouge and leather. He then said, if you will come home to my place, I will furnish you with the materials. He then went away and I followed him; it was past eight o'clock when I got to his place; that I am certain of. I cleaned the articles, and as I was going back home, it was five minutes after nine by the brewhouse clock, and that is all I know.</p>

These things were lost on Thursday last, about half past three in the afternoon, one of the servants informed me that he had detected a man taking some of the plate off the side-board. I went in and saw this stand removed from the place where it stood, and a brown silk handkerchief which I had never seen before, spread upon a plate-warmer, at the end of the side-board, one corner of the handkerchief was turned up over the casters, and the three were spread out. The prisoner insisted that this handkerchief was not his property; and said he came to enquire for a gentleman; but I don't recollect the name that was on a letter which he produced, directed to Pope's Alley, Threadneedle-street.</p>

In the servants room about my business, I heard a bustling of the glasses on the side-board in the dining room, and saw the prisoner in the act of putting a handkerchief over a set of cruets, which usually stood on the side board, but which were removed to the plate warmer. He immediately went out of the room, and I followed him. He left the handkerchief; I can't tell whether he saw or heard me; I raught him just at the green swing doors, which open into the street; there are three pair of doors, and I caught him at the second. I took him into the committee room, and my fellow servant went for Mr. Brooks.</p>

On the 27th of February, I received thirty puncheons of rum into my charge from the last witness; there were tins over the bungs, and they were put into a craft belonging to Messrs. Faweelt, called the Shannon. I then went away to the officer of the gate, to take the samples there. I left no person with the samples in the intermediate time while I was gone to the gate. When I came back, the lighter was moved into the basin, on her way to the river. I went on board then; the rums were then all safe as I believe; there was no smell of any rum, having got out then. I walked on the quay, where I commanded a view of the vessel until about seven o'clock in the evening, and I was then relieved by the prisoner,

            . I am an extra excise watchman. On the 27th, I had charge of twelve puncheons of rum. I was relieved at Summer's Quay by Henry Williams; it was his duty to remain with the charge until six o'clock the next morning; it was a Deck Hoy. I saw it locked up before I left it, and therefore there could be no plunder there.</p>

             and Robert Nichols. My attention was called on the River to a strange smell of rum opposite the old Custom House; it appeared on board a lighter there; I ordered our boat to go along side of it; that lighter turned out to be the Shannen. I then stood, and opened my lanthorn, which was a dark one, and looked, and saw the prisoner Williams, get up from the after tier, in the body of the lighter, from among the casks; he ran forward in the lighter, and into a deck barge; I pursued him immediately, and he went over the deck barge, and into a lug-boat, and I jumped into it after him; he went forward, and endeavoured to conceal himself between the main thwart and the other; but I secured him. I asked him what made him run away? and he said what run away, I have not run away. I told him that I saw him run out of the lighter, and he denied it. His breath smelled intolerably strong of rum, I searched him, and found in his pocket eight spoils. I then put him on board my boat. On returning to the lighter, I found a spoil struck into a one hundred and ninety puncheon slightly, like a pen into an ink-stand; it appeared as if it had been put into the cask with the hand, and not hatcnered in; as near as I can possibly say, Williams ran from the spot, On getting back into the Shannon, I saw Butts and Gough standing in the head sheets of the lighter; they were enquiring what was the matter. I asked them were they watchmen of the lighter, and they replied, yes. I understood that one was the lighterman's watchman, and the other the excise watchman. I told them they knew better than I did, what was the matter. I suspected that the rums had been plundered, and I proceeded to search them; I found nothing on Gough; on Butts I found two sail needles, and some twine. I gave a look round the lighter; but saw nothing farther at that time. I then searched the different crfts along side the lighter; but found nothing. I was not satisfied, and returned to the Shannon again. On searching her further, I found two bladders of rum in her stern sheets, between her timbers. I examined puncheon one hundred and nine, and found it wet, and the two casks one hundred and five, and one hundred and twenty were also wet; they were wet from having been spoiled. Near the full bladders, I found two empty ones also, and with them a gimlet and crane; it is such as would be used for such a purpose. The bladders were tied with string, similar to what I found in Butts's pocket. I took Butts and Williams to the office. I left Gough to remain until I returned. Upon him, I found nothing, and he remained there until I returned. I told him I had left a person on the wharf, who would watch him if he did any thing. I had not done so, but I told him so to avoid his going away. The vessel was laying about one ships length from the shore; not so far off as the midstream.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HAMILTON, and ROBERT NICHOLS. Corroborated the account of last witness.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HURST. I am inspector of the Excise watch. On the morning of the 28th of February, in consequence of what had passed, I went on board the lighter, and found Gough and Brewer there. I went up to Gough, and asked him what he had been doing to let his charge be robbed, and he said, he knew nothing of it. I then said, were you asleep, and he said, no. I said were you in that place, and pointed to a kind of a cabin; he said, no. I then said, where were you then, and he said, there, pointing to some timbers on the fore part of the barge. I asked him if he was asleep there, and he said, he was not. I said if you were there, and not asleep, you must have been a party to the robbery, for in that place, he could have seen all over the barge, and all the casks. He then denied all knowledge of the transaction. I asked if he knew the men who were in custody, and he said, he knew nothing at all of them.</p>

            . I am an excise surveyor of imports. About ten o'clock on the morning of the 28th of February, I went on board the Shannon, and found it in the care of Richard Brewer, she had thirty, puncheons of rum aboard; I examined the puncheons, and found from one hundred and five there was about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030045"/>two gallons deficient, and one hundred and nine was about a gallon deficient, and one hundred and twenty was nearly a gallon and six eights deficient; that includes samples and all; if you deduct the samples from the gross deficiency, that will leave an improper deficiency of about four gallons and a half. I see the spoils that were taken from Williams; they are the same sized spoils as those in the casks.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WOODWARD. Having suspected the prisoner, who was in my service, I was determined to try his honesty, and accordingly I got a friend whom he did not know, to go to my shop in Piccadilly, on the 7th of March, and purchase two locks, with two three-shilling pieces, which were marked, desiring him to get a bill and receipt. My friend gave me the bill and receipt into my hands. I immediately went into the shop, to see if the amount of the bill was entered in the cash book, and I found only two shillings entered for the six. I then desired him suspecting that there was something wrong, to shew me the money in the till, and there was only one of the three-shilling pieces that were marked, in the till. Being certain that he had taken the other three-shilling piece, I asked him to lend me five shillings; upon which he lent me the other three shilling piece, taken from his pocket.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CARRON. I produce the certificate of the conviction of Thomas Paxton, at the last sessions for this County.</p>

               <p>THOMAS CASTLE MEADOWS. I am a silk dyer, When this silk is sent to be dyed, it undergoes what we call the first process, which is its being steeped in ho soap-suds, so as to take the greater part of the yellow gum with which it is charged out. Then it undergoes a second process, in which it is boiled in frest soap-suds, and is thereby completely cleared of the gum; it is perfectly easy to distinguish between silk which has undergone the first process only, and that which has been completely cleared of the gum; it is not by any means a practice in the trade to sell silk after its having undergone that first process; it is impossible to be dyed in that second state. I should think that silk in that second state could not be in the hands of any one but a dyer. The processes are performed by dyers alone, and not by dealers in silk; it is impossible for a honest dyer to sell it 
               <persName id="t18160403-73-person634">al</persName>
             all. the silk is delivered to us by the manufacturers. In the course of the night of the 27th of January, our premises were robbed of silks, Orgazine,Italian, and China, to the amount of eighty pounds weight; the value of what we lost would be about two hundred pounds. Part of the Orgazine and Italian silk had only undergone the first process; some part of that silk Paxman was convicted of stealing. On Monday, the 29th, I saw a small parcel which Paxman had dropped. Paxman was taken up on Tuesday, the 30th. Mr. Deboos waited on me on the 21st of February, and shewed me one pound two ounces weight of Ogazine silk, which had undergone the first process only. I went to his house the next morning, and there he shewed me a small quantity of Italian silk, which had also undergone only the first process. In consequence of further information which I received from Mr. Deboos, I obtained a search warrant against the prisoner, and Armstrong and Gleed went with me to execute it. On searching his house, we found on the counter in the warehouse another parcel of silk, which had only undergone the first process; it was a much larger parcel than either of those Mr. Deboos had shewn me. There was a prodigious quantity of other silks there; but this third parcel was the first I took particular notice of. All the other silks were either entirely in the gum, or completely boiled. Upon this, the prisoner was taken before the magistrate. The tying of the silks in banks, enables a person to know them again, there is a thread round each knot.</p>

               <p>JOHN STEPHEN MARIGNAN. I am a servant to Mr. Deboos, who was a silk dyer, in Spitalfields. I received the two parcels of silk which Mr. Deboos shewed to Mr. Meadows, from the prisoner to be dyed in February last; one of the parcels the prisoner delivered with his own hands; in fact, I had them both from him personally; it was to be dyed drab. I informed Mr. Deboos of it. I did not see it again until I saw it at the police office.</p>

            . I have been a silk dyer in Spitalfields for some years. I remember the silk in question coming into our dye house, brought by the prisoner; one parcel came on the 19th of February; the other on the 22nd. The bills would denote that the silks had never been boiled, and that they were to be of the same colour. The second bill denoted that the second parcel was to be boiled; and there was a third parcel of four pounds, which came by itself, and which has been sent home. The two parcels which I shewed to Mr. Meadows have undergone the first process, and had so before they came to me; that is, the gum was taken off, but they were not boiled; that would at once be obvious to a person who knew his business well; they could not be dyed in the state they were sent to me; silk is never sold by silk dealers in the state in which this is, I have observed the manner in which these banks are tied, and they are not tied in the manner in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030046"/>a dyer would tie them; a dyer would never have sent them home in the way they are now. Knowing Mr. Meadows's loss, it struck me that this was the same sort of silk that he had lost; I had no other reason than that for shewing it to him.</p>

            . Time was given to the prisoner to produce witnesses, but none were produced, except one Daniel Perry, on the second examination.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence of considerable length, arguing upon the improbability of a man of his respectability and long standing in the trade, which subsequently appeared to be the fact, selling his reputation, his honour, and his liberty for such a paulty and inconsiderable profit, as such a fraudulent dealing would afford. He declared most solemnly his inocence, and stated that when he had small orders to complete in haste, he and his wife were some times under the necessity of washing silk themselves, because it was not worth the while of a dyer to light his copper fires, unless he could till Irts coppers.</p>

               <p>Several witnesses of respectability proved their selling silks of various kinds to the prisoner, and also gave him a most unblemished character.</p>

I went to the empty house in Titchfield-street about half past five in the evening of the 24th of February, I secured the house, and it was all safe; this was on Saturday. On my going to the house on the Sunday evening following, and putting the key to the key hole, two pieces of whalebone flew out of the key hole; I found, on unlocking the door. that it was only on the spring, and not double locked as I had left it; I found the latch held up by a piece of white paper doubled up under it; I went and told my master; and on further examination, we found some papers removed in the hall; the cellar door broken open, and a great deal of wine gone.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MICHAEL CONNELL. I am a watchman, On the night of Saturday, the 24th of February, going my rounds in Castle-street, I fell in with my partner, and we met the prisoner in Castle-street, near Oxford-road, not a quarter of a mile from Titchfield-street, and coming in a direction from Mr. Bulkeley's when we met him, he crossed the road, and we followed him; we found seven bottles of wine on him, four in a pair of canvass braces and bags, and the other three in his smock frock, which was turned up at the bottom, and tied round him. We asked him what he had there several times, and he would not answer; and I put my hand into his breast, and pulled out a bottle of wine. We took him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL CROUCH. I was coming up South Moulton-street, towards Oxford-street, about half past Seven in the evening of the 5th of March, and I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running down South Moulton-street, and I stopped him, and took him to Mary-bone watchhouse. The tea-caddy was found in the middle of the street.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. About half past seven in the evening of the 5th of March, the prisoner knocked at the shop door, and on opening it, I asked him what he wanted, and he said, he wanted the tea-caddy, and I told him if he would be pleased to go round the corner to my uncle, and I would go with him to know the price. The prisoner took up the tea-caddy, and ran off, and I cried out murder! stop thief.</p>

I met the prisoner Whiteman; she rushed up against me, and thrust her hand into my left hand breeches pocket. and took out a purse, containing a five pound bank of England note. I had not been walking with her at all. I told her she had robbed me, and immediately the other prisoner came up behind me and knocked me down. Getting up again he knocked me down, and did so two or three times. I had a bundle with me when she first came up to me in a silk handkerchief; it contained the articles in the indictment. When he knocked me down, the bundle fell and she threw it away. I then called the watchman, who took them both, and sent for another watchman, and then took them to the watch-house. I saw my bundle again in about five minutes after that. I never saw my note again.</p>

            . I was at the Bunch of Grapes, at Brompton. The two prisoners had been drinking there that night, in company with each other; they went away at about half past eleven, together. After they went out, I heard a noise opposite our house; I looked out of the window, and saw the gentleman who was robbed, and the two prisoners. I heard the female prisoner talking to another woman whom she wanted to hide the bundle, and by what she said, I conceived she had the bundle in her possession; and she said, she had got the note. She wanted the other girl to run away with the bundle.</p>

A man ran by the side of me, and pulled the watch out of my pocket; he laid hold of my seals, keys and ribbon, and snatched the watch out of my fob with force. Such was the force that the case dropped off to the ground; I followed the man, and saw the watch hanging from his hand as he ran. My cousin stopped to pick up the case. I went up as far as the next or second court in Gray's-inn-lane, where the man had run down, and sung, out stop thief all the time.

            . I was returning home on the night of the 13th of March, between twelve and one, and when I got very near Tash-street, in Grays-inn-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief; there was a young man of the name of John Norman with me. There was a Jew and two women on before us; we all of us immediately turned back; I saw a person run down a place called Charlotte Buildings; I and John Norman stood at the bottom of Bell-court, in Gray's-inn-lane; that was about fifty yards from Charlotte Building. I then saw the same person come running down Bell-court; I then went up to him, and laid hold of his coller; Norman came up at the other side of him; the person whom we seized said, for God's sake young men recollect the consequences to be great against me. The prisoner is not the person we stopped. The person said, you shall have share; I said no, no, come along, and we pulled him out of the court. Coming down towards Holborn again, we called watch, watch; there was no watchman answered. When we came opposite Charlotte Buildings with him, he called out Jack, Jack, and immediately the prisoner came directly, and I perceived the man we had hold of, had the watch on his left side; he gave it to the prisoner, and I said, that man has got the watch, meaning the prisoner. The prisoner said, I got the watch, I will break your bloody neck; with that, he up with his fist, and hit me on the left side of my face; I tumbled against the shutter, and fell down on the rails; then they both got away from us.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS FEGAN. I accompained Symons and Sidney the next day, the 14th of March, to the Falcon in Portpool-lane, where I desired Symons to stand at the door while Sydney and I went in Sydney said that one of the persons who were playing at cards, was the person who robbed my friend. We then came out again immediately, and I desired Sydney to go for a police officer. I and the prosecutor staid outside the door. We had not been there long before the prisoner came out of the house, and crossed the street, down a place called Sparrow-rents; imagining that he was the person that Sydney had pointed out to me, I followed him, and secured him, with the assistance of the prosecutor, and we conducted him as far as Hatton Garden, where we met Mr. Hutt, and delivered the prisoner to him.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Portpool-lane. The prisoner lodged at my house on the 13th of March; he lodged with his mother at my house; his mother has the front room on the first floor. I saw him at home on the night of the 13th; he and his mother came in at eleven o'clock; I bolted and locked my doors after they came in; I slept in a room adjoining my shop; it is a green-grocer's shop; there is only a very thin partition between the passage and my room. When I had locked the door, I left the key in it. I then knew that the prisoner was up stairs; it was a considerable time after twelve before I went to bed. From the time I locked the door, to the time I went to bed, nobody went out, I am positive. It was impossible for any body to go up or down stairs without my hearing them. In the morning, I found the key just as I had left it.</p>

I remember the night before he was taken up; he came home that night with his mother; he went to bed a little before twelve; I saw him in bed; we have only one room; it was impossible for my brother to go out after that, without my hearing him, for I sleep with my mother, who is subject to much illness, and is very wakeful. The prisoner was in bed when I get up at half past six in the morning; I went out then, and locked him in.</p>

On the 17th of February last, I sent the dial and the frame of a watch to the prisoner's to have a gold case made to it. I received it back on the 23rd of February; this is the case and the dial; I have no doubt it is Jackson's work; I have frequently seen his work before, and this has his mark. When I received it back, I sent it to the motion maker, Mr. Warren, Susannah-row, Curtain-road. I received it back in about three days; I found it was not deep enough for the works, and I sent it to Mr. Hayford, the springer, ordering him to get it raised at Jackson's, it was to have been raised before Hayford could have put the springs in. I should think Hayford kept it three or four days; I then put the works in it. A gentleman came after that from Goldsmith's Hall, and wished to look at it, and ordered me to come to Goldsmith's Hall the next day at eleven o'clock; I did so, and left it with Mr. Ayres and Mr. Lane. When I received it home from Jackson's at first, I received a bill of parcels with it for the watch.</p>

Mr. Nadauld brought that watch-case to me to be secret springed and polished, and to get the bow exchanged, and the bottom raised at Jackson; I can't say whether he ordered me to get that done; but when I looked at the plate, I found it wanted it. I sent it to Hemmet to get the bow exchanged; I am not certain whether I sent it to Jackson's or Hemmet's first. When I had it back, I did what was necessary for it then, and then sent it to Mr. Greenwell's; Mr. Greenwell said it was not one of his joints, and the man then took it to Jackson's to have it raised. Greenwell did not work upon it at all; it was brought back to me by the man I sent it out with; his name is Bacon. I then sent it to Ellsworth's to be printed up, and on receiving it back from him, I finished my work; I had only the case as far as I was concerned; I sent it home as it was sent to me; but not as it is now, because it is much altered; I know Jackson's work by the marks. I have remarked one thing; his work used to be shut wires, but this is flat edges. When I looked at the marks, one of the customary ones was not in it, because it was a customary thing to put the first letter of his name in it; but this had not; that made me look at it, and that made me think he had got a new workman. That mark is mostly put into the middle of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030050"/>bottom; and in the trade every man can tell his own mark, if they put their mark and letter; but it might be possible for another person to do it.</p>

            . I am a watch-case maker. In the month of January last, I engaged in the service of Messrs. Jackson; the prisoner superintended the manufactory, and his brother attended to the books. About the 21st or 22nd of February, I received directions from the prisoner about a watch-case; he put into my hand a dial and a frame. That is the same. He gave me directions to make a case for it, and he told me the case was for Mr. Nadauld; I was then in the counting-house, and he told me when he came into the shop, he would give me a Hall marked bottom; accordingly I took the frame into the shop, and he called me again, and gave me the gold for the wires, and mentioned that it was No. 1 gold; the edges are what are termed wires; these wires all together would be the greater part of the watch-case, and consequently would be heavier than the bottom. He said, he was going to give me a Hall marked bottom, and I might use No. 1 gold for the wires, as they were not going to the Hall. I always considered No. 1 gold, by the working, to be rather inferior, from the stubbornness of the metal; the more alloy, the more stubborn the metal. While I was working these edges, they appeared to me to be No. 1 gold, 16 carat gold; while I was working the edges, Mr. Jackson came into the shop to me, and brought me a Hall marked bottom, with all the wires to it, except the wires which shut down; a watch-case opens in the middle, consequently there would be wires both above and below. The case he brought me had been to the Hall, and was stamped, it was one of three which I myself had made shortly before; he told me to cut out the bottom, and put it into the wires which I was then making of No. 1 gold. When I had formed the wire for it, he came to me, and told me that it was a pity to use that case, as it was a large thick bottom-was too thick, and would do for a heavier case, if he should have occassion to make one; he brought me another Hall marked case of lighter and thinner gold; he brought that with the wires also to it; that was another of the three which I had made a short time previous. I cut the bottom out of it, and placed it in the wires which I had formed out of No. 1 gold he had given me. While I was at work upon it, Mr. Jackson came in again, after I had cut the bottom out of its own wires, and put it into the other; it was lying on the work-board, and he took it up, and looked at it. I gave the wires of the Hall marked bottom to Mr.

            , the prisoner; I saw him weighing it, and he stated, it was lighter than the order stated, and than the orders he had given me. In about a week afterwards, or rather better, I saw it again, a young man brought it from the springer's, and said the case was too low for the frame, and consequently wanted raising, and I raised it while he was waiting for it; the one he produced to be raised, was the one of which I have been speaking. I disclosed this transaction about a fortnight after it had been done, hardly as long as that after it came from the springer to be raised; I first directed a letter to the Goldsmith's hall, and after that went and saw Mr. Lane.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. POOLEY. I served my time with a Mr. Mansell, of Goswell-street; I had been about a twelve month out of my time, when Mr. Jackson proposed this to me, I did not consider it right, but I did not know it was a felony. I never proposed the same thing to any master I ever lived with. I never said to any master that I was surprized he did not do such a thing, because a great many persons in the trade had done so, and made money by it; that I am sure of, and that I can swear. I never told any master that a former master with whom I had lived had used a stamp, and that I could make one like it; that I am sure of, and am positive of. I had never any quarrel or misunderstanding at all with the prisoner. He used to give me quantities of gold to work up into wires, and watch-cases. Upon those accasions he delivered tickets of the quantity of metal to be worked up; he never had occasion but once to suppose that I had not returned the proper quantity of metal, and the reason of that was, that he could not find some gold which his brother had taken down in a bowl, and after a search, we found that this bowl had been thrown under the table in the countinghouse, with some empty ones; I mean to state that that is the only occasion that he had ever found fault with me on that head; his brother stated that he had placed the bowl under the table in the counting-house among some empty ones, thinking that they were all empty. I had lived with him about five or six weeks when he put the dial I have in my hands to make a case to it; he had about a dozen servants besides myself; about nine worked in the shop in which I worked; there was not any particular time for us to come to work, that depended on the urgency of the business we were doing; some times all the men were working in the shop, and at times there as been only one. There were seven or eight besides myself in the shop, which is capable of holding fourteen men; at the time the prisoner gave me this dial, the nearest man to me was about as far as from me to you, and the shop in length is about as far as from that pillar to this, (alluding to the brass pillars at the respective Sheriff's box in court.) It was from twelve to one in the day when the prisoner brought it to me; other persons in the shop saw it; a young man of the name of Atkins took it up in his hand, and observed the dial when the prisoner gave me the instructions, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030051"/>he gave me in the shop. he spoke in his ordinary tone of voice. I don't know whether it must have been heard by other persons in the shop, because ours is very noisy business, in which there is a great deal of hammering; and unless a person a tends particularly to what is said to him, he will not hear it. I cannot say that the hammering was so loud at the time the prisoner was speaking to me as to preclude the possibility of any one else hearing it. I sat as far from the man next to me, as I am from you sir. I never counted the benches; we sit opposite the light, all of a row.</p>



               <p>Q. Then if there were eight or nine persons besides you in the shop, and the shop is no longer than from one of those brass pillars to the other, how is it possible that they can all sit as far asunder as from me to you - A. I did not say they all sit as far as from me to you; but if they men whose places would be in that distance in the shop as long as from me to you, were not in their places, nobody else would take them, and therefore that space would be empty; each man sits at his regular place. I said, I should know this case from a thousand. I mean to say that because there is a particular mark, which I accidently made with the cutting tool when I was working this case. In about fourteen days I gave information of this; I left the prisoner's service about a week after I gave information. I never understood I was to have any reward for my information; it was never proposed nor told me that for the information I gave, I should be paid; I was never told that if this prisoner was convicted, I should be rewarded; I always gave the same account of this transaction. I said, I received the case and the wires seperately; I did not say on a former occasion, that I had received them both together; I stated that Mr. Jackson followed me up, and gave me the bottom. I might have said directly, but I cannot say it was exactly at the same time; I have worked for Mr.

The parts the company would put their marks on are the bottom, the cover, and the exterior cover, if it have one. This case has no stamp in the cover; the Hall mark in the upper part may be sometimes worked out. I have assayed this case in its present state; an officer named William City scraped it for me; the assay of the wires in their present state is two carats and one grain worse than the standard of eighteen. The bottom produces half a grain better than the standard of eighteen. On account of the inferiority of these wires, they could not have passed the Hall; the Hall mark would not be fixed to any thing less than the standard of eighteen.</p>

            . I am drawer of the plate to the Goldsmith's Company; I draw all the watch-cases that come to be assayed. I have lately scraped this watchcase for the purpose of Barrow making his assay; in the whole we scrape five parts of a watch-case which is to be assayed; four from the wires and one from the bottom. After it is assayed, the Hall mark is put on it.</p>

            , ESQ. I am Prime Warder of the Goldsmith's Company. I in company with Mr. Lane, received that watch-case from the hands of Mr. Nadauld.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. On the part of the prisoner, objected, that the prosecutors had mistaken their road with respect to the first three Counts of the Indictment, because the prisoner was charged with "transposing and removing," and not with "cauing to be transposed and removed," which allegation was not borne out by the evidence.</p>

               <p>COURT. But I am of opinion that what a man orders his workman to do, he does himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If the case was in the state that it now is when it left our house, it has been done for the purpose of bringing the present prosecution. With regard to that part of the evidence which fixes the certainty of its not having passed the Hall, it is the presumption of my mind, that it was done by the witness Dalton, for the purpose of bringing the present charge; we had a quarrel some time previous, and that was the occasion of this; I know nothing of this case whatever.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called the following witnesses.</p>

            . I am a watch-case maker, in Sinnot-street, Clerkenwell. The witness Dalton offered to come into my service some months ago; he refered me to Mr. Mansell for his character; I did not go to Mr. Mansell for his character; I was induced to take him without that. After he came into my service, he frequently addressed his conversation to me, with respect to the marks on watch-cases; the conversations on that subject always originated with him; he said Mr. Mansell had realized a great deal of money by using a forged or false mark; that was the Mr. Mansell to whom he had refered me for his character. He recommended me to do the same; and said, he could make a mark. I in part laughed at it, and in part treated it with contempt, and denied the possibility of his making a mark. With respect to wires, he advised me to send a rough case to the Hall to be marked, and then to return the Hall mark, and put inferior wires to it. He made this proposition more than once, seven or eight times, a continual conversation upon the subject whenever he had an opportunity of bringing it up; he seemed anxious to induce me to do it. During the time he was with me, I thought I had an opportunity of forming an opinion of his varacity, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030052"/>he is not a person whom I would by any means believe on his oath.</p>

             served his apprenticeship to me; he was with me about twelve months before this happened. From all I have known of him, I certanly would not credit him on his oath.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Because he was so notorious a liar at the time he was a boy, that I could never put any confidence in what he said; a systematic liar; he was with me fifteen months as an errand boy, before I took him as an apprentice; he staid with me three months or rather more, after his apprenticeship had expired. He continued for that time working with me as a journeyman.</p>

               <p>Q. From his commencement as a boy you could not depend on a word he said - A. I did not discover it until he had been with me two or three years. I was continually detecting him in little tritling lies. In hopes of reproving him, and out of respect to his father, I kept him. I did not turn him off as soon as his time was up; I took him as a journeyman. As a journeyman, it is not material, so long as he does his work well, if he be a liar.</p>

               <p>COURT. It is quite immaterial to you then whether your journyman is a liar or not - A. Yes; my lord.</p>

I suppose I missed from one to two hundred weight. I know the two prisoners by their being writers in the office. They are father and son-in-law. In consequence of some information, I went to Mrs. Bridges, Drum-maker, at Hoxton, on the last day of February. I found there a great quantity of the parchment which I had lost, made up into drums and tambarines. I should suppose altogether I found about a hundred weight of it there. It all consisted of bills, answers, and replications. I am certain they had been taken from the office of the Six Clerks. I have examined it; part relates to personal property. After I had been to Bridges, I went to Kilminster's lodging; there I found one skin only; it is an answer in an entire state. It had also been taken from the office at some time or other.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mrs. Bridges, the drum-maker. The parchment which was found on our premises by the officers, and which Mr. Roberts claimed, I bought from the prisoners, Hurd and Kilminster, at various times. They stated, that they weve perquisites; they said, that they were clerks in the office of the Court of Chancery. They came to me in August or September first; they generally brought five or six pounds at a time. I bought the small at thirteen-pence a pound at first, and nine-pence afterwards. The large I gave two shillings a pound for. I believe Kilminster came only twice; I believe he never offered any parchment to sell, but he was with the other.</p>

               <p>JOHN PETER RASCH. I am an under-writer at Lloyd's. In the month of December last, I owed some little balance to Messrs. Driver. The prisoner called on the 7th or 8th; the prisoner called, asking for money for Messrs. Driver; the sum due was twenty-three pounds, nineteen shilling; but I stated to him that a deduction ought to have been made, and that if he would represent it to Messrs. Driver's and Co. I had no doubt but that they would take something off. On the 9th, he came again, and said that the gentlemen would take off five guineas, though it was not customary. He then deducted the five guineas, and I immediately paid him the balance, by a check on Smith, Payne, and Smith, which check was sent to me in my banker's book. The prisoner wrote a receipt in my presence, which I have.</p>

            . I am a land surveyer, in partnership with Abraham Porshouse Driver, and William Driver. The prisoner was our clerk, and employed to receive monies and valuable securities on our account. We never authorized him to make any deduction in the account of Mr. Rasch, or even knew that he applied to him for payment. He never rendered any account whatever of this money to us. I have examined the book, in which such money ought to have been entered, and no entry is made of it whatever.</p>

               <p>ISAAC FIELD. I am in the service of Mr. Pontifex, a copper manufacturer, No. 22, Lisle-street, Leicesterfields. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 27th of February, the prisoner came into our shop, in company with a man, who had a copper to sell. On examining it, I discovered it was one we had sold to Mr. Fyfield. I called Mr. Pontifex down, and he said it was his copper. As soon as the man who had it, found this, he said to the prisoner, you are the master of the copper, and then ran off; the prisoner stood still.</p>

               <p>Humphry Fyfield. That is my copper, I had bought it of Mr. Pontifex.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and I met a young man with a copper, and he asked me if I could tell him where to sell it, and I went with him to Mr. Pontifex's, and they found out it had been stolen, and then the young man ran away. I never stirred, because I knew myself innocent.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop about six o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of March last, to match some French cambrick; in consequence of its being rather dark, she said she would call to-morrow, and she left the pattern with me; she came about the same time on the Saturday, and I had then matched the cambrick for her; she then said she had lost the piece of thing which was to guide her in the length she was to purchase; she then wished to look at some prints; none of them would suit her, as she said, she wanted a pattern the same as one which a friend of her's had, who lived at the Marqurs of Hertford's, where she lived also, and she said, she would send on the Monday for the gown and the cambrick. She then went away, and from the manner in which she quitted the shop, I had an idea that she had got something which was not her own; I thought she had something under her shawl; a young man at the door followed her, and I followed her also; in going back I took from under her shawl a piece of cotton, which was Mr. Rickarby's property; it had been laying on the counter against a desk, near where she stood.</p>

He insisted that I did, and immediately commenced an attack upon me. I told him I should be obliged to call the watch; I saw the watchman at the other side of the way, and called him over; there were some more men coming along, and they came up. The prisoner had his fist in my face, and immediately gave me a shove with his elbow against the wall, and at the same moment I felt my handkerchief go from my right hand great coat pocket.

I live with my mother, Hannah Griffiths, who is a widow a second time; she has two dwelling-houses, one is a public-house, which she inhabits herself; and she lets out the whole of the other in tenements, except the shop, which she occupies as a cook's shop; that shop I shut up at eight o'clock on the night of the 12th of March. I went there again between eleven and twelve, to see if all was safe and right. I was not in the habit of doing so; but I received information that that shop was to be robbed that night. When I went to the shop, I found it had been broken open; I found the cellar flap had the iron forced from it, and the shop door which leads into the passage was unbolted. I found the prisoner at the bar in the shop; I secured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030055"/>him, and called the watchman. I found the till forced open, and I found ten shillings and five-pence in copper gone; that was the money of my mother; it was taken out of the till, and the prisoner had got it in the side pockets of his jacket I believe.</p>

Then he went and sit down on a chair; then he got up, and went and looked in the cupboard; then he went and looked on the mantle-piece. This shirt was lying on the table, under the looking-glass, facing the window. He told my little brother not to stare at him, but look out of the window, and see if my mother was coming. Then he said, he would go and have a pint of beer, and come back again. I did not see him take the shirt; but I am sure it was there when he came in; and we missed it after he was gone.</p>

On Thursday morning last, the prisoner fetched a basket of pigeons from the cellar, and put them outside the dwelling-house door; he then returned, and brought another basket up, and carried it across the market; they are covered baskets, so that I could not see what was in them. I saw him put the basket down near Mr. Cope's, the fruiterer; he then returned, and took the pigeons straight over to the shop; then he went to look for the basket he had deposited by Mr. Cope's, and it was gone; he seemed very much confused, and inquired about where the basket was. When he went with the pigeons, I sent one of our porters to bring the basket away to see what was in it, and found it contained two cheests. I immediately sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody; one of cheeses was Gloucester, and the other Cheshire.</p>

               <p>JOHANNAH WHITE. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came to me at our lodging, between twelve and one o'clock, on the day in the indictment, and said he had met Mr. White in the Stand walking with another gentleman, and therefore he did not like to speak to him. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030057"/>sat down. The watch was hanging over the mantlepiece. The prisoner wrote a note for Mr. White, and laid it on the table, and said he would call on the next day but one. He went out, and I immediately missed the watch. I saw no more of the prisoner until he was apprehended. I knew him coming home from the East Indies.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. On the part of the prisoner, objected. that Lord Roseberry was improperly defined as an Esquire, and commonly called a Lord, because in reality he was a Peer of the Realm, and therefore non constat that he an Esquire; and thefore the prisoner could not be convicted on such an indictment.</p>

               <p>THE COURT. Considered that it was a point which had not as yet been determinated and therefore would reserve it for the consideration of the Twelve Judges, in the event that the Jury should think the evidence sufficiently strong to pronounce the prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARWOOD. I clean shoes, and run of messages, from No. 6, Cock-pit-alley, Drury-lane. While I was cleaning shoes on the 15th of July, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I knew any person who went of messages, I told him I did; and he told me to go to Iurnival's-inn with a note, and inquire for one Mrs. Hawkins, at No. 15, 1.c told me she lived up three pair of stairs. I went up two pair of stairs, and there saw Mr. Williams, and afterwards he took me to Hatton Garden before the justice; then we went back to Mr. Williams's chambers, and they gave me a great coat and an umbrella, and Mr. Read and Mr. Williams went with me to a liquor shop in Drury-lane, where the prisoner told me he would wait until I came back; but he was not there.</p>

               <p>THE COURT. In charging the Jury, told them that the order in question appeared to be addressed to a Mrs. Hankins; when in fact it had not appeared that such a person was in existence.</p>

               <p>The Jury therefore found the prisoner</p>

He put them into a bag, and twisted the bag up, and put it into the ash-hole. The prisoner then came up the area steps. I called to a person in the street to rap at the door; for I thought the prisoner was robbing the house. When the prisoner came to the top of the steps, I seized him, and put him into the hands of Mr. Crawford's butler.</p>

I sat up in an out-house on the night of the 10th, to protect my pigs. Unsuccessful attempts had been made to steal one the night before, and therefore I sat up, well armed with a loaded blunderbnss, a brace of pistols, and two or three swords. We went out at about twelve o'clock, and I ordered the doors to be bolted after we went out; and we went into a shed opposte the pig-stye. About a quarter before three o'clock I heard something, and on looking through a hole in the boards, I saw the prisoner in the yard by the pig-stye; and I suppose he was going to kill the pig. I then levelled my blunderbuss through the hole; I cocked the blunderbuss, and being in the dead of the night, it made a tick, which he heard and looked towards the shed. The moon shone full on his face, and I could distinguish his features plainly. He then stooped again, and as he rose I fired. I immediately ran out, but he had gone over a wall six foot high. Since that we have killed the pig, and he must have had it in his arms when I fired, as the pig was full of shot. If it had been on the ground, the shots could not have hit it for the stye. We found a bat shot through with shot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I cannot swear that this salt belongs to my employers, though I believe it does; there were other barges on the Canal with salt in them.</p>

I immediately took it from him, and took him into custody.</p>

            . On the 8th of this month, on coming down stairs from the drawing room into the kitchen; I found the prisoner there; he was not a stranger to the house. He used to come to buy hare and rabbit skins; he asked me if I had any to sell, and I told him that was not the place to buy them, meaning he had no business in the kitchen. On turning my head, I missed three spoons; I had just put them on a shelf over the dressar; I told him to deliver up what he had got; he ran out. and I got up and ran after him; I never lost sight of him until he was stopped; he then threw the spoons away.</p>

            . I saw the three prisoners, some desseparated and sometimes in company together, on the afternoon in question; I saw the prosecutor looking at the print shop, with his seal and key hanging by a ribbon to his watch, and I concealed myself in a shoe shop opposite. The prisoners, Daniels and Harris, got close to the prosecutor, and beckoned Short over to them. Then Damels got on the prosecutor's left, and Harris on his right. Daniels then got Short by the collar, and shoved him in between the prosecutor and another person. daniels then put his coat round the boy, and his arm under the prosecutor's chin, and on to another man's shoulder, so as effectually to keep the prosecutor from looking down at his watch ribbon. Harris was behind the prosecutor putting his great coat round him, so as to screen from observations from behind. This is what they call covering. They were there a few minutes, and then the prosecutor came away. The boy Short was so covered that I could not exactly see what he did; but I observed Daniels' hand go down towards the boy's side, and I conceived that he had hold of the seal and key, while the boy was cutting the ribbon. The prosecutor came away, and I observed that the key and seal were gone from his watch. The boy left the prosecutor at a signal being given, and followed him into Southampton-street. The two other prisoners remained looking at the prints. I desired George Wooroffe, the young man that was with me, not to take the two prisoners that were in the crowd, for they might throw the seal away; but to wait 'til we got the boy, and until they got out of the crowd. When the boy got off a little way, Daniels and Harris quitted the shop. I took hold of Harris, and immediately Daniels ran away. I did not say any thing to Harris before Daniels ran. He ran down the middle of the Strand, and I hallooed stop thief; and he was stopped a great way down the Strand by another officer named Murry;

             got the boy. When we got them altogether into a shop, I proceeded to search them, and in the bottom of the boy's trowsers, inside the lining, I cut out a pair of scissars made for the purpose for which I conceived they had been used; and also a piece of ribbon which matched with the remainder of the prosecutor's ribbon which was tied to his watch. These were in one leg, and on the other side I found a gold seal and gold key.</p>



               <p>GEORGE WOOROFFE. Corroborated the testimony of the last witness.</p>

               <p>Daniels's Defence. As I was going along the Strand, there was a crowd, and I thought there was row, and I went to look what it was; and the officer said I was one, and so I ran away.</p>

               <p>Harris's Defence. I was looking at the pictures, and never observed who was standing by me; and as for this young man and the boy, I never seen them before in my life.</p>

               <p>Short's Defence. I was sent to school by my father and mother one day, and met these two people, and after that I went home, and met them a great many times instead of going to school; and on this day, when I got to the picture shop with them, they put a pair of scissars into my hand, and told me to cut the seal off, and so I did.</p>

               <p>JAMES THOMPSON. In consequence of information, about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the day in the indictment, I saw some shirts thrown over the pales, which had been hanging on a line in my garden; I could not see who threw them, because there was such a quantity of linen between me and the place where the person who was doing it stood; I ran down the passage, and caught one of the prisoners buttoning my shirts under his jacket, and the other assisting him. I seized Bell, and Bird ran away; but he was taken soon after.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM PICKERING. I am a Bow-street officer. I saw these lads lurking about Thompson's premises, and I told him to take care. I could see the heads of some persons in the garden; but could not tell who they were. The prosecutor momentarily ran down his garden, and out of a side door which lead in the park, and seized Bell, and I took the other.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop about seven o'clock in the evening, and laid hold of a lace veil in question, and asked the price of it; he bed me thirty shillings for it. He asked me to measure it; then he hung it up again, and went away; he came in about eight, and I saw him stretch himself at his full length, then he snatched the shawl, and ran off; I immediately gave the alarm, and he was stopped, and brought back; I am positive he was the man; the shawl has never been found. When he was searched in the shop, he pulled out a particular pocket handkerchief, with which he had blown his nose when he was in the shop before, and to the pattern of which I could swear.</p>

She was running out, when she was stopped by a servant. She had taken ever so many of my lodger's things besides.</p>

            . The prisoner was in the same house with me. I had occasion to go backwards, and the prisoner followed me; and before I had buttoned my breeches up, he knocked me down; and the blow he gave me, took my breath away. He put his knee upon my breast; he then took my watch out of my pocket, and a ring from my finger, and a brooch from my breast, and the money from my pockets together with a smart ticket. I then made for the tap-room as quick as I could, and he tried to get in before me; and when I got to the tap-room door, he gave me a blow on the back of the neck, finding he could not get in before me, which knocked me down two steps into the tap-room, with my head against a settle. He then ran out, and it was a week after before he was taken up. I have seen my watch again, and that is all.</p>

I saw the prisoner go out of my father's shop at about one o'clock on the 16th of March, with something, round which he was wrapping his handkerchief; I was in the parlour behind the shop; I immediately followed him out, and called to him until he got to Queen-street, to know what he had taken out of our shop; he said, nothing. I came back to our house, and then by my mother's request, I returned again to the stable-yard, into which the prisoner had gone; he had gone up stairs into a room, where I found him, and the books in question on a chair. He then went out, and ran away, and I followed him, and took him to the watchhouse.</p>
