               <p>had married my wife's elder sister, and that he had a grown-up family out in Australia, sons and daughters; he told me so, I did not know it otherwise; I did not know it from my wife, not before he came—he said that he used to do slipper-making in Australia, and his wife kept a dairy, and that he came home, leaving her there—I do not know how he had got the money to come home; I do not know at all what his means were, whether he was in a state of poverty there, or that he had a difficulty in getting the money to come home—my wife's brother was not stopping at my house when the prisoner came home; he did not come there till 2nd August; he arrived on Bank Holiday from Canada; he came to stop in the house, and stayed there till the 16th—we used all to be together; we had our meals together—the prisoner came to England to try to get an estate for the brother, Samuel Anstace, and for his wife, for the family; he thought the wife's brother <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> was dead when he came over, and he came to lay claim to the estate for his wife—I don't know exactly the date when he first knew that the brother was not dead; it was not soon after he came back, it was some time after—he was under the impression that the estate he had come home to claim was of enormous value—as far as I know, he believed that his wife's family were entitled to it; it was the constant subject of conversation on his part; it is an estate called the Stock well Park Estate; he used to say the value of it was close on 175,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a veer—he was a great deal with the brother; they were always together, talking on this subject—he was not in a feeble state of health when he came home; once or twice he said he had got a bad cold; he was not attended by a doctor indoors, he went to a doctor—he was not very unwell for weeks, that I am aware of; I know he went once or twice to the doctor, he might have gone when I did not know—I only noticed his trembling once, that was when he had the first letter from his wife—I did not take much notice of him myself, I was not much in<lb/>doors with him—I did not know of the state of his health being con<lb/>sidered dangerous, or of his having been advised to leave where he was—he never said to me that the scenes he had witnessed were too much for him—I heard my wife say once that she could not stand my treat<lb/>ment—I think that was about a week before she left home—I think it was said to an old lady who used to live with us—her brother has not spoken to me about my treatment of her—I am not aware that she was attended by Dr. Chalmers for injuries that she had received—she was attended by Dr. Chalmers, he was our family doctor; I don't know what for, only when she was confined; not for injuries that she had received that I am aware of—I heard after she went away that she had sought the protection of a Magistrate, but she told me when she came back that it was nothing of the kind—I do not know that it was her own brother who took her away; he and her went away together while I was at my work—I don't know that she left by the persuasion of the neighbours—I sought to find her—she came to see me on 8th October—I did not try to find out where he was that same night; I asked her, but she would not tell me where she was living, she would not even tell me the station she had to get out at—I did not prevent her going back again, because I wanted her to bring the child back with her—she had taken the child with her, and when she came back to me she brought the child—I did not like to prevent her going away then, because I wanted the things she had taken away with her, as well as wanting the child—I had no idea</p>

I am a widow and live at 45, Stonefish Street, Not<lb/>ting Hill—on 8th August a friend of mine brought the prisoner and Mrs. Messenger, and her brother to my house; they wanted two rooms—I had but one to let—they came again on 16th August, together, about 3 o'clock in the day, and they continued to live at my house for seven or eight weeks—they had one common room, and Mrs. Messenger slept in my par<lb/>lour—she had a child with her, and the child slept with her—they took their meals together in the common room—there was a bed in that room—the prisoner and the brother <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> slept in that bed—in the day time they were all together upstairs—<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> went out sometimes—the prisoner and the deceased were sometimes left alone in the upstairs room—I can't say exactly how long <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> stayed there; it might have been four or five weeks, be then left—after he left the prisoner and the deceased continued to occupy the upstairs room during the day time, she continuing to sleep downstairs with the child as before;—the child was between three and four years of age—I used my parlour in the day time, and I used to sleep there as well as the deceased and her child—the other rooms were occu<lb/>pied—in the morning the deceased used to go upstairs to the room where the prisoner was, when she had dressed herself—the prisoner left my house a week before Mrs. Messenger; he left on the Saturday morning as she left on the Thursday evening following, 21st October—between the Saturday and the Thursday the prisoner used to come to see her every day—she told me where she had taken a room for him—I never saw her again alive after she left on the Thursday evening—when I last saw them together they appeared to be on good terms, I never saw them any other way but on good terms.</p>

               <p>nothing to do—I did not notice the state of health he was in—he did not seem to be in a desponding state; I did not see much of him; I only thought he was strange, that was all; he would creep about the house so, come downstairs without his shoes, and I thought it was funny for a man to do that, I thought it might be because he should not make a noise—there was nothing else that I noticed strange about him—Mrs. Messenger told me one day that she had found a bottle of laudanum in his pocket, and she told me she threw it under the grate—no scene took place about it—she said when she told the prisoner of it that he said "Eh, what?"—she told me that she accused him of intending to poison her—they had been there some weeks when she told me this—I may have used the expression "he was in a terrible way," because she told me that he spoke in that style "Eh, what?"—I don't know whether that bottle of laudanam was destroyed, I did not see it—I only heard of its being destroyed; there was another one found a day or two before the deceased left—it was not shown to me—Mrs. Messenger told me she had found another bottle—she did not give it me, she told me where it was, and left it there, and I got it—she asked me whether she should throw it away or whether I would accept it—during the time they were there I never heard the slightest sign of quarrelling—when they first came the one thing that seemed to occupy the prisoner's mind was the claim to the property, but not so much at the latter part, after the brother left—I understood that when he left he went to one of his sisters, I am speaking of <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>—when the prisoner left he went to live at a milk shop dose handy, I can't think of the name of the street—I knew the deceased was going to leave, I think the next day after she had seen her husband, I knew it then for the first time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—on 22nd October, at 1.30 in the day, I saw the deceased woman, Jane Messenger, at the hospital; she was dressed—I examined her; on the right side of the body, in front of the chest, she was burnt; the dress was also burnt, the body and part of the stays; I think my hand would cover the space that was burnt; there was a corresponding indentation on the steel of the stays, and a bruise on the chest corresponding to that indentation; on the left side of the body I found holes in the dress and bodice, and a circular wound between the third and fourth ribs, about an inch inside the nipple—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that a bullet had passed through the chest, injuring the left auricle of the heart and the right part of the left lung, and become buried in the sixth rib. two inches from the spine; death was caused by the bullet injuring the heart and lung—I handed the bullet to the Coroner, and the Coroner handed it to Inspector Macfadden—the deceased appeared to be about 35 years of age, as far as I could judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not studied the subject of insanity at all—I did so for the purpose of my examination, but I have not given my atten<lb/>tion to it, nothing more than simply to pass my examination—I know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230010"/>
               <p>that there is a form of that disease known as melancholia, well recognised in the profession—a man may suffer from that for some time without showing any outward sign of positive madness—a suicidal tendency is an evi<lb/>dence of melancholia—I should not think that a homicidal tendency was so much so as a suicidal—I can't say that a suicidal tendency is a common result with a person suffering from that sort of insanity—disappointment may to a great extent produce melancholia, and different internal diseases will cause it.</p>

I reside at 16, Connaught Square, and am senior surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital—on 22nd October, about 2 in the day, I examined the prisoner at the hospital—he was gasping for breath—I found a small triangular penetrating wound, two inches in a vertical line below the left nipple; blood was still trickling from it; there was a corresponding aperture in his jersey—the ball had traversed the chest, and has lodged there very deep—there was no second aperture; the ball was never extracted; it is lodged in his chest now—he remained under my care until he was removed, about three weeks after his admis<lb/>sion—I believe he was removed on the morning of the day that he went to the police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Haviland Villas, Acton—about 20 minutes to seven on Friday, 22nd October, went to Mr. Shepherd's house—I went into the kitchen and found the little girl Ada lying on the hearth rug on her back—I examined her, she was dead—I found a wound on the left side of the throat, apparently a stab, it appeared to go through to the right side, and penetrate slightly—that wound produced death—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a stab of this knife; it cut the arteries—the loss of blood from that wound, in my judgment, caused almost instantaneous death—there were two small cuts on the left side of the chin, probably unimportant, they were such as might have been done with a knife—the face was swollen all over, the forehead was contused, the face was slightly livid, more especially at the forehead, and the forehead was bruised—in my opinion severe pressure over the forehead and eyes would account for the swollen appearance—I examined her person and discovered that she had been recently violated—the back of her thighs were slightly bruised, and her back—in my judgment she had been dead between three and four hours; the extremities were all cold, and the body partially so—it is extremely difficult to tell within half an hour or an hour, but I should say she had been dead about three hours and a half—there was a great deal of blood on the floor on the left-hand side of the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Delahay Street, Westminster—I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster Hospital—on 29th October the last witness brought me some clothes sealed up in a parcel, and on 1st November a knife—I have made a careful examination of the clothes and applied the usual and microscopical tests to ascertain whether they were marks of blood—on the shirt I found two spots of blood on one side and one on the other, in the position spoken of by the inspector—on the collar of the waistcoat I found a small clot of blood, which I examined—on the trousers I found red marks on the lower part of the legs, and two or three spots about the upper part of the legs—I examined all those spots and found that none of them were caused by blood—they were very large red stains; I think they were paint, a crystalline substance—those on the shirt were undoubtedly blood, and the clot on the waistcoat—I examined a smear which the inspector pointed out to me at the back of the coat, it was a very faint smear; that was not blood as far as I could make out; I think it was a stain caused by perspiration—there was no blood on the coat; I may say that I did not notice the stain spoken of on the elbow, so I did not examine that—the marks on the shirt and waistcoat were such as might have been caused by the spurting of an artery—all I can say is that they had all the characteristics of human blood, but that is common to animals, to mammals—those were all the marks of blood I found—they were recent marks; it is impossible to say to a week or two how recent; they were undoubtedly not old stains, it was recent blood, quite consistent with having been there a week—I examined the knife; on each side of the blade there were stains of blood about 2 inches from the point, and also a smear near the handle, but no blood on the handle; that was recent blood—it might have been caused by the knife having been plunged into the throat, or it might have been placed on; it was quite consistent with its having been plunged into the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The size of the mark on the collar of the shirt was about the size of a three penny bit, the two splashes on one side were not quite so large; the one on the other side was larger, about the size of a sixpence—it is quite possible they may have been caused by the prisoner's nose having bled—I cannot even say that it was human blood, all I can say is that it was the blood of a mammal.</p>

Pavey—Inspector Savage showed him the handkerchief, and he said "It is my handkerchief, I placed it there."</p>

               <p>took the prisoner in a cab from the Paddington Police-station to Ham<lb/>mersmith Police-court; when we got to High Street, Notting Hill, I e said "This is the way I went on Friday afternoon when I left the house; I walked through into the Uxbridge Road, through Shepherd's Bush, Bayswater Road, and the Seven Dials, where I reached about 6 o'clock; I lodged that night at the Princes's lodging-house; the next day I walked about and read an account of the murder in the newspaper, and saw the description given did not answer to me; I lodged that night at Redding's lodging-house in Westminster; the next day, Sunday, I walked to Hendon"—he then began making a further statement which I thought most material concerning the murder—I said "What you say will be used in evidence against you; I cannot remember the exact words you use unless I write it down"—he said "I wish you to write it down, and tell the Magistrate what I say"—I then wrote this from his dicta<lb/>tion: "About 2 o'clock the girl had gone with her sisters to school, when a man came to the side door and asked if my name was Pavey, and said 'The governor wants to see you at the Uxbridge Railway Station at once;' I told him the governor said he had gone to Norwood; he said 'He is not, he is waiting at the station to see you;' I went directly to the station and hurried back, and then I saw what had taken place, the girl lying on the floor dead; I covered the handkerchief over her face; before I put the handkerchief over her face I saw blood flowing; I came out of the house; I did not know which way <hi rend="italic">to go</hi>; I could see that it looked so black against me that I was afraid to stop, knowing at the same time that I had been convicted of a similar offence before; I was frightened to say anything about it, as they would think I had done it, and I then went away; I was away from the house three-quarters of an hour going to the station and returning; I went away about half-past 2 and returned about 3 p.m.; that is all I have to say"—I asked him if he wished to sign the statement—he said "Yes"—I read it over to him and he signed it—he completed in Hammersmith Police-station the statement which he commenced in the cab.</p>

Lamond Hemming—it is not my signature—to the best of my belief it is the prisoner's handwriting—I never gave him authority to accept it—the first time I saw it was at the latter end of January, 1880—in October, 1879, I received a letter from the solicitors to Messrs. Barkers' the bankers, in consequence of which I came up to town, and was on my way to Barkers' when I met the prisoner—I told him I was going to Messrs.

Wordsworth, demanding payment of this bill in October—I have not got the letter, I gave it to the prisoner—I did not answer that, I was going to see Messrs. Barker when I met the prisoner—I will swear that I never told him that when he wanted money he might accept for me, if so, why attempt to imitate my signature—in December I accused him of embezzlement—I wrote him this letter of 20th December, 1879—I was not annoyed at his com<lb/>mencing a business on his own account—he did not come to my place and give me a thrashing; he assaulted me—I instructed my solicitor in January to take criminal proceedings, and a warrant was taken out at once, but he was not taken till July, he could not be found—I did not know that he was in the City all that time—I was in communication with his wife; I borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her—I have not paid it back—I never gave instructions to my solicitor to sell some reversionary interest of my wife's—there was 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in trust in Chancery, out of which my wife was to receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, and have been so for many years—I have seen a number of Mr. Hemming's signatures—I have never seen him write—four months ago I saw a bundle of cheques said to bear his signature—I can't say that these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the same.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant T</hi>). On the night of 7tn October I saw a crowd in the North End Road—I went there, and found the two prisoners there—they were taken to Mr. Cameron's shop—I then said to Harcourt "l am a police-officer; where did you get this cheque from?"—he said "A man I met in the Hand and Flower public-house gave it to me, and said if I went to Mr. Cameron's, the baker's, in Hammersmith Road, he would change it for me"—I said to Cave "Do you know this man?" referring to Harcourt—he said "I have seen him once or twice, but he has nothing to do with me"—I accompanied Mr. Cameron to Mr. Walker's and made some inquiry, and the prisoners were given into custody—before I went Harcourt said "Understand, I don't know Dr. Walker, I have never seen him; Mr. Cameron has got his money back, what is he going to charge me with? I will go with you"—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and a small bottle containing some fluid; also a railway ticket, and a ticket for a bag left at the Aldgate Railway Station—I went there with it and got the bag, in which I found this soft felt hat.</p>

I said, "No, it can't be, because your brother has been dead nearly two years, and this only happened at the commence<lb/>ment of this year"—Smith picked him out at Bow Street from several other men—he gave his name George Andrews and said that he had no fixed home—the charge was read over to him, and he said, "I deny it <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>; I know nothing about it."</p>

Graham and Keeling's, Lower Thames Street—they are brokers, I believe—I saw these two pieces of net not numbered, but they were the two pieces de<lb/>livered to the defendant—I said to the defendant "Are you selling our nets in London?" he said "No, I do not know anything about them," and suggested the names of several good houses which might be selling them—I told him that I had seen them—he did not say where he had sent the net which I had supplied—the value of it was 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and payment was to be made a month after delivery, but it was not—I then went back to Graham and Keeling's, and while I was there the prisoner came in and saw me; he coloured up and ran down stairs again—he also gave me a verbal order about 3rd September for 100 pieces of net value 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent to Nottingham—he said that all the nets in both orders had been sent to Germany—I saw the prisoner several times, and tried to get pay<lb/>ment, but could not, and I put it into Mr. Kent's hands—I tried to find Newnham and Co., but could only see the porter and some empty cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor on board the Victor, of Tynemouth, lying by the Tower—on Sunday last, November 21, about 11.10 p.m., I passed the prisoners in St. George's Street—they wished me good-night, and Neil asked me to stand a pot of ale—I said that I had no money—they pushed me into the middle of the street, and said, "Let us have that pot of beer"—I turned down Pennington Street, and they ran after me, rushed on me, and one seized me by my throat and jammed me against some shutters—Neil put his hand in my left pocket, and Harnett' in my right—I told them if they would leave me alone I would freely give them what I had got—they said, "Let us see what he has got"—I pulled 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out, and Neil snatched it, and Harriett took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me—they knocked me down three times, and the people from a house came out—I said that if they did not leave me alone I would call for help—they both kicked me when I was down, on the side of my head and the side of my nose, and on my lip and about my loins—Bardell came to my assistance, and they knocked him down—I went to his assistance, and they knocked me down a third time—a policeman came up and caught Neil on top of me, and Harnett was caught running away—they were both taken to the station—the policeman showed me my knife And a box of matches, which were safe in my pocket when I was assaulted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an advertising agent, and reside at South View, Hampton—on 24th July last I was on the river in a pair-oared outrigger, with my wife, Mr. and Mrs. Baliard, and two children of theirs, one about nine months old, and the other three years—I hare been more or less accustomed to the Thames ever since I was 10 years old—I am now 35—I have lived in my present house about six years—my wife is one of the most accomplished oarswomen on the Thames, and has had great experience—we have been up to Oxford a dozen times, and she has always steered when I was rowing; and she am row as well as I can—on the day in question we started from my own place at 2.45 for Staines—we proceeded on our journey there in a perfectly satisfactory manner—we expected to meet Mr. Ballard's father there, and as we did not meet him we had some tea at the Angel, and started for home at 8.45—the first lock we came to was at Penton Hook, which we passed at 9.15—we arrived at Cherteey about half an hour later; not quite so late as 9.45; I have not the time but at Staines Mr. Baliard looked at his watch to make the time correct by the church clock, and also the clock at the hotel—in Chertsey Lock we asked a launch to tow us up—on leaving Chertsey we kept down the middle of the stream, to get the benefit of it, and a little over to the jurrey shore, nearly mid-stream—my wife remarked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230058"/>
               <p>that she saw a light, and said she had better steer into the Surrey shore—I turned round over my right shoulder and said, "Quite right," and she did so, slightly—I turned round and looked a few seconds afterwards, and the light was much closer to us—she still continued to steer to clear the light—at the time I first turned round, when she spoke to me, I judged the light to be about 200 yards off; I now think it was 100 yards—the second time I looked round it was much closer, about half the distance, perhaps 50 yards off, as I should estimate then—my wife was steering entirely herself—she still continued steering near the Surrey shore, when soon after something made me start up, and I saw the launch coming in to us at an angle of about 45—thinking it was a very small craft I got up with the intention of staving it off with my hands, but the launch immediately struck us on the port bow, and I was thrown violently into the water—my idea was that the launch striking like that chucked me out—in my opinion I was jerked out by the launch striking the boat—I appeared to be under the water some considerable time, as when I came to the top I could see nothing but the launch, as near at I could judge about 100 yards off, up the river, above me; of course I floated down—I called out to them, but got no answer—I then tried to swim back, but could not make any headway at all against the stream, and, feeling exhausted, I struck out for the Middlesex shore, where a policeman gave me a hand out—soon after Mr. Desvignes came back with the launch to where I was, perhaps in about five minutes, and my own boat floated down past me in the river, moderately close to the shore—when Mr. Desvignes came back he pressed me to go on to the boiler and warm myself, and after some persuasion I did so—soon after the lock-keeper from Shepperton came down—the launch remained stationary for a very considerable time—the lock-keeper said, "Ah, Mr. Desvignes, I told you what would happen"—I asked him for his explanation, but he said he was not in a position to give it me; he would not tell me—I am not sure whether that was in Mr. Desvignes's presence; I think not—I complained to Mr. Desvignes about the light being a very insignificant one, and quite unfitted for a boat of such dimensions—while he was warming us in the place he said, two or three times, "Don't make it too hot for me"—Mr. Ballard replied to him rather sharply, I don't recollect the words—after that he took us back in the launch to Shepperton Lock, and we were dressed by the look-keeper, and afterwards went home in a cab—the spot where I rose to the surface was about 200 yards from Docket's Point—I can't tell how long I was under water; it was about 100 yards from Docket's Point that the collision happened, and I was about 100 yards from Docket's Point when I came to the surface—the collision occurred at 9.57; I knew that from Mr. Ballard's watch, which stopped—I saw the watch—the launch was too far off for me to say whether she was in motion when I rose to the surface—I heard a whistle, perhaps two minutes before the collision—I heard no more; no whistle anywhere nearer within the time when we saw the light—I heard a whistle pre<lb/>viously—I don't know to whom it belonged; I could not tell whether it was from a launch going down stream or anything else—I only heard one whistle—I could not hear the engines of the launch; they are perfectly silent; they make about the same noise as a sewing-machine would—at the time of the collision she must have been going at least 12 miles an hour or more—nobody on board the launch took any notice of the boat</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230059"/>
               <p>before the collision—I heard no shout; she did not alter her course at all; it was too rapid for that—I saw her three times altogether—from the way the boat struck, and from Mr. Desvignes's own eyidence, I imagine he turned her into us at the last second—I saw the light twice before she struck us—she was keeping on in the same line; we were trying to clear her—I did not see the launch till it was close on to us—I say she must have turned in just before striking us—I did not know that it was a steam-launch coming on to us till she was within a few feet of us—the second time I turned round I knew it was a steam-launch by the pace she had travelled; I knew it was not a barge, a sailing-boat, or a rowing<lb/>boat, it came too quickly—I was present at the inquest—it was an inquest on the deceased person—Mr. Desvignes made a statement there—he said that he himself was steering the launch and driving, but it required Dagwell, the stoker, to reverse the engines, Dagwell was attending to the stoke-hole and reversing the engines—I have since seen and examined the steam-launch—it is about 60 feet long, within two or three inches, steel-plated, about 18 inches out of the water, with only two large compartments to sit people down, but no accommodation whatever in the shape of awning or covering—there was a small stoke-hole, about three feet deep, a very short funnel, with a boiler-plate about five inches above the stem—I think she drew about 10 inches on one side and About 18 on the other—there was a place on the funnel where a light could have been hooked to; when I saw it afterwards it was on the boiler-plate—I can't tell whether it had been there before; it could be moved at pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We expected to meet Mr. Ballard'e father at Staines—he was not going to join us in the boat; we should most likely have come home by train, or by a dog-cart—it was at the option of the ladies whether they liked to go home by boat or not; we had not formed any opinion; it would have been a matter entirely for afterthought; they would probably have come home by the dog-cart—my wife was steering between Staines and Ghertsey—I can't say whether the children were asleep after we left Chertsey—one of them was not lying down in the bottom of the boat; one was in Mrs. Ballard's arms and the other between them, I believe, but I was rowing, and have not a very definite recollec<lb/>tion—when I was first examined before the Coroner I said that the launch was 300 yards off when I first saw it, but that was a <hi rend="italic">lapsus lingua</hi>, and I corrected it—I say the launch was going 12 miles an hour from the rapidity with which the light came on me—I could not have said before the Magistrate that one of my reasons for arriving at the rate of speed was that Mr. Desvignes was unable to save any one of those in the boat, because he saved Mr. Ballard—the two reasons I gave were the rapidity with which the launch came on us, and the distance she had gone when I came to the surface—the accident took place about 200 yards above Docket Point—when I came to the surface I was about 100 yards from the launch, as near as I could guess; I was then about 100 yards above Docket Point—the launch was not standing over the place where the accident happened; she must have gone beyond that, she had travelled 60 or 70 yards from, the point of the accident, I could not tell whether she was moving or not when I came to the surface, I saw her black hull, nothing else; I did not see her light—she was probably still pointing up stream, I don't know; I could see nothing but a black mass—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230060"/>
               <p>I say I gathered the pace from the rapidity with which she came on us, I don't mean her speed at the actual moment of the accident, I mean her speed up to the time when I jumped up—she came too quickly for me to say whether she had slowed—I can't say whether she had stopped at all or not; I was barely on my feet before I was in the water—I can't say whether the stem of the launch struck us or not, but I should imagine not—I had a very severe injury to my throat and one of my knees, but I should not think the launch struck me, I think I must have come across something, I don't attribute it to the launch; it would have cut me in halves—I am a trifle short-sighted—when I first saw the light it was coming round the bend, I should think nearer the Middlesex shore—I saw it over my right shoulder when I turned round—I was not steering, I only glanced round and saw it, and we steered close to the Surrey shore—I had perfect confi<lb/>dence in the steering—I looked round again after two strokes, and still we had not cleared it—seeing the light across there we kept steering to get away from it—it appeared nearly in the same direction as it was at first, only much closer—I don't recollect noticing the other shore at all, it was all too sudden—I noticed our own shore, the Surrey shore, that we were on—I made no observation of the course which the light was travel<lb/>ling with relation to the shore of the river; we only wanted to get out of the way of it—I saw Burgoyne's launch at Ohertsey lock—I judged it to be his—I have often seen it on the river—we left Chertsey lock together, at the same time—I forget whether he got away first—we asked him to give us a tow; he said he was very late—I am perfectly certain that I only heard one whistle before the accident happened—no one in the boat called attention to the fact of a whistle having been sounded—I did not think about its being a steam launch whistle—we simply looked round again, and looked and steered to get out of the way of any light, which was the correct thing to do—when I saw it afterwards I supposed it to have been Burgoyne's whistle, but there was nothing at the time to mark it on my memory—I dare say we all heard it, but there was nothing to guard against—I did not know what the light was—I should always steer away from a light, because you cannot tell whether it is a steam launch or anything else—an inquest was held on three days, and Mr. Desvignes was examined, and gave his account of the transaction—Sir George Nares was there—I don't know who he represented—I heard the verdict of the Jury on the third day—I have never laid the matter before the Public Prosecutor—I took out a summons in this case, I suppose about the middle of October, I really forget; you must ask my solicitor—it is very likely that my solicitor has issued a writ against Mr. Des<lb/>vignes within the last fortnight—he would not act without my instructions—I have instructed him to do it, at his option.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consulted Mr. Galmoye in this matter from the first time, at the inquest—I have left it entirely to his discretion—if Mr. Desvignes had offered me any expression of sympathy I should not have taken it—I heard the sound of a whistle long before anybody in the boat sighted the light—I think there was an interval of about two minutes between the whistle and the sight of the light; it might be a minute; as I have said, there was nothing to fix it—my suggestion is that when I rose to the surface I was 60 yards from the spot where the accident occurred—my recollection is not distinct—when I came to the surface I only saw the black hull of the launch—I wanted to save anybody's life,</p>

               <p>and when I found I could not do that I naturally looked after my own—it was about nine or ten seconds from the first sighting of the light and my standing to my feet—after saying before the Coroner that it was 300 yards off when the light was sighted I corrected myself directly—I spoke to Mr. Galmoye about it—I don't recollect whether the notes of my evidence were read to me before the Coroner, I was very ill at the time—I now desire to correct it to 100 yards, because I thought it was a launch light, the ordinary proper light, and of course that would look very diffe<lb/>rent to a light little bigger than a policeman's bull's-eye—it was a feebler light than the ordinary, which is quite a blaze of light—very possibly the position of the light had something to do with my inaccuracy of estimate, I can't say—it may have been shifted, or I may not have seen it—it may have been covered by the boiler part at the time—I formed the conclusion that it was a steam launch the second time X looked round, by the rapidity the light had travelled—at that time we were about one and a half or two boats' lengths from her.</p>

                  </hi>. On 24th July I went in a skiff up the river with my wife and two children, and Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb, starting from Hampton and going to Staines; Mrs. Newcomb steered; we started from Staines on the return journey about 8.45—I compared my watch with the church clock at Staines, you can see it from the bridge, and it coincided—I am a jeweller by business and understand watches—I can't say that I noticed the time in coming from Staines at either of the locks before the accident—I cannot tell what the time was at Penton Hook or Chertsey—Mrs. Newcomb steered the whole of the way; my wife was sitting on Mrs. Newcombe's left hand, one of the children was in my wife's arms, and the other was between them on the seat—I was pulling a pair of sculls, rowing stroke—after we left Chertsey we were nearer the Surrey than the Middlesex side—I noticed Mr. Burgoyne's launch in the last lock we passed through, and we asked them if they would tow us down—I have been in Manchester eight years, and consequently have not had much chance of being on the river, but I have been on it every summer I dare say—I cannot tell the exact point at which the accident happened—my attention was first attracted by a remark from the ladies that there was something coming—I think we both turned round and looked, and I think Mr. Newcomb remarked, "It's all right, but you had better keep a little nearer the Surrey side"—Mrs. New<lb/>comb acted upon that and turned the nose slightly towards the Surrey shore—I turned over my right shoulder and saw the light; we never heard anything—I don't think I saw the light again before the accident; I saw the launch, but I could not say that I saw the light—the next thing was a frightened remark from one of the Indies, "They are coming into us," or words to that effect, and in a very short space of time I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230062"/>
               <p>in the water; I turned round and just had time to see that the launch was coming, and the next moment we were struck and I was in the water—I felt the keel of the launch; it seemed to draw me to it, as I suppose it naturally would, till it passed over me, and when I came to the surface I was some distance astern of the launch—I don't think I could swim a dozen yards; when I came to the surface I picked up an oar, and then a life-buoy and a rope were thrown to me from the launch, and L was taken on board—the launch then went to the Middlesex shore, I think, where Mr. Newcomb was with the horse-patrol—Mr. Desvignes was on the launch when I was picked up; he asked me how many there were in the boat, and I told him—I don't think much occurred before we got to the bank—I think the launch was backed into the Middlesex side, but I did not notice; we landed near a small farmhouse there, a few yards above it, I think it is called Docket's farm; somebody came out of the house to us—I got off the launch and then got on again—the lock-keeper had not come up at that time, he came up soon after—I don't re<lb/>member whether Mr. Desvignes went on to the bank before the lock-keeper came, or not; I fancy he was on board the launch when the lock-keeper came up—the launch was close to the bank then; the lock-keeper was standing on the tow-path, close to the launch; he said to Mr. Des<lb/>vignes, "I told you what would happen;" he was very excited—Mr. Desvignes could hear him; he did not make any answer that I am aware of—when I went on board the launch again Mr. Desvignes said to me, "Don't make it hard for me;" he said that several times to me per<lb/>sonally; at one time Mr. Newcomb was present—I said I thought it was very unmanly to make use of such an expression as that; he seemed to think only of himself—we wore taken back to Shepperton that night—the launch was coming quick when the accident occurred; as to giving the number of miles an hour, I don't think I could, because it would require some experience to judge of the speed—nothing was called out to us, or any alarm given from the launch; we never heard anything from the launch at all—I saw the position of the light after I was on board the launch; it was on the top, about three inches above the deck, above the edge of the boat, above the gunwale, in the centre, at the bottom of the funnel, in front of it, not on the bow; not fastened at all, but just simply placed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a lantern placed directly in front of the funnel, about three inches above the stem of the boat—I think I have said that when I first saw the light it was about 80 or 100 yards off; it is very difficult to tell, but that was the distance I put it at—I would not like to swear that it may not have been 300 yards off, because it is always difficult to judge the distance, particularly on a dark night; I may have said before the Magistrate 100 to 150 yards—Mrs. Newcomb steered the whole way; when the remark was made that we were to go to the Surrey side she had the tiller ropes in her hands, because she steered the boat that way—I did not see anybody else take hold of the ropes—I did not see the body of Mrs. Ballard directly it was taken out of the water, I saw it a little time after, and the ropes were round both her arms, very far up, by the shoulders—these were separate ropes; they were wound round and round both her arms; you might almost imagine they had been put round; the top part of the rudder had come unshipped, and was attached to them—when I saw Mrs. Newcomb steering I cannot be quite certain whether she had the lines under her arms or over her shoulders.—my wife had been on the water before, but she had no practical know<lb/>ledge</p>

               <p>of working a boat—when Mr. Newcomb turned round and saw the light he said, "It's all right, but you had better keep a little nearer the Surrey side"—I understood by that that there was something coming, what we could not tell—we saw the light; I should take it that it was a light belonging to some vessel; that it was a moving light—I am not well acquainted with the river now, because I have been away from it for a good number of year—it was a moonlight night, only there were some clouds about occasionally, but there were times when we could see across the river; the moon was nearly full—I put it down that the light belonged to something, and that there was a possibility that it was coming our way; we were not sure, but for safety we steered for the Surrey side; I was not in charge of the boat; Mr. Newcomb knew the river, and I did not; I thought Mr. and Mrs. Newcomb were better judges than I—I did not stand up in the boat at the moment of the collision; Mr. New-comb stood up, that was all—the ladies had rugs wrapped round them, over their knees—I believe those rugs were afterwards picked up out of the water—there was a reticule in the boat; I know my wife had one—I believe there were loose cushions, which they were sitting on—there were no books loose; there was one in a drawer, I believe—I don't remember seeing the boat floating down the river after the accident; when I came to the surface I had been carried down stream some distance—I think I was about 30 yards from the launch when I came to the surface—I was asked at the inquest whether Mr. Desvignes did not do everything possible to save life, and I said, "Yes, he certainly threw me a life-buoy and a rope from the launch, and they did all in their power to save me"—I said that I personally had no charge whatever to make against Mr. Desvignes—I saw a steam-launch leaving Ohertsey Look; I knew afterwards that it was Mr. Burgoyne's; I was not aware of it at the time—I heard a whistle before the accident; I might have heard two—that was some little time before we saw the light for the first time, some considerable time, I think, before; it is rather difficult to fix a time; there was nothing to impress it on my memory—before we saw the light Mr. Burgoyne's boat had disappeared round Docket's Point; we lost sight of his launch very soon after leaving the lock—I did not look round when I heard the whistle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. Ballard's body was recovered about 10 next morning; I drove over from Hampton; the body was being brought on shore after I had been there, I think it was actually recovered while I was there—I did not see it landed, not till it was put where the bodies were laid—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the top of the rudder with the lines that were found—I did not notice very particularly how the lines were round my wife's body; there are other people who have noticed it, they can give it you very much better. Mrs. Newcomb's body was recovered before my wife's—my watch stopped at 9.57.</p>

               <p>about six miles an hour through the water—there was no wind to inter<lb/>fere with the steering; there was no labour, one arm worked as easy as the other—the fact of the boat riding easy proved that the steering was right—I seemed to be a long time under water—I was exhausted when I came up—I cannot swim, but with the help of an oar I picked up I managed to keep myself afloat till I had the life-buoy—I was perhaps under the water the best part of a minute—a very little time elapsed between my rising to the surface and getting the life-buoy—I was picked up within a minute and a half; they were some time getting me up the side, because I could not help myself—I did not notice whether the launch was still pointing head against stream or whether she had got across the river at all; but from the fact of our going back to Shepperton, and we did not turn round afterwards, I think it must have turned round; he could not have turned round in the time, before I was picked up—I think we went to the bank almost directly I was picked up; they said, "Who have you got there?" and they said "A man;" we went to the bank to see who was saved—I had no idea that my wife and children were lost—I saw the boat next morning at Shepperton, not at that time.</p>

I am lock-keeper at Sunbury—I remember on the 24th July last Mr. Desvignes's launch passing through my lock in the even<lb/>ing—it was 9 o'clock when he. arrived at the lock, and five minutes past nine when he left it—the launch had no light on it—I lent him one; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the launch was not detained any time before the gates were opened—I was waiting for him—I had two rowing boats going up, and seeing the launch I waited to receive it—it would take five minutes to get through—I believe it is rather over three miles from Molesey to my lock—I am positive that my watch was quite correct.</p>

               <p>in running between the bushes, if you get close on the land, the boat will obstruct the light; and that is how I am afraid a great many mis<lb/>takes are made with craft running alongside of the river with lights too high—I did not advise him where to place the light—I simply left it to his discretion—I think it was placed in the proper place—I should hate placed it there if I had been in the same position—I have seen the row<lb/>ing boat in question—I have been nearly 13 years the lock-keeper of Sunbury, previous to that time I was at sea—I should think from the condition of the boat after the accident, the launch must have been going at a very slow rate of speed indeed—if she had been going a very heavy rate of speed, the boat, being a small one, would have been completely smashed up—the amount of injury done to the boat indicates, to my mind, that the launch could not have been going at a very great pace—I do not think she would have cut through her, she was bound to have gone clean over her.</p>

I did not look at my watch, but I have two things to go by in taking the time; when the Formosa was in the lock the look was being emptied, as three church clocks struck 10 o'clock, she stopped in the lode, and after it was emptied, for 10 minutes; then I looked at the time, and then I knew it must be just about 10 minutes to 10 o'clock when Mr. Desvignes was there—it is only a guess, I did not see the time—I saw some light—it really was not, in my humble judgment, sufficient, but there are plenty worse than that considerably—it ought to have been a little brighter, but you could see it at a long distance—I should think it would hardly be sufficient on a dark hazy night—on a dark hazy night like that I should think you could see it for about two miles—Docket's Point is half a mile from my look, and the accident was 200 yards farther than Docket's Point—I could not form any opinion as to the rate the stream was running, but on that particular day the water was lower than in any part of the summer, and that would have a ten<lb/>dency to reduce the stream—the look is constantly at work—when there is not much water in the river that does not make the stream go faster—I do not know at what rate the stream was running at the place where the accident happened—I do not think more than three miles an hour, it might be a little more or less—it might be going more than two—it is a question I can hardly speak distinctly upon—I should think it would be between two and three miles—I think that would be very reasonable.</p>

I am one of the mounted police—on the evening of 24th July I was on duty, doing my ordinary patrol beat on horse<lb/>back—I have been a patrol for some time; I have had the same horse for five years—I have timed the pace of my horse between stations when I have been going with despatches; the utmost he does he four miles an hour, that is walking; in fact, it is more than he is able to do—on this night I remember being at Shepperton Lock on my beat—after leaving there I rode up the towing-path on the Middlesex side—I saw Mr. Des<lb/>vignes's launch—it might be about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after leaving Shepperton Look, I could not say exactly; I had ridden</p>

               <p>about half a mile; I had got up to Docket's Point—the launch overtook me; I suppose it was going about 3 1/2 miles an hour—my horse was keeping pace with it for about 100 yards—I saw the Formosa before that 100 yards had been covered, they both rounded the point together; I heard a whistle—I saw them pass each other—Mr. Desvignes passed on the Middlesex side, and Mr. Burgoyne on the Surrey side—after my going the 100 yards side by side with Mr. Desvignes's launch she steamed away from me, wont faster—the next thing that attracted my attention was a crash and some screams; that might have been three minutes after the launch had steamed away, or not so much—I galloped up to the spot where the occurrence took place, still going up stream; I had to gallop about 200 yards—I dismounted and took off my clothes, and was in the act of jumping in when I heard the screams, I thought there was some<lb/>body in the water—I saw Mr. Newcomb in shore, and I helped to pull him out; he complained of his knees being hurt—I saw Mr. Desvignes's launch then about mid-stream, still, and I saw Mr. Desvignes working to and fro with his boat-hook—I asked him how many he had saved; he said one gentleman only; he said there were more people in the river—then I ran down some distance and got into a boat close to Docket's Point, and rowed about to see if I could find any bodies floating; I could find none—I don't remember seeing Mr. Newcomb's boat—I came ashore again, and galloped down to the lock-house—the launch had come to the bank before I left—I came back with several young gentlemen who were camping there—I got back before the lock-keeper; I think Mr. Newcombe and Mr. Ballard were then on the launch, and Mr. Des<lb/>vignes also—the lock-keeper afterwards came up, and several young gentlemen with him—I heard some conversation, but I was busy taking the particulars of the accident, getting the names and addresses of both parties—I took notes, and have them here; I did not take any notes of the conversation, only what I did myself; Mr. Desvignes said nothing to me—when the steam launch was going alongside of me I noticed the lamp, this is the lamp—the atmosphere was cloudy, the moon was clouded every five or ten minutes—I could see the lamp of the launch quite plain—when the Formosa whistled the other launch answered with his whistle when they passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder of steam launches—I am not an owner—the Formosa belongs to my brother—I know Mr. Desvignes's steam launch; there is no other steam launch on the Thames exactly like it, but after the same line—on the night of 24th July I was on board</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230069"/>
               <p>the Formosa, coming down stream—I first saw Mr. Desvignes's lauuch just as we were rounding Docket's Point—I knew it was a steam launch because he whistled; I whistled, not in reply to him, but for the lock-keeper; he whistled first—after that I passed him; I saw his light before I passed him; it was a sufficient light, according to the laws of the Con<lb/>servancy above the look, but it was not a sufficient light—in a straight course I could see it for a mile, if there was nothing to interrupt the view—after the whistling we passed on—nothing attracted my attention—the atmosphere was cloudy; it was a full moon, but the clouds kept on passing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the time Mr. Desvignes's launch passed us she was going about six miles an hour altogether through the air; the stream would be pretty nearly four miles an hour at that point, 3 1/2 or four—I have since seen the boat—looking at its condition, I should say it was struck more at right angles than anything else, between that and 45 degrees—if the launch had been going at considerable speed when it met the boat it must have produced more damage than it has done—if it kept at the speed that I saw it I think it would have cut it in halves, cut it right down—I have seen accidents with steamers and with rowing boots, and can form a judgment as to the sort of injury that would he done to a boat by a violent collision.</p>

I am brother of the last witness—I am the owner of four steam launches, and am in the habit of using them myself—none of them are at all like Mr. Desvignes's—on the evening in question I was not in the Formosa, I was in the Amazon, another steamer—my brother was in the Formosa—she was above the lock, and I was below—<hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following Witness were called for the Defence</hi>:—<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY DAGWELL</hi>. I am a stoker in the employ of the defendant—on. the 24th July I was on board his launch with him—we were returning from Kingston—after we left Shepperton look we met another steam launch just below Docket's Point—she was 80 or 100 yards oil' when I first saw her—I blew the whistle, and then proceeded to Docket's Point, and I blew the whistle again on going round the Point—we always make it a rule to blow it on going round the Point—after we had rounded the Point about 100 yards, I saw a small row boat—it appeared to be about. 80 or 90 yards off, perhaps it might be more or it might be less, I can't say for certain—it was coming down on the Middlesex side—we kept him</p>

               <p>the middle of the river, the course we always take—I did not keep my eye on the row boat the whole of the time—when I saw it again it was about 30 yards off, or from that to 40—the launch was going then about 4 miles an hour perhaps, it might be 5, at the outside—'the rows boat kept coming down till she got within 10 or 15 yards of us, then she suddenly shot right across under our bows by some means—I had orders from Mr. Desvignes to reverse the engines—he was steering and driving also—I reversed the engines—Mr. Desvignes picked up the boat hook, and picked up a shawl—we came into collision with the boat, it might be a second or two after I was told to reverse the engines—I saw the defendant leave the wheel and take a boat hook, and he picked a rug out of the water—he never stirred from the place where he was—we came to a standstill immediately after the collision—I saw Mr. Ballard in the water—I threw life buoy to him, he took hold of it, and we brought him on to the launch—I did not see any one else in the water—after pulling Mr. Ballard out, we stopped there for some minutes, searching about at the scene of the accident—I saw the small boat almost immediately after the accident wing round on our starboard side, the Middlesex side—it floated down the stream—we then went in to shore—when it passed me the boat was up in its proper way, there was nothing the matter with it—we had not altered our course before the boat shot across us; we then turned towards the Surrey side—they were shooting across towards the Surrey tide—if the row-boat had not altered its course there would have been sufficient room for them to have passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been stoker for Mr. Desvignes about six years—the same steam launch was not used during that time; this one came into use in June this year—the steering wheel is behind the funnel and behind the stoke-hole—the person standing to steer is on a higher level than I am in stoking—Mr. Desvignes was standing higher than I was;. he was supposed to keep the look-out—the only light on board the launch that night was about 6 inches above the gunwale—the stoke-hole is between 3 and 4 feet below the gunwale; I could see the light from where I was, it would be on a level with my eye—I saw the row-boat at a distance of about 80 or 900 yards ahead, it may be more, it may be less—we were about in the middle of the stream, bearing towards the Surrey shore if anything—we whistled on passing the Formosa, before the acci<lb/>dent, and we whistled again between passing the Formosa and the acci<lb/>dent—the row-boat was more than 80 or 90 yards from us when we first whistled—we whistled round Docket's Point, I had not seen the row-boat then—we did not whistle when it was 80 or 90 yards off—I have said the speed of the launch at the time was not more than four miles an hour—the stream is very strong at that point, three or four miles an hour I should say—I had the control of the engines; I did not reverse them till I had orders from Mr. Desvignes—the row-boat was very close to us then; I should not say 20 yards, or anything like; I could not say how close within a yard or so, it would be impossible to say—I am not accustomed to row at all, I cannot scull—it is not the rule in going up against stream to avoid the current to go on whichever shore there is the least current, particularly round a point; we go the proper course for a steam lauuch—it was not unusually late for us to be out at night—Mr. Desvignes does not very often go out on the Thames so late; there are steamboats that go on much later; it was late for us—the launch is</p>

               <p>usually put up at Chertsey at night—we have been out a great deal later—sometimes we are earlier, sometimes later—we had not been delayed that night in our course up the river, only at Molesey look, we had to stop out there a little while, waiting for the lock, that was all—we did not carry three lights this night—red, green, and white; we have done so on other occasions—I think the current at this point is stronger on the Surrey side—the launch was turned a little towards the Surrey shore—I noticed that the Formosa had three lights; they were coming round the point as we were going up the reach—I did not see it just then at a greater distance than 100 yards, because they were coming round the point—it could be seen at a great deal farther distance off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The course we took is the best course for a steam launch—the water was not very low at this time, there was plenty of water there—we determine the course as it is the regular channel for steam-boats or barges, because there is more water in that course—the launch draws about 3 feet, or 3 feet 6 inches—she would draw about 2 feet 6 inches that night I should think, perhaps not quite to much—she draws more aft than forward—she drew about 2 feet 6 inches at the deepest that night, I should think.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I had nothing to do with the steering—if the row-boat had held its course the vessels would have passed safely, in my judgment—at the moment the boat was seen crossing our bows Mr. Desvignes did the best thing possible to prevent an accident—a charge was made against me before the Magistrate as well as against Mr. Desvignes, but the charge against me was dismissed.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was living at Shepperton, and was stoker to Mr. Parsons—about 10 o'clock on Saturday, 24th July, I was fastening up Mr. Parsons's steam launch just opposite his house;I saw the defendant come along with his steam launch the wolverine—as near as I could judge he was going from three to four miles per hour—that was between Shepperton lock and docket's Point—I heard him whistle twice—I know his whistle well—I saw a light on board burning brightly.</p>

               <p>that would be the usual and proper course for a steam launch to take—I have looked at the boat—she was struck on the port side, at an angle of about 45, as nigh as I can tell; she must have gone right across the steam launch; she must have shot across the launch's head—I should not think the launch was going at the rate of four miles from what I have seen of the boat; if she had been going at any considerable pace she must have made two of her, gone right through.</p>

He washed me in my blood a few days before this"—I searched him at the station, and found under his shirt, next to his flesh, the fore part of his body covered with tin, forming a kind of tin breast<lb/>plate—it was made of biscuit-tins—I asked him the reason for that—he said that he did not know what might happen among such a lot—I touched him behind and asked him why he had not thought of the back part—he said that it did not matter about that—I received two revolvers from the mate; four chambers of one and one chamber of the other were loaded.</p>

Gaol of New<lb/>gate—the prisoner has been confined there since November 11th—I have seen him daily, and examined him—he is suffering from very strong delusions, and has a very firm belief in them—I have discussed with him the idea that there was a plot on the ship to destroy his life, and he is under the belief that lie has been fired at—he told me that he had taken a tin box containing some papers relating to some pro<lb/>perty in Carolina, and had covered it with carpet to protect him, and had thrown the papers overboard to that the crew should not get them, and flattened the box and placed it on his abdomen to protect him—he likewise stated that there was an attempt to poison him, for one day when he took something into the cabin he saw something glitter, but he was too wideawake to take it—he also said that the fowls and the pigs had poison given to them—he said that he heard the men come and whisper, and they peeped into the galley where he was, and he put out the lights so that they should not see—he also said that he was quite sure he had been fired at some days before he fired—he implicitly believes</p>

I live at 8, King's Street, South Moulton, Devonshire—I own some land at Little Deptford in Devonshire—on 20th March 1877 I received the deed relating to that property from my solicitors, Messrs. Rickards—this is it—I put it with other deeds in an old-fashioned trunk and locked it, and put the bunch of keys in an writing-desk, which I always keep looked—I never allowed any one to go near it—at the begin<lb/>ning of 1877 the prisoner was staying at my house and I allowed him to stay there a few weeks—he left, I think, is August—my late sister left him an annuity of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had paid him ever since—about March this year I looked in my box, missed the deeds belonging to the freehold—I never authorised the prison to pass in my name, or to sign any document on my behalf—the signature to this document looks like mine—it is a very good imitation, but I never thought of having it prepared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I bought the property; my aunt left me some, and my ancestors left me some—it was not altogether from the family—I am sorry to say that I am the prisoner's uncle—my sister brought him, up from child, in my father's house: I had nothing to do with him—my</p>

               <p>father died in 1863, when I Wrap master of the house—I kept my sister—I never hated his father—I hated drunkenness—his father was a great drunkard—I may have written to aim, "Old <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> next door said the moon would shine all the year round now; Moon man told him the stars would shine also"—Moon is a tenant of mine—when my sister was ill I did not ask some medicine-man or conjuror to do anything—my sister used to, encourage the prisoner in everything—I never interfered—I may have written to my nephew of his father, "He owes me 19 years' rout at Little Deptford," etc., "I never had a shilling for it to the Year 1846 His wife's funeral he never paid for"—it is true he owed 19 years' rent—I was not angry with the prisoner because I thought he was holding com<lb/>munication with hit father—I wrote this letter in September 1877: "I am given to understand that your dear father has visited you. I dare say you are very friendly"—I do not know whether I wrote, "I understand your mother was much blessed with her father-in-law, which must be beautiful and heavenly in the extreme"—his father's solicitor threatened me with a chancery suit—he never accused me of embezzling—he might have said I had embezzledd his deeds—I am not aware that a chancery suit is being commented against me by the prisoner's father—think the prisoner married in August, 1877—I heard he had made a settlement on his wife—I never saw the settlement—I heard he sent it to ay solicitor—my solicitor did not tell me what was in the marriage settlement—I did not know to whom to pay the annuity—he did art tell me that that deed of gift was part of the marriage settlement—I never wrote to him in this letter of October 11th, 1877, the words, "So you can get some cash on my deeds in my name"—it is a very good imitation of my writing, but that line seems to be inserted—the letter is mine—I never thought of such a thing; it is quite monstrous to suppose such a thing—wrote this letter, "My late father gave your mother 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to help buy the Red Lion," etc.—I missed the deeds in 1877—I never gave them to the prisoner to raise money on, and I did not say, "Now, James, whatever you do return those deeds"—Mr. Rickards said they had lost the deeds of the freehold of the house which my lather purchased, but it appeared it was a Mistake—I was examined at the police-court, when the present Mr. Rickard's clerk said that it was not missing—I do not know that the prisoner by his marriage settlement conveyed to his trustees the annuity for the benefit of his wife—I am not aware that Captain Harding has sued me for the annuity—Mr. Rickards paid it—I have nothing to do with it—I was not in arrears—that signature to the deed of gut looks like my writing, but I never prepared such a thing—I remember James Smyth; I think he was clerk to Mr. Chaplin, solicitor, at South Moulton—I do not know whether Smyth is alive—I need to ask my sister what he came to me house about, and she said it was about a patent—he was always taking out patents for inventions—I do not know when I saw him last.</p>

The prosecutor said, 'I can show you how to make people drunk, and show you how I can rob them.' He called for more beer, and after coming from that side pro<lb/>ceeded to the Fox and French Horn public-house, and on the way the prosecutor turned to a man, and asked him to stand some beer. The man said, 'If you are broke I will pay for some.' The prosecutor said, 'I have no money. I am broke!' The man said, 'I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for all the money you have upon you.' The prosecutor said, 'You shall have it,' and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and searched him. The man took the prosecutor's money and ran into the Fox and French Horn. The prose<lb/>cutor followed him, and said to the man behind the count, 'Don't serve him, for he has got my money.'

I walked away and took no notice—he followed me and pulled a handkerchief from my pocket with a shilling and two sixpences tied in the corner of it; he took: a penny which was in my pocket; he knocked me down, and made a peculiar noise with his mouth, and two others came from a doorway and held me down while he got away, and then one kicked me—I knew the prisoner from seeing him at the public-house, but I never served him—I shouted "Police," and an hour after I was behind the door of the Quebec public-house when the prisoner called for ale and put down sixpence—I said to a man, "That's the man who robbed me", and the prisoner took his change and ran out, and never stopped to drink the ale—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

death of him—Wickham said, "I have been had up on suspicion of stealing Captain Bonham's jewels, about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and I knew nothing about them; we done a job some time ago at Stevens's, in the Strand, in the same line as Fisher, and there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward offered for that, and they never found us out"—Campbell asked Wickham if he had any money to pay for a drop of beer, and he said, "No, but I will go and get a drop of beer, though," and he went into the Bird-in-Hand and got a quart of beer on credit—Wickham said, "We must do that house in Garrick Street, as we must have some money somehow or other; we are depending upon that for our Sunday dinner"—I made an appoint<lb/>ment with Campbell to meet him at Garrick Street on Saturday at 12 o'clock, to give him an impression of the key, if I could get it—on Saturday I went to the Bird-in-Hand with Campbell, and met Scott there—Wickham</p>

               <p>came in afterwards and asked me if I had got the impression of the key—I told him no, but I thought I could get it by night—he asked me what time, and I told him not before 9 o'clock, during the time my wife was cleaning—on Saturday night I met Scott at the corner of Rose Street, and we went to Garrick Street—Wickham and Campbell came' up and asked me if I had got the impression of the key—I said "Yes," and I gave it to Wickham, and he gave it to Campbell—Camp<lb/>bell said, "It will do first-class." (<hi rend="italic">At this stage of the proceedings Wickham pleaded guilty as an accessory before the fact.</hi>) I had several conversations and meetings with Campbell, Scott, and Wickham before the premises were attempted to be broken into—during some of these conversations a man named Jingle was mentioned—he is the prisoner Gurner—I saw Gurner on Monday morning, the 25th, at about 12 o'clock, at the Bird-in-Hand—the landlord said to Gurner, "How are you getting on, Jingle?"—shortly after Scott came in and spoke to Gurner; shortly after him came Campbell—then I heard Campbell tell Gurner that "Joe" wanted to see him—Gurner said, "I thought he would be here"—he then went away—on Monday night I saw Gurner at the Bird-in-Hand with Campbell and Scott—I was introduced by Campbell to Gurner—Campbell said, "This is a friend of ours, he is all right"—Gurner said, "That is all right as long as I know who is present"—Gurner then said, "Do you Know if the job will go off straight?"—I said, to the best of my knowledge I thought it would—Gurner then said, "I hope it will, as I have done lots of jobs for 'Joe' before, and do not wish to get myself into trouble"—I told him I thought it would be all right—on Tuesday, the 26th, at about 12.30, I went to the Bird-in-Hand again, and saw all the prisoners—Gurner said to Wickham, "Do you know when you will want me?"—Wickham then said, "Meet me here between 6 and 7 o'clock without fail to-night"—Gurner then left—we met again about 4 o'clock at the Drury public-house in Catherine Street—Jingle did not come in—I saw Jingle again on Wednesday, about 6.10 a.m., at the corner of Wych Street—he was with his Hansom cab; they just came out of the public-house as I got there—Campbell and Scott were then in the custody of the officers inside our premises—I said, "Make haste, they are waiting at the door for you"—Wickham then said, "What the d—and hell are you out here for?"—I said that they were getting anxious—Gurner then said, "Have they got the things ready?"—I said, "Yes"—Wickham then said to me, "Go on indoors"—I then went indoors and took up a bag that had been prepared before by the police inside, and I placed it in the cab which had followed me down Arundel Street, two doors past ours—Gurner was driving his cab—I put the bag in, and Wickham went and rapped at the private door, and said, "Come out, you b—fools"—Scandrett and Gregory then ran up and secured them—directly I put the bag in the cab Gurner drove off towards the Embankment—Wickham said, in the presence of the other prisoners, the stuff would be divided—Wickham said if I got into trouble he would engage Mr. Keith Frith to defend me—during this time I was daily in communication with the police.</p>

He then fell down a few yards off, and this man said, 'I will pick him up.' I said, 'Don't; you may get yourself into trouble.' I went over the other side and stood ten yards away, and saw a constable come up. I was going across the road to see what this man was to be locked up for, and the constable came across the road and said, 'I want you for robbing this man.' I said, 'You have made a mistake.' On going to the station he said, 'Who knocked that man down?' I said, 'I believe he fell down.' The prosecutor, when at the station, said he had lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

"Here is the agent"—I said to Fox, "I am pleased to tell you you will get the whole amount"—there was some question as to whether she was entitled to it all, but it is the practice of of our office to pay in case of an accident—I was not previously in a posi<lb/>tion to say so—I told them the deceased was not in benefit, yet on account of accident they would pay the whole—Fox seemed pleased, but did not reply—I then produced the necessary receipt and asked her to sign it—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she could not write—I said, "I recollect you could not write; the other day you made a cross"—so she made a cross after the words "Susan Walker—Clarke and Mersh were also present—prior to that I said, "I want some one to witness it; a respectable person from the street can be called in"—they demurred, but eventually called in Mersh—I said, "I merely want you to witness this claim for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he had signed the paper on a former occasion—he signed the paper after the cross—it is the usual form indemnifying the company against any further claim—I counted the money out to Fox, thinking she was Mrs. Walker—I then endeavoured to canvass her—she made some excuse about distress, and I went away—on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a money-lender, of 8, Store Street, Totten<lb/>ham Court Road—in August last Mr. Burns, the prisoner, applied to me to lend him 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I should like to see his furniture, as that was to be the sole security for the advance—I went to Sabella Row, Clapham, and saw both the prisoners—Burns told me that the furniture was his absolute property—I said, "Have you any marriage settlement?"—he said, "Go upstairs and get me that settlement"—she went up and brought it down, and gave it to me—it was dated 7th January, 1880, I believe—it was dated before the settlement of 22nd March, 1880—I looked through it; there was no reference whatever to furniture, and I believed his statement about it being his absolute property—I asked him particularly if there was any settlement on that property, and he said, "No"—I was proposing to take a bill of sale, and a declaration before a Commissioner by Mr. and Mrs. Burns was made out, which states that "no part of the furniture is settled, charged, or encumbered, and it is free and clear from settlement, mortgage, or encumbrance"—I believed that, and advanced the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two years, for which I was to receive 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is 25 per cent.—I afterwards received information, and went down to Kennington—he had made default in his payments, which gave me the right to seize—I saw Mrs. Burns and another woman, and found that part of the furniture had been removed—I afterwards saw Mr. Burns, and said, "You have obtained money from me on furniture which does not belong to you"—Mrs. Burns had told me that—he said, "I will see you to-morrow about it"—I then went to Ely Place and saw Mr. James, a solicitor—I did not see Burns again, but a day or two afterwards I was served with a writ in an action of Edward Atkins and George Solomon</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a money-lender about eighteen months—the business has been established thirty years, but the office has been there twelve months—we carry on the "West of England Loan and Dis<lb/>count Company," which has offices all over England, and the name is in our window—we have offices at Cardift Newport, Portsmouth, and other places—we are all connected—"we" means my father and myself—he is still alive; he is not the sole proprietor of the business, I am one, and there are others who I am not going to mention—my father is not here because he has nothing to do with my office, he carries on the business at Cardiff—Mr. Eyles is our manager at Reading—we do sot advertise there in the same name as in London, because in every town we are bound to give the manager's name when people come to the office: they ask for the name which they see advertised—my name is Benjamin; my father's name is Solomon Benjamin, and he advertises in that name in Cardiff—this advertisement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) says, "Apply to B. Blyberg, 8, Store Street. Established 50 years"—my brother may have, put that in—his name is Joseph, and this is "B"—each party advertises. when they are of age, but Joseph is only eighteen—he may have put in the advertisement in my name—we turn over, I dare say, 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if that turn-over was on the same terms as the bill of sale, we should have nothing left, because it would all go—our terms are from, 10 per cent, up to 30, and we have only charged 25—I am in the habit, of taking the wife's signature when I lend money to a married man—I mean that I take a statutory declaration by husband and wife occasionally—I did so in this case because there were two children there aged 8 and 9, and Mrs. Burns said that she had only lately been married—I thought there, was some doubt about the marriage, so we took both—I saw the marriage settle<lb/>ment—I had a doubt whether they were lawfully married, and other doubts—I doubted whether he was the householder or she—they produced no rent receipts—I might have had a doubt to which of them the fur<lb/>niture belonged if they were not married, so I thought I would have a joint declaration and a joint bill of sale—I included Mr. Burns's business address simply because a bill of sale is a registered deed, and we are bound to give a full description. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of sale also included the stock-in-trade and furniture at</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">Paternoster Row.</hi>) If I had found a couple of hundred pounds' worth of stock at Paternoster Bow I should not have seized it without consulting my solicitor, but I should have if he advised me to do so—Mr. Burns was to begin with an instalment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd September—I did not see him on that day or at all until I found that the goods did not belong to him—I found that he had removed his furniture, but did not see him till after he had made default; that was about four days after the second instalment was due—I have no recollection of seeing him on 25th September—he paid the first instalment when it was due, and when the second was due on 23rd October he did not pay it, nor on the 26th, and I told the clerk to go and see why he had not paid it—I swear he never tendered me the second instalment—when I saw him he said that he would come and see me in the morning, but he did not say with the instalment—I would not have taken it after I found that out, if he had offered it—I did not offer to take the instalment if he gave me other security—I did not say a word about further security to Mr. or Mrs. Burns—they</p>

               <p>said that Mrs. Burns's father knew all about the bill of sale, and was coming to see me about it—I gave them a 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—you will see "cash" written on it—it is payable to Burns and James—that is the name over the office in Paternoster Row—I said, "Here, I want you, Mr. James, to come up with me and draw the bill up"—that was a promissory note admitting the amount, and I made out the cheque to Messrs. Burns and James—I have the promissory note; it is made by Mr. and Mrs. Burns and Mr. James; I will sell it to you for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took Mr. James's security in addition to theirs, and still hold it—I did not say a word about that at the police-court, because I was not asked; I was going to tell you about it and you stopped me—I had taken a mortgage on all there might be in the house, and on all that there was at Paternoster Row—I did not require Mr. James, the partner, to become security for the loan—when Burns took me there I saw "Burns and James" over the door, and I said, "You tell Mr. James I shall require him also"—it was not because I had a doubt as to whom the furniture belonged that I required Mr. James to join in the matter—I would have lent him the money whether James's name was given or no—I did not say, "I will not advance the money till I have James's name"—he came to the office with James and a man named Wollelt, who got a commission out of it—he is not a friend of mine—he introduced these parties to me—it was a commission business, and if I carried it out I gave him a commission—I did not put Mr. James's name in for safety, but for protection—besides the crossed cheque I gave them 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold; they may have handed that back again, but not a halfpenny more—I charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going down to his house three times—I gave them the cash because it was after banking hours, and they wanted some cash that evening—they did not ask for money which I refused—they even came back next morning and begged for more cash—I swear that they did not give me back 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I keep books and enter every transaction—I have not entered the guinea I received back because that is what I was out of pocket—I swear to the best of my knowledge that they did not return me six guineas; it did not exceed a guinea—I said at the police-court, "I advanced my money solely on the assertions made to me by them, and the statement in the declaration"—it was only upon that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I agreed to lend the money before I knew of James—the Paternoster Row goods were not worth more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or £2—I had no reason to believe that goods worth £160 were coming there—it was ouly au office, not a warehouse—the only security I hud was the furniture at Clapham.</p>

Waterlow and Son were our London agents, but not to lend money, we had no London office to lend money—they are our agents and stamp bills of sale and register them, which business we now do for ourselves—we had no money-lending business in London till my brother Joseph started it 18 months ago; he was 18 when he opened it—he traded in my name till I came to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to James and James, 23, Ely Place, solici<lb/>tors for Mrs. Burns and Mr. Kirk, not for Mr. Burns—I produce a settle<lb/>ment made on 22nd March, 1880, which settles the furniture and chattels at 13, Sabella Road, Clapham, on two trustees for the benefit of Mrs. Burns, and the issue of her marriage, if any—there is a schedule of the furniture supposed to be on the premises, and if it is not there it ought to be, but a portion has been removed, and another portion has been sold under the settlement.</p>

I took Jones into custody on the 27th October—I received information five days after the robbary—I saw Mr. and Mrs. Cadwell, and they gave me description of the four men—I said to Jones, "I want you for being concerned with others in breaking into No. 8, Fashion Street. Spitalfields, on the morning of the 13th"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station—Mr. and Mrs. Cadwell and the little girl were fetched—Jones was placed with 11 others—Mrs. Cadwell walked directly up, and pointed Jones out—she said "That is the man who was loading the clothes in the sack," the husband also identified Jones momentarily—the daughter pointed to a</p>

               <p>man named Early, who was called in from the street—she said "That looks like the man who came to borrow the sack"—the mother said "Yes, it does look like one"—Jones said "I can account for where I was on the 12th or 13th"—I do not think that is in the depositions—on the 13th November the three Cadwells came again—Shaw was placed with about 10 others—Mr. Cadwell pointed out a man who burst his door open—I said "You had better summons him"—he then walked up to Shaw and said, "This is the man I saw with the coats"—Shaw made a remark which I could not catch—there was no likeness between Early and Shaw—the Cadwells have been subjected to great annoyance since the occurrence.</p>

Clark says "I don't know, he wanted to see you, and I brought him here," and I said to his brother "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to do what you have done for me; you turned my place over last night while I was away; I have locked Wiggins up, and he has rounded on you in the station-house; you may as well tell me all about it and where my stuff is, and I won't turn a policeman on you"—I stayed there for a considerable time, and had a cup of tea with them—up came Bullock, and I said "Sadler?" and he said "No"—I said "You turned my place over while I was away last night;" he says "How do you know I did?" I said I had locked Wiggins up, "he has turned round on you and told me you done it, or else how should I</p>

I said "I will;" he said "No, you cannot;" I said "The boy (Clark) will go," and he went away and brought me some stuff back—he turned round and said "You have got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff there, don't grumble;" I said "All right, I don't grumble, wait till I see it"—he went round to another public-house and <hi rend="italic">sits</hi> down, in the back parlour and opened it and looted at it, and seeing it was not what I wanted, I said to Bullock "I want a large gold watch, a diamond ring set with three diamonds, and a nugget pin and another nag set with three emeralds"—he said "You cannot have them unless I have another 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" I said "I am not going to be made a fool of and be messed about by you, I shall turn a policeman on you;" and I jumped into a cab and gave information to the police—I saw Bullock again when I was jumping out of a cab the game night at 12 o'clock—I went back to the public-house the same night; when I get outside the public-house I saw Bullock and two or three often in a cab; he jumped out of one sitter, and the sergeant laid hold of him and brought him into the public—Clark came in and said "Do not do anything wrong; here is your stuff," and he pulled out my watch and diamond ring—Bullock was taken to the station and dark was let off—I kept him in my employ for a few days—I told him he had better have some supper and go home, and see me to morrow morning—he came, and he was taken into custody—I did not give him into custody—I should never hare got this stolen property except for him—I do not believe he had anything to do with it.</p>

I went on the 2nd November to the prosecutor's house, 153, Cleveland Street, and from inquiries I made I Went to a public-house in Castle Street with the prosecutor and Sergeant Salmon, where I saw Bullock in company with three other men in a cab—one of them was Sadler—two of them jumped out and ran away—I asked Bullock to get out of the cab, and as soon as he got out the prosecutor said, "I give him into custody for stealing my jewellery; I gave you 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get this back; now you see I have turned <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>"—Bullock went into the public-house before I got hold of him, and there I saw dark—he attempted to hand the prosecutor this gold watch and diamond ring—I took mem from him and said, "Where did you got this from?"—he said, "From a strange man in the street"—I then took him to the Tottenham Court Road Police-station—I searched him and found five contract notes, a diamond ring, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, some coppers, and a Bank of Engraving note on him—he said nothing in answer to the charge—I have since tried to find Sadler, but have not been able—Clark was taken to the police-station at that time, but not charged—subsequently the case was handed over to the Public Prosecutor, and I received certain directions, and I took Clark in custody outside the Green Man in Euston Road—I told him I should take him into custody</p>

                  </hi>. I am Member of Parliament for the county of Meath—I have lived in London for four years past, and practise as a barrister at the English bar—I was formely the proprietor of several newspapers in Dublin, among others the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>—I edited the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>—I was proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>, not the editor—in 1875 I practically ceased to have any connection with journalism; but absolutely and legally I entirely severed my connection with journalism in 1876, and I have had nothing to do with it from that day to this—that was the year when I was called to the Irish bar, and it was because of that I thought it right to cease to have anything to do with political journalism—I first became a member of the British Parliament in March, 1874—I was then elected for the county of Louth, in Ireland—Mr. Philip Callan, the defendant, was on that occasion elected as my col<lb/>league—he had at the same election been elected for Dundalk, the capital town of that county—he elected to sit for Dundalk, and I had another colleague elected, Mr. George Harley Kirk, and we sat together as mem<lb/>bers for the county of Louth during the remainder of that Parliament—I was called to the English bar in 1877, to the Irish bar in 1876—from the time when I was called to the English bar I have resided in Lon<lb/>don, and practised as an English barrister—when Parliament was dissolved in the spring of the present year I was made aware of the fact</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230117"/>
               <p>that a resolution was come to by the Home Rule Executive Committee as to the course they should adopt in the elections—I am not a member of that Committee—after the dissolution of Parliament was announced, I received a very strong request from the Executive Committee that I should give all the influence which they thought I could exercise to assist them in certain places in organising the Irish voters—in reply to that request I undertook to do so, expressly in certain places which were named, and which I think I made a pencil note of at the time, and added that upon actual application from other places I would see what I could do, but would not bind myself—Devonport was not one of the places mentioned, either to me or by me on that occasion—I had never heard of Devonport all my life in connection with Irish politics—the borough of Devonport was never mentioned to me during the election, in fact I heard nothing about it until alter these proceedings commenced—at the general election last March I was a candidate for my old constituency of Louth with my colleague Mr. Kirk, we agreed to stand or fall together—my opponent at the last moment was Mr. Callan—he had been canvassing for a year before, but he publicly announced his candidature on Easter Sunday evening; that was before he was defeated for Dundalk, before any election had taken place—after Mr. Callan had become a candidate in opposition to myself and Mr. Kirk I made a public declaration with reference to what I would do if Mr. Callan were returned; I stated that I would not sit if Mr. Kirk were sacrificed, under the circumstances I then named—I am quite ready to explain my reasons for that declaration if I am asked—on 9th April I was elected member for Louth with Mr. Callan as my colleague, Mr. Callan being at the head of the poll by about sixty or seventy votes, and Mr. Kirk some hundreds of votes below, at the bottom—the moment the result reached me (I had crossed over to London while the counting of the votes was going on) I immediately placed my application for the Chiltern Hundreds in the hands of my com<lb/>mittee in Louth, in fulfilment of my word; that application was sent in by my committee I think towards the end of May—that was after I had become a candidate for Meath—after the general election was over one of the seats at Meath became vacant; I was publicly invited to accept the seat, and after some interchange of views I consented, and I was elected without opposition—it was while I was a candidate for the representation of Meath that I saw the article in the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> on Saturday evening, 8th May—at that time I had been publicly announced as a candidate for Meath; a committee had been formed in the county, and were prosecuting the matter there—this is the article, beginning "Who is the culprit?" (<hi rend="italic">The alleged libel was put in and read; in substance it stated that Mr. Sullivan had received pecuniary assistance from a Conservative member of the Carlton in order to secure is election for Louth</hi>,) I read that article on the very day that it was nominally published—I was then in London, at my residence at Clapham—as soon as I read it I instantly telegraphed to Dublin to my brother to state that there was not a shadow of foundation for this, and that by post I would send instructions to commence a criminal prosecution—Mr. Richard Piggott, the proprietor and publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi>, was the gentleman against whom the proceedings were to be taken—criminal proceedings were taken against him on my motion, and he ultimately appeared on 27th May at the Police-court, Dublin, to answer my summons—those proceedings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230118"/>
               <p>were published in all the Irish papers, and in most of the London papers—Mr. Piggott on that occasion made an ample apology and paid my costs—I told my counsel that I insisted on presenting myself for cross-examination in the witness-box in order that the whole matter might be "tilted; I went into the box and offered myself for cross-examination, and denied on oath that there was a shadow of foundation for the statement Which had been made—in consequence of what took place on that occa<lb/>sion Mr. Piggott handed me the original telegram from which his article had been concocted, what we call the post-office flimsy—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—this was handed to me as the MS. from which the article had been printed—this flimsy does not disclose the name of the author—I applied to the Post-office in London for a sight of the original message sent by the author of the telegram, and I was granted it, on receiving an authorisation from Mr. Piggott—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am perfectly familiar with the handwriting of this telegram—I recognised it imme<lb/>diately, without looking at the back—the whole of it is in the defendant's handwriting—on the back are two signatures in the defendant's hand<lb/>writing, "M. Brennan, 12, Claverton Street, St. George's Street, London"—that is rubbed out and over it is Mr. Philip Callan's signa<lb/>ture in his own handwriting—it was on 9th june that I saw this tele<lb/>gram, and on that same day I applied for a summons—it was not granted then, the Magistrate required the production of the telegram, and on 16th June he granted the summons—up to the 9th June which I saw the telegram at the Post-office I did not know who was the author of the libel—the case was ultimately heard at Bow Street on 2nd July—on that occasion Mr. Callan said that he was anxious and eager to justify what he had said; he said he longed for the hour—his Counsel said it certainly, and I rather think lie said it himself, but I am not sure; I beg pardon, Ms solicitor said that—he himself undertook to admit that he sent the telegram, so as to save the necessity of proving it, and he made some observation, I really should not like positively to say what, but the impression on my mind was that he said something corroborating what his solicitor said—I have through my wife a connection with New Orleans, in America; in 1879 I had a large sum of money lying to my credit in a bank at New Orleans in the hands of our agent there, stated By himself to have been collected by him and held for us, quite private property—I am acquainted in the House of Commons with Mr. Puleston, the member for Devonport—I am happy to say that persons on the opposite sides of the House have personal friendships, and I hope it will be always so—Mr. Puleston is a Conservative, but a private friend—I made an application to Mr. Puleston with reference to this money of mine at New Orleans, because I was informed that the banking house of Puleston, Brown, and Co., which is an American banking house, had a branch in New Orleans, and I thought that what I required to have done could only be effectually done through a house having an actual branch there—Mr. Puleston has resided for a considerable part of his life in America, and has been a banker there; he is the head of the firm—my application to him was that I wanted to draw on this money; I wanted to lodge an order of ten or twenty days after sight, I forget which, on my agent, who is a member of our family—perhaps it is desirable that I should state that at New Orleans we had joint securities, in which the agent's share was charged to us for any indebtedness to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230119"/>
               <p>estate—the ultimate arrangement was this,. Mr. Puleston said, "You are under a mistake, our house has no branch there, but if you do not want a large sum we may manage it for you here readily; how much do you want?"—I said "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, pooh, pooh, never mind your sight order, or your securities; send us up, or "send me up, your own note of hand for what you want; our manager shall put it to your credit;, if you get the money when, it cornea due well and good; if it is inconvenient let me know"—that, was how he put it, and that was how it was done—this conversation, took place at, the end of May, 1878—about eight or ten days after I did as, Mr. Puleston said; I sent him my note—I have it here; he put it to my credit in his banking house, and it was paid immediately at maturity at my own private bank on 10th October, 1879—250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount of the bill—owing to a circumstance which I believe I can, explain there was only a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put to my credit—Mr. Puleston put the sum to my credit less the discount en 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a purely business transaction on my part, and I believe on his—we never exchanged a word about the Irish vote in Devonport in any shape or form, except that since these proceedings commenced he chaffed me, and told me he believed that there were not more than a dozen Irishmen there—I am perfectly ready to give any explanation on the various matters alleged in the plea—there is not a shadow of truth in the insinuation in the libel that there was any kind of understanding between myself and Mr. Puleston respect<lb/>ing the Devonport election; and until after these proceedings had com<lb/>menced, and I heard Mr. Puleston named at the police-court, I was-not even able to imagine who the Conservative member could be who was alluded to in the libel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not had similar business transactions with, other Conservative members—there may be other Conservative members, connected with the bank, I really do not recollect; I am certain. I had not last spring—I really cannot recollect that I ever had another bill transaction with a Conservative member; when I read in the libel that a Conservative member had supplied the money which carried my election in Louth on a corrupt understanding, I could not imagine to whom it referred, for there was no such person in existence—I have not said that I never had any other bill transaction with a Con<lb/>servative member, but I have said, and I say it now, that I really do not remember; I may have had, but I am very certain that I had none last spring—when I was asked at the police-court if there was any transaction to which I could possibly imagine this referred, I answered "No"—the thing was finished and done with on 10th October 12 months, and I was not iron that date to the present, nor ever before, under an obligation, of a penny or a penny's worth to Mr. Puleeton, consequently I could not imagine to whom it referred—I was in business in Dublin for two years since my election in 1874, and unless there was some Conservative con<lb/>nected with a banking house. I have not been under any pecuniary obligation to any Conservative M.P., or any Liberal-Conservative; of course, I have had bill transactions, with banking houses; not with any Liberal-Conservative in his private and individual capacity since 1874; I really cannot, recollect—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) I have not had a bill transac<lb/>tion with this gentleman; I think the gentleman's name should be men<lb/>tioned, Sir Joseph McKenna—I did not recognise him as a Conservative or a Tory—I practically ceased any connection with journalism in 1876—since</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230120"/>
               <p>that time I have not been connected with the Press Association—I have performed for Mr. Saunders, of the Central News, a personal friend of mine of many years' standing, certain duties from time to time, not altogether literary—I did not send any despatches in connection with the Louth election, or the Cork election, to the <hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal</hi> in any shape or form—I began my connection with journalism in 1853; I was connected with the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> in 1854 as a contributor, and in 1855 up to 1876 as either part or whole proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and several other publications, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Morning News</hi>—those are said to be National papers in Ireland—before I became connected with the press I was engaged as an artist on illustrated newspapers—while engaged on the Great Exhibition of 1853 in Dublin as artist for the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Expo<lb/>sitor.</hi> I made the acquaintance of some gentlemen, men of fortune, who knew my father when he was better off than he was then; they took me by the hand, and they told me if an opening ever occurred whereby capital could advance me, not to hesitate, and they would assist me, and they did; a share in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> newspaper became vacant soon after; I had, meantime, been contributing to some London journals, one directed by the late Charles Dickens, and others; and assisted by that capital, those friends have ever since been my best and dearest friends—in 1862 a company was unfortunately got up in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Morning News</hi>—I don't recollect that I wrote a letter inviting Mr. Callan to join; it is likely I did—this letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was a request to Mr. Callan to have his name put on the directors' list</hi>)—that company was wound up, I think, two or three years afterwards; they never succeeded in raising enough capital—I did not obtain pecuniary assistance from Mr. Callan soon after that—this letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "Might I ask you to put my acceptance through your bank for personal convenience and obligation to myself, which I will acknowledge as cash?") This is a matter which I am bound to explain; that application related to this transaction; the registration of the company occupied some time, the secretary informed me that Mr. Callan had undertaken to take some shares to a certain amount, and to forward the money at once; I wrote to him that owing to the legal delays which had supervened would he on the part of the proprietors let me send him my acceptance for the amount which he undertook to take in shares, and it would be allowed to him as cash in the formation of the company—Mr. Callan became member for Dundalk in 1868—I believe his father died a year or two before and left him some property in Louth county—I believe his family had been connected with Louth a long time—this letter is my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was marked "Private," and merely dated Thursday, and referred to a meeting to arrange matters, and to a temporary advame of</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on lodging the writer's acceptance in his</hi> (<hi rend="italic">defendant's</hi>) <hi rend="italic">bank</hi>)—at this time my news<lb/>papers circulated pretty extensively in Louth County and in Dundalk—most people think that the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> have considerable influence on the electoral body—the Government occasionally honour those papers by a little looking after; it is bound to do so—up to 1874 I did all I possibly could for Mr. Callan in every way—I spoke in public, and I believed it implicitly, in commendation of his manly and patriotic course in Parliamentary affairs. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1870 you induced Mr. Callan, did you not, to guarantee you in the National Bank for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the transaction referred to in</p>

               <p>the last letter, and which I took in the shape of a guarantee from him; I required some capital for a new business enterprise which we were then entering into; that guarantee I required for two or three years, but thought it better to have it renewable within shorter periods, and it was so renewed by Mr. Callan for shorter periods; in 1874 it was current, and circumstances having come to my knowledge which caused me to alter my opinion of Mr. Callan, I felt it would be unworthy of me to allow the guarantee to remain in force; I accordingly went to the bank and stated that I would pay it up, and I paid off the guarantee, tore it up, and threw it into my waste-paper basket—I think it had been renewed two or three times, once every 12 months, I thought it was oftener, he all the while being member for Dundalk; I believe he had great influence there, and in the county of Louth in 1873—he did not introduce me to the county; he was very anxious that I should stand for the county—I do not come from that county, but I do not need an introduction to any one of the 32 counties in Ireland—I went there in 1874 to oppose Mr. Chichester Fortescue, a Government official—I do not produce the letters from Mr. Callan to me in reference to the 1874 election—I have not brought any<lb/>thing but what I thought was germain to this inquiry—I never quarrelled with Mr. Callan until quite recently—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing; I state in this, "If any Government official seeks election in Louth, if I see no better man to be found I will enter the field"—Mr. Chichester Fortescue was then sitting for the county, and was about to contest it again—I never asked Mr. Callan to obtain a Government berth for a friend of mine from Mr. Fortescue—this is my telegram. <hi rend="italic">Produced and read</hi>; "Sept. 15, 1870. Vacant by death of Gerald Gray; I am working my best for Gallagher, of the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi>; will you, like a good fellow, help him, all you can? in the gift of Chi.") "Chi" is Chichester Fortescue—I will explain this; I was a member of the Corporation at the time; the district auctioneers in Dublin are quasi-municipal officers; the Cor<lb/>poration appoint some, they think they ought to appoint all, but the Government, or rather the Chief Secretary, has something to do with the appointment of one, independent of what the Corporation might have done; the Corporation were very anxious that Mr. Gallagher should get it, and accordingly that telegram was sent; I had quite forgotten it; that is my explanation of it; it only shows that when a man tries to be good-natured he had better have a good memory—the value of the office was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I cannot recollect authorizing a letter to be sent that same day asking that influence should be used for another person; I am sure I did not—in 1874 Mr. Callan contested Dundalk with Mr. Charles Russell; in 1880 be again contested Dundalk with Mr. Charles Russell—Mr. Cullan lrmt his election on the last occasion; it took place on 2nd April—before 1874 I had urged Mr. Callan to give up the corrupt borough of Dundalk, inasmuch as he had told me he had nearly beggared himself in. bribing the voters to get into Parliament; I urged him to go to his native county; that was before the election of 1874, and I said I would help him all I could—having been beaten for Dundalk in 1880 he immediately started for his native county; I then stated, "I declare before Heaven I will not sit with him if Mr. Kirk is sacrificed under these circumstances"—a good deal had happened before I said that, in the course of the election, and I am ready to state why I said it—I accused Mr. Callan publicly of treachery under these circumstances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230122"/>
               <p>and with this explanation; I made certain statements, and selected the most fair and straightforward and responsible mode I could invent for saying so, so that he should hold me accountable for wrong, and so that I might make the <hi rend="italic">amender</hi> to him if he denied them and if I was mistaken—what I said in the heat of an election meeting in defending my seat I can't say—subsequent to the election I wrote this letter to my committee, placing my application for the Chiltern Hundreds in their hands. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "If the high honor of a seat in Parliament were an object of great anxiety to me the result might well call for the expression of thanks and gratification on my part; nor would it be otherwise if the gentleman offered to me as a colleague, whatever his politics were, was a reputable public character. In the present case, however, by putting such a man as Mr. George Harley Kirk at the foot of the poll, and such a man at Mr. Philip Callan at the head of it, a section of the constituency has succeeded in bringing black disgrace on your gallant county. Before 24 hours a shout of shame will resound all over Ireland. Throughout the recent contest I flung aside all considerations for my own seat, and my every effort was directed to averting the foul and unmanly blow leveled at Mr. Kirk.") I wrote that letter, and I felt that the statement I had to make was one not to be lightly made, and that I ought to put it forward in such a way as would compel him to take notice of it if there were not grounds for it, and that I ought to sign my name like a man to the letter, and take the consequences—a petition was lodged against Mr. Callan's return for the county, not at my instigation—I assisted in the petition, and would have done anything to enable my friend, Mr. Kirk, to recover his seat—there were grounds for my doing so, which I am ready to state at any time—during the fortnight or three weeks, that elapsed after the election, a correspondence went on in the public press in which I took part, with Sir Joseph McKenna, in reference to a statement I had made—it is likely that I wrote on 3rd May accusing Mr. Cellan of "a guilty and secret intrigue to stab another Home Ruler in the back, if the Goverment would provide the funds," and for this reason, a fact having been brought to my knowledge which I felt it to be my duty to put candidly before Mr. Callan; I stated that he had ap<lb/>plied to a member of the Government secretly to give him the means of thrusting me out of Louth, and I characterised it then, as I do now, as a secret and guilty intrigue—I thought the honest way was to put it for<lb/>ward publicly in print in the <hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal</hi> with my name to it, think<lb/>ing that Mr. Callan would deny it if it were not true—that appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi> of 4th May—the libel of which I complain appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> on 8th May, anonymously—rumours of a dissolution began imme<lb/>diately the Ministry was formed, there had been rumours of it for three or four years; nobody seemed to attach great weight to them—I have not sees Mr. Puleston to-day, I should think he is about the Court, for I heard he was to be subpœnaed; I had intended to subpoena him myself—I told Mr. Waddy that Mr. Puleston was a friend of mine, I have not dined at his house—I met him at dinner at a mutual friend's house—I had not a slight acquaintance with him in 1879—if it was merely a friendship matter I should not have called on him, but being a business matter I did—I am proud to say that some of my dearest friends are Conservatives—this is the first I have heard of Mr. Puleston acting with the support of the Conservative party—we will not call that a purely business transaction—it</p>

               <p>was not impurely—it was in the House of Commons that I first named this loan matter to Mr. Puleston, I asked him to look at the securities and put two of them in his hands, they were titled certificates—they had not been mortgaged—he never said he would not touch them, he returned them to me, saying, "Pooh, pooh, send me your note of hand"—they were titled certificates of real estates in America, with joint names of the agents which was stated on the face of them—that was one of the interests, and he said the estate was charged for the indebtedness, and he had an in<lb/>terest in those estates, they were charged to us to cover any advance of money—he came to me a day after and said, "You are under a mistake; if it is not much you want I can manage it"—I knew the name of Mr. Puleston's firm Puleston and Brown—I knew after the bill was paid that the name on the back of it was not that of Mr. Puleston's firm, but not before—I never dreamt that when I accepted the bill—there was no signa<lb/>ture, I accepted it first and sent it to him—the name of the firm was not then on it, nor any other name; I put it in an envelope, addressed it, and sent it to him—I understood Puleston, Brown, and Co. to be bankers—it was a blank acceptance—I saw the name on the book some time after the bill was paid—I said I would lodge it with the agent in New Orleans for him to pay 10 or 12 days after sight if he would immediately put the amount to my credit here, I being responsible to him in the interval—that was a bill at four months—I discovered some time afterwards that that was not discounted by the firm—the bankers are the South-Western Banking Company, and were then—I did not see the bill for a good while afterwards—I saw Mr. Lever's name on the bill with astonishment—it seems that it was paid away to Mr. Lever and paid by him to Ham<lb/>mond and Co., and finally it seems to Tuttle, Banbury, and Co., but it was a perfect surprise to me—all the transactions were settled in October; there was a balance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my credit, and I drew it on 3rd or 4th January this year—as to any balance of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to my credit I thought I had drawn it all out—in the beginning of this year I asked Mr. Puleston for accommodation, but not of that kind, I asked him to do what he said he would do at a future time—I never applied to him in the House of Commons—either the last week in December or the first week in January I called his attention to an error on his part in the fact that the bill was drawn for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and only 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed by his manager to my credit—I wrote to him to say "There is that error, so you ought to have something to my credit at the end of the year. I may require a hundred or two more"—Mr. Puleston answered that from America, and said "All right, I will be at home at Christmas"—at the end of the year I wrote to remind him of what I had said, and by that time, in looking up my bank vouchers and bills, I found this bill, and, to my astonishment, on the back of it the names, which showed me that it had not been paid, as the manager's letter had led me to believe, to my credit, but it had been paid away to others—I wrote to Mr. Puleston, and he said that he should be soon home from America, he could not do it then, but at a future time he would; I connected that with the fact that my bill had been paid away to others, and then I determined that I never would apply again or avail myself of his kind offer, and I never did—I wrote to him in January, asking him for accommodation in the sense that I have now narrated—I wrote to tell him that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine owing to this misapprehension. I can give you the date when Mr. Puleston refused</p>

I did not know that the old bill had been done by Mr. Lever; it was paid away by the gentleman himself to Mr. Lever—I do not know that he went to Mr. Lever to discount it, or to get a second bill done, I never had a shadow of suspicion of it—I gave up my connection with the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi> practically in 1875 or 1876; they are in my brothers' hands—one brother is proprietor and the other has an office of responsibility in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Weekly News</hi>—those papers circulate among Irish electors in England—I have brought an action for libel before; I laid my damages at 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and got sixpence—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) must be a leaf or a couple of leaves taken out of the volume of the newspaper of 1858.

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Sale Street, Paddington—on 23rd Sep<lb/>tember the prisoner engaged a room at my house for the night—her husband and she slept there—the next morning they took it for a week—she brought a child on the Thursday after she had taken the room—I saw the child on the Saturday—it looked very ill—it had a placid look, it could not move—the prisoner was then downstairs—when she came up I <hi rend="italic">said.</hi> It ought to have beef-tea"—she said it would not take it, and that</p>

               <p>she fed it on milk and eggs—I gave it a biscuit—it could not hold it—it dropped and remained on its chest—later the same evening she came and said the child was dying—it was laid out in front of a large fire—I said, "What makes you think it is dying?"—she said, "Because its feet and legs are swollen"—I said, "Its legs are not larger than a child's ought to look; you had better call in the doctor"—it was lying on the carpet on a bundle of straw in front of the fire—she said it was not any use to call in the doctor—I said, "Oh yes, call in the doctor. Then you must have money to pay him"—Oh yes,"she said, "he has plenty of money at the yard"—I said, "If you are not able to pay you had better take the child to Dr. Waller in Sholdham Street"—she took the child, away and came back tipsy, and said, "The doctor says, like all other doctors, that it may live for a year, or may live six months, or a week, or it may die in an hour"—I said, "What medicine has he given you?"—she said, "Oh, he made a bottle of medicine up, but I was not going to pay eightpence for it"—she said she would take it to the doctor on the Sunday morning, but she never went out till the afternoon—I saw her about 11 o'clock on the Saturday evening—she was tipsy—she had some halfpence to get some beer—she said it was for her husband, but she. drank it herself—she was in my room, standing by the door—she took the child out about the middle of the day on Sunday, when she name home tipsy at night—she was tipsy every day from the Saturday till she was taken in charge—I heard the child cry several times—I heard her heating it and calling it, "Dear, darling Meggie," yet still beating it—the cry was a very unnatural sort of shriek—on the Monday morning I saw her with the child laid upon her shoulder, the way she always carried, it—she said she took it to the doctor and brought back some medicine—I never saw her feed the child—I am surd she never gave it any beef-tea—she said it would not take it on the Wednesday afternoon I saw a soldier come into the house with the prisoner—she was drunk—the child was lying on the little sideboard by the side of the fireplace—there is a recess on each side—the next time I saw the child it was dead—the fol<lb/>lowing day, Thursday, the prisoner was out in the afternoon—the child was locked up in the room for two hours—when she came back she was drunk and very excitable—about 6.30 I heard the child scream, that unnatural sort of noise, and I heard her talking to it—I never heard it after wards—about 7 o'clock I had to go on to the leads—I looked through the window and saw her dressing her hair—she went out—I saw her husband come in—when the door opened I saw the child—a caudle was spoke to the husband—he sent for a doctor—when the room was searched I found the biscuit, which I had given to the child on the Saturday, with some pieces of bread and bacon, and a lot of dry bread and things of that sort—the man slept there the whole time—he worked up to Sunday even<lb/>ing driving a 'bus, and he would go out about 10 o'clock and come back between 12 and 1 o'clock at night—he had no work on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 159, Edgware Road—I was called in by the police to 17, Sale Street, Padding ton, about 9 p.m. on Thursday, 30th September—I found the dead body of a female child about 14 months old—it was warm—it had apparently been dead about an hour—it was on top of a small cupboard or chest of drawers in a recess, and about four feet from the floor—it was laid out and covered with an apron—a bottle of medicine was subsequently handed to me by a police<lb/>man—it was a mixture that would be used for diarrhoea—it was about two-thirds full—when given from a dispensary, bottles are not always full—I saw the prisoner—she was intoxicated—by the Coroner's order I made <hi rend="italic">A post-mortem</hi> examination on 3rd October, assisted by Mr. Botley—the child's length was 2 ft. 3 in., its weight 8 lb. 1/2 oz.—a child's weight at its birth is about 7 lb. or 8 lb.—this child ought to have been heavier—its abdomen was green from commencing putrefaction—some lice were on the stomach, and some flea bites about the abdomen—the body generally was extremely emaciated; it seemed simply to be bones—there were do marks of external violence—there was no fat whatever under the skin—that would show that the child had been suffering for some time either from some disease of a wasting character, or from neglect as regards food: that it had been starved gradually—on opening the scalp it was blood-lese—on opening the skull, 2 oz. of serum escaped—the stomach was contracted and empty as regards nutrition, but there was about half a tablespoonful of grumous fluid usually found in all stomachs—the intes<lb/>tines were empty from beginning to end, except a small portion of mucous matter in the large bowel as it descends on the left side—I should expect to find traces of solid food if given within two days, and of fluid food within twenty-four hours—I found none whatever—the right lung was contracted and adherent to the chest wall—I should say the cause of death was exhaustion while the child was suffering from inflammation of the lungs and pleurisy, accelerated by neglect and starvation—I mean neglect both as to cleanliness and proper nourishment—there was not the slightest sign of anything in the bowels that would prevent the child taking food.</p>

I went to market, and bought 20lb. of these grapes; there were some white ones among them. I gave a sovereign for them. Nurserymen come. at the market and bring their goods to sell. If I could have got out on bail I might have produced the man I bought them of. I do my business openly, and do not thieve. I stand outside Forest Gate Station, and sell poultry, game, and fish to the public You can go and cut grapes for yourself at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound. I sold them openly, and if Mr. Spicer had asked me for one or two pounds I should have sold them to him. I do not see what there is to connect me with them. Nobody but themselves was there when the police matched the grapes. Instead of being taken before a Magistrate, was taken before one of Mr. Spicer's intimate friends and neighbours, and 'not allowed to say a word, and he said that instead of being prose<lb/>cuted I ought to be acquitted. The Magistrate said that it was for a Jury to decide, and I said I thought so too. As to matching grapes, people come from all parts of the country with them, and who can say that they have not been tampered with. I hope you will consider my ex<lb/>planation a truthful one, and that I shall leave this Court without a stain upon my character. A reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been offered; lots of people think the police do not get the reward; they do not get it directly, but they get it indirectly.</p>

On 5th October my wife served two men with beer—I was in a small room taking my tea, and had a full view of them—I saw them give her a coin—a third man then came, and they carried the pot to the door, and the prisoner drank out of it outside—they then left, and I went out at another door and followed them, and saw them divide some money—I have known the prisoner and the two others eight or ten years—I went back and found only one half-crown in the till, which I marked, and went out again and followed the other three men, but not the prisoner.</p>

I will leave the door open for you"—I heard no reply; I was in bed—I heard nothing more that night—next morning about 10 o'clock I went down to go into the yard, and when I got in the parlour I saw the deceased lying in front of the fireplace a little more towards the partition of the shop, on her stomach, and with her face on the floor and her legs straight out—she was dressed as she had been over night to the beet of my knowledge, and she was to all appearance asleep—I saw the prisoner on the stairs about 12.30; I think he stepped over the stair that I was cleaning; that was the first time I had seen him that morning—I could see the woman lying in the same position—he went up to her and said "Are you going to get up now?"—she made no reply—he went towards her, turned her over, and said "Good God, George, my wife is dead; what shall I do? I will go for a doctor immediately," and he went out apparently for that pur<lb/>pose; he returned in five or ten minutes and said that the doctor was out—I said "You had better go to the police-station"—he went out and came back with a constable—Dr. Tanner came in a few minutes and went upstairs—I saw him several times later in the day, and went to the undertaker's with him—he said on the road that he could not understand how it had happened, but he supposed she must have had a fit—that was after the doctor had been—I had lived there about six or seven weeks, but had never seen any indication of a fit about her—she was very possibly that night under the influence of drink, which was very often—prisoner has more than once told me not to allow my children to get any drink for her—I had not seen her on the Saturday before I saw her lying drunk.</p>

I am now employed at St. John's Wharf, Wapping, as colonial sampler—I went in May, 1880—I had been at Butler's wharf from 1875 to that time—the prisoner was employed there as delivery foreman in the Colonial department—soon after I joined the service the prisoner asked me on several occasions whether I could make up packages of goods for him to dispose of for our benefit; any stuff I was working in the Colonial department he would be able to dispose of if I got it ready for him—I did not take any property from Butler's wharf—these overtures were made almost up to the time I left Butler's wharf—I think between 12 months and two years before I left Butler's Wharf I met the prisoner on the stairs; he showed me one or two sovereigns and asked me whether I should like them—I said they would do very well—he said "You can very soon earn them;" I said "What about the other side of the question?"—the subject then dropped—up to the time I left the service I gave him no answer to these overtures, nor did I act upon them in any way—after I had gone to St. John's Wharf the prisoner came over to the wharf on one occasion—it was about three miles from Butler's Wharf—he came about the time we were closing, and and it would be early in June, I should think—he was waiting for me outside the wharf—he asked me if I could spare a few minutes, and we walked down Wapping Wall together—he asked me what we were working on at St. John's Wharf—I told him we were doing coffee—he asked me if I would consent to make up some packages to get rid of from St. John's Wharf—I said "No"—I suppose we were together five minutes—the next time I saw him was in Bermondsey Street—my brother-in-law had gone to Croydon in a trap, and I went over there to meet him, when business was over—I walked along the road, and on the road I met the prisoner; it was some time before August—he asked me what we were working on, I told him we were still working on coffee, and he asked me whether I would consent to make up some packages—I then said to him, "Broughton, you have been a long time punching this into me; to what extent would you wish me to go in this matter? do you want to go to 1, 2, 3, 6 or 12 bags?" he said, "Use your own discretion, creep as you go," or "creep and go," I cannot exactly say; he asked me then whether I consented to do it, and I said"No;" he then said if I would do so he was going away in the course of two or three weeks, and if I arranged to do it we might both go away together—I think the subject dropped then—he came over to my house one Sunday after that; I was in the back garden and did not see him—he made four suggestions to me to rob St. John's Wharf—I stated at the police-court that he had made 30 to 40 suggestions to rob Butler's Wharf—I do not wish to correct that—on the 18th August my wife gave me this letter marked "A"—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—I then communicated with the manager of St. John's Wharf. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "18-8-80. Friend Sones,—As I have not seen you as promised, I thought of taking a week's holiday next week, and should like something to back it up with Let me know if there is any prospect this week.—Yours truly, W. B.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He first tempted me to rob soon after I joined the service at Butler's Wharf in 1885—I cannot give you any date in 1875 when he asked me to rob my masters—I refused to do so—I left Butler's Wharf in May this year—his suggestions continued through 1877, 1878,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230165"/>
               <p>and 1879; I did not tell my master or the foreman of the firm—I was always unwilling, but still he kept on—we were friendly as regards business at the wharf—there were some sweepings sold at St. John's Wharf; I believe it was the custom to sell sweepings, and that they were properly sold—I never said to him when he suggested to me to rob St. John's Wharf that I had got some sweepings mat I was getting together, and that I could lot him have them—there was never any con<lb/>versation between us but once—the first time the sweepings were ever mentioned to me was when Mr. Lafone, of Butler's Wharf, took the prosecution up; he sent for me at St. John's Wharf, and the first person I met standing on the quay was the prisoner, and he asked me before I went up to Mr. Lafone whether I would say it was sweepings he wanted me to get from St. John's Wharf in answer to that letter—in June or July he came to St. John's Wharf one afternoon when Butler's Wharf closed early—he walked from St. John's Wharf to Wapping Station—there was nobody else with us—on 5th August I met him in Ber<lb/>mondsey Street; I did not say then that I had been putting together about a ton of coffee sweepings, and there would be about ten bags; I swear that; that note did not relate to such sweepings—from 1875 to 1880 I never mentioned these suggestions to my employers or anybody else in authority in the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not keep a diary, and I did not put down when these suggestions were made—I was not aware when he made those suggestions that he was making them to any one else; I thought I was the only person—Mr. Lafone entered the service at Butler's Wharf about two years ago I believe; since he has been there there have been no sales of sweepings; I think previous to that time a certain amount was sold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am colonial sampler at Butler's Wharf—I came there in May, 1879—my duties are to class colonial produce—the goods are sent up in the warehouse, and I sort them according to what kind of goods they are—if they are bags, such as tobacco or pepper or cloves, we stab them with an iron; if they are cases of ginger and so on, we turn them out on the floor and <hi rend="italic">bulk</hi> them; they are then weighed, put into stock, and I have nothing more to do with them—when they are on the floor in bulk they are all cut open to draw samples from—there could be stuff put on one side—even if anybody felt disposed to get rid of some, it would be running a risk to do so—there must be delivery orders passed before he can deliver them—some few months after I went to Butler's Wharf the prisoner on one occasion held out a handful of coffee and asked if I could manage a half</p>

               <p>hundredweight of that, and if I would he knew a party' who Would buy it—he said "I wish I was the other side of you, old man, we might make a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> or two"—I have passed it off and left him—I do not know that I have made any reply—in August last we had a very good parcel of white pepper working on the top floor at the time, and he asked me if I could let him have a bag of that, and I said "Yes, you can have a bag"—he said "All right, see <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Leader;" I said "No, that is for you to do"—he said "All right, I will see him"—some months after I was down stairs, at the foot of the C staircase; I am all over the building, from the top to the bottom; I saw <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Leader at the bottom of the stairs—while there the prisoner came along, and he said to <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Leader "Our friend has got a bag of white pepper for us;" Leader said "All right, show me where it is," and I showed him the bag of pepper, and left him there—the bag remained there for a couple or three days—it was then a parcel of pepper not finished, which was left for some more to come from the ship—the bag of pepper was put to its parcel, and at the end of the week I went away and left the matter in the hands of Bradley—the bag was resting against the wall, and I said "There is a bag for you"—I came back from my holiday in the beginning of September—the parcel of pepper was weighed, and put into stock—I told Mr. Webb, the manager, all that took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In May, 1879, the prisoner suggested to me to rob my master—he looked upon me as a perfectly honest man at that time, I believe—I may have said "Yes, all right," and so on—I cannot tell what replies I made—he made the suggestion to me about a dozen times, or more—I believer I mentioned before the Magistrate about his holding out a handful of coffee to me—I cannot swear—I talked the matter over with Sones once—I said "I am in a fog here; I have got one each side of me"—he said "What is that?" and I said "Well, perhaps you know as much as I do myself; perhaps when I am gone they will tackle you"—the prisoner was one side and Leader the other side—I have not accused Leader at all—the prisoner suggested to Leader to get rid of the stuff—I should be very sorry to say that Leader was dishonest too—Leader agreed—I know what stealing means—I was charged with stealing a piece of chain from the West India Dock Company about two years ago last Christmas—I was tried at the Surrey Sessions and honourably acquitted—I have a letter from the West India Dock Company's police saying they believed I was innocent—the prisoner incited me to steal, and Leader too—I cannot say why I was discharged from St. John's Wharf—Mr. Hall, I believe, can vindicate my character, and the proprietors will give me a good character.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not speak to Leader about the pepper after the interview I have related—I have no means of ascertaining Whether Leader was testing the honesty of the prisoner or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 91, Old Out Road, Bennondsey—I was employed at the prosecutors' during last August as delivery foreman—the goods in my department in C warehouse came under my notice before they left the wharf—in August I met the prisoner on the stairs, and he said "Can you do with a bag of pepper"—I said "Oh yes," attaching no importance to it—I was very busy at the time with my deliveries and passed on—five or ten minutes afterwards I was passing along the quay when I saw the prisoner and Moad at the bottom of the staircase; he said as near as I can remember, "Our friend has a bag of pepper"—I</p>
