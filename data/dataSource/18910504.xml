I am a clerk in the Confidential Inquiry office, General Post Office—the prisoner was employed as a second-class sorter for some months—on 2nd April, about 10.30, he was brought to me—I produced ninety-three letters and twelve postcards which had been duly stamped, and were going through the post—I said, "You were seen this morning with your hat and coat on in the Inland branch; you were watched and seen to take bundles of letters and place them in your pockets; you were afterwards searched by a constable, and these letters were found on you; what have you to say?"—he said, "I was going to take them downstairs into the kitchen "—I said, "What were you going to do with them?"—he said, "I was going to look over them; I was going to open one or two of them to see the contents; I wanted to see if there was anything of value in them; I was going to steal some of them.

At one in the morning of 7th April I was called to this house; I went up to the back bedroom, first floor, and there saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner said, "I will murder him"—I took him to the station—this knife was handed to me by Mrs. Ward.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector J</hi>). On the morning of 7th April, about one, the prisoner was brought to the station—on my entering the charge, he said, "I am sorry he is not dead and I was going to be hung to<lb/>morrow for it"—I cautioned him, when he continued, addressing the injured man, "You ain't got so much as I thought you had, I will settle you; you are twenty years younger than me; you struck me and challenged me to fight"—after the prosecutor was taken to the infirmary the prisoner said to Mrs. Ward, "If I get two years for it I will give him and you worse than he has got this time; I will use a b----belt for both of you, I am sorry his head is not off his shoulders; this is only a start on him; if I get two years I will finish him when I come out; I said I would murder him, I will murder your son, God blind me I will murder the lot of you"—he was very excited, and had evidently been drinking, but I should say he was not drunk; I sent for the divisional surgeon, and the prosecutor's wounds were dressed at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (M.D.) I am divisional surgeon to the J Division of Police at Hackney—about half-past one in the morning of 7th April I was called to Victoria Park Station, where I saw the prosecutor; he was suffering from wounds, one incised wound on the right side of the neck three and a half inches long, extending half an inch from the jaw, and a quarter of an inch deep; another incised wound two inches long, half an inch deep, extending across the neck below the preceding one; a super<lb/>ficial incised wound one inch long and two and a half inches above the right ear—on the left side of the head an incised wound of the scalp half an inch from the fore part of the left ear, and upwards and backwards three inches; the hemorrhage from this was considerable, a small artery being divided; another incised wound two and a quarter inches above the left eyebrow, extending backwards two inches; another one running into that half an inch backwards and upwards; the two middle fingers of the right hand and one on the left were cut across—I stitched the wounds and sent him to the infirmary; they were caused by such a knife as this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant, of Chicago, and am staying at the Hotel Metropole—on 24th April I went to the British Museum, and was looking at the sculpture, and saw the prisoner Green there, who gave his name as McEvoy, an American gentleman—we engaged in conversation; he said, "I have been here before, but did not see much of London; I will take you to the nicest restaurant in London, the Holborn"—we had some refreshment there, and made an arrangement to meet there next day—next day, at eleven o'clock, I met Green at the Holborn, and he took me to Hyde Park, and showed me the Albert Memorial and Kensington Palace; we then. went to a restaurant about two o'clock, and sat down at a table, and Dunn came in and sat at the same table and said, "You are American gentlemen?"—I said, "Yes"—he and Green did not seem to know each other—Dunn's language sounded like broken Irish—he said, "Won't you have a drink with me?"—I said I did not care for anything; but he insisted, and the waiter brought something—I said to Green, "This man is under the influence of liquor"—Dunn produced a slip of paper and said he had a lot of money with him, and he had £1,700 due at the Bank of England—I suggested to Green that he had better show the gentleman to his hotel—he produced what looked like Bank of England notes; we put him into a cab to go to his hotel, but he insisted on going with us—we went to the Underground Railway Station, and told him when he got out to go to his hotel, but he would not have that, he said, "I will go as soon as I have had my dinner"—he produced this slip of</p>

               <p>a newspaper, and said that it referred to him—we went to a restaurant, and he insisted on paying for the dinner, as he had plenty of money—I said, "No," and put my hand in my pocket and took out some notes—Green said, "You do not sup<lb/>pose we travel without money?" and produced a draft for £830; he also had plenty of money—Dunn said, "No, I will pay for the dinner," which he did, and Green went out for five or six minutes, and came back and said, "The music is full, you will have to go there to-morrow," and said he would take us where we could have some oysters—we went to several places and had refreshment, and to a bakery and had some coffee, and Dunn said to Green, "You know me very well; would you be afraid to trust me with £100, and go out at the door and get a cigar in company with this gentleman?" referring to me—Green looked at me and said, "No," and passed to Dunn what appeared to be £100 in Bank of England notes—Dunn and I went outside to a cigar store, and Dunn said, "He is not afraid to trust us"—I said, "No, he is an American gentle<lb/>man; I met him yesterday at the British Museum"—Dunn bought a cigar, and we went back and gave Green his money and a cigar, and then Dunn said, "Would you be afraid to trust me with £100, and go out with this gentleman?" Green—I said, "I have not got £100, but I am not afraid to trust you with £100," and I took my American notes, my gold watch and chain, five £5 Bank of England notes, forty-five dollars, and a diamond masonic locket, and said, "There is £100 and more," and handed them to Dunn, who went in the name of Moran—he put them in his pocket, and he and Green went out at the door; they were hardly out of my sight when the officer Travers called me out, and I found the three prisoners in the hands of the police—I had not seen Holborough before—I went with them to the station, where they were searched, and I identified the whole of my property (<hi rend="italic">The newspaper extract stated that</hi> £40,000 <hi rend="italic">had been bequeathed to Michael J.

I am the wife of James Crane, a grocer, of Sparrow Hill, Loughborough—my maiden name was Harvey—I was a sister of the late Ann Gimson, who was married to the prisoner on 10th April, 1851, in my presence—she was then a widow named Dewberry—they lived for 19 years at Loughborough, and there were five children of the marriage, and then in 1870 the prisoner went to America—after that my sister worked for her living as a dressmaker and taking lodgers—the prisoner sent her something for about two years; I don't know what; she had one daughter at home, and the boys were apprenticed, one was at Loughborough, and one at Leicester, and one at school—in 1879 the prisoner came to England, and was with his wife a few weeks; I saw him—he sent money to her down to 1872, and he ceased doing so after that</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 290, Dalston Lane, Hackney—I was born at Nottingham—about twenty-three years ago, I think, I went to America; I never naturalised there—I first met the prisoner in 1871, in New Brunswick, New Jersey—he told me he had been married, and had divorced his wife—I was married to him at Trenton, New Jersey, on 19th February, 1872, at the house of the Minister of the First Baptist Church, Trenton, where the prisoner was in the habit of attending—the Minister gave him this certificate, and he handed it to me at the time—a lady was present, and my husband asked if she should sign the certificate, and the Minister said, "I have signed it, that is sufficient," and so there is no witness's name—I lived with the prisoner till 24th January last—on 1st May, 1881, we arrived back in England—I knew nothing of his wife in Loughborough—in 1886 I took divorce proceedings against him, because he seduced my servant girl, and I found he was keeping a woman—I filed my petition—he answered it—he never denied that a valid marriage had taken place between us at Trenton—I proceeded with the divorce till the prisoner wrote me some letters, and got a friend to intercede on his behalf to get me back, because he said if I went on with the proceedings he should go back to America, and not face it—these are some of the letters I received after the pro<lb/>ceedings had commenced; he wrote more, but he burnt them when I returned to him. (<hi rend="italic">One letter addressed her as his dear wife, and said he would call the next evening, and she must be ready to come home with him as his wife, and that she ought to have more confidence and trust in one she had sworn to love</hi>)—I lived with him again till he left me on 24th January this year—I have by him two sons living and two children who have died—for a short time after he left me he provided me with half means—I first learnt on 11th April this year that his wife had not been divorced; I then went down to Loughborough and made inquiries, having heard some<lb/>thing—I then took these proceedings—I have been present and seen other marriages take place in America in the same way as mine; I cannot say if witnesses have signed in other cases—I have had a brother married.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> 11th April this year was not the first time I knew the prisoner was a married man when he went through the ceremony with me; I knew he was married when I married him, but I believed he was divorced—I did not know that his wife was living, and that there had been no divorce—I knew Louis Wright Atkin in New Brunswick through my husband—he never told me that I was going to marry a man who was married and not divorced, and that I should be committing bigamy—he is here now, I know—I went to work at the Norfolk and New Brunswick Hosiery Company, where also the prisoner and Atkin were employed—the prisoner was manager—I did not live with the prisoner before I married him—he professed it was a marriage of love—I heard of the death of his wife, from whom he said he was divorced, in 1884; he told me Edwin's mother was dead; he never called her his wife—Edwin was one of his sons, I did not know</p>

I shall have to caution you, that whatever you say I shall take down and give in evidence,"—he replied in a very excited manner, "Yes, like an Englishman, like an Englishman, I am an Englishman, I shot like an Englishman; it was a good job I had it with me"—I then proceeded to Bartholomew's Hospital, and there saw the body of the deceased—I went back to the station and said to the prisoner, "The poor fellow is dead"—he replied, "Serve him right, I am glad of it"—I then formally charged him with murder—before reading the charge over I again cautioned him, and he made this statement which I took down.

I said to the man, 'All right, don't take any notice of him, I will pay for what I have had and what he has had.' I and the stallkeeper went into the public-house, the deceased followed. I paid for three glasses of ale. The oyster man said something about the two oysters, and then the row began.

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, said</hi>: I was asked to open the drawer, and I said I would try, and I fetched the hammer for that purpose, but an iron bar was wedged in so tight that I could not open it. I put the hammer on the counter, and went on working. I felt all of a shake. I went downstairs and got a pail of water, and cleaned the windows, which I could hardly get up to do. I took half a quartern glass of rum, and told the child to tell her father, because I was so bad. The child came round whore I was, and looked into the parlour; I then took up the hammer and hit her on the head; I think it was once or twice. When I hit her she fell headlong into the parlour. When I had done it, I was all of a shake and tremble. I then put on my coat and shut the door, but I did not lock it. The girl went headlong into the parlour, and she must have fell up against the table, which must have made the other bruises. I had no animosity against the child, and I had always treated her with the greatest respect. After I had done it I walked home. I think I got the revolver down Tottenham Court Road on the Saturday, and when I got home on the Sunday I took it out of my drawer and put it in my pocket.</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine, a Master in Surgery, and Gold Medallist of the University of Edinburgh—on 27th March I was called up about 1.15 a.m. by Kightley, who said his mother was dying—I went with him to 17, Narrow Street, where I saw Mrs. Lippy lying on a bed covered with blood, and her head and face much disfigured; a great deal of blood was issuing from her mouth and ears—she seemed dazed and stupid; she did not seem to know anything about her position—I could get nothing from her; I saw it was a case of hæmorrhage, and went away to get remedies, and met the police as I came back; I applied the remedies and partially stopped the bleeding, and then I went with the police to King David Lane Station about a quarter to two or two; I returned to the woman and examined her more carefully, and found the perpendicular part of the frontal bone was fractured—on pressing my finger on the fracture I found there was increased effusion of blood from the mouth and nose, and I then knew there was communication between the base of the skull and the throat—there were several more injuries, of which I did not take special cog<lb/>nisance—the injury I have described would be sufficient to account for the bleeding from the ears—I did not examine the lower part of her body, as her dress was on, and it would have been unsafe—at the time I thought she was in an extremely dangerous condition, because these fractures are generally fatal—I think the kicking must have taken place later than Mrs. Lippy described, because I saw her at one o'clock, and the injuries appeared to be more recent than if done at ten or eleven—a kick on the forehead would cause the injury—I have attended her since; I think she will recover, but I cannot speak positively, because the remote results of brain injuries are so uncertain—I could not smell any liquor about her; she was stupid and dazed, but the injury to the head was sufficient to account for that, and I cannot say what it was due to—the prisoner appeared to be sober—as he was going to the station I heard him say he hoped he might hang for her—these cases used to be regarded as fatal, but lately there have been one or two recoveries from them—the injury might have been caused by a fall from a height on to a projecting point like a cobble stone, or by the person being lifted up and <hi rend="italic">banged</hi> down, but not by an ordinary fall.</p>

On 27th March Mr. Wright sent a plain clothes constable for me, and I went to 17, Narrow Street, where I saw Mrs. Lippy bleeding from the mouth; her face was very much bruised and disfigured—the prisoner was there—I asked her how she received her injuries; she said, "My husband kicked me"—I asked the prisoner whether he denied kicking her; he said, "No, I did it"—he appeared to be sober; he was excited—I asked Mrs. Lippy if she would charge him;</p>

K. 234—I delivered a case in London Wall, and then went down Aldermanbury Avenue, and asked a boy named Cox, who I saw in the street, to look after my horse, about 11.45—these two cases were then in the van—I returned in about two hours, and found Cox there, eating bread and cheese—I noticed that the van was different, counted the cases, and missed two—I reported the matter at Moor Lane Police-station.</p>

"—I said, "It may be evidence against you"—he said, "I only want to speak the truth; I bought them of a man named Edwards, who hired the van from Mr. Fisher in York Mews, who has a shed in the mews"—I said, "Did you know they were stolen?"—he said, "No, I have done business with him about eighteen months, and have never had anything wrong before "—I then went with Lythel and Moody to York Road and spoke to Mr. Fisher—I afterwards saw three men coming down York Road—the prisoner Edwards was one—I said, "Which of you gentle-men is named Edwards?"—none of them owned to the name—I called to Fisher, and said, "Who hired the van of you to-day?"—he pointed to Edwards—I said, "This is the man you know by the name of Edwards?"—he said, "Yes"—Edwards denied it—I left him in charge of Lythel and Moody—Edwards lives in Britannia Street, City Road—I know 49, Baring Street, New North Road—there was no appearance of a wholesale paper dealer and mill agent being carried on there.</p>

               <p>bank, the National Provincial, on 25th November, 1887, and I let him have £60 or £70 to make up £100—he gave me a £100 promissory note, with Bloore's and his wife's and his own name on it—he then told me his wife had the building lease or building agreement—when I had advanced him the £30 or £40 he had told me nothing about his wife, she had not been mentioned till it came to the larger amount—I think this is the promissory note. (<hi rend="italic">This was a joint and several promise to pay at three months, signed by G. H. Wyatt, Elizabeth Wyatt, and William Bloore</hi>)—these are notes the manager of the bank gave me of the times I drew out the different moneys—the prisoner had made no statement to me at this time as to his being an undischarged bankrupt; I should not have let him have the money if I had known that—on December 0th, 1887, he had £100 from me—I took from him a charge from his wife on her property; this a copy of it; it is dated 3rd December, 1887; it is a charge on her property in respect of £100, and any further sums that might be advanced by me—apparently by this document I knew on 3rd December that it was the wife's property, and that it was upon that security I was advancing my money—apparently by the documents the promissory note was given on 6th December, instead of in November, when I had already got the security from his wife—the charge itself I took to the bank manager and then to my solicitor, who has it now, I understand—from that date, whatever sums I advanced I advanced on the security of the charge—I advanced altogether £450, but with interest and principal, and the costs of two actions against Wyatt and his wife it comes to over £500—I sued Mr. and Mrs. Wyatt, and got judgment against them—I sued her separately in respect of her separate estate—I made this affidavit under order 14, and got judgment—I said in the affidavit that I sued her on a joint and several promissory note given me for the advance of £450, and that she was possessed of certain hereditaments at St. Margaret's, and that she had charged that on 3rd December, 1887, in my favour for the repayment of certain sums and interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner paid me the smaller amounts two or three times—£30 or £40, part of the £450, he borrowed before 25th November, and did not repay—those £30 or £40 were included in the £100, for which I took the joint and several promissory note—I swore in my information before the Magistrate that by April, 1888, the bankrupt had had £450, and that he subsequently gave me two joint and several promissory notes, one for £50, dated 7th April, 1888, and one for £400, dated 21st June, 1888—it did not come clearly to my mind at the time—I think that what I was speaking of as taking place in 1888 really took place in December, 1887—I was mistaken as to the date—I think the prisoner told me on the first occasion where the buildings were, which he wanted money to complete, and that they were mortgaged, and that he could get no further advance—I did not ask to see the mortgages, May and may had got them, who were financing him—I did not see May and May before I made the advance—I did not see them before he gave me the charge—he did not tell me the property belonged to his wife, who was building these houses when he first commenced to borrow money, nor did Bloore tell me—he was an acquaintance of mine; I don't think he knew, he said he did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lower Derby Road, "Watford, and am a traveller for the Patent Wood Company, Limited—about July, 1889, I was introduced to the prisoner, as a builder, by Mr. Shrieve, a tea mer<lb/>chant—the prisoner said he should soon be wanting mouldings and doors and timber, I forget exactly what it was—he said he was building at Twickenham—a few days afterwards he gave an order for mouldings and doors to the amount of £10; they were sent to Twickenham—nothing was said then about any person having an interest in the buildings except myself—afterwards I went to Twickenham and saw the buildings, and he introduced me to Mrs. Wyatt, and said he would go over the shops with me, and then he would let me have another order; and when we were in the shops he said his wife's money was invested in these shops; I don't know whether he said the shops were in his wife's name or not—he gave another order for about £20 worth of" goods, which he had—I was dealing with him, so far as I knew; he never said anything as to trusting his wife, not a word, nor as to his being an undischarged bankrupt; if I had known he was I should not have let him have the goods—I don't think I learnt that till the beginning of 1890, about January or February—I spoke to him from time to time with regard to payment for these goods; he promised time after time that he would pay for them; promised to send a part of the money, and so on—he sent me two or three letters, and wrote to the company giving reasons for not paying, I believe, but I cannot say what the reasons were—when I spoke to him about payment he merely said he could not get finished, and something about advances, I think; I forget now what was said—he never suggested that I had given credit to his wife.

Wyatt—he told me when I went over the shops that they were in his wife's name because her money was invested in them—he did say they were in her name—I was not before the Registrar when she was examined—I don't know whether she swore that the goods were obtained in her name, or that she authorised her husband to obtain them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as Wright and Harrington, umbrella furnishers, at Birmingham—on 1st April, 1890, we entered into an arrangement with Goatly—the bulk of the agreement was put down on paper; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two letters; they were made out about the same date, one for ourselves to sign, and the other for Goatly to sign. (<hi rend="italic">One of these stated that Goatly teas to enter the prosecutor's service as an agent, at 2 1/2 per cent, commission; the other teas from the witness accepting the terms; three months' notice to be given on either side, the agreement to continue in force for five years</hi>)—the sole re<lb/>muneration was 2 1/2 per cent, on the sales; he was afterwards allowed to act as agent for two other manufacturers, but not in umbrella furnishing, only umbrella sticks and ribs—Goatly introduced Slade to me, and he was ultimately engaged to assist Goatly in the London warehouse, but he was in our employment; we paid his salary—Goatly had no power to endorse cheques; he had to send them to us in course of post—hard cash we allowed him to retain and pay Slade's wages, fifteen shillings a week, and his petty expenses, and the boy's wages, and to account every month, but he had to advise us every night of money received—he had a duplicate day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this shows the name of the cus<lb/>tomer, and the goods sold, so that if the thing was regularly carried out we should have a duplicate set of books at Birmingham—on 1st April I sent up a considerable stock to start Goatly with, and we were constantly receiving requests from him for more goods—I have about a dozen letters, as specimens—these are some of them. (<hi rend="italic">These requested more stock to be sent, as he must be fully prepared to execute certain commissions</hi>)—these letters are principally in answer to charges made by us, copies of which we have—Goatly took stock on 31st December, and I came up and took stock about 20th March, unknown to Goatly or Slade—I had with me the quantity of goods that had been dispatched, showing what ought to be in stock, and the result of my examination was that there was a very large deficiency—we have a book at Birmingham called the Dispatch-book, in which are entered all goods dispatched for London, and sale-sheets showing the exact amount and description of the goods sold; and by making a calculation between the two we could ascertain exactly what we ought to have in stock—acting upon that basis I found a very large deficiency of stock, in grosses and dozens, amounting to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040043"/>
               <p>about £500—I had separate interviews with Goatly and Slade—I first asked Slade to give me an explanation of the large quantity of stock which was deficient—he said he did not know at all what I was talking about, and would throw no light on the matter—Goatly was out then; when he came in I said, "I want you to give me an explanation of this large quantity of stock which is deficient"—he said, "I don't know what you are talking about, Mr. Wright; you must be mad"—I said, "Do you mean to say that you know nothing of large quantities of our goods being sold round the trade at ridiculously low prices?"—he said, "I have heard it"—I said, "Then why on earth did not you tell us about this, when we have written you all these letters, asking for an explanation of deficiencies, and telegraphed to you to come to Birmingham and give us information where our stock is going"—he said, "I did not like to worry you, Mr. Wright"—I said, "Where are Osborne's stock?"—he took me across the load to an outside warehouse, and drew open a drawer, and said, "Here they are"—I glanced at them, and perceived that they were all right—when He took over the agency there were ten dozen of those sticks brought there by my orders; Goatly has never returned me any portion of them as having been sold; they are silver plated—just before we took criminal proceedings I examined the quantity of sticks in that drawer, and found only thirty-five; I cannot find any trace of any of the others in any of our books—Goatly has never accounted to me in any shape or form or the missing sticks; they are peculiar, they are made in America both handles and sticks; we are the sole dealers in them for the whole of the United Kingdom—I dismissed Goatly and Slade the following day, and took possession of the warehouse and its contents—it was our warehouse—we paid the rent, they had nothing to do with that—I knew nothing about the Rudmans until I made inquiries of the police—prior to seeing Goatly on 20th March, I had received anonymous communications about him, which "brought me up to London—I communicated with the police, and in the result the four prisoners were given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. My previous agent was Corder, he stayed up to 1st April, 1890, when I engaged Goatly—this document, containing the terms of the hiring, has not been executed by Goatly; I drew it up, and brought it to London, but it was not signed, as in consequence of what I heard in reference to Goatly I refused to sign it—I called on Mr. Cuzner, a stickmaker, who was also represented by Goatly—he informed me that Goatly was trading in his own name, and selling sticks; I came straight to the office and charged Goatly with carrying on business of his own, which he denied—I said, "I am very sorry, Goatly, that before you have been our representative a month or two you should break faith with us, because I have found that it is true"—he then admitted it—I said I could not allow it—he said it should be forthwith abandoned, but I did not require him to sign the agreement, because he had broken faith with us, and it was for five years—we did not take stock when he went in on the 1st April, and I have no means of knowing the amount of stock which he took over from Order—it would take us two or three days to remove the stock—I cannot give the jury any idea of the amount of stock he took over—the ferrules are made up in small packages, and they are packed in pigeon-holes about two feet deep—whether the pigeon-holes are entirely filled depends on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040044"/>
               <p>the quantity of stock—they might not be entirely full, because each hole is kept for a different size—we pack from back to front, and if a person did not look behind the front tier he could not see if the back tier had gone—we have about one hundred pigeon-holes—our stock consists of ferrules and umbrella-handles, which were in boxes with sliding lids—the boxes are also placed in pigeon-holes, and unless the lid is taken off it might be empty without a person knowing it—they were also packed from back to front—we have some tip-caps in stock; they are not miss<lb/>ing—we took over Osborne's sticks with his other stock—Corder was not agent for Osborne at the time he was agent for us—when we took stock on April 1st we made our calculation at Bir<lb/>mingham, but Goatly took stock at Christmas—I looked at our books to see what stock had been forwarded to Goatly, between April 1st and December 31st, and then compared the amount of sales between the same dates, without taking any account at all of the stock on the premises on April 1st; what that was I do not know—the total number of ferrules consigned between April 1st and December 31st was about 1,735 gross, but I can give you the figures of which that amount is composed—I took stock again about April 1st, 1891, and there was a deficiency of 811 gross—I have no record of the total number—I have no record of the sales between 1st January and 30th March; I only have the result—I cannot remember making any inquiry about Goatly's cha<lb/>racter, but I feel certain we did—when I dismissed him on 21st March, I do not remember saying, "You have been disposing of these goods to various persons, and we nave every proof "—my solicitor was with me; he did not, I believe, say so—I do not believe I said then, "We shall apply for warrants for your arrest," but I certainly told him se afterwards—I do not remember his saying, "I heard some time since that there were a few goods offered for sale in the market at lower prices, and endeavoured to trace where they came from, or whether I was told so by others—I inquired of Mr. Mellish, Mr. Harlow, and several others—I employed Mozer, a private inquiry agent, and went with him on Monday, March 23rd, to our office—Goatly had been discharged on the Saturday, and I do not remember seeing him that day—he did not say, "I know nothing of the missing stock; we are anxious that the matter should be cleared up, as our reputation is of greater value than the missing stock"—my brother is not here—I applied for warrants, but they were not granted—I was told to give them in custody, but did not do so till April 6th—I have been served with a writ for slander, but I have never opened it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined,</hi> On March 21st, when I made the discovery, I im<lb/>mediately communicated with my solicitor, and Mozer was employed—I went to Guildhall on 21st March and swore an information against the four prisoners, and applied at once to the Alderman for warrants—I then communicated with the City Police, and Mr. Davidson, from the Old Jewry, was appointed to conduct the case—he thought some inquiries were necessary—Messrs. Michael Abrahams and Co.'s name is on the writ—I have heard no more of it—when I came up on 20th March I brought up certain papers by which I could check the stock, and the total consignment of stock was brought up after<lb/>wards—I had extracts from the books showing the total return of sales by Goatly, and arrived at the result I have told you—I was very</p>

               <p>careful, but we can never tell the full extent of our loss, because we did not know the full amount of Corder's stock, but I have given in over and above the amount of it—I only go upon the amount of stock sent up—if Corder's stock is there, so much the better for us, but it does not lessen the deficiency.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella and walking-stick manufacturer, of 137, St. John's Road, Hoxton—I kept a shop a month before Christmas, but do not now—about October, 1890, I saw Edward Rudman at my shop, Pimlico Walk, Hoxton—he brought about half a dozen samples of metal handles similar to these, and said they were his own—I did not buy any—he did not give me his address—he came again three or four days afterwards with samples of handles, but I did not purchase any; and again a few days after that—I told him I was buying them cheaper somewhere else—he then called with ferrules done up in packets similar to these—there was no label on the first lot—I purchased twenty-three gross at 4s. a gross, and took this invoice. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 19.11; 23 <hi rend="italic">gross assorted ferrules, at</hi> 4s., £4 11s. 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, discount</hi>)—I saw him write that and receipt it, "G. White and Co., 3, Morland Street, Goswell Road"—on 20th November he came again alone; I had not seen his brother at that time—I had another deal with him, "36 gross assorted ferrules, at 1s. a gross, £1 16s.—G. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITE</hi> "—he called again alone, and I had another deal, "2 gross and 4 dozen assorted handles, at 2s., £2 16s.—Received, H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITE</hi>"; and again on the 28th, "80 gross ferrules, at 1s.—Paid, H. <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITE</hi>"—on 12th December here is a bill of H. White for forty-four gross, of ferrules—those are all the receipts I produce, but I have had dealings with him in the same articles; altogether I have had six or seven hundred gross of ferrules, and two gross and four dozen handles—my last dealing with Edward was about a month before the case came on—about a month after I first saw Edward, Harry came with him, and they were nearly always together afterwards—Edward did all the bargaining and wrote the receipt and took the money, he was generally the spokesman—the third lot had a label on them, "Wright and Harrington," and I said, These come from the firm of Wright and Harrington—he said, "Yes, that is right, they are my own goods, I bought them; there is nothing to fear, it is all right"—I knew the name, but I did not know the firm—when he came again I said, "It is curious you can sell them so cheap"—he said, "The manager at Wright and Harrington's is my brother, and I get them cheaper than anyone else"—I did not feel satisfied with that answer, and sent my card to Wright and Harrington's by a man named Artis, at Bartholomew Lane; he knew the address; he came back in the evening and saw me—after that I had another deal, and the label was on again—Edward said to me, "You was a fool to send in your card, I told you it was all right, and there was nothing to fear; I have sold them at lots of places in the City"—I said, "I have not received the answer yet; they are going to send me a price-list, but they have not done so"—he came again and brought goods with labels on, and said, "You sent a man into the City to sell these ferrules near where they came from; the firm your man went to have wrote to the firm about it"—I said, "You did not tell me not; you said they were all right, and he could go where he liked"—I had sent a man to sell them, Barnett—Edward said, "You did <hi rend="italic">not ought</hi> to go near the firm to sell them"—I said, "I don't care where</p>

               <p>he sells them if he buys them of me; it seems funny you don't want me to go to the City to sell them"—he said, "Well, I buy them off Goatly and Slade, and it is all right," so I did not think much more about it after that, but if I wanted any I bought them—I did not get a price-list—Edward said that Goatly was his brother and the manager—I asked Harry if that was right—he said, "It is a lie; Goatly is the manager, but he is not my brother"—I have never spoken to Goatly or Slade in my life—it never occurred to me to go to the warehouse and get a price-list for myself—I recollect being seen by a police officer, and a night or so before that Edward Rudman called at my house at Hoxton, and said, "I have come to tell you that there is a bother about the ferrules; Mr. Wright has come to London, and has been into his firm in the City to inquire about the loss of these ferrules, and I have come round to tell you about it; if you have any I will take them off your hands myself to save you from getting into trouble, as I have got a shop now where I can take them"—"I said, "What I have bought I shall keep; I have only a few left; as I have paid you for them I shan't give them to you back again"—he said, "Will, you trust me with half a gross-of walking-sticks to put in my shop?"—I refused—he said I was not to be surprised if Mr. Wright and the detective called on me that night, as he had seen them going up Pimlico Walk, where I used to live, and he had been in an umbrella shop that afternoon, Mr. Bunn's, in Brick Lane, and Mr. Wright and the detective had called there, but did not know him, and he left to give the other ones the <hi rend="italic">tip,</hi> and mentioned Small and Curney and Mr. Bull, of the City Road, and Bignell, and said, "Whatever becomes of this case I will never bring Goatly or Slade into it"—Harry Rudman was present at that time—Brown was at my place for about two minutes—he is a stick-seller—I knew before they came that all the articles I was buying were very much under the price—I knew Bunn—I I have only seen the boy, John Rudman, once.</p>

I am sixteen, and the brother of the two Rudmans, the prisoners—I live at home with my mother and father at 328, Comp<lb/>ton Buildings, Goswell Road—before I went to Wright and Harrington's I was at Moore and Company's, Westmoreland Buildings, Aldersgate Street, umbrella makers; Slade was in their employment—I left Moore and Company at Christmas, 1889—about April Mr. Moore told me to go round to Wright and Harrington's—I saw there first Slade, and after<lb/>wards Goatly—I was taken on there as parcels boy on the following Monday—I had to run errands and clean up the place, and nut it to rights—there was only one entrance-door to Wright and Har<lb/>rington's premises, which are all on the first floor; it does not communicate with other premises—other people are in the building, but Wright and Har<lb/>rington had the first floor, and there is one entrance-door from the land<lb/>ing, and when that is locked there is no means of getting into their pre<lb/>mises without breaking in—Goatly generally kept the key when the place was locked up at night; sometimes I took it—if I got there before them in the morning I had to wait—Slade sometimes took the key—during part of the time I was with the prosecutors my brothers lived at homo; I cannot say when they left and lodged elsewhere—Goatly and Slade were sometimes out together in the dinner-hour, so that I was left alone in the warehouse—during the other part of the day either one or the other would be in to receive customers; once or twice they were both out in the afternoon, leaving me alone—I had nothing to do with the books except a parcels book that I took out—I have never seen either of my brothers at the warehouse or outside it—I have never, when I have gone in in the morning, found any disturbance of the stock, or any sign of the stock having been pulled about or altered since the warehouse had been locked up the previous night—I have never taken out parcels of goods belonging to Wright and Harrington and given them to either of my brothers—I have never taken out any parcels except those I was ordered to take out by my master, or by Goatly or Slade-soon after I began work at Wright and Harrington's Goatly did</p>

I don't know what you mean "—I said, "You have been present when your brother has sold quantities of ferrules and umbrella handles in the name of White"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You were present when receipts were made out in the name of White; do you know Mr. Phelps?"—he said, "I have heard the name"—I took him to Mr. Wright, who was close by, and we went together to Moor Lane Police-station, where I confronted him with Phelps, and said to Phelps, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is ha the young man who has been present with the other young man, when you have purchased umbrella fittings?"—he said, "Yes "—I said, "Has he been present when the receipts were made out in the name of White?"—he said, "Yes"—Harry Rudman said, "How can you say that, Mr. Phelps?"—he was then charged—on April 6th I took Goatly and Slade, at 109, Mildmay Grove, Mildmay Park; they occupied apart<lb/>ments there—I said, "I am a detective officer of the City Police; you must consider yourselves in custody on a charge of being concerned with others not in custody, in stealing and receiving large quantities of umbrella furniture, the property of Messrs. Wright and Harrington, of Birmingham and Aldermanbury, and you will have to accompany me to the station"—Slade said, "I can only say we are innocent of this matter"—Goatly made no reply.</p>

Harris knocked my daughter down; she is his wife; she had the child in her arms. I went to stop it, and he knocked me down. Me and my daughter came home. About an hour afterwards Harris went up into the van and got a stick, and tried to hit me with it, and then threw it at me, and struck me in the back, and then he went to the barrow or van and got the soldering-iron, and threw it at me with all vengeance, and it stuck in my side. I was then standing on the ground between the vans. My daughter pulled it out, and. I then fell down; I am now in great pain"—the prisoner heard all that; I cautioned him, and he said, "When I came between the vans she said, 'Little Dog's-nose'. I said, 'Yes.' She had a broom-handle in her hand, and struck me with it on my head; her son, John Eastwood, was on top of me on the ground; young James Hedges pulled him off. As: I got up Johnny came after me again; my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> stood over me, so he</p>

               <p>should not kick me in the head. As I was getting up I got this iron or whatever it was and threw it, I did not know what it was; I do not know whether it hit anybody or not. I put the iron in a corner of the van"—he was then taken to the station and charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was in February, about eleven at night—I saw Johnny Hedges there, he did not pull me off the prisoner—I was not on top of the prisoner—the row began in the public-house, and went on afterwards—my mother had this broom-stick in her hand, not at the public-house, but at home—I did not hear her speak to the prisoner or to any one—I did not hear her call the prisoner "Little Dog's-nose"—it was quite dark—the van was five or six yards from where my mother was standing, and about half-a-mile from the public-house where we left the prisoner—I was seven or eight yards from him when he threw the soldering-iron—I saw it in his barrow before he threw it, and in his hand—only our own family were standing about—he said nothing when he threw it.</p>

I am a registered medical man, of Barking—on 15th February, about 11.30 p.m., I went to a ran in the New Road Barking, and found the prosecutrix suffering from a small punctured wound at the back of her left side—it was bleeding, and she was in a state of considerable collapse—it must have been made with a sharp instrument; it penetrated into her chest, and injured her lungs, and pneumonia supervened; she was in very great danger of her life for two months—she gave evidence at the Police-court on April 25, but in my opinion she was not able to go—she has not recovered yet—the wound could be inflicted with a soldering-iron.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I am assistant to Inspector Thomas.

                  </hi>. I live at Alma Road, Windsor—on the 17th of March, about 4 p.m., Domenico Moretti called, and was shown into the dining-room—I went in to see him—he asked in Italian if I spoke Italian; we did not speak a word in English—he said, "I have come to see you about a boy I am anxious to have placed in a school; he is not my own, but the nephew of a friend of mine, who went over to America to attend his brothers deathbed, and received from his dying brother the boy and a certain sum of money for the boy's maintenance. He gave the strongest orders that the boy should be educated in England. Prior to coming to you I went down to Eton, hearing that Eton was an excellent school, but when I arrived there it was suggested to me that I should call upon you for advice; I therefore have come to get your assistance in this matter"—I said to him, "Is the boy not a Roman Catholic? I suppose for that reason you were sent to me, as I am so well-known at Eton, and you would consequently like the boy to be brought up in his own religion, and the religion of his parents"—he was utterly indifferent for a moment, and then said, "Oh! the uncle does not mind whether the boy is brought up a Catholic or Protestant, so long as a school may be found for him "—I said, "This is very remarkable; that neither you nor the uncle seems to consider the question of religion"—he shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Well, I will tell you the reason; of course it must be kept a strict secret: this child is an illegitimate child, and consequently you will know how impossible it would be to take this child to Italy to its friends; they do not of course know of its existence, moreover, the uncle is more or less of a dolt, stupid, and entirely in the hands of a very angry or irascible sister; she has for years thoroughly ill-treated him, giving him little or nothing for his hire (because he has worked for the sister as a labourer on the farm), and provided him with very little food. I am sure all this you will understand thoroughly; you know what farm life must be in Italy, and you will at once understand the difficulty of the case." I said, "What is it you want me to do? Why have you come to me?"—he again told me on account of the advice he had received from Eton—he did not pretend to have any idea of what sort of a place Eton was—I said, "Well, I do not know in which way I can help you"—he said, "Are there not some other excellent schools in the neighbourhood? "—I said, "There are"—he said, "Well, now the matter is very easy. I have not come to you to take this boy out of charity, because the uncle has received from the father of the boy quite sufficient money, not only for the boy's maintenance and education, but also to give him a start in life; this money the uncle will deposit with you "—I said, "Whatever he deposits with me I will place in the hands of my solicitors for the boy, and I hope I shall be able to arrange everything satisfactorily"—as he was going away it was arranged that Moreno should come down with Moretti to be introduced to me and to arrange the preliminaries on the following Thursday, 19th—on that day at noon Lorenzo Moreno, who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040064"/>
               <p>was said to be the uncle, and Domenico Moretti came, and at once set about the matter in hand—Moreno drew from his pocket a long thin brown paper parcel folded at the ends, opened it, and drew from the end a very large number of what he called 100 dollar notes; he showed me the top one, I did not look at the amount of it—I should say there were at least 50 or 100 notes; they were all the same, all notes; he did not pull them from the parcel; the only one he appeared really to use was the top one—I did not examine them—he also snowed me some two or three large golden American coins, ten-dollar pieces, I suppose—he said those notes gave him a great deal of anxiety, as he continually carried them about his person—on this occasion he carried them in an inside pocket of an inner coat—after refreshment he offered to put down for my housekeeper an English sovereign—I said, "I don't think you ought to do that," and I asked him to take it up again—he showed me innumerable coins of every description, French, English, American—Moretti spoke English on several occasions to my housekeeper in my presence at this visit—Moreno said nothing to me in English—neither spoke to me in English except jocular words, as though to show they were foreigners, and knew a word or two only of English—on Sunday, 22nd, Moretti came alone by an early train in order to attend the church service at eleven, he said; and he attended service at my church—after the service he went to my house and remained while I had breakfast—he spoke of the business almost entirely; he said, "I am glad to tell you that Moreno is perfectly satisfied," at the same time paying me several compliments, "and he is most anxious to hand over to your keeping the boy"—he partook of refreshment and went away after making an appointment with me in London on the Monday, 23rd—I had mentioned I had business in London on the Monday—he said he was staying at a hotel very near the station; he did not give me the name—he said, "That is very fortunate; I can meet you at Waterloo Station, and you can come with me to the hotel"—on the Monday he met me at Waterloo—I said, "Now, I have some business to do which must be done, and I should like the business settled as early as possible"—he said, "Oh, there will be no difficulty," and I went with him to Savage's Hotel, near the station, and there I found Moreno expecting us—he said he was not very well, and that he was just preparing to have breakfast in the dining-room, a very large room—they had breakfast, and asked me to have a cup of coffee—on a previous visit Moretti had spoken about some sort of security for the money—Moretti now said, Moreno would be glad to see some sort of sign that you are a man of substance, and that you would not profit by the money which is to be given to you for the boy, Moreno "(who was by at the time) "is a poor <hi rend="italic">contadini,</hi> you know, a poor man who does not know the world; and although you have your bank-book and all that, yet he would like to seethe money"—this did not surprise me, because from my experience of Italians I know that this is exactly the way they would act; no Italian would trust another who had not or could not show more substance than himself—Moreno quite bore out the character of being a dolt, and scarcely spoke except to say he was suffering from indigestion and had a headache—I said that I must be about the business I had to do in town, and that they must either settle their business at once or I would return when my business was accomplished—Moretti offered to accompany me, and he did so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040065"/>
               <p>—we went to my solicitor's, he remaining outside, that I might draw out some money to pay certain bills and, at the same time, satisfy them that I had no other intention towards the boy but a good one—at the first or second visit it was said the money was to be deposited at my solicitor's, and whatever remained after the boy was twenty-one was to be transferred to the boy, who was not to know who he was or how he came into the world until he was twenty-one—the whole matter was to be left to myself and my solicitor to do the best for the boy—when Moretti accompanied me to my solicitor's I received there a cheque for £300, which I cashed at the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury branch, in sixty £5 Bank of England notes—Moretti asked me if I had got the money—I said, "Oh, yes; I must now. go off and make some purchases"—he said, "I want some money myself," and he produced from his pocket an American note, and asked me to go with him across the road to the Royal Exchange that he might change it into English money—he said, "This I received this morning from Moreno"—I went into the Exchange, but did not notice how much he received for the note; he told me he received £20 odd—we went to Shoolbred's, Tottenham Court Road, by the Underground Railway, where I purchased a large carpet for the church—afterwards we returned to the hotel, where I found Moreno, who appeared to be very anxious; he gave as a reason for not accompanying me that he was afraid to leave any money in the house, and was afraid of its loss, imply<lb/>ing that there was other money upstairs in the house—refreshments had been ordered previously, of which we partook—after that Moretti suggested that the whole thing should be settled at once, as it would be necessary for them to go to Liverpool that evening to fetch the boy, as both he and Moretti wanted to get away to Italy as soon as possible—he said, "The boy will be brought to you to-morrow, and you can then arrange for his school"—I said, "I am satisfied with that arrangement, as I have already arranged about a school for him"—Moreno said to Moretti, "Oh, I will give him the money now; it will save the danger of carrying it to Liverpool and bringing it back again," and he said to me, "My friend Moretti, so anxious for the safety of this money, has purchased for me a strong iron box"—he went upstairs and returned with a Gladstone bag—he went to the further end of the room, which was a very large one—no one else was in the room—he unlocked the bag and took from it something rolled in brown paper—at that moment two people came into the room, and he said to Moretti and in Italian something to the effect, "What a nuisance"—they sug<lb/>gested we should go upstairs, and that the money should be handed over to me there in order that neither the strangers nor the people in the hotel should know that they were possessed of so much money, and that our business should not be overheard—we went upstairs—Moreno went inside what he told me was his bedroom—I followed him just inside the door—Moretti took up a position at the door-post, with one arm outside, and the greater part of his body just inside the door—I was nearer Moretti than Moreno—the bag was taken on to a bed or couch, and a steel box like this was taken out; it locks itself when the lid falls—he took this brown paper envelope and placed it inside the box, and closed the box; I cannot say if he allowed the lid to go right down or not, or whether he used a key afterwards, but he had a key in his hand—opening the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040066"/>
               <p>box again, he said, "Oh, how silly! Why have two cares? you have the care of your own money in your pocket, and you will have now the care of this money in the box; it is most probable that you will lose one or the other: look here, put your parcel in here on the top of this, and then we can lock it, and it will be so much easier for you to take charge of the box"—I at once acceded to his request, and gave into his hands the bundle of notes, which were in an ordinary bank envelope just as I had received them from the bank—he folded them, and put them on the top of his brown paper—at this moment either my attention was drawn by Moretti at the door, or some<lb/>thing else happened, but in an instant the box was folded in brown paper and handed to me—my attention may have been distracted—I cannot say what happened at that moment; I was not two yards from Moreno, and nearer to Moretti—we were all standing in a line; the box was nearer Moreno on the bed or couch, and Moretti was standing nearer the door and nearer me—Moretti was speaking the whole time these proceedings were going on, so that I did not take so much notice of Moreno as I did of Moretti—my attention was distracted for a moment, and next moment I was handed a box very badly wrapped in very thin, brown paper—Moretti was at the door the whole time—these two boxes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are exact <hi rend="italic">fac-similes</hi> of each other—I cannot tell in which one the notes were placed; there are different designs round the sides, but otherwise they are identical; I noticed no difference till just now, when it was pointed out to me—when the box wrapped in brown paper was given to me it was very nearly the time for the 4.15 train from Waterloo, and Moreno and Moretti both went to the station to see me off—it was arranged that the boy was to be brought to me the following day, the 24th, by one of the prisoners, and then the box was to be opened in their presence, and if there was not sufficient money to enable me to do what I had promised, they would make it up to the amount, as they kept in Liverpool a large iron safe, which they brought from America, con<lb/>taining all their gold coins—they saw me off by the train; but something in their manner struck me, and I got out at Clapham Junction and went to a locksmith; who opened the box, and carefully folded at the bottom of it were two or three long packages—I examined them; they con<lb/>tained waste-paper, and there was nothing else in the box—the box that the prisoners had given me had not left my hands for an instant till it was examined by the locksmith in my presence, and I took out the parcels—I asked for the nearest police-station, rushed there, communi<lb/>cated with the police, who gave me the address of Sergeant Ward, and telegraphed to him—I then went to Savage's Hotel, and afterwards, with Brogan and Ward, to London Bridge railway station, about eight o'clock, and then to Cannon Street—I changed hats with one of the detectives, and went to examine the carriages of the train—in the first carriage I entered were all the prisoners—I placed my hands over the two male prisoners (I did not know who the female prisoners, who were sitting on the opposite side of the carriage, were) and screamed out, "Sergeant Ward, here they are!"—Ward was in the carriage in an instant, and as soon as he entered, Mary Moretti rushed out from behind me, screaming—Ward placed his head outside the carriage, and cried out to the man at the barrier, "Heigh! stop that woman!"—she was stopped and brought back to the carriage by Brogan</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189105040067"/>
               <p>—I held the door to prevent any further escape—all the prisoners were taken into custody—Domenico and Mary Moretti, Ward and myself went in one cab to the station, and the Moreanos and Brogan in another cabin the cab, on the way, Domenico Moretti said in Italian, "I am very sorry it has happened; I wish you would show mercy to me; I have been led into this by others "—I asked him who the woman by his side was, and he said, "She is my wife"—I charged the prisoners at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined,</hi> I did not offer to take charge of the boy immediately after the money was mentioned; the offer came from Moretti—I said since they had the money to pay for schooling and maintenance of the boy there would be no difficulty, and they said, "Do you mind taking the responsibility?"; and I said I would—I am a Roman Catholic clergyman—nothing was said about showing the money at the first interview—I was willing with my solicitor to take the care of the child if the money was paid—I never heard of getting rid of an illegitimate child in this way before—the child was to be placed at school; to a certain extent the whole care of the child devolved on me, but he was to go to the uncle once every one or two years to stay with him during the holidays, so that there could be complete communication between them; he was to know nothing of his relatives except the uncle—on the second occasion I told Moretti that I should place their money in my solicitor's hands—I showed them bank-books then—until last night I had not the smallest notion that they understood English, but they understood figures, and I found out last night that they know English perfectly well—Italians in their dealings with one another do not trust one of less substance than themselves; the prisoners were not satisfied with the bank-book; they said, "That may mean anything," and I said I was going to draw money to pay bills, and it would serve the two purposes—when I came back to the hotel, having made my purchases, Moretti said, "Have you got the money?" and I took the envelope out of my pocket and showed them the money—I spent no portion of the £300 on the carpet; I had a £10 note and a few sovereigns apart from that—it struck me that the prisoners had a considerable sum of money when they showed me their coins—they seemed to have a great number of American notes; I did not take them into my hands, I only saw the top note, and it appeared to be for 100 dollars; I took no notice of the others, and though they appeared to be the same, I cannot swear that they were—I did not consult my solicitor about the matter, I only went to ask whether there would be any harm in my taking the boy under the circumstances—I showed them my notes immediately after we had refreshments, and put them back in my pocket, and they were not produced again till we went upstairs—I first saw the box upstairs in the bedroom; I only saw one box—it was not intended at first that my money should be put in one box and their money in another box—Moreno put my money in the box, which was immediately closed—it was not a very large room, but my attention was drawn by the conversation of both prisoners, who were in different directions—I do not know if the money was placed in the box; my impression is that it was; Moreno put two packages in, but the box was immediately closed—I paid no attention except to what was immediately before me—I was only five or ten minutes in the bedroom—they retained the key of.</p>

               <p>the box—I had never seen before the paper I found in the box when the locksmith opened it; I do not know if that box was the same as the one I saw in the bedroom, but neither of the parcels in it was the same as the parcels that were put into the box in the bedroom.</p>

I am in the employment of Theophilus James George, an ironmonger, of 119, Falcen Road, Clapham Junction—on 23rd March, about 4.45, the prosecutor came with a box similar to this, and at his request I picked the lock—I saw him take out the contents, which consisted of two packages of brown paper—he opened them; there were strips of newspaper inside—I saw nothing else—he then asked the way to the police-station, and I directed him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant L</hi>). About five p.m. on 23rd March I received a telegram, and at seven I saw the prosecutor at Kennington Road Police-station—accompanied by Brogan we went to London Bridge, and then to Cannon Street—we reached there at 8.19; the doors of the 8.20 train were closed—in a second-class compartment we found the four prisoners; they were the sole occupants of the compartment—Mr. Longinotto identified the two male prisoners—I secured Moretti, and Brogan secured Moreno—I said to Moretti, "I am a police-officer; I want you for those notes that you stole this afternoon"—he shrugged his shoulders, and pulled out this pocket-book, and said, "That is all the notes I have got"—I opened it, and saw it contained notes; I examined it at the station; it has been in Inspector Payne's possession since—Moretti spoke a few words of English—Moreno spoke no English in my presence—I got an interpreter to explain the charge of stealing these notes by means of a trick—neither of them made any reply to the charge—the first thing I knew of Mary Moretti being connected with the male prisoners was her rushing out from the carriage—she is English—when she was brought back I said, "Let me have the money you have got on you; no doubt you are connected with these men"—she handed me a purse, which I found to contain £10 in English gold and two 100 franc notes, one of which is very much torn—at the station prior</p>

               <p>to her being searched I said, "Have you got any more money on you?"—she said, "No, the only money I have got is what I gave you in the railway carriage"—Mrs. Barber, who searched her, subsequently gave me thirteen 100-franc notes—Rosini Moreno, who is an Italian, was asked through the interpreter if she had any money, as she was to be searched; she said, "No, I have no money"—I informed her through the interpreter that she would be stripped and searched—she put her hand in her breast and pulled out a bundle of notes, which were handed to Brogan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant L.</hi>) I was with the prosecutor and Ward at Cannon Street Station on the night of the 23rd, and when the prosecutor pointed out the male prisoners in a carriage I entered, and said to Moreno, "I am a police-officer, and I want-those stolen notes"—he said, "I have got no notes"—I said, "Turn out your pockets"—he then handed me this purse containing £20 in gold, fifteen napoleons, and some foreign silver—at that moment Mary Moretti hurried out of the carriage in a suspicious manner, followed by Rosini Moreno—I pulled Rosini back, and said, "You must stop here, as you are connected with those men in this robbery"—I said to Ward, "The other woman has gone away"—I followed and caught her as she was about to pass through the barrier, brought her back, and said to her, "I want those stolen notes"—she said, "I have got no notes"—I said, "Turn out your pockets"—she then handed me her purse containing £20 in gold and silver—I took them to the police-station—I searched Lorenzo, and found in his Test and trousers pockets a number of foreign notes, some of which were worthless; they are of the Confederate States of America—the one on the top is good and all the others are worthless—I searched this port<lb/>manteau that was in the railway carriage with them, and found in it the iron box produced; it locks itself.</p>
