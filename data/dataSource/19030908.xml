                  </hi>. I live at 44, Southampton Street, Clerkenwell, with my mother, who was first married to Mr. Roberts, on his death she married the prisoner—I had a half brother named Herbert Patrick, and a half sister named Mary Beatrice, aged 5 years and 2 1/2 years respectively—we all lived with the prisoner and my mother in two basement rooms—the front room was a kitchen with a bed in it and the back one was a bedroom—opening out of the passage at the back there is an area where there is a coal hole—this hammer (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was generally kept there for breaking coal—the prisoner generally slept in the back room; I, my mother and the children slept in the front room—the prisoner frequently got drank—on Sunday, August 2nd, he came home rather late in the evening—he was drunk—I was in bed with the children and mother—the prisoner went to bed first, then he came into our room and said to mother, "Why are you not asleep, I have come to kill those children"—mother said, "Go to bed you <hi rend="italic">ratted</hi> fool"—he did not seem to know what he was doing—he was drunk—he went back to his room—on Monday or Tuesday I put 6s. 6d. belonging to Mrs. Strange on the dresser—it was her rent, and she left it with me to pay the landlord while she was out—when the time came for paying the money I found it was gone—I do not know if my mother spoke to the prisoner about it; I did not do so—on August 5th I was in the front kitchen between 10 and 11 p.m.; the two children were in bed there—the prisoner was in the same room—I went out about 10.30—he had been home for about half an hour—he may have had some drink that evening, but he was not very drunk—he did not talk to me much while he was in the room, he was having his supper which mother had got for him—he did not have anything to drink with his supper—my mother went out with some mangling—I left the kitchen and went to the front door to wait for her—I was away from the kitchen for about fifteen minutes—there was a light in the room when I left—when my mother returned we went down stairs—we could not get in at the door as it was locked—mother kicked at the door and said, "Are my children all right?"—the prisoner said, "They are all right, they are sleep."—mother asked Mrs. Wade, who is another lodger, to lend her her key—mother said to the prisoner through the door, "Let me see the children"—he said, "Wait a minute and I will let you see them"—I got Mrs. Wade's key and opened the door—as we did so the light on the kitchen table was put out—I think it was blown out—I do not think it was the opening of the door which put it out—I then went with my mother to the top of the stairs—the prisoner came out of the room—there is a small passage outside the kitchen, before the stairs begin, which go first up to the yard and then to the street—mother said to the prisoner,</p>

I am medical officer at Brixton Prison—I have had seven years' experience at Holloway and Brixton; during that time I have constantly had to observe prisoners with a view to judging of the state of their minds—I have given evidence at this Court upon many occasions—the prisoner came under my observation on August 6th—I saw him about 5.30 p.m., that was less than twenty-four hours after the death of the children—I have kept him under observation since then with a special view of judging as to the state of his mind—I have frequently talked with him, and observed him, and had reports on his conduct from the warders—he had a light all night and continual observation—I have studied the depositions—I have seen no evidence of insanity in him—when I first saw him I thought he was sane—I have seen nothing in the depositions or in my observation of him to make me believe that he was insane on August 5th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner was brought before the Magistrate I had the same opinion as I have now, but I did not wish to give it—I had read the prisoner's statements except the one to Mrs. Strange, which I have heard to-day for the first time—I formed the opinion that he was worrying at being unable to get employment to support his children, and that the probable meaning of his exclamation that the children were spending his money was that they were costing more money than he could earn—it is possible that it may have been a delusion when he thought that they were spending his money—I understood that he was</p>

               <p>worried about the 6s. 6d. which had disappeared—that might be likely to have more effect on a man who had been drinking for years than on a person who had not—his mind might be confused by long drinking, probably if he had not been drinking he would not have done this, or have taken the view that the children were spending his money—the evidence shows that he had some idea of killing the children on the Sunday, but I think if he had any real intention of killing them then he would have gone about it in another way—his conduct on that night was much more like that of an intoxicated man—the idea was probably in his mind then, but not very fixed—continual drinking would lower his moral sense, increase his depression, and diminish his power of self-control—I have seen the envelope which was found—he told me he wrote it so that his wife should know he had committed it, and not to blame any other person—it was a strange thing for him to write—I think his mind was confused by excessive drinking, trifling things might have more effect upon his mind than if he had been sober—he rather resented my asking him any questions about the money which was taken, and I did not press him—continued drunkenness would have an affect on the brain of any man so as to weaken and warp the effect of his judgment, varying in different persons—it is so long since he had the attacks of ague and malaria that I do not think they would make him more likely to be effected by drink; if they had been more recent they might have had some more effect—habitual drinking would have more effect on a man than occasional bouts—in some cases drinking would be more likely to effect the mind of a man who had suffered from ague and malaria than a man who had not suffered, but not necessarily—if for some years he had been taking insufficient nourishment that would add to the effects of drinking.</p>

August 16th, we had breakfast together, and he promised to be home to dinner at 1.30—he did not return until between three and four, and then he refused to have any dinner—he was not in a suitable condition to want any, and he said strange things—he said he would spend Christmas Day in prison—about seven o'clock I went to chapel—he said he was going to Kingsbury—he went out—after I had been in chapel some time he came in—after it was over I went home, but the prisoner did not return until 10.15—he went straight through to the kitchen—I was in the front room—he came in and sat down in a chair and began talking disagreeably—to pass it off I asked him to have some supper—he declined, saying he would get it himself if he wished it—he</p>

               <p>Post Office—Berry, who has pleaded guilty, was employed in August as an auxiliary postman at the Fulham Sorting Office—a great many complaints have been received of loss of letters and packets during the nine months Berry has been in the service—I made up and posted in a pillar box at Fulham, about 7.30 p.m., on August 24th, a test packet, addressed to Mr. Tom Peyton, 137, Broughton Road, London—in it was put a silver match box, and twelve penny marked postage stamps in a purse—it was placed in Berry's hands the next morning—the number is much higher than exists in the road—Berry's duty was to say that there was no such number as that on the letter—he delivered in Broughton Road, and knew it was not a proper number—I gave instructions to the overseer at the Fulham Office—on August 25th I saw Berry about 1.30 at the Fulham Sorting. Office—he made certain statements, in consequence of which I instructed Detective Blake, and I had given back to me the purse, match box, eleven stamps, and a 1s. postal order, posted in another letter—I also saw White about 3.30 on Wednesday, August 26th—I told White at his tobacconist's shop who I was, and cautioned him in the usual way—I said, "You know Berry has been employed by the post office for some time;" he said, "Yes;"—I said, "Yesterday morning you purchased a postal order from him, and 1s. in stamps;" he said, "I got them off him as a customer, he has been a customer of mine for some time"—I said, "Why did you tell the police officer yesterday that you had not got anything from him?"—he said, "I was busy, and I forgot"—I said, "In July last you were seen by a police officer from the post office with reference to a stolen 5s. order, and you then said you did not know where you got it from;" he said, "I did not know him"—I said, "The officer asked you whether you had any orders from Berry;" he said, "I had one some time ago"—I said, "That should have been a warning," and showed him this 3s. stolen postal order, and an addressed letter, and asked him, "Have you done business with him?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "You must also have taken this order from Berry;" he said, "I do not remember"—I said, "You see you have been dealing with three stolen orders;" he said, "If I have taken them, I took them in good faith, as I have every confidence in Berry"—he then left the room and brought back a postal packet addressed to G. Anthony, 31, Ismalia Road, Wandsworth Road, Fulham, containing two ties stolen by Berry on the morning of his arrest—he said, "I found this under my counter when sweeping this morning"—I said, "Is it not more likely Berry gave it to you to mind?" he said, "No, I found it as I told you"—anybody could open it; it is tied with string, and is intact; he said, "I was going to ask you whether I should give it to the police or hand it to you"—I said, "You ought to have given it up in the morning at the post office"—I reported the matter to the solicitor of the Post Office, and under instructions saw him again on Friday.</p>

The stolen postal orders I have changed I have paid through to my firms in a straightforward way, and certainly should not have changed them for customers if I had any suspicion that they had been stolen With regard to the packet found under the counter on Wednesday morning, I had had whitewashes in to do the shop out, and in sweeping the rubbish up this packet was swept up with it before I noticed it, which I handed to the detective.

I went on August 8th to 84, Leadenhall Street, about 2.15—I found Mr. Bray and the prisoner there—they stated that the previous day twenty-seven boxes of cigars had been removed, and that a key had been found in the office—the prisoner said he went out on the previous day about 12.30, leaving his governor in the office, and when he returned at two they were gone; that he went out again at 3.30 and returned at 5 and tried to open his door with the key in the usual way and could not turn it, so he called the lift boy, who put the key of the lift through the ring of his key and tried to turn it, but in doing so broke the key in the lock.</p>

Pooley, weigh-bridge manufacturers—he told me he had been to their Fleet Street branch, and had seen Mr. Pooley and had got the order from him—the signature is more like "Pollin" than "Pooley," and I told him so—he replied, "Whether it is 'Pollin' or 'Pooley,' Mr. A. M. Pooley signed it in my presence and gave it to me"—the order was for £30 and his remuneration was 25 per cent.—he had had £2 8s. previously, and I paid him £5 2s.—the same day I wrote to Messrs. Pooley acknowledging the order, and by return of post received a letter from them repudiating it—I then sent a telegram to their head office at Birmingham and received a letter from there confirming their other letter—I wrote to the prisoner about it and the letter was returned marked "House empty."</p>

                  </hi>. On July 15th I was residing at 5. Clinton Road, Tottenham, which was occupied by the prisoner—Mr. Christy and I occupied the front room on the first floor—I have two children, a boy of fourteen and a girl of nine months; the boy went to school—I think I had been at the house since May 20th—the prisoner had a cocoanut <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> at the Alexandra Palace—she is married—about a fortnight before the fire I was in the kitchen in the morning; the prisoner said she had only taken 4d. the day before at the Palace, and 6d. the day before that, and that the insurance was running out, and if she had a good fire it would about put her right—I said, joking, "Why don't you have one"—she said, "I am nearly out of the insurance and it would be suspicious for me; it would be best to take place in your room; you can easily put some clothes to air and make a big fire and go out and leave them; you can take the children and go out and tell me when you have done it"—she said she would not give the alarm until it had got well hold of the place, or something to that effect—I said, "Good Lord, you are saying enough to get me seven or ten years"—she said, "How would they know; how would they find out"—I said, "How do they find out things after they have been done years?"—when Mr. Christy came home I started telling him about it; while I was doing so, the prisoner, who I believe was outside, came in, and I finished telling Mr. Christy what she had told me in the morning—the prisoner said, "I will give you £50, and it will buy you double as good a home as you have"—she said she should get £250 if it was all gone—Mr. Christy said, "I should lock her or anybody up who did such a thing wilful"—between that day and July 15th the prisoner told me two or three times that she had" dreams that my place had been on fire—on July 15th, about 8 a.m., she called me and said, "I had another dream last night that your place was on fire, and it seemed so true to me I came out on the landing to see if it was true"—I said, "Don't worry about it, I am too careful"—</p>

               <p>she said, "You never know; I have dreamed two, when I have dreamed three times it comes true"—I sent my boy to school and then went to pawn some things for the prisoner—I brought her back the money—I said, "I am going out"—she said, "What time will you be back"—I said, "A little before two to send the boy to school"—that was soon after 10 a.m.—I took the baby with me and the boy was at school—I went for a walk on the Down Hills; then I returned and sat on a bench on the green opposite the house—I sat there from 12 to 2—my boy came back from school—I was speaking to an old lady by me, and I saw the prisoner looking out of the window of my room—that was just before two—about 2.30 I went into the house; directly the prisoner opened the door I said, "What a funny smell, just like hair burning,"—she said, "It is nothing, only some hair under the copper"—when I went up stairs with the baby and the boy there was more smell—my door was half way open—I had shut it when I came out in the morning—I then sent my boy to school, and went down to the back kitchen and filled a jug of water, leaving the baby just inside my room—while I was getting the water the prisoner kept hurrying me to go up and see if baby was all right—she said, "Why don't you go up and see if the baby is all right"—I said, "She will be all right, I have only left her a minute"—she said, "Why don't you go and see if she is all right"—I said, "She will be all right," and I went up—I got up on the first floor and saw the place on fire—I saw smoke coming out at the top of the door—I called out, "God help me, save my baby, the place is on fire"—the prisoner did not come up—I rushed up the second flight of stairs—I could not walk into the room, but I crawled in on my hands and knees, and pulled the baby out by the back of her neck—she was in the same place where I had left her; she had a little drop of water in a doll's basin which she was playing with—I got the baby down stairs—as I was going down the prisoner caught hold of me and said, "Stop here, fool; wait until it gets through to my parlour, and I will buy you all you lose"—I rushed to the front door and called a neighbour, Mr. Barker, who came in with the police—some firemen came and the fire was extinguished—I had had no fire in my room for a fortnight—I used to cook by the gas down stairs—no lamp had been burning in my room that day—I afterwards found out that the fire began in the cupboard in my room—the last time I had opened it was about 8.15 or 8.30 that morning—there was clothing and a tool box with tools in it, and an empty half-gallon oil can hanging up on the right side—there were no matches in the cupboard—I do not think the prisoner said any more to me about the fire that day—later on Mr. Christy came home—I was not present when the prisoner spoke to him—a few days afterwards I was in the room with the prisoner and my mother, Mrs. Bell—I said to the prisoner, "Here is a nice home, all through you"—she said, "Why don't you shut up and keep in doors and say nothing to <hi rend="italic">nobody</hi>, and if I get my insurance money I will give you something towards what you lost"—she got into a temper with me and said, "If you don't say your baby had matches in her hand when it happened, I shall say you did it"—my mother said,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not known the prisoner before I went to her house in May—I saw an advertisement and so took the lodgings—I have been living with Christy for nearly four years—I have a husband—I am separated from him for cruelty—I occasionally do a little needle<lb/>work—the baby is Christy's, and the boy is my husband's—this is not the first time I have given evidence in a criminal Court, once I was a witness against a man for highway robbery—I did not charge him, I saw it done—the case was not sent for trial—I think the man was fined 40s.—it was seven years ago—I do not know the date that the prisoner started her cocoanut pitch, it was some time in July—I considered at first that she was joking about the fire, but afterwards I thought it was serious—I still remained in the house—before July 15th she spoke to me about the fire two or three times—I think the third time was on the day of the fire—I did not go to the police—I did not think she meant it—I mentioned the statements to a turncock a few hours after the fire—I do not know his name—I do not know if he is here to-day—I told Detective Wood about him, and I had told him of the prisoner's state<lb/>ments—Wood came to my place about a week after the fire—I have never told anybody that the fire was caused by my baby playing with matches—I know Ellis, the carpenter; he did not come into the room and assist to put the fire out—he did not say "How the <hi rend="italic">deuce</hi> did this occur"—I did not say, "My child must have been playing with the matches"—I never spoke to him—I know Mary Jane Vicary—she did not meet me coming down stairs at the time of the fire—she did not say to me, "Where is the fire"—I did not reply, "In my cupboard"—she did not say, "How was it caused?" and I did not say, "My child was playing with wax vestas"—that is absolutely untrue—I know Thomas Rose—he was not there at the time of the fire; he came afterwards—he saw me in the kitchen—he did not ask how the fire was caused—I did not say, "The child was playing with matches"—I told him what the prisoner had said, and he said, "Shut up, I want to write her letters and I want to get something for it; Mrs. Rimell is a friend of mine"—I told him on that day that the prisoner had talked on the previous day about having a fire—I did not hear Rose give evidence before the Magistrate—the prisoner did nothing to call in assistance; in fact, she stopped me from calling assistance—I know Emily Last—I saw her at Clinton Road that day, she was the first one I saw—the prisoner was not then on the door step screaming and wringing her hands—I should have seen her if she had been doing so—she came out and stood on the door step after I had been out and called a man—I did not hear her say to Mrs. Vicary, "Come up and see what you can do, my house is on fire"—I never leave my baby alone in the room; I sometimes leave the boy—once the prisoner showed some anxiety as to whether the boy would fall out of the window, he got on to the window ledge—when I came in on the day of the fire,</p>

I now live at 31, Clinton Road, Tottenham, and am a pressure gauge finisher—from May until some days after the fire I was living at the prisoner's with the last witness—one evening some weeks before the fire I came home from work about 6.45, when my wife told me of a conversation that she had had that afternoon with the prisoner, who then came into the room, and my wife told me in her presence that the prisoner had offered her £50 if she would set fire to the place—I said, if anything occurred like that or if the place was set fire to and I thought it was done wilfully I should have it thoroughly investigated and have them locked up—the prisoner said, "Say no more about it"—on July 15th I came home about 6.45—Mrs. Christy met me at the door and said something to me—the prisoner was standing near—Mrs. Christy said, "We have been burned out"—I said, "Good God, how did it happen?"—she said, "The child is supposed to have been playing with matches"—the prisoner said, "Hold your noise, you fool, or you will have no home to-morrow"—I went upstairs to have a look at the fire—then I came down into the kitchen—about an hour and a half afterwards the Insurance Agent came—before that the prisoner said that the child had caused it by playing with matches—I said I did not see how that could be, because there were only two matches in the room in a tin box when I left home—the height of the mantelpiece from the floor is about 3 ft. 6 in.—I left 5, Clinton Road, and went to number 31, and on the Sunday following I saw the prisoner at her door—I went there to ask for my razor which had disappeared from my mantelpiece, and a saucepan and one or two other things that had been left behind—the prisoner said she had given them to the dustman—she said her husband was in the hospital and she did not want to be upset—I said, "I have not come to make a disturbance here on any account, I have simply come to ask for my razor and a saucepan that was left in the yard"—she told me the dustman had taken them all away—I asked her what she was going to do, and she said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Argyll Road, Tottenham, and am superintendant of the Tottenham Fire Brigade—at 2.50 p.m., on July 15th, I received a call from the fire alarm—I went to 5, Clinton Road; when I got there the fire had been got very well in hand by some men I had sent on, and by some strangers—I went over the premises—I went into the first floor front room, and found that the fire had originated in a cupboard at the far end of the room; the inside of the doors were very severely charred; all the contents had been pulled out by my <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080039"/>
               <p>outside there was no very great damage; there was one line of fire outside which I found on a second examination, and which had spread slightly to the bed, which was two or three feet off—I saw the prisoner down stairs, and asked her if she was insured; she said yes—I did not ask her about the origin of the fire, and she did not tell me—I was told that the fire occurred in the portion of the premises occupied by Mrs. Christy, and I only applied to her—on August 6th, at 8.30 a.m., I went there again with Sergeant Wood; the prisoner had a conversation with him, and after that I said, "I do not wish to ask you any questions, Mrs. Rimell, but with your permission I would like to just have a look at that cupboard, as the case will be coming on in Court, and I should like to refresh my memory"—as we went to the door, Wood said, "I should like you to tell me, Mrs. Rimell, how often you used to come into this room;" she said, "Never"—Wood said, "Surely you went in sometimes;" she said, "No, I never went in at all, the room was too dirty"—I examined the cupboard in her presence—I noticed on the right hand side of the wall a sort of oily mark on the paper; while I was looking at it, the prisoner said, "They used to keep their clothes, rags, I called them, ail along the wall"—I said to Wood, "There is a portion of the wall paper which appears to have an oil mark on it, I shall take it off;" this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—she said, "Oh! that is where they used to keep the frying pan"—that was on the wall inside the cupboard—I cut it out; it might be due to the frying pan—Wood then said to the prisoner, "Really, Mrs. Rimell, I must again caution you; a minute ago you said you never came into the room, and now you are showing an intimate knowledge even of the contents of the cupboard"—in the opposite corner of the room to the cupboard I noticed there was a deep burn, extending along the floor towards the bed, as if oil had run out and then taken fire—I take it that it was that which actually fired the bed—it looked as if somebody had thrown oil into the cupboard, and then it had run out—the fire undoubtedly originated in the cupboard—the door of the cupboard was a double one, and opened in the middle—they were undoubtedly closed at the time of the fire—along the top, where the doors shut, there is a mark where the smoke oozed out—the room was practically untouched, except for the bed, and I do not think that would have taken fire except for the oil—if a child of eight or nine months had set fire to it, it could not have shut the door, and if a child lights a fire it does so to see it, and would not shut the door.</p>

I live at II, Hanover Road, Tottenham, and am fire loss assessor to the London and Lancashire Fire Assurance Company—the prisoner's husband had a policy of insurance with the office on furniture and other things at 5, Clinton Road, for £250—on July 18th the office received a claim, marked "A."—it was handed to me—I do not know whose writing it is in—I went to 5, Clinton Road, on July 21st—I saw the prisoner, and told her my business as to the claim, and that I also wanted an explanation as to the ownership of the property, as I had received a letter about it—she said she had effected a bill of sale on the goods and had nearly paid off the loan—I said that as the people who had advanced the money had insured them in another office she had better write to the other office and apportion the loss—I went up stairs to the first floor front room, and saw traces of a fire—I asked her if she could give any explana<lb/>tion about the fire—she said it was caused by the lodgers' child; whether a little boy or girl I cannot say—she said it had been playing with matches—I went up stairs to see what further damage had been sustained to the building, and noticed in the back room on the second floor that one of the beds had been covered with water—I asked for an explanation, and she said that the men putting out the fire had thrown water over it—I asked her where the lodger was, and she said at work—on July 30th, in the afternoon, I called again—I saw the prisoner, and said that I had a claim for the damage to the building, that I wanted to check it, and to arrange for the damage to the furniture—she said that the claim had been pre<lb/>pared by a friend, and that one bed and bedding too much had been claimed for—I went up stairs and examined the cupboard again—I told the prisoner that the amount of fire could not have been caused by a match only being thrown down, and that the marks of burning on the floor, in my opinion, were the results of paraffin—I do not think she said anything to the point in answer to that—I asked her where the lodger <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, and she said she had gone to 31, Clinton Road—I left a card with the prisoner, saying I would agree to the amount of damage on behalf of the office interested—I went to 31, Clinton Road, and had a conversation with Mrs. Chesty, in consequence of which I returned to the prisoner and told her that from particulars I had gathered I required the card back again, and that I could not negociate any further in the matter, but must report to the office—she wanted me to go inside again, but I said, "I refuse to discuss the matter any further with you"—she handed me the card and I left.</p>

I did not go into her room, it is too dirty, and I do not know what she had in the cupboard; I never sent her to pawn anything that morning for me; I had a bill of sale on the furniture and pay 15s. per week for the £30, and £2 10s. is owing; I have not paid anything off lately; I have had two loans of £30, one is now paid off; I have never had a fire before, and I have lived here since last September, and pay 14s. a week."—I then went up stairs with the prisoner and Mr. Edlington,—while the superintendent was examining the cupboard the prisoner commenced talking—I checked her, and told her I should put it down—she said, "That is" where the frying-pan was hanging down,; the cupboard was full of old clothes; the Christy's did not know I was insured until the man asked me the number of my policy, or had any loan on the furniture; I never went into Mrs. Christy's room that morning"—I took her to the police station, where she was charged—before she was charged I read the statement Mrs. Christy had made on August 2nd over to her—she said, "That is all false."

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon at Lambeth, and practise at 153, Kennington Park Road—just after midnight on August 4th I attended to Chalk's wounds—he was suffering from a contusion of both eyes, a lacerated wound under his right eye, a quarter of an inch long, two contusions on the forehead, two wounds on the bridge of the nose, and a swelling over his left cheek bone and lower jaw from severe blows—his face was very much swollen—his right eye was closed and his left eye nearly so—he was absent from duty about three weeks from disfigurement—the injuries might have been caused by the prisoner's boots.</p>

I got up and went across the road, spoke to Mr. Rixon, that was unloading a barrowload of iron, and he said to me, 'Ain't you going to see the funeral round the corner?' I said to him, 'I am too late now, I suppose.' I next went home and had some tea. After I had my tea I said to my wife, 'Wash Tommy's face, and I'll take him out for a walk.' I went out to the corner of the street, and went into the Dove beer house, and stopped in there till half-past nine. I was playing cards for pastime. I got four charges against me, and I am an innocent man. I work hard for my living, and always will while I have got health and strength. I work in the gas works in the winter, and in the summer I work along the canal unloading barges of timber. If I were guilty of these charges I should plead guilty like a man."</p>

I was just going to help him, but another man did. The carman said, 'Can you tell me where this place is?' I looked at the note and said, 'Yes, I can show you.' He pulled his cart up to the top of Boltolph Lane, and I showed him where it was. I walked into Pudding Lane to try and see a Mr. Bermann. I did not see him, and walked back again and asked the boy if he had got his case. I again went into Pudding Lane, and met the man Bermann. I had asked him for a job a month ago. I was with him the rest of the afternoon. I think we left Eastcheap about four o'clock, and from there went to Spitalfields Market, then to Stapleton's Depository, and then home to his place, 10, Beaumont Street."</p>

                  </hi>., M.D. I am divisional surgeon practising at 11, Gascoyne Road, Hackney common—on Wednesday, July 22nd, I went to Victoria Park Police station, where I was shown the head and trunk of an infant without the legs or external genitals, which had been cut away" with a knife or some sharp instrument—it appeared to be a fully timed child recently born—the umbilical cord was untied and had the appearance of having been broken—at the end, where it had been broken, was a clot of black blood—it was moist—the nails were discoloured, dark—in my opinion it had been dead about twelve hours—it was naked, and lying upon a piece of white muslin: outside that was a piece of green material, and outside that a portion of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi> newspaper—a placenta membrane covered a portion of the face from the forehead to just below the mouth and half of either cheek, covering nose and mouth—the edges were curled and dry, the central portion appeared fresh and glistening—it was moist, not dry—the next day when I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation it was perfectly dry and tore easily—just the dry edge of the membrane appeared to be adherent to the face—the next day, Thursday, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body—it was of normal weight—it weighed 6 lb. without the legs—it was a female—I found no marks of violence on the body—the brain was semi-fluid, and there was a marked absence of blood in the sinuses, denoting more or less decomposition—that was due to hæmorrhage possibly during life—it may have bled from the untied cord—I found upon the material upon which the child lay, blood from the severed parts of the limbs or trunk—the severance of those limbs would not account for the absence of blood in the sinuses, I should be more inclined to attribute it to hæemorrhage from the cord—I should think there had been more bleeding from the cord than the clot of blood that had formed—I found the epiglottis curved inwards, the mucous membrane of the trachea and the bronchi showed ecchymosed patches, due to ruptures in the mucous membrane—the lungs were filled in the pleura! cavity of the chest; they were pink and mottled, and sufficiently buoyant to support the tongue, the trachea, and the sinuse gland in water, and portions were cut off and squeezed until they floated—from the appearance of the lungs, and their condition under various tests, in my opinion the child had undoubtedly breathed—the lungs had been fully inflated—there must undoubtedly have been several breaths to have accounted for the appearances I found—the stomach had a little brown mucus in it, and the mucous membrane showed patches of ecchymosis at the intestinal end—the other appearances of the body were normal—the main evidence as to how long the child had lived I should look for in the umbilical cord—within thirty hours a change takes place, when it becomes dried and shrivelled—there was no evidence of that here—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080057"/>
               <p>the child might have lived for an hour or so, or it might only have lived a few minutes—if the cord had broken in a stillborn child it might bleed and no clot be found—that leads me to suppose that the clot was formed during breath circulation, owing to the foetal heart working—I think the child had a separate arterial existence—the arterial system of the body was working independently—in the development of a child in the womb of its mother it would be enclosed within the membrane, which expands as the child develops according to its time of development—shortly before the birth takes place in normal cases there is a rupture of this membrane—that is usually followed by a flow of water, which varies, but sometimes will continue more or less at variable times until the birth is accomplished—afterwards the child is expelled, in a normal case by itself—usually the membranes when they rupture, retract—they go back away from the part of the child which is presenting—they are retained, and the child is expelled with the membrane in the normal case—the next thing is that the placenta and membranes come away, in a normal case together—in popular language it is called the after-birth—it is not usual to have portions of the placenta membranes off and expelled afterwards, as large as the portion I found over the child's face—the membranes when expelled are very moist and slippery as a rule—in my opinion the cause of death in this case was asphixia or suffocation—I cannot tell in what way it was caused from the conditions I saw—it might have been caused if the child had respired fully by being suffocated in the mother's clothing—I think it is possible that after the afterbirth and membranes were expelled the child might have got its face in the membranes and so have been suffocated, or that when the child and the membranes were both born, they may have taken up together a place some where, and the child remaining in the membrane have been suffocated, but those are only suppositions—then it must have been lying on its face—I was speaking of the membranes as a rule, but as to the large portion found on the face of the child, the only thing I can suggest, though I think it is very improbable, is that that portion of the membrane being there, if the child's face were lying in the membrane, and allowed to stay a length of time, would be torn; then the membrane might be broken off and so become attached to the face—the condition of the membrane is normally moist, and rather slippery—if the membrane was on the face of a full-time child, and it made an effort to breathe, that would detach it, unless it were held there 'mechanically; if the child were dead it would remain—I was shown a left leg of a child on August 2nd, and a right leg on August 8th—from their appearance I have no doubt-" they were the legs of this child—in my opinion the dismemberment had taken place after death—I found no marks on the face of the child—I should have expected to find marks if pressure had been used, if it had been held there.</p>

I cannot say no more, but I close, I remain your wife Eliza," and "I was confined on Monday, but being away from my husband and him not knowing I was in trouble I was afraid of losing my children, and I have done away with the child,.

Please don't blame my husband for anything as he did not know anything about it, but he said he would not live with me again, and he asked me if I was in trouble and I said no, but it was done because I was afraid of my children being taken away from me. I had begged of him before I misbehaved myself to come back and live with me, but he would not hear of it, so I misbehaved myself, but it was only once.

I am a farmer of Cannons Park Farm, Little Stan<lb/>more, and on August 8th I had a black gelding, about 16 hands high, which I sold to a Mr. Holmes, of King's Cross, for £30—I entrusted it to a man named <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Chilton to take to Holmes, at 6.30 a.m. on August 8th—I never saw Chilton again, and ascertained on the 10th that Mr. Holmes had not received the gelding—I gave information to the police—on August 19th I went about 10 p.m. with the police to Elnathan Mews, Paddington—I there saw my horse in the prisoner's stable—it had been changed in appearance, its tail and mane pulled, its ears clipped, and some of its hair pulled out of its legs—the prisoner came up, and Ayres,</p>

               <p>police officer, said he should take him into custody for having a stolen horse there—I do not remember his reply—he was taken to the police station, and I took the horse away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Chilton for about a year—I knew that he had an uncle a horse dealer named Smith, well-known at Bristol—the horse was black, not a dark brown—on Monday, the 10th, when I heard from Holmes, I went to Edgware Road and made inquiries, and there met a man named Grindle, a horse dealer, who told me that <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Chilton had sold my horse to the prisoner—I have known the prisoner for years—I had heard from a cab washer that the prisoner had been seen driving my horse about—the prisoner, when he was asked where he got it from, said he" bought it off Ted for £15," meaning <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Chilton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor at Elnathan Mews—I have the next stables to the prisoner there—on August 10th I bought a Mack gelding from the prisoner about 11 a.m.—I gave £23 for it—I paid for it on the following Saturday, the 15th—after the Monday I had it in my stable—I put it to work the same day, but finding it too big for the cab, I asked the prisoner to sell it for me again—that is how it got into his stable again—the first time I heard of anything being wrong was the 19th, when the officers came and wanted to buy a black gelding, and the prisoner was brought in and made a statement and was taken to the station.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Detective X.</hi>) On August 10th I received information from the prosecutor about the stolen gelding, and went on that day to Elnathan Mews with another officer and saw the prisoner—I told him we were police officers and had come to make an inquiry respecting a black horse that had been stolen—he said, "I have a horse in the stable which you can look at"—we went into the stable, and the prisoner showed us a brown horse—I told him it was not the one I wanted, I wanted a black one—I then left the stable—on the 19th, in consequence of further information, I went with the prosecutor and Detective Morgan and another man again to Elnatnan Mews—I there saw Mr. Clayton—I represented that I wanted to buy a black gelding which I had seen at the prisoner's stable—the prisoner was sent for—when he came, knowing who I was, I asked him if he had sold this horse to Clayton—he replied, "Yes, last Saturday week for £23"—I asked him how he got it; he replied, "I bought the horse at Ives', Canterbury Terrace, off a man for £15; I know who the man is; it was about 6 o'clock on the Saturday"—I asked him to produce a receipt—he replied, "I did not have one"—I took him to the station—he there asked if he could send a wire to Mr. Ives—he was taken to Edgware, where he was charged—I was not present.</p>

Canterbury Terrace, about 14 hands 3 in.; I gave £26 for it"—I asked him where it was; he said, "I have not got it now"—I left him—I saw him again on the 20th at Harrow Road Police Station and conveyed him to Edgware—he made no answer when charged.</p>

I am a horse dealer of 49, Greenside Road, Shepherd's Bush—on August 8th I was at Aldridge's and there saw the prisoner—a man came up to him and asked him if he would buy a horse; the prisoner said he would if it was a useful horse—ultimately, I and the prisoner with the man and another one drove off to Canterbury Mews, to Mr. Ives', where the prisoner got out, took the horse and ran it up and down—I did not hear what was said—we adjourned for drink, and in the public house £15 was mentioned as the price of the horse—I saw some gold pass—the man who sold the horse was a respectable young fellow, well dressed, and looked like a man who might be reasonably selling a horse.</p>

Official" 5s., 10s. and £1—he left them with me until May 18th, when I bought them from him for £28—I paid him by this cheque, which is open, to bearer—he required payment in cash—I had not cash, so I simply gave him an open cheque—I scratched out the word "Order and put "Bearer"—my first idea was to send to the Bank for the money—instead of doing that I gave him the cheque—I asked him about the stamps in the usual way.

               <p>in regard to specimen stamps—on May 30th he went on leave of absence—before he went his stock was taken—the ordinary course is for the stock to be taken each month, but as he was going on leave, a further examination was made—he would have to hand over and account for all the stamps which had come into his possession from the double locked stock—I took part in the stock taking in conjunction with others—among other things he produced this sheet (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which purports to have on it six Inland Revenue official King's head 5s. stamps, five 10s., and five £1, and on another piece of paper there are nine 10s. Queen's head stamps—those were treated when taking stock, as being what they appear at first sight to be, and it was necessary that they should be produced so as to make up his stock—looking at them cursorily they appear to be stamps which have been accidently torn and damaged, and they were treated and taken over in that way—some of them are only rather dirty, but not fit for issue—we also took possession of some Inland Revenue official stamps over-printed specimens, there were only fourteen 5s., eleven 10s., and fourteen £1—I did not notice them much, they were as they are now (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Richards had been in possession of twenty specimens of stamps of different denominations, and upon checking those that were left I found an authority for the issue of one set of specimens (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), that is one each of 2 1/2d., 6d., 1s., 5s., 10s., and £1, so there should have been nineteen of each denomination left—there were also under his control and amongst the stock, overprinted ordinary postage stamps for 5s., 10s., and £1 specimens—he had forty-six of the 5s., thirty-two of the 10s., and fifteen of the £1—from May 30th up to July 20th there had been no overprinting of Inland Revenue official specimen, or specimen only, stamps of these denominations.</p>

I am now occupying the position that Richards held, but in another department—I am now acting for the Assistant Controller, who is in charge of the overlooked stock—Mr. Barber has the other key—an absolute record is kept in the department as to the specimen stamps that are issued or overprinted—the date of the warrant preceding the one of April 7th, withdrawing from stock the twenty stamps of different denominations, would be shown in the Charge and Discharge book, but I do not believe it is in Court—I do not think there is any book in Court which will show how many 5s., 10s., and £1 specimens remained in stock on December 31st, 1902—I do not know if there were any speci<lb/>men stamps in Richards' hands or in those of his colleague at the end of last year; the only book which would show whether he had any then would, be the book which shows the creation of the stamps; the receipts of the persons who received them are also kept; there is a list kept of the persons to whom stamps are issued—a specimen of each stamp was properly withdrawn from the number by Mr. Mallet, one of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue—I have myself got a number of specimen stamps, it is an official collection, and I take it that my predecessor in my present office had one—it was not left behind for me, and I made a new one—I did not have any of the stamps which were withdrawn by the warrant of April 7th—the only record which shows that Mr. Mallet had one of each is this letter signed by Mr. Cleve, (<hi rend="italic">Asking for a set of stamps, and that his letter</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. If two or three sets of official In<lb/>land Revenue stamps were abstracted in December, the dishonesty would be discovered before the end of the month, if the stocktakers did their duty—there is a stocktaking at the end of each month by the officials of the branch, and an independent stocktaking by an official appointed by the Board at the end of each quarter—if there was a deficiency in the Inland Revenue official stamps, it must have been discovered at all events at the end of March—if Richards had dishonestly given two sets of Inland Revenue stamps to Creeke on February 12th, it would certainly have been found out at the end of March, and probably at the end of February—on May 5th there was a surprise stocktaking; it was a special thing by some of the outside officials of the Board; no one knew of it beforehand in our department; it was practically directed to the over printed stamps—I believe that the amount came out correct; some of the stamps had been moved, but I think the total value was correct—I cannot say that the Inland Revenue official stamps were absolutely correct from my own knowledge—when a new issue is coming out, specimens are always taken from the first issue, so that they can be compared—I have a collection of stamps—I cannot say that it is complete—Richards had one also—when the sheets of stamps come from the printers, there are forty £1 stamps, fifty-six 5s. and 10s., and 240 penny on each sheet—when they had been marked "Specimen "Richards would have the custody of them—he always deputed Mr. Beckworth to hand them out—we can say what has become of the specimen stamps by comparing the number of receipts with the number of stamps created, but of the ordinary stamps an absolute record is kept—I think the new and better method with regard to the specimen stamps was adopted in April; the book was certainly kept by Richards' authority—I can find no cancellation of Inland Revenue official stamps from January to May, except on April 7th—Richards initiated the book, so that it could be seen at once who had had the stamps without hunting up the receipts—if single stamps are accidently torn, they should be put on paper to prevent them being lost—I do not believe the over locked stock book is in Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In the over locked stock there would be a stock of Inland Revenue officials of different denominations—it is from that stock that the issue stock is replenished—I should have said before that I was present at the examination of the issue stock, not the over locked stock, which was audited very rarely—I only remember one occasion—there was a small deficiency in the 10s. stamps when Richards' stock was examined; it was only £1—we were giving him credit for all the stamps being genuine—the stamps of. a common issue</p>

               <p>might get torn, but these, which were of a higher rate, would, not be so often issued, and therefore not so often handled, so there would be less likelihood of them being torn—if they were torn, it would be the right thing for them to be gummed on paper—I do not know if the stamps in question were passed again on June 30th—I asked how they came to be torn, and the explanation was given that Richards tore them accidently when they were in an envelope, and threw them away without knowing it—since then, the accounts have been gone into again, and although the actual deficiency is the same, it does not appear to be in the same stamps—at the end of June they were still credited, but they were in the hands of Mr. Highmore.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an analyst employed at the Government Laboratory at Clement's Inn Passage; it was formerly at Somerset House—I have been employed there for sixteen years; during that time I have had considerable experience in microscopical examinations of different sub<lb/>stances—I had submitted to me by Mr. Highmore, assistant solicitor to the Board of Inland Revenue, a quantity of stamps, including this piece of paper with the torn stamps pasted upon it on the lower part of it—they are all King's Head, all apparently Inland Revenue official; there are five of 5s., five of 10s., and five of 20s.; there is also a loose 5s. one which is torn, but otherwise not mutilated—the other fifteen, with two exceptions, are all torn or cut immediately below the word "Official"—the two exceptions are Nos. I and 3, 10s. stamps, and I have formed the opinion that they are genuine Inland Revenue official stamps—upon a cursory examination, all the other thirteen appear to be whole Inland Revenue officials—I have examined them, and find that they are composed from at least twenty-six different stamps—I have also examined Exhibit 31, which consists of a number of stamps which are overprinted "I. R. Official, Specimen" denominations 5s., 10s., and £1—Exhibit 32 consists of a number of postage stamps overprinted "Specimen" only, and of the same denominations—by cutting up and piecing together 'those two classes of specimen stamps it is possible to make a stamp which would appear to be an Inland Revenue official stamp without the word "Specimen"—that would be done by taking one of the Inland Revenue officials and tearing or cutting it below the word "Official," so as to have a portion Of a perfect stamp with the word "Official" on it, and then taking one of the specimen stamps, and taking the bottom of it off and putting the two together; if that was pasted on a piece of paper it would resemble an entire Inland Revenue official stamp, as on Exhibit 31, and he tally would be correct—I have examined the other pieces of stamps on Exhibit 38, they are the portions cut from the bottoms of three 10s. postage stamps (<hi rend="italic">Found in the possession of Creeke.</hi>)—the stamps from which they were cut may or may not have had the word "Speci<lb/>men" on them—I could take similar pieces from some of the 10s. stamps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080080"/>
               <p>in Exhibit 32, but not from all, because the word "Specimen" is printed too low down; you want a stamp where "Specimen" is printed especially high—there are four on this slip suited for that purpose; the same observa<lb/>tions apply to the 5s. and £1 stamps—I have microscopically examined the three 10s. stamps on Exhibit 30—I find that Nos. I and 3 are genuine, but No. 2 has been cut in half below the word "Official;" when the two parts are dropped together so as to make the pattern, there is a gap left between the two with a clean cut edge on either side—the design of the stamps is incomplete; if they belonged to the same stamp there would be a portion missing; then the stamp has been clean cut through on the left hand bottom corner, and a piece has been patched in which does not exactly meet, and which is not the exact pattern; then the margin is missing on the right side, and at that place there is an overlapping of the pattern; there is not a clear margin in the original stamp, and if the two portions had belonged to the same stamp the measurement of the margin would have agreed, but at the only place where you can measure it the margin is missing on the original stamp; it is not distinct on the left, and it has been cut away on the right—stamp No. 2 has been made up of five pieces, and numbering them from the top the pieces above the word "Official" are from the same stamp, the other three pieces, I think, are not—No. 4 is divided into four pieces—the two upper pieces are from one stamp and agree one with the other, the two lower portions are from another stamp—the right hand lower portion does not agree in any way with either of the portions of the stamp that are there—the perforation on the right hand bottom side, is narrower than that of the other side, and could not have belonged to any of the other stamps of that row—part three of that stamp is attached too close to the other part; it should be lowered a little at the right hand bottom corner in order to make the full size of a genuine stamp; there is a considerable portion of the stamp missing—the stamps have been divided by a sharp instrument—No. 3 stamp is composed of four pieces, and one part of the stamp is missing, that is the margin on the left hand bottom corner—the right hand bottom piece shows too much duplication of the pattern where it joins the next piece—the piece at the bottom of the left hand side is too near the upper piece, and if separated to make the proper sides of a correct stamp it would show very clearly a gap with a clean cut edge on either side—the 5s. and £1 stamps on this piece of paper are made up in a similar way to the 10s. ones, and in every case are divided under the word "Official" and made up of more than one stamp—I find that in the block of stamps in Exhibit 30 in the left hand corner a portion of a stamp which coincides exactly with the corner which is missing from No. 3 of the £1 Inland Revenue specimen—if what I say is correct the stamp upon Exhibit 30, which appears to be an Inland Revenue official stamp, must be an Inland Revenue official specimen.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant.</hi>) In May I was making inquiries at the instance of the Solicitor for Inland Revenue with regard to matters connected with stamps—On May 25th I visited Creeke—I told him I was a police officer and that I had been deputed by the Inland Revenue to make certain inquiries concerning overprinted official stamps, and in consequence of my inquiry I had found he had sold several stamps, and I wanted to know where he got them—he said, "Am I bound to tell you?"—I said, "That is a matter for you; I have got the inquiry to make and I want to know"—he said, "I don't feel disposed to tell you"—I told him I should take it that his answer to me was no, and that I would convey his message to the Inland Revenue—when I was about to leave he said, "You can make this proviso, I will ask my friend from whom I got them"—I said, "I will make no proviso," and I left him—I continued my inquiries, and on June 9th I had a warrant granted by Sir Albert de Rutzen for Creeke's arrest—I arrested him about 1.45 outside the Law Courts that day—I told him I had a warrant for his arrest—he said, "What for?" I said, "For receiving official stamps"—he said, "Do you mean the Office of Works stamps?"—I said, "Yes, and there will probably be a further charge of receiving other stamps"—on the way to the station he said, "I have never had any others except the Office of Works', except a few Mr. Purcell gave me years ago"—at the station I read the warrant to him and he made no reply—he was searched, and upon him I found a pocket book and certain documents and some stamps: in the pocket book I found eight 1d. Inland Revenue stamps over-printed "I. R. Official," and these three pieces of stamps (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>)—that same day I saw Mr. Highmore and handed to him the different things that I found on Creeke—among them I gave him the three pieces of stamps—on June 11th Creeke came to New Scotland Yard, where I was—he was out on bail—he wanted to know what he was charged with and said, "If I give you the connecting link as between me and the person from whom I got the stamps, do you think it will assist"—I said, "I can make no terms with you, but if you make a statement to me I will take it down"—I wrote down his statement and he signed it afterwards—</p>

               <p>when I got to the words "I did not even then connect his father with it" he stopped me—I asked him about the Inland Revenue stamps he had sold to Mr. Ginn, and he then went on dictating the statement—I witnessed the statement, and then said, "Are you sure you have told me everything?" and he went on, "I had altogether five sets of Inland Revenue official 5s., 10s., and £1 stamps, King's head: one I sold to Mr. Jones, stamp dealer, Strand, for £15; two sets I sold to Mr. H J. White, of No. 8, Whitehall Place, for £42, and the other two sets I sold to Ginn for £28," and he signed it again—on June 20th I was with Ser<lb/>geant Palfrey, when I arrested Richards on a warrant—he was taken to Bow Street Police Station—he made no statement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Reed.—When I first went to Creeke's office I gave the clerk my card before Creeke came in—I was in plain clothes—I told Creeke I was a police officer, and he had my card in his hand—I did not conduct myself in rather an offensive or over-bearing manner—I did not insist upon his supplying me with information—he did not say, "I feel some difficulty about giving you the name of the man from whom I received these, because I have promised my friend that I would not mention his name in the matter"—he said he would see his friend—he said he had not got the stamps from an official—I made a note of what he said shortly after I left his office—I have looked at it since—when I searched Creeke, Waterhouse (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) was sitting in the corner with his eyes shut—this was about 1.30 p.m.—Waterhouse had been there about an hour—I do not know if he looked at Creeke—these three pieces of stamps I took from Creeke; I am sure of that—a list of the stamps found on him was made on the back of a visiting card—I asked him about the Inland Revenue stamps—he said he did not know where he got them—I said, "You had better take a note of what I am going to take from you," and he did so—I did not check the list; he has got it—its object was for him to know what I had taken—on the last occasion I said I had had it, but I had another card in my mind—I did not want the list: I had the stamps themselves—when I made a list of the stamps found on him I did not include the pieces of stamps, because at that time I was dealing with official and mis-perforated stamps—I noticed the mis-perforated stamps because I had been given to understand that it was impossible for them to get into the hands to the public, as they were destroyed—Mr. Moore told me that—I did not hear him say at the Police Court that he had no knowledge of these peculiarities, or that he had gone to Percy Richards and asked him if he had seen these postal curiosities—I do not know that these mis-per<lb/>forated stamps were bought over the counter at Chancery Lane Post Office—I have not confused Creeke's property with anybody else's—I have not manufactured the three pieces of stamps for this case, I should not do such a thing—I sent a bogus telegram—the case was before the Magistrate and dismissed—I never saw the 10s. stamps before I arrested Creeke, and I handed them to Mr. Highmore.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Assistant Solicitor to the Inland Revenue in June; I have now been appointed Solicitor to the Board of Customs—I had charge of the inquiries with regard to the misapplication of overprinted stamps—I was present at Bow Street Police Court on June 9th, when Creeke was arrested, and on that day communicated with Ward with a view of knowing what had been found on Creeke—before June 9th there had only been evidence of arrest—on June 9th, before Ward gave his evidence, he brought me at the police court a purse or wallet which he had found on Creeke; I opened it and found therein the stamps which were produced on that day, Exhibit 42; I took them out of the pocket book myself, and selected what should be put in evidence—I also found in the wallet these three small pieces of stamps, Exhibit 38—there had then been no reference at all in the infor<lb/>mation or otherwise to the existence of anything of that kind—I did not at that time appreciate the importance of them, but finding them there with the other documents, they have since remained in my official custody; they were placed in the same envelope as Exhibit 42, and after Ward gave his evidence they were made a separate Exhibit—it was on July 14th that the importance of these three pieces of stamps first became apparent—on Saturday, July 11th, I had occasion to ask the Controller for the production of the Inland Revenue official stamps overprinted; on the Monday I was at the police court, and on Tuesday he produced those stomps to me and then I found they were short in 5s., 15s., and £1 stamps; after some further inquiry, the sheet of three other stamps, Exhibit 30,. was brought to me, and I then realised the importance of it—my opinion' at the time was that instead of the Exhibit consisting of damaged stamps, these separate stamps were made up of parts of other stamps, as was proved by the expert yesterday—Ward had nothing to do with the dis<lb/>covery of the importance of these pieces; it was entirely myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. REED</hi>. The discovery was made on July 14th, and the stamps were submitted to the expert for examination, and he was called on this subject on July 20th, at the first hearing after the discovery—I believe there was no reference to these three pieces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080084"/>
               <p>of stamps till the 27th; in fact, it was impossible to get through the evidence as quickly as we should have liked at Bow Street*; the witnesses were there but were not called—I did not at the time make a list of the property handed me by Ward as having been found on Creeke; I put the property in two envelopes—I first made a list, I should think, about two months ago, about a month after his arrest—it is not my general practice to make a list of property handed me by police officers in cases which they have to investigate; such property is placed in envelopes and kept under lock and key—all the stamps enumerated by Ward in his evidence, as well as these three pieces, were in the wallet at the time he handed it to me; I pledge myself to that—I think there were also in it some ordinary postage stamps which were returned—I recognised that these three portions of stamps were portions of 10s. stamps, not 10s. I.E. necessarily—there are 10s. stamps in blue which are sold to the public, besides those with I.E.—I was aware at that time of the provisions of the Stamps Management Act—it struck me as strange that a gentleman should have in his possession three portions of mutilated 10s. stamps; that was why I kept them—I believe I did not hand back to Ward the three pieces for the purpose of his evidence—I took them out of the pocket book on that day—it does not strike me as strange that no mention was made of the three pieces in Ward's deposition; I did not know the importance of them; I thought it curious that he should have the three pieces, but I knew he was in the habit of coming to Somerset House, and I thought they might be printer's waste, or something of that sort—it did not strike me as being suspicious; he had other stamps which showed he took an interest in curiosities, and I thought they might be curios—there is no possibility of doubt as to my having seen these pieces on June 9th, and they were all in this envelope—they were not produced at the police court or referred to till July 27th—on the committal I was in possession of the same information as I am now as to the building up of these other stamps spoken to yesterday by the expert—I cannot say why the Magis<lb/>trate was not asked to commit the prisoners on the charge upon which they are now indicted; I instructed Counsel and Mr. Muir is responsible for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. On July 16th, I began to appreciate the importance of these three pieces; I asked for the stamps to be produced, and found some missing, and I came to the conclusion that these pieces might have been cut from the overprinted specimens—the first intimation Walter Richards had that a new charge in connection with these <hi rend="italic">faked</hi> stamps was going to be produced against him was when I wrote on Sep<lb/>tember 4th to his solicitor and stated that an additional indictment would be prepared against some of the prisoners for forgery, and I sent with it a sheet of paper giving the old and the new charges—a considerable number of witnesses were called at Bow Street; I did not give a list of them to Walter Richards but their names are endorsed on the indict<lb/>ment—the deficiency in the specimens left by Walter Richards was five as eight 10s., and five 20s. stamps—if it required 26 stamps to make up the 13 patched up stamps Walter Richards must have used some other stamps;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080085"/>
               <p>these are official stamps—sheets of ordinary stamps do not run in any order—I cannot say whether Walter Richards is responsible for that; they were in his custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On June 9th Creeke was brought before the Magistrate at nearly 4 o'clock—as to stamps that might be used in making up these stamps on the sheet, only six ordinary specimens seem to have been picked out—on examining a sheet of this kind, I find a specimen is printed higher up—in my opinion, there has clearly been a selection of the stamps that have been taken off.</p>

I am Registrar of the Admiralty Works Department at 21, Northumberland Avenue—the prisoner was employed there under me as temporary accountant clerk—he had not come into the Civil Service by competition, but was taken on for a time—he was continuously employed there from December 23rd, 1901, till he was arrested on June 9th—at that date his pay was at the rate of 5s. 6d. per day; it was settled monthly—he was liable to be dismissed at the end each month—he sat in my room, which is very large; sixteen persons were employed there, including myself—I am supplied, on my request as I require them, with a stock of Government parcel stamps—I fill up a form for the purpose—the stamps are used for placing on Government parcels—they are so over-printed—no one in the department is allowed to use them for any other purpose—they are kept in a, locked drawer in my table—I used to issue them to the post clerk, Sutton, in small quantities when he wanted a further supply to carry on with—he is suffering from consumption; I have a certificate to that effect—he does not bear the least resemblance to the prisoner—during the day the key of the drawer would be either in my possession or left in the drawer during my presence in the room—at night time the key was kept in a box at the back of my table—the box was not locked—I left about 5 p.m., or when it was convenient, and the clerks remained till 6.30 or 7—in my temporary absence Birch had charge of the stamps—no one besides Birch and myself would know what stock of stamps I had in the office—during January I was only absent from the office two days; Birch would be in charge then—when I left the office in the day time I took the key with me—the</p>

               <p>prisoner had nothing to do with the official stamps, his duty was tracing records; when a document was wanted I directed him to search for it and bring it to me—a great deal of that is done in my department—on February 10th, in the evening, I think, I went to my drawer to issue some official stamps and found the envelope in which were 404 penny. 357 2d., and 07 6d. Government parcel stamps when I had last seen it, empty—my entire stock had gone—they must have been taken out of the envelope and the envelope replaced—I never found or traced the stamps—I had during January nine 1s. stamps in stock, but seven were used on January 6th, and two on January 20th—from January 20th until February 18th I had no is stamps in stock at all—I knew that and Birch would know it; it was nobody else's business to know it—I reported the loss of the stamps immediately to the Accountant General's Department and inquired of all the men in the Registry if they could assist me in throwing" light on the disappearance, without result—the heads of the department had the idea that the stamps could not have been stolen because they were of no use to anyone—they were written off as having been abstracted from my drawer, and that was all that was done about it—until I missed the stock on February 10th I believed it was quite correct—to the best of my belief the prisoner, who is now clean shaven, had a very slight moustache some months ago, I hardly like to fix the date as January.</p>

               <p>less than 900 stamps altogether—I think it is very doubtful if I should' have noticed on February 3rd if over 500 stamps had been abstracted before that date—I had no 1s. stamps on February 3rd—the nine 1s. stamps I had in January were issued quite regularly, and so far as I know were applied to parcels and sent off—I cannot say that anybody in the office was suspected when the stamps were missed—I cannot say whether it was thought they had got lost in some way; I believe all waste paper was examined by my direction to see if they had got among that—I wanted to take every step I could—I was in attendance at Bow Street on several days; there were eight or nine remands—the prisoner was charged in conjunction with four other persons, three Richardses and Creeke—I believe I heard Mr. Moore's evidence on the first occasion there—I heard the evidence of a number of stamp dealers—I cannot honestly say I heard those witnesses speak to extensive dealings with the Richardses in Government parcel stamps—I know several cheques were produced, I do not know what for; I did not follow the evidence clearly—I cannot swear that a cheque was found on Richards from Moore for £10—the prisoners were charged with stealing stamps from the Admiralty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Works Department of the Admiralty, and I was in the same room as the prisoner; ten or twelve others were employed there—towards the end of January this year the prisoner showed me a collection of Brazilian stamps at the office, and gave me one of each value for my collection; these are they—they have been through the post—a few days after that I and others were out at lunch,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080088"/>
               <p>and when half way down Villiers Street the prisoner said he was going to bell the foreign stamps that ho had, and he went away down Villiers Street, and afterwards at the office he said he had sold the Brazilians—I have since seen Mr. Moore's shop; it is at the bottom of Villiers Street, on the right, going down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I can remember this conversation took place towards the end of January, four or five days from the end, perhaps; I cannot remember if it was more—I do not think it would be a week before—we had been lunching together—I was friendly with him; we were fellow-clerks—we were going down the street when we talked about stamps—the conversation was not about Government stamps; they were never mentioned—I examined the stamps he had and picked out one of each; they were Brazilian—the prisoner walked down towards the end of Villiers Street—I knew there was a stamp dealer's down there—you can go from there by the District Railway Station into Northumberland Avenue—going up Northumberland Avenue and turning to the right you come into the Strand, and there are plenty of stamp dealers there—I have never seen a stamp dealer's in Northumberland Avenue; I have never looked for one—I was first spoken to about giving evidence in this case after my holidays, about June 17th or 18th, after the prisoner's arrest—he said he was going to sell them, and after lunch that day he told us he had sold them—he said he had got 1s. 6d. for the lot—I cannot remember that he said they were not worth more than that—I first had occasion to recall these words in June; I had forgotten the incident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stamp dealer at 3, Villiers Street, which is opposite Charing Cross underground station, at the bottom of the street—I know the prisoner—I first met him in January at my shop—I can fix the date from a note I have in my pocket; I had it at Bow Street, and I got it from my ledger—I have my ledger here—it was January 7th, I think—he brought in a few foreign stamps to sell me and I gave him 1s. or 2s., I cannot say exactly—they were some Malta, and I believe some Java stamps—no others that I know of—there were about fifty stamps and several varieties—after I had bought them he asked me about unused Govern<lb/>ment parcels, and wanted to know if they were of any value—I said they were—he said he had got a strip of four 1s. ones for sale—I offered him 10s. for them—he said he would accept it and bring the stamps in the evening—he brought them in the evening, and I bought them and paid him 10s.—he then said he could get me some more if I would buy them, and I said I would buy all he could bring—I have been engaged in the stamp trade just about a year—I did not know these stamps were never issued to the public—I said I would take all he could get, because I found I could get £1 each for those he sold me; I was doing good business by it; it does not</p>

               <p>often come—I asked the prisoner where he got them from—he said a friend of his was in one of the Government offices and had a large number of parcels to post and he saved the stamps and substituted ordinary stamps which he bought at a post office—I next saw the prisoner on January 13th, when he came in and passed me some stamps done up in a newspaper, and said it was a large lot, and asked me to look through them, and he would call for the money later on—I open my shop between 10 and 10.15; on the 13th I opened it at 10, and the prisoner came in about a minute afterwards—he was waiting outside—I let myself in; I do not keep a clerk or a boy—another customer, Alfred Lamb, was also waiting outside, and he came in first and was in the shop when the prisoner came in—I opened the parcel and showed Lamb the stamps, which were Government parcels, and said, "This is what he has just sold me"—I think there were half a sheet of 1d., about 130:120 2d., 20 1s., 40 or 80 6d., and 10 9d.—I had been making enquiries about the value of the stamps, and had heard they were very scarce; that was why they fetched such a large price—it did not occur to me to ask what the prisoner did for his living; it was not my business—I gave him £7 10s., double the face value, for the stamps when he came in the evening—the stamps were not separate but in sheets—I had a market ready for the stamps—two days later, on the 15th, the prisoner came again at 7 p.m., and brought me a small quantity of stamps for which I paid him £3 5s., double the face value—the following week, about the 22nd, he sold me an entire sheet of 240 1d. stamps, and I paid him double the face value; £2—I had got a market for them—I sold them to Mr. Healy for £6 15s., I think—he is a stamp dealer in the city—Exhibit No. 3 is half the sheet I bought from the prisoner and sold to Healy; I put a pencil mark in the margin at the time—on the prisoner's third visit, about January 22nd, I said, "Can you get me any more 1s. Government parcels"—he said, "We have run out of them at present, but we shall have some more in in about three weeks, but they may be King's heads, not Queen's"—I never asked him his name—on January 30th. I bought from him 120 2d. Queen's head unused Government parcels, and paid him £5—I have notes which are the result of searching my ledger and comparison of dates with Mr. Field to whom I sold stamps—my ledger entry is simply money paid out and money received; there is nothing in my books to indicate the person who was there, but merely the amount—looking at the amount I have to say from recollection who the person was—I first saw Sergeant Ward in connection with the inquiry as to Government stamps about February 1st, two days after the prisoner's last visit to my shop—I gave him a description of persons who had sold me Government stamps—I had bought Government stamps from other persons—I gave him a description of Richards first of all—I gave him a description of the prisoner; I cannot say if it was at the same time or afterwards—I knew that for some time after I gave the description Ward was keeping watch on my shop to see if he came there—I undertook to let Ward know if he came—the prisoner did not come until May 16th, about mid-day, when he said the stamps had been missed from the office, and he had been wanting to come in for some time, but did not care to—I recog<lb/>nised</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a fairly good memory—I am not very clear about these dates—I consulted another person about them before the prisoner, was arrested—my evidence about the dates when the prisoner visited me is the result of conversation with a third person and reference to my ledger, my ledger was not enough—I cannot say whether the prisoner came to my shop on January 30th—I have been in the stamp business about a year, or it might be fifteen months—I had been a stamp collector before that, since I was seven years old—I am now about twenty-lour—I did not know the value of these Government parcel stamps when the prisoner first spoke to me about them—I saw no stamp guides till I started dealing—I started dealing without inquiring into the value of any stamps—I know stamp guide? are published which contain the prices and values of various stamps—I purchased a guide as soon as I started dealing and read it—it simply said that Stanley Gibbons, the publisher of the guide, did not deal in Government parcel stamps, and gave no further information about them—I inferred nothing from the fact that the largest dealers would have nothing to do with them—I was twenty-three then—when I made inquiries I knew they were worth more than</p>

               <p>their face value—I had not purchased any before I made inquiries—I said I would buy them, and I immediately made inquiries and bought them in the evening—I was told then I could get 15s. for them—I did not think anything about the leading firm not having anything to do with them; I saw they dealt in some official stamps and not in others—I think the prisoner first came to my shop on January 7th—I can swear to it if I can look at my notes, not without—I made these notes before I went to see Mr. Highmore at Somerset House, after Ward arrested the man—I saw Mr. Highmore about the middle of February, I cannot say the date—I have never before been to see a solicitor about a matter of criminal prosecution—the date did not impress itself on my mind, the incident did—by my ledger it was February 7th when the prisoner first came to my shop—the whole entry in my ledger is, "Received £3 17s. 6d.; paid out 17s.," there is no entry about the stamps having been received from the prisoner—it is from that entry and written evidence of another dealer to whom I sold them, which I have seen, that I say the prisoner visited my shop then—there is nothing in the ledger to show that I pur<lb/>chased any stamps from the prisoner—the fact that I paid out £3 17s. shows that on January 7th I purchased stamps—I do not pay out for anything else—I have my rent and advertisements to pay for—if I paid 17s. 6d. for advertisements I should enter it as advertisements, but buying stamps are shop purchases, and I do not put "stamps" against them—I can show entries with "advertisements" against them—the prisoner next came on January 13th; my ledger entry is "Received £7 15s. 1d. and paid out £31 15s. 10d. for the week"—I have entered these at the end of the week, the expenditure for the week—in my day book the entry is, "Paid out £4 17s, 6d."; £3 5s. was for stamps and £1 12s. 6d. for collec<lb/>tions; against the £1 12s. 6d. there is" collections "; there is nothing against the £3 5s—I have a note in my pocket made afterwards as to what stamps I purchased that day—I can tell from memory that there were twenty 1s. ones—the subsequent entries are in a similar form to those I have just read, just giving the totals for the day—I am quite clear that I pur<lb/>chased from the same person who sold me those stamps, twenty-four 1s. stamps altogether between January 7th and 30th—in January I was only dealing in Government stamps with one person—I began to deal with a second person on February 2nd or 3rd—I am sure of that—those did not include Government parcel stamps; they were Office of Works official stamps—Sergeant Ward called on me on February 1st about Government parcel stamps—I swear he did not come to inquire about Office of Works stamps—I do not know that the only inquiries that were being made at that time were about stamps supposed to be missing from Somerset House—they thought they might have come from Somerset House—I did not hear that these stamps were not missed till February 10th—I do not know when they were supposed to have been stolen—when Ward called on February 1st the inquiry was about parcel stamps—I do not know that it was not discovered till February 10th that the parcel stamps were missing—I am certain that on February 1st I was being asked by the detective about Government parcel stamps; I</p>

               <p>was told they were stolen—two days after another man came to me with Government stamps over printed Office of Works—it did not strike me as singular—he came four times—I paid on an average £10 a set and got from 12 to 15 guineas—Stanley Gibbons put in their catalogue that those stamps were allowed to be bought, and I did not think there was anything wrong about them—I did not ask the man who sold them where he got them from, I did not think it was necessary—I saw they were catalogued and allowed to be sold—I saw Ward three or four times, and whether I gave him a description of a man the first or fourth time I cannot say—he told me I had purchased some and I admitted it—he asked me from whom I had purchased them, and I told him from a young chap; I did not tell him the name because I did not know it—I do not think I gave him a description of him at the time—the sergeant was satisfied; he said, "When is he coming again"—he did not want a description at that time—the first person I gave a description of to Ward was young Richards—he did not call till two days after the sergeant called—he had not sold me any Government parcel stamps—I did not give Ward a description of a man as selling me Government parcel stamps who had not sold me any—I first saw Richards on either February 1st or 2nd, and I saw Ward about February 1st; it may have been before or after I saw Richards—I did not give Ward, a description the first time I saw him, he was in and out of my office three or four days—I did not give a description of Richards immedi<lb/>ately he came to deal with me—Ward was coming in and out for a fort<lb/>night, and Richards was coming in and out of my shop for more than a fortnight after that time—I cannot form any idea when Ward first inquired of me about stamps other than Government parcel stamps—I think I was dealing in stamps with Richards down till April, all Office of Works stamps—I asked him where he got them from, and he said he got the damaged stamps from a friend of his, and they were put on parcels in substitution for good stamps which he kept—I think altogether I pur<lb/>chased from Richards five sets and three odd ones, 3 go to a set—I did not refer stamps supplied to me by Richards to Healey—I do not know that he was supplying Healey at this time, I swear it—I did not know they were dealing with hundreds of these over-printed stamps till Richards was arrested—I continued to see Richards and have conversa<lb/>tions with him about the police, although I thought I could deal with these stamps legitimately—he told me his name was Richards—I gave a description of him to Ward because Ward inquired about some others which Richards had in his possession—I gave that description before I gave any description of the prisoner—Ward told me the stamps must have been improperly come by, and I still went on dealing with Richards in Office of Works stamps—Mr. Lamb lives at Ealing, and is manager of the Shaftesbury Theatre; he is a stamp collector—he was at my shop on January 15th, at the same time as the prisoner—I did not say a word about that at the police court because I did not know Lamb's address, he was only a casual customer—I have known him since—that was eight months ago—I have not seen him regularly since; I have seen him several times—he has been away touring—between January and</p>

Whenever I had a fight with anybody I always faced Mm even if I fight with my hands, or if I fight with a knife or revolver I always would face anybody. He (Thorne) always treated me bad. I said to Thorne, 'You have always treated me bad, you take your knife in your hand, and I take my knife in my hand, and we will settle that.' When he came from the w. c. he looked at me with contempt, and said, 'You f----bastard.' I then called him a son of a bitch, and at that moment I stabbed him, and he ran towards the forecastle. The ship's carpenter knows he has beaten and struck me when we were in the port at Alexandria. The carpenter said he would be a witness for me. I should like, as I am a foreigner, and cannot speak English, to have someone to speak for me at my trial. My witnesses I mentioned at the Police Court, Pedro Georgio, and an Italian I do not know by name, did not see me stab Thorne, as they were not present.

(<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter.</hi>) I am a milliner living with my father and sister—the prisoner Lichtenstein is my sister—about the end of June I gave her £15 to put into the London Provident Savings Bank for me—I told her to open an account for me and bring back a book—she brought back a book with £15 entered in it—she told me afterwards that when I gave her the £15 in three £5 notes to bank, she, having had a watch repaired, had called at the shop of two men named Silberstein for the watch, and asked for the address of the bank, and one of the men asked her "What have you to do with the bank?"; that she said, "I have to take money to the bank for my sister," and the elder Silber<lb/>stein said, "Show me the money, I have never yet seen bank notes," and she showed it to him, and Philip Silberstein said, "Give me £5 "; that £2 were taken away from her and she took £13 only to the bank, and an alteration in the bank book was made by Silberstein—that she, accom<lb/>panied by Eva Silberstein had withdrawn the money from the bank, and her brother waited near the bank—this withdrawal receipt was shown me at the bank—both signatures, "Lena Lichtenstein" and "Clara Lichtenstein" are my sister's writing—I never gave her any authority to withdraw any of the £15, nor did I receive any of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Provident Savings Bank—on July 23rd Lena Liechtenstein came there—she said something to me, but I do not remember what—I told her on account of the report I had heard, she was to fetch her sister Clara—on June 27th she came with another woman whom I cannot identify, who she said was her sister Clara—I handed this form of receipt to Lena—I told her to write her own name and the name in which she opened the account—she wrote her own name, and also. "Clara Lichtenstein" on the right side of the paper—the other person wrote the other two signatures, "Clara Lichtenstein"—I put my initials to the receipt and in the book—they were then passed on to the cashier for payment of the money.</p>

I am manager of the Goswell Road branch of the Royal British Bank—Ellis had an account there up to March 21st this year—on the 21st £87 10s., all the money to the credit of the account, was paid out by order of the High Court—I produce a certified copy of the account—in it there is a record of a cheque signed by Ellis for £10, presented on April 7th, and returned marked "Refer to drawer"—on June 2nd this cheque for £3 was presented and returned unpaid.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant.</hi>) On August 27th, about 5 p.m., Mr. Martin called me to arrest the prisoner for stealing a bicycle—he said he had met with an accident in the Edgware Road, and felt too queer to return to Mr. Martin, but took it to Frith Street, Soho, and gave it to a man named Arthur—when charged at the station he made no reply—at the police court I heard the prisoner give evidence upon oath, and saw him sign his deposition—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "I am the defendant. I live at 3, Dallion Street, Kennington. Having been out of work for six weeks, and having no lodging and no friends, I did not like to let them know how low down I was. This young man asked me if I would like to earn a shilling or two; I said yes. He said he wanted to borrow a bicycle and to raise money of some friends at Harlesden, as he was in want himself. He asked me if I knew where to borrow one. I knew of Mr. Martin, where I used to hire bicycles, and went to him and got a bicycle and took it to his lodgings in Frith Street He said he was going to Harlesden, and told me to meet him at Chapel Street between six and seven, and he would, give me the bicycle and the money to pay for it and something for myself. I went there, and stopped till seven o'clock and did not see him. I went back to Lyle Street and met him. He said he must have missed me on the road and had got the bicycle at home. I said I should like to take it back at once. He said he wanted to keep it till Sunday afternoon to enable him to see some more friends. I consented to that. I did not see him on the Sunday. On the Monday I went and saw his landlord. He told me the man had gone, bicycle and all. I failed to find him since. I hired the bicycle for two hours. I had known the young man a year. I knew him as Arthur. He said he was a commercial traveller. I did not live with him."</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant.</hi>) On July 22nd, at 2.30 p.m., I went with Mr. Lewis, the prosecutor, and other detectives to 2, West Place, Chapel Street, Islington, the prisoners' dwelling and storehouse—I saw them there, and said I was a police officer, and produced this piece of lace and said, "Have you any lace like this?"—they both said, "No"—the female prisoner took it out of my hand and said, "Oh, yes, I have got some like that; I bought it of? a man yesterday morning"—I said, "Who is he? What's his name?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "Can you describe him?"—she said, "No"—she then produced a small piece of lace—I asked her if she had any more—she said, "Yes"—we then went to the first floor, which is a bed room, and stored with goods all round the room—from behind some boxes she took these four pieces of lace—I said, "Have you anything else?"—she then produced these blinds—I asked her to account for the possession of them—she said, "I bought them of the same man as I bought the lace of; I gave him 1 1/2d. a yard for the lace"—I said, "How much did you give him in all?"—she could not say—the male prisoner then handed me this paper bag with the name on it of "George Watson, 324, City Road"—there was a Watson there, but not the same Christian name—he voluntarily came to the police station, and was placed with a number of men, and the prisoners saw them—they both said the man from whom they bought the lace was not there—I then charged the prisoners with stealing and receiving this quantity of lace and the blinds and trolley, the property of Mr. Lewis—the male prisoner said he knew nothing at all about it—the female said, "I admit I bought them"—I charged them on July 30th at the Mansion House with stealing, on July 13th, 1903, 576 boxes of coloured crayon pencils, value £13 4s., the goods of the Eagle Pencil Company—the male prisoner said, "I know nothing at all about it—the female prisoner said, "I bought them from a man named Reddish</p>

               <p>in Goswell Road about eighteen months or two years ago"—I then read a further charge of stealing on July 15th, 1903, 448 yards of white lace and one gross of corset laces, the property of James Pickworth, of Bread Street, value £1 18s. Id.—she said, "I bought that of Mr. Kaplowitch"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The house at West Place was packed with goods—the stolen goods were not hidden—the prisoners have not been identified as being in any way connected with these robberies—no one saw anybody take the goods away—it was a larceny from the street—I was not told that the blinds had been cut up and exposed for sale on the stall—the paper bag with the name of "Watson" on was produced from near the bottom of a file with receipts and invoices on it—the prisoners carry on a fairly large business—they have been customers of some of the largest firms, such as Rylands; Foster, Porter, &amp; Co., and others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a maker of embroidered goods, of 42a, Noble Street, and Crawford Passage, Farringdon Street, E.C.—these goods are mine—on July 17th, at 3.40 p.m., I gave my man Pardoe a large basket with six boxes to deliver, value of about £5—the lace is sold whole<lb/>sale at 3£d. and retail 6d. a yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think this lace is an article that would be sold by any firm in job lots—job lots of stuff undoubtedly get on the stalls of the prisoners' class of people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a machinist, employed by Mr. Lewis—on July 18th, the day after these things were stolen, I took a walk down Chapel Street—I passed the female prisoner's stall and looked at the goods thereon—I saw some of the lace belonging to my employer—I asked the price and was told 2d. a yard—I went away without buying any—on July 21 I went with a detective down Chapel Street—we passed the female prisoner's stall—I bought three yards of the lace at 2d. a yard—I took it home and it was compared with a pattern we had and found to be the same.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190309080116"/>
               <p>they were subsequently charged—the female prisoner admitted buying the goods; the male prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no special time for the money to be paid—the prisoner was the only banker of the Society—Blackman has told me that the object of the prosecution is to get the money.</p>

I am a cab driver, of 19, Ralph Street, Union Road—on July 4th, about 2.45 a.m., I saw some smoke coming from the shutters and window of 67, East Street, which has a window in King and Queen Street—I did not notice any smoke coming through the side door—I heard the crackling of fire—I gave the alarm and informed Police Constable Neilson—it was then between, dark and daylight—I saw and heard nobody at the shop—I thought at first the place was empty—when the constable came to the alarm, he told me to wait till the firemen came.</p>

About 2.45 a.m., on July 4th, Newson spoke to me—I went to 67, East Street—I saw smoke coming from the door and windows of the shop and the private house next to it—I knocked at the door and got no answer—I procured an axe and broke in the house door in King and Queen Street, which led at once into the front kitchen—as I entered I found a fire in the cupboard on my right, which was on the side of the fire place—I did not notice if it had a door—it was burning fiercely and flames were coming out—there was no fire in the fire place—I went into the back kitchen, and on the left hand side of the back kitchen, on the stairs, I noticed another fire about three or four steps up—it was a large fire and flaring up at the time—those were the only two fires I noticed—I helped to put them out, they were distinct fires and about twelve feet apart—I noticed a smell of paraffin—I did not see or hear anybody on the premises up to that time—I then went through 74, King and Queen Street—there were people in the house; I woke them up; I went through their house into the back yard—when I was in the back kitchen of 67, I saw the door, there was an iron bedstead against it, and I came to the conclusion that the door was a fixture—when I got into the yard of 74, I was separated from the yard of 67 by a wooden fence—two of us knocked it down, and when we got into the yard we found the prisoner; she only had her nightdress on; she had a baby in her arms—she said, "Sir, do save my baby"—I asked if there was anybody in the house—she said, "No, there is only me and the baby at home"—I did not know her—I asked where her husband was—she said, "He went away two or three days ago"—I saw a blanket lying in the yard; the first floor window was open from the bottom about half way and had this piece of cord hanging out (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it was hanging down for about four feet; it was fixed to this pole which was inside the window—I took the prisoner and the child into No. 74; she seemed to be calm—I again asked her if there was anyone at home, and she said, "No, my husband went away to Ireland yesterday."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Salvage Corps at South wark Bridge Road—a little after 3 a.m., on July 4th, I went to 07, East Street—I went in at the private door in King and Queen Street—the fire was practically out when I got there—I first examined the cupboard by the front kitchen—the fop part of the cupboard had been very severely burned, and the corresponding cupboard in the back kitchen was also burned—I am rather doubtful if the fire had burned its way through the lath and plaster partition—the cupboard in the front kitchen ran from the ground practically to the ceiling; there were shelves in it—it was formed by the space on each side of the chimney breast—the fire began about 4 ft. from the ground—there was no fire on the floor inside—the cupboard in the back kitchen was in the recess—the fire had evidently</p>

               <p>occurred somewhat higher than that in the front part—there were shelves in the back one also—there was a hole about a foot long in the partition between the two cupboards, and if it was caused by the fire I should have expected to see portions of lath and plaster lying about, but I failed to see any—I have seen a large number of fires—to the best of my judgment there had been two fires, one in each cupboard—I went up the stairs; I noticed that paraffin oil had been spilt on three or four of them—they were not much burned, but in the bend, about half way up, there was evidence of a fire having taken place there—there was some wicker work there—the paraffin was on the left edge of the stairs as I went up; there was a small piece of carpet on them in the centre of the tread—the wicker work had partly charred the boarding on the staircase and the paper over it—the flames had only ascended the staircase three or four step's—the wooden partition on the left of the stairs, had been recently sawed away for three or four feet; that would make the staircase wider—I next went to the room on the top floor over the shop—I saw a couch in the room, on the seat of which were a number of unspent matches; an easy chair standing near it had had the outside covering removed; the inside covering had a hole in it from which shavings were protruding and unspent matches were spread about it; there was a carpet on the floor, and a goodish number of unspent matches and pieces of shavings were spread about—this photograph correctly shows the position of the couch and chair—I then went down and looked at the cupboard on the stairs; its door was closed; inside I saw that there had been a fire on the floor—there were three or four pieces of wood which had the appearance of having been part of the partition on the staircase, and had apparently been erected in the shape of a tripod; there was some charred paper on the floor; across the top was a large piece of wood, and it looked as if the tripod had given way and the larger piece of wood had fallen down and extinguished the paper—that had nothing to do with the fire on the stairs—I went into the shop" and saw an empty wooden box standing just inside the door leading from the front parlour—inside the box were three or four boxes of matches, and lying on the top of the box was a spent match and the corner of one of the boxes was partly charred; it looked as if the match had been struck and laid on the top of the box, but had not had the desired effect; it is rather difficult to burn a box of matches—along the counter there were chiefly empties representing stock—there were numbers of matches along the fixtures and shelves—I do not remember seeing any on the counter—I went upstairs again into the back bedroom; there was a bed close against the window—unless you went round the foot of the bed you would have to get over it to get to the window—to get out of the window you would have to get on the bed—this cornice piece (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was hanging inside the window and lying on the bed—the string was hanging outside the window—the pole was not fixed above the window; there was another pole with fittings at the top of the window; this pole was not jammed against the window; it could not be pulled out of the window; this rope was fixed to it as it is now; it has not been disturbed—the surface of the bed was lower than</p>

               <p>the window ledge—I think the lower half of the window was right up—I looked out; I did not notice the stonework of the window ledge; the roof of the shed below was about 2 ft. from the window—I think in an emergency persons could have got on to the lean-to roof with a baby in their arms—I think there is a gutter running down the wall by the side of the window, which would form a handrail—I should say that the whole value of the contents of the premises, including the fixtures, which were the most valuable things, would be £2o.</p>

I am not guilty. I have a clear conscience that I was never down stairs after I went up at 10 or 11 o'clock"—she was searched by the female searcher—a policy with the Atlas Insurance Company was found in her pocket, dated April 15th, 1903: it was handed to me in a pocket book—it is a policy for £300 from April 15th. 1903, to March 25th. 1904, premium, 7s. 6d., £200 on household goods and furniture and the premises at 67, East Street, where Mrs. Jane Anderson, who is described as a grocer and tobacconist, resides, £20 on the fixtures, and £80 on the stock—a Post Office Savings Bank book was also found, showing a balance of 20s. in Mrs. Anderson's favour, also a document showing that a charge of 2s. 6d,</p>

Anderson, Esq.," and asking for the amount of the claim representing the loss he had suffered by a fire on the premises, and also this document, which shows in detail how the claim was originally made up, amounting to £12 0s. 6d.</p>

I am district officer of the Fire Brigade at New Cross—on September 14th, 1902, I received a call at 7.41 a.m.—I went to 6, Cornwall Road, and found the shop there alight—I saw the prisoner in a house opposite—I asked her how the fire occurred, and if she could give any account of it; she said she had come down about 5.30 to let her husband out to work; that she had gone behind the counter to get some milk for the baby; that she had lit a match, and had probably dropped it; that she discovered the fire by the smoke coming into her bedroom, after she had gone back to bed again—I do not know if she said she Lad gone to sleep—I went over the premises—I looked at a door on the first floor communicating with part of the next house—she said she had gone out by it—it is a wooden door nailed up from her side—it opened on hinges towards her premises—when I saw it, it had been forced open; there were seven or eight nails each four inches or five inches long; they had all bitten into the wood work, and one went into the floor as well as the frame<lb/>work—there was a space of about half-a-inch between the bottom of the door and the floor—the prisoner said she had pulled the door open with her fingers from underneath the bottom—there were a few marks on the side of the door, and a small chopper was there; there were no marks at the bottom—I do not think it possible for a person to force it open In putting their fingers under the door, without assistance from the other side—I asked the prisoner if the were insured; she said yes, but she did not know the office, as her husband transacted the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I came to the conclusion that it was impossible for her to have done what she said she did—she said she had waked up and found the room full of smoke—in the ordinary way that would considerably lessen a person's power of resistance—it would have taken the strength of a powerful man to have opened the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the Salvage Corps—on September 14th, 1902, I was called to 6, Cornwall Road—I got there about 8 a.m.—after the fire was out. I was left in charge of the promises—I found that the shop and staircase had been severely damaged; it appeared to be all one fire—the prisoner said that it originated behind the counter, and I think that it had done so; it had spread round the shop, and gone up the staircase—I saw the prisoner again about 9 a.m.—I asked her how the fire might have been caused; she said her husband went to work about 5 a.m.; that she went downstairs to fasten the door after he had gone out; she said she then went behind the counter to get some milk or sweets for the baby; that she struck a match, the shop being dark; that she then</p>

               <p>went upstairs and went to bed again; that she was awakened by the smell of smoke, and got up and found the shop was on fire; that she got a chopper and forced the door into the next house, as it was only nailed up—by going through the door you can get into the yard next door—I asked her where she was insured—she said she had a policy with the London and Lancashire, and also with the National Union Society—I afterwards examined the door which she said she had forced; it had been nailed by seven or eight five inch nails, driven into the frame; it had marks of having been forced—I saw a chopper lying on the floor near the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Under ordinary circumstances, I think it quite possible for her to have forced the door, but the room must have been full of smoke, and when a person is half choked with smoke they have not all their ordinary power—in my opinion,' with the smoke in the room she would be quite unable to force it.</p>

               <p>24th. 1902, a policy was effected by a Mrs. Anderson upon the household goods at 6, Cornwall Road, Peckham, for £200; this is the application for the policy, the description of the house was given as a private dwelling house—nothing was said about any shop or business being carried on there—the policy was issued to the prisoner, and I saw her—it would be effective from June 24th, the premium was 4s.—on September 16th. A claim was received at the office in relation to a fire upon the premises, it purported to show what articles had been destroyed by the fire, it gives a number of details to the aggregate value of £58 4s. 9d.—on the back, in answer to the question there printed, as to the cause of the fire, the answer is, "Supposed to be a match." and "(Q). Were there at the time of the fire any existing insurances with other offices? (A). No. (Q). Has there been any previous fire? (A). No"—that purports to be filled up by E. Anderson—shortly after that had been sent in, the prisoner called at the office in relation to the claim—I saw her, there were some negotiations between her and the office as to what would be a proper sum to be paid for the damage, she agreed to £30 in relation to her claim of £58—this is our cheque endorsed by her—we were not aware at that time that there was a policy in the National Union Office upon the stock-in-trade and the trade utensils—the statement is made twice over in this document that no such policy existed—a fire was reported to us as having taken place at 70, King and Queen Street, on May 30th—at the time the claim was made, we did not know of any identity as between King and Queen Street, and 07. East Street—we discovered it after<lb/>wards—the claim for that fire works out at £12 0s. 6d.—at the back, there is, "What was the cause of the fire, and under what circumstances did it occur? (A). A pair of window curtains was put up before the fire to air on the backs of two chairs and very likely a spark from the fire caught them. (Q). Was there at the time of the fire and other existing insurance? (A). No"—that is signed by Mrs. Anderson—there was some little hitch about the amount—our assessor did not value the loss at anything like £12 0s. 6d.—we received this letter from Mrs. Anderson, dated June 6th (<hi rend="italic">This stated that she could not accept the</hi> £4 5s. at which, the office valued the damage; that a coat which before was only a little the worse for wear was now only for the rag shop, and that if it had not been for her own energy, she would have been burnt out.)—this is an undertaking (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) dated June 12th, agreeing to take the £4 5s. in settlement of the claim—this is our cheque of June 17th. 1902. for that amount—it was June 3rd, 1903, when this claim was being put forward by Mrs. Anderson, and when the policy was transferred to 07, East Street; by that time we had discovered that 07, East Street, and 70. Kin and Queen Street, were one—on June 15th, 1903, our office cancelled the policy, it would have terminated on June 24th, 1903—I saw the prisoner again in connection with the cheque which was paid to her; by a clerical error, it was made out for £4 instead of £4 5s. she brought it to the office—we rectified it and gave her a fresh cheque for £4 5s.—to the best of me belief the signature "Elizabeth Jane Anderson" on this document is identical with the signatures on our forms—the cheques were made out to Mrs. Anderson, and the endorse<lb/>ment</p>

                  </hi>. I am a duly qualified medical practitioner and practice at 105, Camberwell New Road—on August 6th I attended the prisoner in her confinement, when she was delivered of a male child—she was very strange and reserved in her manner, and seemed to have no affection for the child—a short time after its birth she said it was not her child, and that it had been changed—I thought she was in a very</p>

               <p>strange state of mind—on the second day I found her running about the room in her nightdress—I ordered her back to bed—I asked her what she was doing; she said she did not know—I asked her if she was looking for anything; she said, "No, nothing"—at times I did not consider her responsible for her actions—I have seen a report made by Dr. Andrews on the condition of the prisoner—I was present when the examination was made—I agree with the report.</p>

                  </hi>., M.D., M.R.C.S., M.R.C.P. I practice at Cavendish Place as an obstetric specialist and assistant obstetric physician at the London Hospital—at the request of the solicitor for the defence I, in conjunction with Mr. Coles, saw the prisoner on August 18th; she came to see me—I also had a conversation with Mr. Coles sis to his attending her at her confinement—I found her to be in a dull, listless, apathetic condition, and it was very difficult to get anything out of her—she did not seem to take any interest in her case—she knew I was trying to get evidence which would be in her favour—I heard from her husband of the fits from which she had suffered—I do not think I heard until to-day that she had suffered from influenza; that is the most depressing known disease; it might have an effect upon her mental con<lb/>dition—patients whose nervous system is easily upset in any way. As hers evidently was, are very frequently eccentric, peculiar, and even quite insane during pregnancy, and not responsible for their actions—that non-responsibility would be consistent with her having business faculties at other periods—there are cases of insanity arising from pregnancy, and consistent with a perfect mental condition both before and after inter<lb/>vening periods—the prisoner told me that when she reached the middle of her pregnancy she became ill and depressed, and had been so ever since; she said that was when she first felt the movement of the child—she said she had smelt bad smells about, which her husband did not smell—she said to destroy them she had put down lamp oil, because she thought it was a healthy smell—she said she was certain the baby was not hers; that it had been changed, and that she would destroy it—that was the only time she was at all interested in it; she was almost violent upon that point—she seemed to me to be of low intellect: it is very difficult to give any general statement as to the length of time that the effect of insanity arising during pregnancy may remain on the brain; if a patient during her pregnancy becomes insane, she will probably not become sane for some months after her delivery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> August 18th is the first and last' occasion that the prisoner visited me—I do not know if that was the day that she was committed for trial—she was accompanied by her husband and Dr. Coles, who. I understood, had been in attendance during her second confinement, which took place on August 6th—I do not know for how many days attended he—I found that the prisoner had had fainting fits, and 1 considered they were minor epilepsy; fainting fits are strong evidence of</p>

               <p>epilepsy—it occurred to me that the prisoner might not be the best person to give me a good account; that her husband might have an interest in her, and that Dr. Coles had only seen her at the outside for ten days.</p>
