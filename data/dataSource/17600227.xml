               <p>S. Morgan. I found part of them on the prisoner the same day. I had recomended her as a servant to my sister, at Lambeth. When she was there she staid out one whole night, and my sister was afraid to take her into the house again; so she came to my apartment, and I let her lie with me on the Thursday and Friday nights. On the Saturday morning she got up, under pretence of going to light my fire in the fore room. I heard her busy with my petticoat, and said, what are you doing. She said, your petticoat is lying on the ground. I bid her put it on my shoulders, which she did. Soon after this I missed her, whereupon I got out of the bed, and saw there was no fire lighted in the fore room. She had left the street and yard doors open. Then I was informed one

             and she kept company, so I went to justice Welch, and got a warrant and found her. She had then my purse, pencil, corkscrew and thimble; the thimble was marked, S. M. I asked her what she had done with my money. She said she had bought the cloaths she had on, and other things. I asked her what she had done with her own cloaths, and she said she had thrown them away, fearing I should advertise her in them. I asked her what she had done with my crown pieces. She said she had bought some things of Mr. Day, a pawnbroker, near St. Andrew's church, Holbourn, and had paid them away there. I went thither, and just as I came there, a boy came and said, pray what are these half crowns a piece. Mr. Day's Daughter said they are crown pieces, they are 5 s. and 3 d. a piece. The three crown pieces were lying with their heads uppermost, the coin of king

            . I said they were mine, and that one had the date 1679, another 1671, the other 1673, and desired he would keep them separate till produced in a court of justice. He said he would, and he took and looked at them; they were of the dates which I had mentioned. Then I went to justice Welch, and him what I had done. He asked me if I knew more. I said the prisoner had then my pockets which were produced. Mr. Welch sent for Day, saying he should be very glad to see him. Day returned for answer, My compliments to Welch, I am out of his jurisdiction. Then I went to my Lord-mayor, had a warrant sign'd, and took Mr. Day up. When I came to Mr. Welch's, he produced my three crowns and three other crown pieces. I told him I wondered how three crown pieces could breed in another person's pocket, they never did in mine. The six crown pieces were laid down, the heads uppermost, on Mr. Welch's desk, who gave me a strict charge to take mine out as they then lay. I took mine out. Said he, are you sure they are yours. I said I was certain. Said he, look and see whether they answer as to the dates. They were defaced; that of 79, the tail of the 9 was taken out, and made 1670; that of 71, the 1 was taken out; and that of 73, was hard to be discerned. The dates were all fair and plain that day at between eleven and twelve, and when we were before the justice it was between three and four, (The pieces produced and inspected by the court and jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Day. The prisoner came to my house on the 19th of January. She bought a cardinal for half a guinea, and a pair of stays, a bonnet and a handkerchief. I took of her two crown pieces and a guinea, out of which I gave her change. I received of her in the whole 1 l. 4 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q Did you look at the crown pieces when the prosecutrix came to your house?</p>
               <p>Day. I did not, and did not know what dates they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of their being altered?</p>
               <p>Day. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for answer to the justice that you was out of his jurisdiction, and would not attend?</p>
               <p>Day. I said, I am out of his jurisdiction, notwithstanding that I will go, if you will stay till my wife comes home; the prosecutrix came in a sort of a passion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner said she had a gown from Mr. Day's that morning, which cost her 8 s.</p>
               <p>Day. That is truth, she did, it came to 8 s. and 2 d. She used to pledge things with me, but I had not seen her for five or six months before</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever bought any thing of you before?</p>
               <p>Day. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you surprised when you saw her produce so much money?</p>
               <p>Day. No; I do not ask people how they come by their money.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. When I asked Mr. Day if he had any other crown pieces in his house, he said he had not.</p>
               <p>The Constable. I saw the crown pieces at Mr. Day's house; the dates were fair on them all then, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270004"/> they were not so when before the justice. The prosecutrix desired Mr. Day to look at the dates of each, which he did, and gave them into the prosecutrix's hand, one by one.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of January the prosecutor gave me a warrant to take up the prisoner. I went to his door, and saw him and his wife sitting by the fire; I wrap'd at the door, but they did not open it. I said, why do you not let me in? I saw him make motions to his wife not to let me in. Then I called again for them to open the door, and it was opened. I went in and told him I had a warrant for him, and on what account, and said I hoped he would help Mr. Perrit to his things again, saying, he wanted them for a great while. He said, he never saw them; but at last he said he had them, and sent his wife up stairs, and she brought down the case of brass ones. He denied having the silver ones, till in the coach going to the justice. Then he said he broke the silver ones from the steel, and sold the silver to a silversmith. We sent for the silversmith, and he recollected buying such silver of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where did these instruments lay in your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They lay on the cornish over my chimney, in the room where the prisoner used to shave me.</p>

               <p>Roark. It was about seven weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Roark I keep a shop at the corner of Hatton Garden. The prisoner asked me if I bought old silver, and shewed me some pieces of silver instruments. I asked him what was his business. He said he was a barber. I said, what use have barbers for compasses? He said, at his leisure hours he was a painter, and drew drafts; but these being of no manner of use to him, he would sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity were there of them?</p>
               <p>Roark. To the best of my remembrance they weighed an ounce and four penny weights; but there being some steel on them (for which he allowed six pennyweights) I paid him four shillings and six-pence for the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of silver was it?</p>
               <p>Roark. They were handles to compasses.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, but called two witnesses, one of whom had known him three years, the other eight or nine, and both gave him that of a good character.</p>

            . I was at London the last day of the old year, and when I came home the house was in great confusion, upon the sight of that blood. I asked my mother what was the matter. She said, the old story; that was from the suspicion we had of the girl's being with child. Then my husband ask'd the prisoner if she had been at supper, if not, he bid her to take it, and go to bed. My husband went to bed, that was because my mother should have an opportunity to tell me all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go about her business as usual?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Page. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other servant?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Page. No other but a man. Then my mother said she was in hopes it was but a miscarriage; there had been something. The next morning I look'd into the room, and it had been mopped; but I saw streaks of blood down the wall, and on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of blood might there appear to be by the marks?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Page. There might be a hundred large spots of blood. I look'd on the ground under the window; it was scratched about with a broom, but I saw no blood there, so we were in hopes it was but a miscarriage. We did not care to take the girl's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270006"/> character away; something of that nature there had been to be sure.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the girl examined on that?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Page. No; we were careful of taking her character away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl continue with you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Page. We kept her till the coroner was there. She was a good servant. She dined at our table, and used to say she was as well as ever she was in her life.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in her defence, but called the following witnesses.</p>

            . The prisoner lived servant with me three years; she was a very sober, civil, modest girl, and went from me to Mr. Page's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be with child at the time she went from you?</p>
               <p>H. West. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. I am a midwife, and by the justice of the peace's order was obliged to search the prisoner after the child was found, on the 2d of February.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had had a child about the latter end of December, do you think you should have discovered it?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. I think I should; there were no marks of her ever having a child. I am very sure if she had had a child I should have known it, for I thoroughly searched her.</p>

            . I was called from my work to go of a job, to earn a shilling; I went and there were the two soldiers, that is, the prisoner and the last evidence. They had got a wine hamper of about an hundred weight. They ordered me to carry it to Turnmill-Street; there was a shilling left at the bar for my trouble. I pitched at the Flying-Horse, in Tyburn-Road. I saw the wing of a fowl hang out, so I looked in and saw it was full of fowls. I asked the evidence how far they had brought that hamper, he said three or four miles: I asked him where he came from, he said such a place in Yorkshire. I said, what is become of the other soldier that had a game cock in his hand; he said he was gone to Carnaby Market, and would be there as soon as me. I went and carried the hamper to Turnmill-Street, to the house of one Crow, and left it there; that is all I know.</p>

First he said he had it from his grand father, after that, when sober, he said he had it from out of Esq; Calderwood's parlour, from off a table; I went, but found no-body there had lost a watch; since he says he found the watch. He has lived with me about eight months. He is a sober, careful lad; he has taken money for me, I never could find that he ever wronged me of a farthing. He is of a poor family in the country. I should not scruple to take him again.</p>

               <p>Wills. No, upon a bed.</p>

               <p>Wills. I had. I looked at it when it was past ten o'clock. I neither stop'd nor staid, nor spoke to any body till I met with her.</p>

               <p>Wills. Only a pint of beer. She came out at the door along with me, where we parted. It could not be a minute before I missed my watch, and I returned directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again?</p>
               <p>Wills. I took the prisoner up on the Thursday following; the watch was found, and is now in the officer's hands. I carried her before justice Bury, but she denied it; the justice committed her, and advised me to take a warrant against Mrs. More, whose house we were in. I did, and soon found where my watch was, by one Mrs. Kenady. The watch was pawn'd to one Mr. Ellise, a pawnbroker, and the officer went there and brought it.</p>

I had told him out thirty-six shillings, and then he wanted silver for a guinea more. He laid down his guinea on the bar, and walked towards the fire. I said to him, this is a very plain guinea; his answer was, it is a very good one My husband then knock'd for me to come down stairs. Then Catherine Beard came in for half a guinea in silver, and I said I would change her none, because she had brought me no silver all the week. [She used to bring me silver for gold.] Then she said, if you will give me silver for this half guinea, you shall have all the silver I take next week, so I said I would change it. She took the guinea that Mr. Masckall had laid upon the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>A. Day. I did, and saw her put it to her bosom. I said, don't play the fool, you have got the guinea, give it me. She said, Geago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by that?</p>
               <p>A. Day. I don't know the meaning of the word. Then she walked towards the fire-place, and I insisted on searching her for the guinea. She would not be searched, but hit me on the breast, and I let her go. She got to the door, and broke the pully of it to get away. After she was gone we fetch'd a warrant for her. She staid away for about half an hour, when she came in again, and desired we would search her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>A. Day. This was on Saturday the 26th of January, about eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you ask Mr. Masckall for the guinea?</p>

I turn'd my head round, and saw her hand on the bar. The prisoner ran to the fire, and said Geago. After that she broke the pully of the door, and away she went. I might say Geago too.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. About eight at night on the 26th of January, I was paying my father's men, and wanting a guinea in silver, I went to the bar, and laid down a guinea. Mrs. Day looked at in and said it was a very plain one. I said it was a very good one, and went to the fireside. The prisoner came in for half a guinea worth of silver, and Mrs. Day said she would not or could not give her any. Presently Mrs. Day said to her, you have got my guinea, and insisted on her being searched, but she ran to the door, broke the pully, and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the guinea?</p>
               <p>Masckall. No, I did not. After we were gone to the justice's, I was told she came in again, and wanted to be searched.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner Whether Mrs. Day did not go to you and say, Mr Masckall, where is my guinea, when you said you gave it her, and said you did not?</p>
               <p>Masckall. She might say I did not give it her, but I can't recollect it; if she did, I know she owned that I gave it her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shipley. I am a constable. When prisoner in charge, I heard her offer to pay half a guinea down, and 18 d. a week till the remainder of the money was paid.</p>

               <p>Foster. I have work'd for Mr. Masckall five years. We sat down, and drank beer and hot. My master came in about a quarter of an hour after us, and asked for change for a guinea, but whether he carried any money or not to Mrs. Day, I know not; I suppose it was for change to pay us, there being four or five of us to be paid. My master then turned his back to the bar. Mrs. Day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270011"/> went to call her husband, as I suppose; but the case was this, she went back again into the bar, and said she missed a guinea, and said, Mr. Masckall, you have not given me the guinea. Yes, said he, I did. Another man said he saw Mrs. Day take it up. Then she said, d - n her blood, he never gave her the guinea, search me; it was not found. Then she went directly, and said this old woman (which was the prisoner) had got the guinea. Said the prisoner, I know nothing of it, I wish you would give me change for half a guinea, for I have a customer at my stall. The prisoner went and sat down by the fire for the space of four or five minutes. After that Mrs. Day swore, G - d d - n you, you have got my guinea, and I will swear you took it up; that is all I have to say.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Masckall, and we went there to be paid. There being words about a guinea, I said to my master, I wish you would pay us as soon as you can. As I was going away the prisoner came in, and said she wanted change for half a guinea. Mrs. Day said, you brought me no silver last week. Then the prisoner said she would bring her all the silver she could the next week. Then Mrs. Day said, Mr. Masckall, you did not give me the guinea. I did, said he. You did not, and I'll swear it, said she. Then she turn'd herself round, and said to this woman at the bar, you have taken the guinea, if you have don't fright me; the prisoner said I have not I declare.</p>
               <p>- Randall. I saw the prisoner come into the house in the first place, and ask for change for half a guinea. The other said she would not let her have any, went from out of the bar to the stairs, which are facing the bar, turned back again, and said she missed a guinea, which is all that I have got to say.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it proposed, betwixt the prisoner and you, that you should trust him?</p>
               <p>Vere. No, no; he said his name was ready money, that he had laid out near 400 l. in coming into the house, and that he chose to lay out his money with his neighbours.

I sent him with them, and gave him strict orders not to leave them without the money, as he had done the others; but he came back without the money or plates. As he will tell the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270012"/> court what passed there, it will be needless to relate what account he gave me at his return.</p>

               <p>Q. What goods?</p>
               <p>Amson. There were eight china bowls and several other things, I can't say exactly what quantity; my master order'd me not to leave them without the money, and I said I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put them into the basket?</p>
               <p>Amson. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I admit the receiving the goods.</p>
               <p>Amson. When I came to the prisoner's house I saw him there, I had the bill of parcels and a receipt upon it. The prisoner said, Well, my lad, what have you got? I told him I had brought the china. He said, Well, my lad, set it out, and I will call my wife down. I set it out, and then he asked me to drink a glass of rum or something. I drank a glass and he another, and then he forced another upon me. Said he, See how my vessels are tumbled about, but I have seen better days; it has cost me 400 l. coming in here. Then his wife came down, and said she liked the china very well. I gave him the bill and he read it over, and she took some of the things away. Then he called for a bottle of wine, and asked me if I would drink again. I refused it, but he swore I should. He then called for a pair of scissars, the boy brought them, and he was going to cut the receipt from the bill, when I asked him what he meant by doing so. Said he, you must go home, and fetch half a dozen china plates, and then I will pay you for the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did the prisoner bespeak any china plates of you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; but he said he should want some other china soon.</p>
               <p>Amson. I told him I was ordered not to leave the goods without the money, but he said, several times over,</p>
               <p>"Go your way, and bring the plates." I told him I must either have the money or the goods, and then we got to high words. After I had been there almost an hour he said,</p>
               <p>"The goods are deliver'd,</p>
               <p>"you can't touch the goods, the goods are mine,</p>
               <p>"you may go and tell your master that they are</p>
               <p>"mine."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut off the receipt?</p>
               <p>Amson. No, I would not let him do that, I prevented him; I said I must either have the goods or the money, I will stay with you till I have one of them. When he found I would not go out of the house, he laughed at me, and said, I should have neither; he asked me if I would drink again, and called for more wine, but I would not drink any. He swore I should have neither money nor goods. His wife came down stairs, and said, you must not mind my husband, he is in liquor, come to me in the morning, and bring half a dozen plates about ten o'clock, and you shall have the money for all. Then I went home, and told my master what had happened. My master sent me in the morning, but ordered me to be careful that I was not tricked out of the plates, and not to leave them as I had done the rest. I went, and when I was at the door, there came a strange woman, who said, my mistress is upstairs, I will take them up to her, and she will come down and pay you. I delivered them to her, and she carried them up. Then the mistress came down, and said, my husband is gone out with two countrymen, to buy some goods, and I expect him to be in every minute. I staid there a good while, till after eleven o'clock, and he not coming, I asked her to let me have the goods again. She said, there was nothing but what her husband had ordered, and I should not touch any thing. Then I asked her to let me have the plates again. She said, it was all by her husband's order, and I should not touch any thing. I came away, and went again two or three times that day, but never could see him.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was not you offered some money?</p>
               <p>Amson. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not order you to bring half a dozen plates the next morning, and say you should have the money?</p>
               <p>Amson. Yes, he did tell me so; but I carried the plates the next morning by his wife's order.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you deliver my wife a bill?</p>
               <p>Amson. I was ready to deliver one, if she would have paid me.</p>

               <p>This evidence said his master had transported one man for such a fact, and I should be transported, right or wrong. He would not deliver the bill to my wife, and she could not pay him till he did.</p>

            . I was upstairs at Mr. Ambery's house when half a dozen plates were brought up by a woman to my mistress, who went and took out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270013"/> money, both gold and silver, and went down stairs. I heard her say, here, if you'll give me your bill and receipt, I will pay you, but he would not; they had several words, but what they were, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you heard the words you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I am sure I did. I am positive she said, if you will give me the bill and receipt, I will pay you the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the man that gave evidence last?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I do think it is the same man, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Amson. Did you see this woman there?</p>
               <p>Amson. I never saw her in my life before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you did not see her in Ambery's house?</p>
               <p>Amson. I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Pinborn. Will you be positive as to this man?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I will not be positive, but I think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court Look at him once more.</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I do think it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear what was the reason the man would not take the money; here is a man that had delivered goods the night before, and he came with a fresh order; he has delivered them, and the mistress comes down stairs, and offers to pay him the money, but he would not take it.</p>

               <p>A. Pinborn. She would not pay him without the receipt and the bill, and he would not give it to her; I did not stay to listen to what was said, for they had a great argument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, at that time, say whether he had the bill and receipt about him or not?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I have no more to say; I heard no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you below?</p>
               <p>A. Pinborn. I came down to look after her; I lived there till there were people in possession of the house. Then my mistress said she had no occasion for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Amson. Was there any discourse between the prisoner's wife and you about the bill and receipt?</p>
               <p>Amson. No, there was not; she never mention'd the bill and receipt to me that morning.</p>

When I came down, I found the window shutter of my shop was taken down, and I saw a hand picking out my buckles at the end of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Howes. It was very moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your shop secure at going to bed?</p>
               <p>Howes. It was bar'd up with an iron bar, and a staple; the end shutter goes in first, and they are key'd secure with a bar; but, upon examining it, they had bent the bar into a triangle, just enough to clear the end shutter, which they had taken down and carried three or four doors off, where I found it. I had no opportunity of laying hold of the hand, the window being glased on the inside as well as without. I called up to my wife, and desired her to open the dining-room window, and call the watch, which she did. She told me she saw a man run away up Chancery Lane. When I came to look over my things, I found I had lost more than I have laid in the indictment, but am sure I lost what are laid. The loss of the whole is to the amount of twenty guineas. I advertised it in the Monday's paper, with a reward of five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch at that time?</p>
               <p>Howes. That was the first morning of the watch going off sooner than usual for the winter, so they were just gone off. On the Monday there came a messenger from Mr. Welch, and desired I would step to him, for they apprehended they had got the man that rob'd my shop. I went, and there was the prisoner Guest, whom they had searched before I came: I was shewed some silver buckles broke all to pieces, so that it was impossible to know how many pair there were; but I saw by the marks and patterns that they were mine. I have some odd buckles, which they left behind, that are fellows to some of them. (Producing some.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270014"/> There Guest acknowledged he had been concerned with one Smith in several robberies besides mine: He also declared in what manner he opened my shop, and told us where he had sold some of my buckles, upon which the justice sent a search warrant. I went there (it was to one Mrs. Montgomery's) and found some of my buckles. After I was come home, I had another messenger from Houndsditch, from Mr.

            . The prisoner Guest came to offer a coat to sell at my master's, a salesman, in Monmouth Street. We heard that Mr. Lee had had his house broke open, and lost an alapeen coat; the prisoner offered such a one, and asked nine shillings for it. I asked him how long he had had it. He said it had been in pawn nine months, and that it was made for him; I observed it was not near big enough for him. I took hold of him, sent for Mr. Lee, and kept him in our shop till Mr. Lee came. Then we took him before justice Welch. I finding he had something in one of his pockets, felt in it, and found some chases of buckles, and the constable took out some broken silver buckles from another pocket. Then I told him he had broke the gentleman's shop open in Fleet Street, which I had seen in the Advertiser. He acknowledged he did break it open, in company with one Smith. Then the justice sent for Mr. Howes, who came, and we found the very same marks on the buckles as he had advertised; he swore to them. We found in the prisoner's pocket such a tool as the brewers coopers make use of to take out the bungs of their vessels. The prisoner said they used that first to bore with, then they took down a shutter, and he put on his glove and broke a pane of glass.</p>

               <p>Pollard. I am clerk to the Clothworkers company. When I was examining Chambers, the prisoner came down in a great fury, and said she would discover every thing.

She said she brought all the money to Chambers, and Chambers never gave her but one six-pence.</p>

The small-pox was in our family, and I never had it, so I had my victuals out of the house. I had my watch in my pocket, and the prisoner at the bar came and sat down by me when I was in the publick house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Randall. At the George in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work in your master's house, and go out to eat your victuals?</p>
               <p>Randall. No, I was at work in the Strand. After I went out of the publick house the prisoner at the bar followed me, and desired me to go along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. To go where?</p>
               <p>Randall. I do not know the name of the place, but she carried me up a court.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened there?</p>
               <p>Randall. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to your watch?</p>
               <p>Randall. Yes, the prisoner took it out of my pocket, and ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she taken?</p>
               <p>Randall. I never set eyes on her till about a month afterwards, when she came into the neighbourhood again.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Randall. I am nineteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation past between you in the court?</p>
               <p>Randall. She asked me whether I would give her any thing to go with her. I told her I had nothing to give her. I took her before justice Cox, and gave the same account to him as I do here. She would not own that she knew any thing of my watch or me either. but when she was going to Bridewell she confessed to the constable she had taken my watch, told where she had pawned it, and it was found accordingly.</p>

               <p>Fear. No, it was another lad. I said you must get a warrant to take her. He said she would be gone away before they could get one. I went with him to the Castle, in Swallow-Street, took the prisoner in custody, put her into the watch-house, and in the morning I carried her before justice Cox, who committed her to hard labour for ten days in Bridewell. The prisoner said, I had rather go to Newgate than to Bridewell, for they lie there on boards; and as we were going together in the coach, she said that this lad was going to be concerned with her, that he had no money, but gave her his handkerchief, and that she pretended somebody was coming, whip'd out his watch and ran away with it, and told me she had pawn'd it for 30 s. at a house behind the New-Church in the Strand, but could not tell the people's name. I went and told the boy's master of it, who went with me to justice Cox, and from thence to the pawnbroker's, and there found the watch, pawn'd in the name of Thomas and

               <p>A young woman, an acquaintance of mine, sat up with me to wash and iron, and I went to lodge with her in the same house, but not in the same room. She desired she might be paid for the box before it was broke open. If I had known of these things being there, I had time enough to have made away with them, as Mrs. Riley said she would be as great an enemy to me, as she had been a friend.</p>

We took her, and as we were bringing her along, just by the new burying ground, she owned she had taken and pawned the cloak for a shilling, and where. We went and found it accordingly.</p>

            . The 22d of February was my washing day; the prisoner at the bar lives below me. She has no other way from her apartment but through my wash-house. I left her in the kitchen when I went up to breakfast, and when I came down again I found her there. Upon missing one shirt, I asked, her if any body had been there in the time I was absent, and she said there had been nobody there. I took her before justice Fielding. I had lost one shirt the week before. She owned she had taken and pawn'd the two shirts; one at Mr. Gunston's, in Germain-Street; the other, at Mr Watson's, at the end of Coventry-Court, the last of which I found ( produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you lend me this shirt?</p>

            . The prisoner, the deccased, and others of their fellow workmen, had been drinking pretty plentifully at the Valentine and Orion, in Goswell Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I keep that house; after some time words arose.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. There were nine of them in all; there was the deceased's son. I did not know them all.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had they had?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. They had eighteen full pots of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words about?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. They were about their trade, which was the best workman.</p>
               <p>Q. What were their trades?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. They were nailers and rivet makers. The deceased's son was fighting with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the words between?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. They were between the prisoner and and the deceased's son. The deceased's son said the prisoner's father was a thief and a rogue, which provoked the prisoner to strike him, upon which they began to fight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they fight?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. They fought I believe near half an hour, and then they parted and sat down in a box together. The deceased and his son sat opposite each other in the box. Then the prisoner said to the son, whom he had been fighting with (very coolly) what do you know of my father or any of my family, that you should use such language. Harthill equivocated a little, but the father, who sat opposite to him, started up and said the prisoner's father was a rogue and a thief. Then the prisoner struck him one blow, on the right side of his head, with his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with his flat hand, or double fist?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. It was a swinging blow like.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner right or left handed?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I believe he is right handed, but he was on that side the box that lay for his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that blow seem to affect him?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. It did not seem to me to affect him; they sat together for an hour peaceably and quiet after that, arguing coolly with each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any blows struck after that?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270019"/>Shirlock. No, nor any likelihood of any.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them part?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I did, I was in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition did the deceased seem to be in?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I saw no other difference then than at any other time, only being fuddled; he was in a bad state of health, in a consumption, long before; his son says, six years before</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time he died?</p>
               <p>Shirlock, I do by his son's account.</p>

               <p>Harthill. I did, it is much the same; we were drinking all together and talking, and had a good deal of liquor,</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Harthill. We were all fuddled.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the conversation you had with the prisoner at the bar?</p>

               <p>Q. What conversation did you fall into after that?</p>
               <p>Harthill. The prisoner call'd my father thief.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you call the prisoner's father thief or rogue?</p>
               <p>Harthill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shirlock. Did you not say you heard this witness call the prisoner's father thief and rogue?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. I heard this witness say, that the prisoner's father was a thief and a rogue.</p>
               <p>Harthill. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your fighting?</p>
               <p>Harthill. We were talking about our trade, and he hit me a blow; then I struck him again, and so we fell to fighting, and fought some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you both of one trade?</p>
               <p>Harthill. We are; when we were fighting my father came to part us, and he said the prisoner's father was a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this when you were fighting?</p>
               <p>Harthill. No, this was after we had been parted about an hour; that occasion'd the blow, but I did not see it given. After that my father and I went home together, I led him by the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he not go without help?</p>
               <p>Harthill. He was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go home?</p>
               <p>Harthill. Between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What happen'd when he was at home?</p>
               <p>Harthill. He went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any hurt?</p>
               <p>Harthill. He complain'd at the alehouse, before he went home, of the blow, and told me the prisoner had kill'd him; so we went home upon that, but when he gave him the blow, I do not think he intended to kill him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shirlock. Was it a violent blow?</p>
               <p>Shirlock. It was a hard blow for a man that was infirm; but I do not think it would have hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harthill. How had your father been as to his health.</p>
               <p>Harthill. He had been in a very bad state of health these six years.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the blow given?</p>
               <p>Watson. No, I did not, but while the prisoner and the young one were fighting I saw the old one (that is, the deceased) put his hand over the bar and pull the prisoner by the hair; the prisoner at the time put his hand over his shoulder, and gave him a blow which knocked him down, but I saw no blow after that.</p>

I got between and parted them; they got together and fought again; then the old man, the deceased, went to pull the prisoner by the hair, the prisoner struck him and he fell down, and what by holding by one another, or how I cannot say, but I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270020"/> they all three were down together at that time. I got the old man out at the doo r, and he came in again, and the young one and the prisoner at the bar fought again. They set to it five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Allcock. They were all drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased as to his health?</p>
               <p>Allcock. He was very ill, and sometimes he could not go to his work for three or four days together; he worked but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they work'd for you?</p>
               <p>Allcock. I believe about three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of their fighting?</p>
               <p>Allcock. They were fighting when I went there; they call'd each other thief and rogue, as drunken people commonly do. I don't think the soldier (the prisoner is a soldier) did intend to do him any hurt, for he is as quiet a man as any I have, and I have about twenty-five of them. He has behav'd as well as any of them for the time he has work'd for me, which is about three years. He is a very quiet man, I never knew him quarrelsome in my life.</p>

            . After the fray was over I only saw one blow given. The deceased call'd the prisoner's father thief and rogue, and used very scurrilous language; upon that the prisoner at the bar, with his left hand, gave him a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with his double fist, or open handed?</p>
               <p>Farrin. I saw the blow, but I cannot say whether it was open handed or double fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it seem to be a very severe blow?</p>
               <p>Farrin. If I had received such a blow, it would not have hurt me a great deal; but the deceased was in a bad state of health.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goodman. I was sent for by the coroner. I opened the scull of the deceased, and found the brain in its natural state.</p>
               <p>Q. If a blow on the head had been the occasion of his death, how should you have expected to find the brain?</p>
               <p>Goodman. We should have found a great quantity of blood there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this man's death was occasion'd by that blow?</p>
               <p>Goodman. I don't believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge, by viewing the body, what was the deceased's state of health?</p>
               <p>Goodman. By all accounts I have learned since, he was in a very bad state of health.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for what was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Goodman. No doubt but that any body, in such a bad state of health, might have died by such irregularity in living, without the blow; it is reasonable to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of any contusion?</p>
               <p>Goodman. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any mark on his breast or any where else?</p>
               <p>Goodman. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Goodman. I have known several irregular people, by being put into a very great passion, carried off directly.</p>

            , the name he himself went by, as will appear by an evidence here; that they did it by the light of a lanthorn. Norman was not there then, and we took him up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the house?</p>
               <p>Griffiths. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the day it was broke open?</p>
               <p>Griffiths. By Beckwith's own confession.</p>
               <p>Isabella Griffiths. After our house was broke open, we had a warrant to search Beckwith's house, where we found a small looking-glass lock'd up in a closet; we found also a fire shovel and trevit.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Backwith live?</p>
               <p>I. Griffiths. He lived at Hummerton, and kept a cook's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you was at your house at Hackney, before you missed the things?</p>
               <p>I. Griffiths. We were there on Christmas Eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say upon your oath these goods which you lost were in your house on Christmas Eve?</p>
               <p>I. Griffiths. I think I can say all of them were. The house was broke in two places, but in one they met with a beam in their way, and could not proceed there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a dwelling house?</p>
               <p>I. Griffiths. Yes, Mr. Griffiths and I go there sometimes. I was all over the house on Christmas Eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with your husband on the Monday he has mentioned?</p>
               <p>I. Griffiths. I did, but at that time we were sure the other things were at Mr. Henfield's the broker. I found the same goods missing that my husband spoke of.</p>

            . I am a broker, and know the two prisoners at the bar. I think it was on the 26th of January Beckwith came to me (be then wrote his name Robinson.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Henfield. I had seen him before pass by my door. He brought a letter and said he had brought some goods from some relation at Ware, and wanted to know if I would buy them. I told him I would see them first, and away he went; and in about three quarters of an hour after he came again with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that?</p>
               <p>Henfield. It was one that is not here. They brought the goods, and I looked them over. I said I did not care to buy them, except he could produce the owner.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did they bring?</p>
               <p>Henfield. They brought the bed furniture, a quilt, blankets and two glasses, tied up in a coarse cloath, and a letter, saying the goods came from such a person at Ware, that was in distress. I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270023"/> except I knew you, and where you live, I shall not buy them. Said Beckwith you may go to where we live, we liveright against the Plough, at Hummerton. I and my brother set out to go with them to their houses: Going along the New Road, one of them said here is Cayton's cart, he serves us with meat, he knows us. We look'd about to see if we could find him. We found him in a public house, I took him out and asked him the character of the two men; he said he had served them with meat, and they paid him very honestly. Then we turned into the public house, and

Then I went home, saying. I did not care to buy the goods till I saw the person that owns them; then they said let us have the goods away. I said no, I shall not part with the goods till I have seen farther. Then they said they would go and fetch the waggoner that brought them up from Ware. They were gone about half an hour. I had still the goods in my possession. I went to be shaved, in order to go to Mr. Fielding's, to give him intelligence of them. Then my brother came and said the men are come back again about the goods, and had brought the waggoner. I found the prisoner Norman standing by the fire side. I said to him, what say you; he said, I am come about some goods that I brought up from Ware. I said, what are they, he said one of them is a flat parcel, which they bid him take care of, because there was glass; I said, do you know who you had them of; he said he knew them by sight, the man lives within a few doors of my master; my master's name is Fugan, and mine is Norman. I asked where I might find him, he said either at the Cherry-Tree or Black-Horse, in Kingsland-Road. Then I said to Beckwith, as you appear to be an honest man I will pay you for your goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for them?</p>
               <p>Henfield. I gave him 5 l. 13 s. Dan said to the waggoner, take notice of the money we take, for you are to carry it down: very well said Norman. (The goods produced in court and deposed to by the prosecuter.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Henfield. Had you a receipt of Beckwith?</p>
               <p>Henfield. I had; he signed his name Robinson in the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present before justice Fielding when, Beckwith was examined there?</p>
               <p>Henfield. I was; I think he said he was in Mr. Griffiths's yard when Dan and Robinson broke into the house; that he was set there to watch, (he used some word which I took to be watch, which I do not understand.) He said they wrench'd open a shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said he was set there to watch?</p>

Then they told us where they lived, and he and I were going to their houses. to inquire how they came by the goods, and whether they came from Ware, as they had said. We happened to see one Cayton's cart stand in the road, and they inquired for him and found him in a public house, of whom Mr. Henfield inquired their characters; he said they were honest men as far as he knew, for he had sold them meat several times, and they paid him; then we came home, but he said he should not chuse to buy the goods without he saw the right owner; they said the right owner could not be seen, for he was in the hands of a bailiff; but they could bring the waggoner, who brought them up from Ware; and while Mr. Henfield went to be shaved, in order to go to justice Fielding,

            . I am the person that found out where the goods were, and sent word to Mr. Griffiths; I was at Mr. Fielding's when both the prisoners were examined. Beckwith said two men, Robinson and Dan, were along with him; that they two broke the house open, by the light of a lanthorn, and he was in the garden and watched; they handed the goods out to him, and he carried them out into the fields, where they pack'd them up, and then he did not know what became of them. I asked him whether they had a dark lanthorn or another; he said it was a large horn lanthorn, with a candle in it. I was present at Hummerton when the goods were found at Beckwith's house, and heard Mr. Griffiths swear to them.</p>

I told Mr. Fielding I would send a letter down to his master to send him up. I thought it was to be an evidence. He sent him up, and I went along with him to the justice; there he said two men came to the inn where he was baiting his horses, on the 26th of January, at the Cherry-tree, and told him they had some goods come out of the country by another person, that they would give him a crown, if he would go and say they came up by him, and he took the crown and went and did say so. I do not think he would be guilty of such an action, had he known the goods to have been stolen.</p>

When I went for him, in order to carry him to be examined again, then he told me one Robinson was concerned, and that he stood and watched while they broke the house and took the goods out. The first time he told me Dan and he took the goods out over night, and hid them in the fields, and went afterwards and took them away.</p>

Just before I came to my own door a couple of fellows stop'd me; the short one took out a pistol, and the tall one had a knife. They demanded my watch and money, or they would shoot me; I said I had no watch with me, and as to money, I could give them no more then I had. They took from me a furtout coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270025"/> three handkerchiefs, and nine-pence half-penny.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Decoster. I do not know him any farther than coming in a stage coach once with him; that was since I was rob'd, coming from London. There were in the coach a gentlewoman and the prisoner, and a companion of his, as appear'd to me. The gentlewoman was set down at a distiller's, by Shoreditch Church; after that, we in the coach fell into discourse about robbing. I told them I had been rob'd just by my own house; they asked me how they used me; I said a couple of fellows stop'd and rob'd me of my coat and three handkerchiefs. They asked me a great many questions, and wanted to get out of the coach several times. I then did not like them, so instead of being set down at the Shoulder of Mutton Field, I chose to go farther in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing against the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Decoster. No, I was so frighted when I was rob'd, that I cannot swear to the man; but when the prisoner's house was searched for other people's goods there were two handkerchiefs found there, my property, and of which I was rob'd that night.</p>

            . I am the constable that searched Beckwith's house for Mr. Griffiths's goods, where we found two handkerchiefs, in the custody of Dan and the prisoner (produced in court and deposed to.) They were delivered to me by their two wives, saying, they did not belong to them, and said they were afraid they were stolen. Beckwith was then taken, but Dan had made off. The prosecutor came to my house afterwards and described the marks on them at the corners, and after that he swore, before justice Norris, they were his property, which he lost at that time.</p>

They came over a gate that was lock'd, to come to the door, and said where is your master; I said, I do not know of any master that I have here. They came in at the door, and turn'd again and bolted it; I said what do you bolt my door for; they asked me where the key was; I said the key was lost; then they went to a little room where my husband and I lay; the first thing they laid hold of was a pistol; they said this is a pretty thing, this will do for us. Then they tore a drawer out, and said we will take none of your wearing apparel, we want money. They found and took some old money. Then they said where is your husband's money; I said we have some to be sure in the house (my husband had said to me, if your landlord-should come by call him in and give him a quarter's rent, which is twenty-five shillings, and told me he had put it behind the door, but no landlord came.) They rifled and jostled me about and bid me not talk, and took three-half pence and four farthings out of my pocket. I had in my left-hand pocket a half-crown, and three or four new shillings; they took them, and hit me a blow on the side of my head; I thought they had beat my brains out. I said don't use me ill, I am old enough to be your grandmother. [The prosecutor and his wife were a remarkable ancient couple.]</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come to your house?</p>
               <p>I. More. They were in my house between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they take?</p>
               <p>I. More. They took twelve pewter plates, three pewter dishes and four pewter porringers. My husband had also lost 3 l. 15 s. in the house, that also they took, as well as the 25 s. for rent, two pair of sheets and a table cloth, near four yards long, and eight handkerchiefs, one of which was silk and another cambrick; one was my husband's, the rest mine, and an old laced pillow case, which I believe had been my grand-mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take the money?</p>
               <p>I. More. They took one half-crown and gave me again; then they took it away again and made me sit down on the bed, and then, before my eyes, they took the 3 l. 15 s. away, and 20 s. and two half-crowns.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270026"/>Q. Did you see which took your money?</p>
               <p>I. More. I believe Dan took it; I saw him take my box and put it on the table, and take the money out. Some time after this I heard of a robbery in our neighbourhood, and the people were searching for their goods. My husband said he would bring his old woman, and he did not doubt but he should find some of his goods; I went, and amongst the things at Dan's house I found two pair of sheets, a table-cloth four yards long, two handkerchiefs, one silk, the other cambrick; a laced pillow case and a Russia one, within a nail of a yard long; two rags and a white handkerchief; the prisoner and Dan then lived both in a house, and kept a cook's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose all the money you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>I. More. I did; there was not a farthing left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take the money?</p>
               <p>I. More. I saw them take the things out, and fumbling about and putting things into their pockets.</p>

I put 1 l. 5 s. by, for my wife to pay our rent to the landlord; when I returned I found the money gone. As to the linen, my wife knows that best; I know nothing of that, except a spotted handkerchief and two napkins; there was also a case of instruments missing; the case was found, with three of my lancets in it, in the prisoner's house.

Seeing the prisoner take one down, I went out at the door and saw him with it under his arm. I ran and took hold of him, but he drop'd the coat, and slip'd from me. I ran after him and left the coat on the ground. I took him again, and turn'd about to see for the coat, but it was gone.</p>

               <p>Holgate. I am; and he also own'd he took it, said it was of a blueish colour, and beg'd for mercy. I took him before justice Welch, and when the justice asked him what was become of the coat, he said he could not tell who had it.</p>

               <p>Q. What house does he live in?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. He lives at Mrs. Rook's house, in the same street. I saw the prisoner with a child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270027"/> in his arms, at his chamber window, on the 20th of January last, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I was at a one pair of stairs window in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he hold the child?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. He held it in both his hands, and the head of the child was on his right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you observe him standing there?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. It was that minute that I saw him there; he made but one motion and gave it a swing from his arm [ describing in what manner he did it, not much unlike that of flinging a casting net] He came side ways to the window, and so flung it out into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child alive, can you tell, before he flung it out?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I cannot tell. I saw its fingers move as it was coming down like a pidgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child move in his arms before he flung it out?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived in that place?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it his own child?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. He was reputed to be the father of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I am servant to a widow gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him with that child in his arms before?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was the child?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. The child wanted three days of five months old.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner any other children?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his general behaviour?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. I never heard any body give him an ill character in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child after it sell?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not, when he came to give it that swing, you imagine he did it with an intent to destroy the child?</p>
               <p>E. Barden. It had that appearance to me.</p>

            . I live in Rupert-Street. I was in my mother's shop below the prisoner, between the hours of two and three, on the 20th of January. I do not know whether by accident or what, but I saw the child fall by the side of our window; I ran out immediately and took it up, but it was then stone dead. It came out at the three pair of stairs window.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the child last before th</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. I had seen it alive and hearty a three hours before.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine was the death of the child?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. It was the fall that kill'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner lived there?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. My mother has kept the house between eight and nine years, and the prisoner has lived there twelve months last Christmas. The child was born last Bartholomew-day in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever observed the prisoner's behaviour to the child?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. I never saw him behave amiss to it. When it cried he always made a noise about it, and was always tender of it as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him soon after it fell?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. I did; he came down stairs immediately, and said, my child, my child. I said your child is dead. His wife and he came both crying together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be in very great concern?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. I was so concern'd in taking up the child, that I cannot say as to that; he went to my mother's apartment, and said to his wife, give it the bubby, give it the bubby.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him use this child with any sort of cruelty?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. No, he always seem'd to be very fond of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after he desired his wife to give it the bubby?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. He was secured and carried to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it had fallen from his arms?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. He said he was dancing it, and it went out of his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What highth may that window be from the floor of the room?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. It is a high window with a casement.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not such an accident happen by playing with a child in a man's arms?</p>
               <p>E. Wallan. I am not a judge of that; it is a great way over from the window, because there is a gutter before it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was that before the child went out at the window?</p>
               <p>Lord. It was about half an hour before:</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that it went out?</p>
               <p>Lord. It was between two and three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it continue in the cradle before he took it in his arms?</p>
               <p>Lord. Not long; he soon took it up, put it upon his knee, and sat by the fire-side; he seem'd to be fond of it, and made as much of it as ever he could; he put his left-hand under its back-side, hug'd it to his breast, and walked about the room with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the room was you?</p>
               <p>Lord. I was sitting by the fire-side. I saw him walking backwards and forwards with it in his room, but I did not see how it went out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was your face?</p>
               <p>Lord. My face was towards the fire. I heard the prisoner run down stairs and his wife after him. Oh! the child is gone, said he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cry out as soon as the child was gone?</p>
               <p>Lord. Yes, yes he did. I ran down after him. He made no stay, but as soon as the child fell he ran down; I believe in my conscience he did not do it wilfully. There was a blanket round the child; he had that in his hand after the child was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. After he ran down, did he seem to be very much concerned?</p>
               <p>Lord. He did; he went into his landlady's shop, and then they took and carried him away to St. James's round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about its being an accident?</p>

               <p>Lord. It is not a great breadth. The window is just upon a level with the gutter; a body could hardly put one's foot in the gutter.</p>

            . I moved into George-Court on Monday, and this accident happened on the Sunday following. I was at the end of the court, facing the prisoner's window, when this accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the window plain?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I could see it as plain as I can see this window ( pointing to a window in the court.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see at the window?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I saw the prisoner dancing the child at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he hold it?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. He had it on one of his arms, I cannot tell which; it was upright, with a blanket loose about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did he stand to the window?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. As near as possibly he could; the child came out at the window, and the man had the blanket in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him any matter of time?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I had my little boy in my hand, and was looking at the prisoner two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had observed him so long?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I am certain of that, if not more: I look'd at him all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be looking up?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. Because I heard him cheriping to the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270029"/>Q. Did it seem to fall from his hand by a slip, or as if flying from him?</p>
               <p>B. Askins. I cannot say whether it fell or whether he flung it, but he had the blanket in his hand, and cry'd out, O Lord! my child is gone. He went backwards from the window, and the mother of the child lean'd out at the window, so that I thought every moment she would have been down. I saw a woman pick the child up, it was kill'd by the fall.</p>

               <p>Brown. I have [he reads it again.] This is the same trunk, it was pack'd up in the cart. There was some salmon brought up by the Gloucester coach as well as this trunk. I was sent to Billingsgate with the salmon, and then to carry this trunk to Bishopsgate Street. We put it up in the cart between two salmon baskets, so that it could not fall out. Going along Cheapside, at the hither end of the Poultry, on the left-hand side, a man came from the other side of the way, and look'd into the cart. My master's son was leading the horse, and I had a candle and lanthorn. I look'd at him with my light, but took no notice, looking very sharply after the cart. Just as we came opposite to Walbrook, or the Mansion-house, there stood a carriage. I kept along the path-way with my lanthorn in my hand, and going to look at the cart behind, I saw the same man pulling at the trunk; he gave three tugs at it, got it out, and carried it three or four yards. I hallow'd out, and he let it drop against my right leg, by which means I tumbled down, and the man ran away. I called out, Stop thief, and a young man who was coming by followed the man round the Mansion-house. The prisoner was stop'd somewhere by Lombard Street, and brought to me at the cart, and the people said it was the best way to lodge him in the compter till the morning.</p>

               <p>Brown. I did, and took notice of it, not only when I saw him pulling at the trunk, but also when he look'd into the cart; as soon as the prisoner was brought to me I said, this is the man.</p>

               <p>Cockeril. No, I did not; when we were both in Lonbard Street, he went to cross the way, and as he was crossing, a young man stop'd him, and I said hold of his coat; the people went by the end of the court when he ran up it, and so missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man?</p>
               <p>Cockeril. He is; he cry'd, and in the Jews Ianguage said, Pray, pray let me go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That witness is the same man that laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nash, one of the Lord-mayor's marshal's men. I heard Mr. Harrison give a different account from what he has now; if you please to swear me, I will repeat it.</p>
               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Nash. Harrison declared on the prisoner's examination, that the prisoner was the very man, that he saw him taking the box out of the cart, and knew him to be the very man as soon as he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. Did you say as this witness has said?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I said before the alderman, I did not know whether he was the man or not, I believed he might be the man.</p>
               <p>Nash. He said he was the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. When he was taken, was he out of breath?</p>
               <p>Harrison. No, he was not; before the alderman I said I believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Last Tuesday morning I went out with my bag, I deal with several pawnbrokers, and coming home between five and six o'clock, I met one of our people* with a bag of cloaths over his shoulder; I asked him what he had got, and he said he had a parcel of cloaths that would suit me; he pitched them at the Bull and Gate in Holbourn, and I bought them of him for 3 l. I put some in his bag, and some in mine, and we walked to Snow Hill, where we met a person of our acquaintance. We tied the two bags together, and he carried them home. Then we went to the sign of the Cock on Snow Hill, I paid him, and we sat there about two hours. At a little after eight we were coming along the city, a little higher than the Mansion-house; I staid to buy something of a woman, and he walk'd along, thinking I should follow him. As I got to the Mansion-house I heard the cry of Stop thief. Several people ran, and I ran after them, and I saw my partner run as well as the rest. I ran round the Mansion-house, with several before and several behind me, there might be near 50 people. I was running up again, in order to go into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270031"/> Lombard Street, thinking my partner might be there, and was not got a yard out of the alley when a gentleman laid hold of me and said I must stop you, there is a cry of Stop thief. I said, you are mistaken in the person, when up came several butchers and said, here is a Jew thief. They pulled me this way and that way, and when the man that had lost the box came up they said to him, that is the man; said he, I believe he is, and they would not let me say one word more. One of them swore I had a blue coat on, and I had a brown one. I have been an industrious young fellow ever since I was twelve years of age. I return about 50 l. every week, and sometimes 300 l. a month; there is never a dealer in London but what knows me.</p>

I took it, and inquired where the man lived that had given it to him. I found there was such a man in being, and that he lived in a creditable house. I deliver'd him some goods as quick as I could, on the credit of that note. I deliver'd him goods to the amount of about 100 l. before I got the money. When this note was due I apply'd to the person for payment, and he quibbled with me, and said the covenant of the note was not performed; he said, I'll tell you the truth, it is for a core 16 and so, that the prisoner engaged to cure him in such a time, and had not perform'd the cure, but said, as I have given the note I must pay it. I bid him let his time and I would stay, and at last I recover'd my money. After that the prisoner came to me with another pretence, he told me he wanted his first floor furnished, for he had got a nobleman and a lady to take into his house as patients, that he was to have four guineas a week, and would pay me the money as it arose, adding, you see I live in creadit; you see I have forty guineas for a cure at a time, and I'll pay you honestly. I gave him credit in the whole for 244 l. This being a great deal of money I push'd him from time to time, and got of him fifteen guineas, ten guineas and two notes upon a minor, but could get no more of him. I then heard he had had several trials at Westminster, which appear'd very black. He had bespoke several other goods of me, particularly a Sopha, which he said he could not do without in his parlour. He came once to my house and saw two pictures, drawn by Mr. Worlidge, said he, what shall I give you for them? I said three guineas, but I would not part with them without ready money. He said, me pay you ready money for them, but he did not offer to pay me any, so I did not deliver them. After that, I did not see him for some time. I was going out of town to Canterbury, with a funeral. Then I thought proper to call upon him, to tell him I was going out of town, and wanted a little cash, but I could not get any of him. He said nothing about the pictures then. I told him I should be in town about Friday or Saturday, and desired him to pay me some then; he said at Christmas he would pay me all. Before I came back again he had been at my house and got the two pictures, which my servant can give a further account of. I had desired my servant not to deliver them to him without the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live at that time?</p>
               <p>Peirt. He lived in a house in Bream's Buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pay you by bills and money?</p>
               <p>Peirt. He paid me a hundred and fifteen or sixteen pounds; two of the notes in part I have in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of the prisoner's having these pictures?</p>
               <p>Peirt. As soon as I came to town (I came to town on the Friday following; I can't recollect the day of the month, but it was in the month of December, about the middle) I went directly to Tower Hill, where he directed my servant to come; it was at a house where he attended three days a week.</p>

               <p>Bentley. I imagine, from first to last, it might be an hour. I did not go to bed: I was upon it. When I awaked, she was not there. I felt for my watch, and it was gone. After that a soldier came, and told me the prisoner had given him the watch. I went to justice Fielding's, and there I saw it. The prisoner was taken up, and she said to me, if I appeared against her, she should be transported, and beg'd I would not appear.</p>

            . The prisoner delivered a watch to me last Saturday was a fortnight, and desired I would pawn it, but I would not; I had heard the prosecutor say he had lost a watch, so I told my landlord of it, who desired me to get it if possible, that the prosecutor might have it again. Then I went to her, and told her I would pawn it for her, but she would not deliver it to me till we got to the pawnbroker's door. Then I took her by the hand, turned her about, and bid her go along, and carried it to my landlord; it was afterwards produced before justice Fielding, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

            . I keep a publick-house. The prosecutor and prisoner came into my house and call'd for a pint of beer, which they drank, and wentaway. I hearing afterwards that a coachman had lost a watch, and she had stole it, I desired the soldier Harding to get it of her, that I might deliver it to the owner. He went and got it, and brought it to me that very night. Then I said I would have it advertised, and he should see me deliver it to the right owner. The prisoner came into my house afterwards: I told her I would take her to justice Fielding if she came to my house any more; but she soon came again. Then I took her to justice Fielding, and there she told me where the coachman lived. I went and carried the watch to him, and he owned it directly. Then I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270034"/> Mr. Fielding, and he told me to deliver the watch into the constable's hands, which I did, and desired the constable last night to be here, but he is not come.</p>

               <p>I went in at the Red Horse, in Exchange Court, to have a pint of purl, and the prosecutor was drinking some hot, so he asked me to drink with him, which I did. Then he asked me where I lived. I said in the Strand. He desired to go home with me, which he did. We had some more liquor, and then lay down on my bed. I said he should not stay without he would give me some money, so he left his watch with me for a crown. I went to this soldier Harding, and asked him to pawn it for a crown; he was with me three or four hours.</p>

I said, what do you ask for it? Said the prisoner, take this lump at any price, take it at half a crown, which made me suspect it was stolen. I said, tell me where you had it, you shall not carry it out of the house. He said he had it in Thames Street. Said I, did the master or servant deliver it to you? He said it was the master, and that they were to carry it to some inn. I said, then how came it here? I will send for a constable. Then the other man ran away. The constable came, and I gave him charge of the prisoner. We inquired at one place and another in the neighbourhood, and at last found the owner, who came and own'd it. Then we sent the prisoner to the Compter, and the next day he was taken before a magistrate, and committed. The constable deliver'd the sugar to the prosecutor.</p>

            ) and I used to lay together. We had some words, and he struck me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270037"/> on the 20th of January. Then my master came and ordered us to bed. Horn bid me to make the bed, but I would not because he had beat me. Then he tuck'd up the bed as small as he could, for only himself to lay in it, went to bed, and would not let me lay with him. I was sitting on the prisoner's bed in the same room. The prisoner said, here is room enough in my bed, so I went to bed to him; and in about a quarter of an hour he got my legs between his, and his arm round my neck; here he proved the fact laid in the indictment, which is too indecent a subject to be particular upon. I struggled to get away, but could not. I called to Horn several times, and he answered me but once, saying, he would not get out of bed for me. I told Horn how he had used me the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lay near you?</p>
               <p>Churchill. If I had made a very great noise, nobody could hear me besides Horn, the family laying two pair of stairs lower.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called to Horn, did not you tell him the reason of your calling?</p>
               <p>Churchill. I said, let me come into that bed, for I do not know what he will do with me; I believe he will ruin me if you do not come to help me out. This was on the Sunday night, and on the next morning I told Horn of it. On the Friday following I told my mother of it, which was as soon as I saw her; she lives in the Fleet Market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell your master of it?</p>
               <p>Churchill. No, I did not, for I was afraid he would make a noise about it. I had went once before with an intent to tell my mother, but she was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever ask you to go to bed afterwards?</p>
               <p>Churchill. No. He is a <rs id="t17600227-44-deflabel234" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

            . I am twenty years of age next June. After the boy had been in bed with the prisoner about a quarter of an hour, I heard him cry out, be easy, old Bell; a name the prisoner went by among his countrymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him call out in any other words?</p>
               <p>Horn. I heard him repeat that twice: I heard him say no more than those words all that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived in the house?</p>
               <p>Horn. About six or seven weeks. The next morning Churchill told me that the prisoner offered him a silk handkerchief to lay still, and that the old man ( meaning the prisoner) had had to do with him. I asked him how. He said he was ashamed to tell me, and he never told me any farther.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did your bed stand to the prisoner's bed?</p>
               <p>Horn. From the side of my bed to the feet of the prisoner's bed, is about four feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to keep the boy out of your bed?</p>
               <p>Horn. He heaved a bit of a tobacco-pipe at me, so I gave him a blow, and the bed not being made, he said he would not make it, and I said, then he should not lay in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, whether the boy did not call upon you several times, complain, and desire your assistance?</p>
               <p>Horn. I heard him say no more than the words I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him no answer at all?</p>
               <p>Horn. I don't remember that I did; there was a countryman of the prisoner's in the same bed with them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Churchill. Was there another man in bed with the prisoner and you?</p>
               <p>Churchill. There was; it was one of his countrymen; he lay on the other side of the bed, and the prisoner in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Churchill. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Horn. How did you understand that of the old man's having had to do with him</p>
               <p>Horn. I understood it was something of this nature.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this before the prisoner was taken up?</p>
               <p>Horn. He was taken up on the Sunday morning following.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master do nothing in it?</p>
               <p>Horn. I believe he knew nothing of it till the constable came to take the prisoner up.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged at my house; he went to bed drunk on the Sunday night, and another of his countrymen lay with him. My two apprentices lay in the same room, in another bed. I examined the boy, and heard nothing of this till the Sunday following. When the prisoner was taken up, the boy went out of my house every day of his life, and he never went out but he would call upon his mother, and would stay a long time on errands. I sent him that day on which he says he told his mother, at half an hour after three, and he never came home till nine in the evening. He went every day that week to a finisher at Westminster; he has been with me about six months, and is a very silly, empty boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Horn?</p>
               <p>Brasset. He is a good civil lad enough; he has made complaints to me that he did not chuse to lay with Churchill, because he used to be always hugging and bussing him, and that the boy once said to him, you are very rankey, it is a wonder you do not love me as old Bell did, taking hold of his private parts, using an abscence word. I have seen the boy hang over him in the kitchen and kiss him, and the other would knock his head away. The prisoner has got the foul disease now, and he had it then.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think so?</p>
               <p>Brasset. Because he cannot go to the whores our way but what he must get it immediately.</p>

               <p>Thomson. He said he asked his fellow apprentice what day it was, and he said it was on a Monday, on which account I went and brought several people to prove him on board a ship; he went also a whoreing that Monday night.</p>
               <p>Brasset. There were five Portuguese lay in the next room to them, who could all speak English; and if the boy had made a noise I could easily have heard him, and I would have gone up with my sword and ran him through the body.</p>

I gave her a good character and she said almost three months in her place, but she was too weak for it and was forced to come away, but with a good character. After that Mrs. Sands took her to a bawdy-house, and call'd for a quartern of rum. I believe all this is owing to Mrs. Sands being jealous of her, for Mr. Sands told me he was obliged to prosecute, or he should have no peace; and Mrs. Sands told me with her own mouth, she never found her guilty of any thing amiss.</p>
