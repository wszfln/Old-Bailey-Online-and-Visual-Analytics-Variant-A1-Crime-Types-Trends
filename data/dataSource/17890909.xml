Williams said he saw Marsden pull the watch out of his pocket; I said if there is any it is yours, for I had none, and Marsden had none. was informed by a Gentleman, that as I was innocent, I had no occasion for witnesses.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you, I was out at two in the morning, and not all night? - He said he had been out a great while, I think it was all night.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of July I was at the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street, and Smith came down, I went with him to the Three Tuns in Oxford-street; I took the prisoner into custody; I waited with him till they fetched the mare out of the stable, Mr. Patie told me it was his stable; I desired they would bring it and come along with me, I took the prisoner and the mare to Litchfield-street office; the magistrates were gone out of the office; I put the prisoner into St. Ann's-watch house, and the mare I took to the White Bear livery-stable, St. Ann's Soho, I gave the stable-keeper charge of her, to suffer no person to have her but myself; at six in the evening the prisoner was brought before the magistrate and committed on suspicion according to the evidence; I enquired of him very minutely who he was, and where he had lived; I searched him and found this pocket book with several receipts in it in the name of Beadle; I told him then his name could not be Smith, as he had made out the receipt which I found in his pocket book, in the name of Smith; the receipt in his pocket book was to receive the money for a Mr. Shaw who he said lived in Long-acre, I went to enquire, and at last heard of a Mr. Shaw that had lived in Mercer-street, Long-acre, that had kept a chandler's shop and dealt in vinegar, which he told me; the prisoner did not say Mercers-street, he told me Long-acre; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090009"/>found several receipts in his pocket book as receipts from Mr. Shaw, some for grocery and some for vinegar, and upon enquiry the people could not tell me where he was: but he was gone away; then the prisoner told me he had the mare from a miller at Lee Bridge out of his marshes, I think his name was Hodges; I went down to Lee Bridge to enquire, and on enquiry there I found they had had none in the marshes for a considerable time; the prisoner farther informed me that he had left word at the turnpike gate at Lee Bridge to inform Mr.

             the miller that he had taken Mr. Shaw's mare from the marshes; upon enquiry at the turnpike gate they told me they had had no such message; and Hodges told me he had not had one in the marshes for some time past; he referred me to the marsh driver at Hackney, to know if any had been strolling about; the marsh driver said he had not seen any; and I got a direction to Mr. Dodd; the prosecutor swore to his mare and the prisoner was committed; when the prosecutor came up to town he gave me a description of a man he suspected, that had been at his stables, which answered to the description the prisoner gave to me of Shaw; and according to the description given when he came to town and saw the prisoner, says he, that is not the man I suspected; he then described a person that seemed to me to answer the description that the prisoner had given me of Shaw.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dodd. What sort of a mare was your mare? - A black mare about fifteen hands high or better, two white feet behind, ten or a dozen years old, but she was past eight; there was a man came into the stable on the Tuesday night, before I lost the mare, and he asked my servant if he could tell him of a job, I was in the yard but he said nothing to me, but turned out of the stable again; he appeared to have a shortish white waistcoat on, about my pitch, I rather suspected the man, after the prisoner was taken I said to Mr. Dalton, this is not the man I suspected him to be; I have no other reason for suspecting the other man, he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find out a man of the name of Shaw that they talked of? - No, I do not know any such man; I have enquired, but not heard of such a man; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

             a day or two before; I heard Patie bought horses; I went to him and told him I had one to dispose of, and they went with me to Great Queen-street; I got up much about two o'clock; I live at Islington. Mr. Patie said my man is at such a place; my man buys all my horses; I asked him eight guineas, the man said no, she is a very old mare, and very bad feet; I cannot give so much; we had a pot of porter, and he said I will give five guineas, and if any body will give me a guinea more, they shall have her; says Patie I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090010"/>have a guinea; and he gave me the guinea; I told him do not want you to pay me; I wrote a note before ever I was stopped, and sent to Shaw, and gave a man a shilling to go to him, desiring him to come and take his money; and they know that.</p>

               <p>Smith. He called in the man, and gave him a shilling to go somewhere; I understood it was to go to White chapel.</p>

               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; these men and another came and laid hold of me, and asked where I was going? I told them I was going home; and then Burrows asked me what I had got? I told him nothing; he put his hand into my pocket, the other two ran before him, and he knocked me down; I struggled for my money, but he got it before he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Had either of the other two spoken to you at all? - Yes, they were accusing me, and calling me all they could call me.</p>
               <p>What were they accusing you of? - They were calling me many names; it was the prisoner Burrows that asked where I was going; the other man did not speak; they were speaking to him; I do not know what they said, but they went off; none of them touched me but Burrows.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it, light or dark? - I think it was about twelve o'clock; it was a dark night; it was not very clear; I struggled with Burrows some time, till I got assistance, and he ran through a narrow passage; I called for the watch, and kept hold of him, he knocked me down and took my hat, and another man seized me by the collar directly; that was after we got down the passage; the passage was a thoroughfare, the street is called the Amby; it was so dark I could not distinguish the faces, except of the man that I caught hold of; the other went off; I held him by the coat till he knocked me down the second time, and I got help; I never missed him; he never was out of my reach or sight, till the watchman and another man came to my assistance; the prisoner was taken and carried to the watch-house; he was in soldiers clothes; the other was taken about a quarter of an hour after; that is the other lad in the red coat: I gave information of three; the prisoner was not searched till he came to the watch-house; the prisoner Burrows came and snatched the hat from the other prisoner, and ran off with it; I saw him; that was before we got him to the watch-house: I saw no money found on him when he was searched; the struggle was some time; they had all bayonets hung in their belts, but used no arms to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Nally, Prisoner's Counsel. What business are you? - I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Are not you a waiter at a public house? - No.</p>
               <p>What house are you porter to? - A gentleman in Ely place.</p>
               <p>What gentleman? - Mr. Brodie.</p>
               <p>Were not you then, or are not you now waiter at a public house in Holborn? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>What is Mr Brodie? - A wine merchant: I was at a friend's that I have in Westminster, the soldier came up to me, and asked me directly where I was going.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you before this? Not much; they asked me where I was going? and I told them I was going home; and in the mean time they had their hands in my pocket; there was no conversation but them words; when this lad had his hand in my pocket; that was Stroud, I saw him putting his hand in my right hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>It was dark? - Yes, it was not moonlight; it was dark; I was a great deal frightened.</p>
               <p>Was you near a lamp? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Was there sufficient light for you to distinguish one man's countenance from another? - Yes; I recollect the countenance of the lad in brown; I do not swear to the countenance of the man in red; the one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090012"/>that robbed me I never let him out of my sight or hands.</p>
               <p>Was not the blow by which you lost your hat a blow in the man's defence, when he was pursued? - He gave me a blow down, he took off my hat and knocked me down after taking it off.</p>
               <p>Was not you fighting at the time he took off your hat? - I was struggling to hold him, he was not struggling to get from me, he took off my hat and knocked me down and went forwards.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see these soldiers before? - I never saw them with my eyes before, we have so many soldiers, it was a dark night; I ran up and held my candle and lanthorn right in their faces to see whether I could swear to their faces again.</p>

               <p>But that is not calling you names? - No more; they were talking to themselves, but I do not know any thing more, the other men stopped and Stroud was behind, then they stood, and Stroud came and I laid hold of him, and says I give me my own; and he knocked me down, and I called for the watch.</p>

               <p>When did you get up? - Just as the day broke, and the morning sun; that was I believe about four o'clock; then I came towards London, to the lodging that I always resorted to; I went to see whether I could get any justice, or a constable to apprehend these people; I went to the justice, but no justice would hear me, it was Sunday; I did not go to any justice the next day, for I never expected to meet one of them afterwards till the Wednesday. I met Mahony just at the end of Oxford-road, I took him, and carried him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090015"/>justice; when I asked him to spare me my life, he desired me to lay alongside of my countrys an that hung in chains thereabouts; I lost all my money, I was perfectly sober indeed, they seemed to me to be sober, excepting Mahony, and he could not be drunk, from what was there, nor none of them; I say they were sober.</p>

               <p>I was at Bow-street when these men were brought in; a person came to me, and gave me information, and I took this waistcoat off M'Cauley, at Bow-street, and this coat I took off Ridge; I never saw Shaw or M'Cauley in my life, I am not the apprehender of any one of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my coat and waistcoat, and all these things; they were on the counter a few minutes before I got up, I am sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>PRISONER RIDGE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been seeking for work, and could not get any, I saw some men coming over Hounslow Heath, and they asked me if I had lost a jack-ass; they gave me a jack-ass, loaded with hampers, and they desired me to take and find an owner for it, so I drove it along, and I overtook this lad; the waistcoat and coat were at top; it rained, and I took the coat and put it on to keep off the rain; before I came to Acton, I overtook the other prisoners, and when we came to Acton, we were stopped, the man came to the jack-ass, and owned it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to Brentford, my father was extremely ill; I went with two of the other prisoners, I arrived there the Friday afternoon, I slept at the Bull, and got up about four in the morning, I was very ill, and came to Town, and I met these men, and this boy, driving a jack-ass and hampers; he asked what it was o'clock, it was past five; he said, which road are you going? I said, towards Acton to go home; then I went into the Red Lion, to get a pot of beer, and some bread and cheese, we came out, and Mr. Cole stopped us.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'CAULEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got up to go to work about three in the morning; I went to the Bull, at Hounslow; I could not find my aunt's, and the man overtook me; says he, here is a jackass strolling along, it was the gentleman in blue, that overtook me; but it rained, and he said, as it rains, we may as well put on these things; so I put on the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Acton from Brentford? - Rather better than three miles.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Did any conversation pass about this business? - They owned one ass; Ridge owned that which was loaded, but not the others.</p>
               <p>Did the others take any part? - Two of them tried to make their escape; that was Shaw, and Baker (the boy), they were all together, before I overtook them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Lloyd called two witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner M'Cauley called four witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>This man owes me an old grudge; he wanted to use me impudent; I was frightened at a big man laying hold of me, and I dropped a shilling; and I had a bason in my hand at the time; and the watchman came up; and then the prosecutor said these ladies are going to steal the beans.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw one of them before, and I have used the market fifteen years; they brought the goods out of the square by the dial; it was broad day-light.</p>

               <p>Then if people chuse to come thro' the mud, they may get into your master's dockyard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it difficult? - Not very difficult: the kettle may be very near two hundred and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I coming out of the gate? - He was coming to the gate; the kettle was eight or nine yards from the gate.</p>

               <p>Court to Andrews. Might not the footsteps you observed in the mud, be those of a person coming from the mud, instead of going to it? - No, they could not, because the person must have come through a quantity of mud, and have jumped up upon a plank, and the first foot mark in the mud was so far from the plank that he must have jumped from the plank to the mud, by taking a run first, and he could not have jumped such a distance from the mud, up upon the plank.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber, I live at Stanmore, this lead was delivered to me and Mr. Finch, by the constable, to see whether it matched the mausoleum from which it was taken, I fitted it, and it matched not only one piece, but all the pieces; I was at work on the church on Saturday, and on Monday morning I missed this lead; this mausoleum belongs to the Duke of Chandos, it stands in the church-yard; I am positive this lead was taken from that mausoleum.</p>

               <p>I am agent to the Duke of Chandos, I went in company with the last witness to fit this lead to the mausoleum, it belongs to the Duke, it fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. In consequence of this information, I had the prisoner apprehended; I suspected Boulton, and got a warrant to search his lodging; I saw his wife, she fetched him, and I found the property on Boulton.</p>

               <p>I went down to Westminster, with six bundles of small hand paper; I put it on the bench, the corner of the public-house, in Downing-street, where Mr. Pitt lives; I went into the house, to go backwards, and a gentleman said he would take care of the load; when I came back, the load was gone; I came back to Parliament-street, and King-street, and Charles-street to look for it; and could see nothing of it; the next morning, as I had the bill, and the stampt receipt, I went to one Mr. Cartwright's, and borrowed three bundles; then I went to Mr. Greenland's in the Little Sanctuary, he lent me three more, I was to make them good; I carried them at twice, to Mr. Wilkinson's, the linen-draper, I brought home the money next morning; our shopman asked me where I had been all night, and I gave him the money; I did not know what to do about this paper; Mr. Cartwright said he would trust me, and I told him of the loss, and when I came back again home, the next morning, I did take these two bundles of paper, and gave to Mr. Boulton; I was going to take them down to this Mr. Cartwright; I went with three the next morning, which the shopman sent me down with to Mr. Greenland's the Little Sanctuary, I brought back the money safe, I never defrauded my master before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any mark on the paper? - There is the King's mark.</p>
               <p>Court. That is on all paper? - The same number is not on any other papers but these, because the same officer does not survey any other bill but mine, I can swear positively not only to that, but the hand writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of this story? - I am apprehensive that he lost some paper, and I really believe the reason of his taking away this paper was to supply that loss.</p>

            ; our private mark is upon it, E. E. and E. S. I know them to be my master's hand-writing; I did not enquire whether such a piece was missing, when I returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe this woman had dealt at your shop, several times before? - She had.</p>
               <p>After she was in custody, there was an application made to her, to give up her keys, was not there? - I believe there was, I do not know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that she did give up her keys, in order that any search, that was necessary, might be made, as to the goods and duplicates, that might lead to a discovery? - Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Then she did? - I believe she did, as I heard my master say, deliver the keys of her apartments.</p>
               <p>There was a search made; in consequence of that search, there was a petticoat and some other things taken? - There was a petticoat taken, and brought to our house.</p>
               <p>That coat was taken on suspicion that it was your master's property, and stolen from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was returned to her afterwards? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it appeared to be regularly bought and paid for? - There was a remnant of cotton -</p>
               <p>Answer the question; I am confining myself to the petticoat? - I do not know; the remnant of cotton she never bought at our shop.</p>
               <p>Is that other shopman here? - He is not here.</p>
               <p>She bought some things, and did not pay for them? - I heard her say, I will be in again directly and pay for what I have looked out, make out the bill of parcels; she always went out, before she paid for all she bought, she left some money.</p>
               <p>Then Hopkins the shop-man, was doing with her, exactly in the way he was accustomed to do? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not observe every article she looked out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what passed between them? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this woman must be acquitted; she is in conversation with a man, bargaining and dealing with him, from whom it is possible, she had the goods; and this very cotton might be in that very bill, and on credit; and nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090033"/>can prove the transaction between them, but the very man who dealt with her, and whom the prosecutor has not brought, to give an account before you.</p>

               <p>Were any promises made use of? - None by me, nor by any person before me.</p>

               <p>How long had you been retired to your room, before you heard the dog? - About half an hour, I was just got into bed, but had not put out my light.</p>
               <p>I believe on the 14th, you had some magistrates at your house? - No; peace officers, from Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Was you present at the time he was apprehended? - I was, he was taken by Shakeshaft, Armstrong, and Harper; in my presence, and of Steward, he was taken on the other side Tower-hill, I do not know the identical spot in the street.</p>
               <p>I believe at first the officer collared him, and used him a little roughly? - Not in the least, I believe they said no otherwise than this to him, they went up to him, and before they spoke to him, he was going on in a wild station, and when he saw them, he could not stir.</p>
               <p>And upon that I believe you said, do not collar him, I do not wish to hurt him? - Upon my word I cannot tell what I said, I was very much confused.</p>
               <p>This young man was kept in custody from the 18th till the 20th? - The 19th was Sunday.</p>
               <p>What time was he taken into custody? - I think between nine and ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>What time on the 20th was he carried before the magistrate? - I did not go down there till about twelve.</p>
               <p>In whose custody was he kept during all that time? - These three people that took him, he was kept in the watch-house all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you overhear all the conversation that passed between Armstrong and the prisoner, in the way from the place where he was apprehended to the place where he was taken to? - Yes, I believe I was not further behind, than I am from you.</p>
               <p>I can very easily believe that you made no promises; did not Armstrong or Shakeshaft, or Harper; but particularly Armstrong, did not he use a great deal of persuasion to this young man, to induce him to confess? - I should think Mr. Armstrong had better answer for himself.</p>
               <p>Sir, you will condescend to let me manage the defence of this young man in my own way? - You seem to know about it, you had better explain.</p>
               <p>That is very gross and abominable and infamous conduct in a prosecutor; I ask you, and do not tell me again that I had better explain; upon your oath, Sir, what did Armstrong say, and repeat it as nearly as you can? - What Armstrong said to him, was first regarding the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, you are prosecuting a young man for his life? - My lord I know it; and I am as partial to the prisoner as any man in the court.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider your situation; you come here as a prosecutor; if the counsel should ask you a question that is not proper, I shall find it my duty to stop him; but you are not competent to judge of the propriety of the question? - He said where the prisoner had been that night; what he had done; and the different places he had stopped at; what he had left regarding to his boots and other things, as near as I can possibly recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be understood that Armstrong held no conversation with the prisoner respecting the circumstances of the robbery? - Do you think that, when I made an application to the peace officers; I did not tell them the nature of the thing in which I was robbed.</p>
               <p>I ask you this, Sir; not what you told the peace officer; I ask you not what you said to any body; but whether Armstrong said any thing to the prisoner respecting the concern he was supposed to have respecting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090035"/>the robbery of your house? - I cannot give any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Flourish apart; and God knows when a man's life is at stake, that is not the time for flourish; did Armstrong, or did he not, say anything to the prisoner at the bar, after he had him in custody, with respect to his supposed share in the robbery? - Not to my knowledge, he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say he did not, as far as you recollect! - I will.</p>
               <p>Nothing of any sort? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Then Armstrong did not say in your presence, for God's sake! tell me all that you know of this affair, that innocent persons may not be suspected? - To my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>He did not desire him to say that he had let in two men to rob your house; and that if he did say so, they wanted to get at those two men, and they would set him at liberty? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody ever said in your hearing, that he should have his liberty on any terms? - No such thing in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Was not he told that he had better tell the whole truth? - I believe Armstrong said this; what ever you have to tell, tell it; but nothing further, neither better nor worse; that was in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that it would be as well for him; or that it would be better for him; for that there were other apprentices that might be suspected: did not he entice him in short, to take this guilt upon himself? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>After you were at the watch-house, were you and the prisoner alone in the room? - Never till after his examination, which he signed.</p>
               <p>Am I to collect from you; that speaking now, seriously and solemnly; taxing your recollection, nothing was said to him to induce him to confess? - No one individual thing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Does your knowledge afford a certainty of it? - In my hearing they never did.</p>
               <p>Did you never authorise any body to do so? - Never; I gave gave a strict charge to any of my people, never to go near him.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with a brother of his,

               <p>There again it is better for you not to judge: do you mean to swear that you have not had any conversation with that brother about this business? - I believe I spoke to him on the Sunday, to tell him the circumstances his brother then was in; and I likewise spoke to him, that he might have his clothes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell that brother that there had been promises of forgiveness made to this young man, before he made the confession; and that until these promises, he had absolutely denied his guilt? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you, that you never made use of any expressions to that effect, or of that import to the brother? - Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to the brother about his confession at all? - Upon my word I cannot say, if it was after the Monday I spoke to him concerning his confession.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that this young man on the day after the robbery, and afterwards, had denied he knew anything about it; but that upon some promise being made to him, he confessed his guilt? - Never, nor anything relating to the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you never say to the brother, that you would not hurt the prisoner, as he had confessed it? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>How long had this young man lived with you? - As near as I can recollect, I think he came the latter end of last October.</p>
               <p>I observed you said, that to the best of your knowledge, you fastened the door when you came in? - I swear positively that that door was fastened when my dog lay against it; I can swear to the best of my recollection, that six nights out of the seven, I fastened it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090036"/>And therefore, as it was your general habit, you conclude that you did it that night? - I do.</p>

               <p>Was that the door where the dog laid? - Yes</p>

             and Joseph Jones were the two men, being with him in Moor-fields on the evening of the robbery, Jones gave him something to give the dog, which Jones said would poison him, which he gave the dog; and on Tuesday evening the day of the robbery, he met Jones and Colston on great Tower-hill, and they gave him two guineas, and no more, and said that was his share of his master's plate, and then he went home to his master's, and says he has not since seen them."

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am brother to this unfortunate lad.</p>
               <p>After your brother was taken into custody, did you see his master at all? - On the Sunday, as he was taken on the Saturday night, the prosecutor came to our house, I was at the next door, having my hair tied, he enquired for Mr. Clarke's, he said he wanted his son, says he, you are not the person; the prosecutor laid hold of my arm, says he my name is Berkenhead, your brother is apprentice to me, and I took him up last night for robbing of me, but says he, I promise not to hurt him, if he will confess; and desired me, by no means, to let my father or mother know it, for he meant to give him his liberty the next morning, Monday morning; he desired me, particularly, when he left me, not to let them know it, because it would occasion them a great deal of uneasiness, and he intended him to have his liberty on Monday morning, and he would not hurt him; he said if he did not confess, he would certainly be hung; I was sent for to Shoreditch watch-house, and I went to my brother, and I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090039"/>what Mr. Berkenhead said to me, and he told me, that Mr. Berkenhead had promised him the same, and the officers, that it would be best, he declared to me that he knew nothing of it; I told him as Mr. Berkenhead had given his word to have his liberty, to say whatever his master would with him to say; that was on the Sunday, and on the Monday he made this confession; nobody was in the shop, but the hairdresser and me, his name is Ewington, I did not know he had heard any thing of the affair till I came in again, and he said that gentleman has been robbed; I said, yes, he has; and he said he does not mean to hurt the person if he will confess; I said no, and let the conversation drop; I found the hair-dresser listened.</p>
               <p>And you swear positively that on the Sunday you told your brother what Mr. Berkenhead had said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What day of the month was this? - On Sunday, I cannot recollect the day of the month, it was about one, I went to my brother in the evening, not before; I was not there again in the morning on the Monday; I was at work in a hurry; I supposed by Mr. Berkenhead making that promise, that he meant to perform the promise; when he was fully committed to Newgate, I went then, when Mr. Berkenhead came and told me, I suppose it might be him; nobody was with Mr. Berkenhead, and this conversation was at the door of the shop of the hair dresser, close to our door; it is in Jewin-street, the hair-dresser had nobody in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. You have heard what this witness has sworn, is that she brother you alluded to when I examined you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it true that you went to him at the hair-dresser's? - I called on him at the hairdresser's and asked him where his brother in law, Mr. Franklin, lived.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Franklin? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any part of his family except that brother on the Sunday? - No.</p>
               <p>Did that conversation which he has now stated, pass between you? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you go there for? - Why I wanted to see his brother in law, as it was through him I had the prisoner, he told me he lived in St. Paul's-church-yard, I told him, I supposed he could not be ignorant I had been robbed; he said no, that his brother had been home, and told him that they had all been examined; I told him then, that his brother was in custody, but where, or any thing further, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him not to let his father and mother know of it? - Why I believe I did, not, till I had seen Franklin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the boy was to be indicted for a capital offence, the sooner his father and mother knew of it the better; if he was to be set at liberty, it was not worth while to trouble their old age; why did you mention that, unless the young man was the next day, to be restored to his liberty? I can conceive that it is humane, it is kind, it is benevolent not to tell them; but if at the distance of a month, their son is to be hanged, the sooner they knew of it, the better; upon your oath, did not you tell the brother, and recollect that this poor boy's life, depends now upon your recollection; did you tell Franklin so? - Upon my oath I did not, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did not the boy's brother understand, the boy was not to be committed? - Upon my oath I never understood it myself, nor said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that he was to go before the magistrate to-morrow? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him he was to go to make confession? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, and to take the risk of it; you are but a young man, you may have many days to live, do you mean to take upon yourself to say that you did not convey to this near relation of his the idea, that the next day he was to be discharged? - On my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Very well! it is your business, thank God! not mine; I defy human ingenuity to point out a reason, except a barbarous one, for the caution, unless he was to be discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Franklin about it, on Sunday? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Then your only purpose in going, was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090040"/>find Franklin, and to have some conversation with him, and after that you did not see Franklin? - I went home, and from thence went into the country.</p>
               <p>When did you next meet Franklin? - Not till Monday.</p>
               <p>Not till after the lad was committed? - I believe before.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was before? - Yes, Sir, I will.</p>
               <p>Did Franklin attend before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>So then neither Franklin, nor the brother, nor the father, nor the mother, nor any of the relations attended before the magistrate; now can you help us to a reason, can you help us to a conjecture about it, why this young man was to be deserted in his distress, unless you was to be his protector.</p>

             asked the gentleman whether he should send his sister to shew where his brother in law lived; the gentleman refused letting the girl go; he asked him in door, but the gentleman refused; the gentleman told him the lad should come home on Monday morning; and desired Francis not to take any notice to his father and mother concerning the matter; they were about five minutes together; I was listening at the shop door, with my head half in the entry, and half in the shop; when Clarke came in, he sat down; I put the cloth about him; says I, that gentleman has been robbed, by what I hear? and he made answer to me, yes, in a slight indifferent manner, as if it was of no consequence to me; I said, I heard the gentleman say he had promised the person he would forgive him, if he would confess; nothing further ensued between us; Clarke dropped the conversation; a fortnight after, we were in a publick-house, drinking a pot of beer; then he related the circumstance to me concerning this affair; I had heard before that his brother was in custody; but I never took any notice to him, till he did to me.</p>

               <p>Francis and you are pretty well acquainted, I take it? - Very little acquainted; no otherwise than he dresses with me; and I use him as a customer.</p>
               <p>He lives next door to you? - He does so; we are but very lately acquainted; I have not known him above two months.</p>
               <p>He did not say the person had confessed? - No; he said if they would confess.</p>
               <p>Did he desire him to use his interest with the young man? - No; I understood he was to be at home at Mr. Clarke's house.</p>
               <p>Then, when he came into the shop again, you did not know it was his brother? - No, Sir, nor for a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Why was it to be at Mr. Clarke's house, if you did not know it was Clarke's brother? - I never saw young Clarke in my life; I collected that he would be at home on the Monday; I understood at Mr. Clarke's house, but I could not justly tell; I cannot positively say it must be at Mr. Clarke's house.</p>

               <p>Court. Who went last to bed in your house? - I did; every night before I go to bed; and the night before this, I examined the pins of the windows, and all was safe.</p>
               <p>How do you apprehend they got into your house? - I apprehend they got in under the bulk, and from thence made their way to those places, from whence the things were lost.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver; I know the prisoner, I have seen him three times; at ten minutes after five, the 24th of July, I saw the prisoner and another going over to Mr. Good's house.</p>
               <p>Court. It was light then? - It was as light almost as it is now; so his companion knowing something of me declined the job; the prisoner went to Mr. Good's door, and went in, as if he lived there; now I do not take upon me to say he broke the door open, the door was closed, it was under a catch latch; I was too distant to hear a latch move, I was thirty-six yards off; the prisoner shut the door to, and came out into the street, and brought out a pier looking glass, it appeared to me to be a yard in length, and about twenty inches over; by the distance I was, I took him to be the servant of the shop; if he had had other clothes on, I could not have sworn to him, at that distance; I do not go by his face, only his clothes; I never saw him before, in my life; he had on a pair of crimson breeches, two buckles in his hat, a flapped hat, and a red coat; when he left the house he went up a new road, about forty yards off, when I went to the office, the prisoner was precisely dressed the same way, I think; but I am sure the breeches was.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the two buckles in his hat; I did not observe it; as to the coat, I made no further observation, but I think it is the same he had on at the office.</p>

               <p>Court. How many stories are there in the house? - Two stories; there is the lower rooms, one pair of stairs, and garret; I secured the woman, and they all rushed up stairs; I and the woman went up stairs into the garret, and saw the man almost naked in the garret, with only his flannel waistcoat and his breeches on; he at that time was not subdued, but was in the act of resistance; I assisted, and handcuffed him myself; the first thing I saw after that, was a furnace lighted with a charcoal fire in this fore-garret; and this pot was on the fire, which I took off; the contents is in it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What else did you find there? - I found every thing necessary for two pair of flasks; the frames, boards, and screws; all these things were found in the garret, besides scouring-paper, cork, charcoal, files, old crucibles, a pair of seales, about an ounce weight of this metal, which I am informed is silver, at least, some of it; I searched the woman at the bar; and while I was searching her right hand pocket, I saw her put her hand into her left hand pocket; and I saw these two six-pences drop; in her right hand pocket I found these two other six-pences; after that, I went down stairs with the man; and a coat lay on the bed; and I asked if it belonged to him? he said it did; I searched the right hand pocket, and I found this silver, two shillings, and seven six-pences, and some silver or metal; he put the coat on, and went away in it before the magistrate: in the back window of the back room below stairs, lay these four base shillings, and seven six-pences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How many stories are there in the house? - There are two cellars, two lower rooms above the cellars, even with the street, two rooms up one pair of stairs, and two garrets.</p>
               <p>I observe, Mr. Fletcher, that the information was granted in the name of Johnson; she was the woman that knocked at the door; do you know that woman for any long time? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Do you know her by any other name; for I observe that her name in the warrant is on an erasure; was not the information given in the name of Williams? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that her husband was in custody for a felony? - I do not know she has a husband.</p>
               <p>I mean the man she cohabits with, by the name of Williams, is in custody for a felony? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in custody for stealing a weight, and uttering base money? - I do not know the charge.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Williams and the woman that went with you to the house, occupied the garret which you have searched? - I do not.</p>
               <p>That, however, was the woman who gave you the information? - It was.</p>
               <p>When you first saw the woman, she was looking out of the window; afterwards you describe her as being on the stairs; she had not time to do anything in the mean time? - No, nothing else but to go up stairs and down again.</p>

             after him; and I followed them; and I saw them two a fighting together; then, after we had been at it some time, we secured him, and began to search the place; and I found this coin.</p>
               <p>(The coin produced.)</p>
               <p>Have you kept them in your possession ever since? - Yes; they are a parcel of six pences which were on the ledge of the garret window; and likewise this leather-bag with some more bits of cut shillings and six-pences.</p>
               <p>Do you know anything of the mode of the carrying on this business? - I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090053"/>Do these cut shillings appear to be good or bad? - Bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did Fletcher come into the room? - He followed me close.</p>
               <p>Do you know this woman that lives with Williams? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know where her husband, or the man she lives with, was at the time she gave this information? - I have been told he was in Barking gaol.</p>
               <p>You have been told he was in Barking gaol; upon your oath, did you not fetch him from Barking gaol this morning? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>As a witness in this cause I suppose? - I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>What was he in custody for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What, had you so little curiosity, that travelled with him from Barking to London, and yet never asked him why he was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>You really do not know what he was in custody for? - No; I heard somebody say he was in for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Who had you your order from? - Justice Staples.</p>
               <p>Do you or do you not know that Williams and this woman that gave the information, occupied the very garret you have been searching, till he had the good fortune to get into Barking gaol? - No.</p>

               <p>In which room did you find it? - In the room where the prisoner was in, in the garret; I found it up by the side of the wall, just by where the flasks and things lay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know Williams, the man you have fetched from Barking gaol this morning? - I never saw him till we fetched him from Barking.</p>

               <p>Was desired by the court to explain what the things found in the possession of the prisoners were; and accordingly describes the whole process, he sets the frames, for the inspection of the court; and shews which is called a mould, and the channel in it, which is called the get.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the crucible to melt in? - The metal in it was for the purpose of re-melting.</p>
               <p>What are these other things? - Here is other flasks, and other metal; here is some appears to be silver; at least, it is of a good composition; and some blanched copper, and something to blanch it with, corks, scouring-paper, files, shears, and a piece of a warming-pan; there is no sand here, but only the faceing; here is every thing compleat for casting; here are some coins made use of for paterns; the white stuff in the window appears to be wrought arsenic; by melting down copper with this, and it being fluxed together, gives it the first degree of whiteness; these which came from the garret, are a quantity of bad shillings and six-pences; here are some just cut from the get; they have got their roughness; these two parcels found on the woman, are counterfeits; these other parcels appear to have been fit for circulation; but they have got too bad since; but I think they have all been in circulation; those found on the man, do not appear to have been in circulation, especially one; this other parcel are some bought up by jews, ready to melt down, to cast again; these in the pocket are in a fit state of circulation.</p>
               <p>(Handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing all that process you have been talking of, would the effect be to make such things as you have in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was in the court while the other witnesses were examined; you attended to the manner they gave their evidence? - I did in some part.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090054"/>You heard the witness describe he found the flasks without the board, and without the screws; I take it for granted, it is perfectly clear that these six-pences could not have been made in the present state of the flask? - No.</p>
               <p>In the then state of these cut off from all spray and get, it is impossible they could have run in the sand at that time; the mould was not in a state for running? - That could not be, for they must make a side before they can make a mould compleat; in all probability, that spray was laid all down the sand; that may be half a mould, they cannot take these six-pences out till they have laid the mould upside down.</p>
               <p>Of this, Mr. Clarke, we can have no doubt, of the sand and six-pences laying together in irons and flasks; that it is so; but then it was not in a state for using, without first taking out the get and the six-pences; it was impossible to use it in the state it was in? - Most assuredly so.</p>
               <p>You have stated that the fusion of base-metal with wrought arsenick, will produce one degree of blanching; when that is done, it is still necessary to make use of something else to draw out the colour; there is no aquafortis here to day, Mr. Clarke? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>So, that in the present state of these things, he could not with them impose upon you or me a piece of base-metal, without the assistance of something else? - No.</p>

               <p>Where was Steward at that time? - He was standing about a matter of fourteen or fifteen yards off; I told her at the same time; says I, you ought to be taken up, and sent into prison; what is that to you, you vagabond, says she; I will cut you; and she followed me, and cut me across the lip; I got the watchman, and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Did you know the woman before? - What, Poll Peters; no, I never saw her before, only once or twice; I am quite sure she was the woman that cut me, and cut my lip.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where she hit him? - No, my Lord, I did not; I was afraid to rush in when she cut the prosecutor, because she had the knife in her hand; when I gave charge to the watch of her, it was about four minutes after; the watchmen were present then.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else there besides the watchman? - Not as I know on.</p>

               <p>Did you see any body go up to the soldier? - I saw a man taking hold of him; I do not think that was the watchman; it was another man.</p>
               <p>Where was the woman when the man took hold of the soldier? - I had hold of her then, she might be two or three yards; or four, or five yards; he was about fifteen yards off at the time when she cut the man.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he was fourteen or fifteen yards from the woman, when she cut the man? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Then before the watchman came up, did he come nearer her? - I did not mind him, I ran after her, to take her, after I brought the watchman.</p>
               <p>What distance was the soldier from Poll Peters at that time? - I cannot say; when she had cut me, she ran away; I said, I will be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did you say in the watch-house that she was not the woman that cut you? - No Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Did you take hold of me directly when you was cut? - No, it was you cut the man and cut me besides.</p>

               <p>I am a coachman; I was in Oxford-road at past eleven o'clock, on the 20th of August last, plying for hire; two gentlemen called me; I put them into the coach, and they ordered me to go to the Temple-gate,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090070"/>opposite Chancery-lane; one gentleman ordered me to go to Tower-street; and as I was going round St. Paul's-church-yard, it was half past eleven; and a man about twenty yards from the end of Watling-street, meets me, and says, stop coachman, d - n you, why do not you stop coachman; he said so two or three times; at last, I pulled my horses in; the man came from Watling-street way; he chucks the trunk up before me, on the top of a shut-down boot, and jumped on the box himself; I went on, and there stood the chaise; and I called halloo, post-chaise boy, here is your trunk, and the man that has it; when he stopped me, I saw no post-chaise; the post chaise was just at the turning at the end of Watling-street, going into Cheap-side, when I came up; I was going along Watling-street; the chaise was in the church-yard; and I stopped my horses as soon as I came up to him; I told him there was his trunk, and the man that had it.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man that was on the box with you? - I cannot tell; it was a dark night, and the horses would not stand still; I delivered the man to the watchman, when he came up; I had no opportunity to take any notice of the man; I believe the gentleman himself came up and took the trunk.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you sure that is the man that you delivered to the watchman? - I am; and I can positively swear that every word the coachman has uttered, is false; he says he stopped and called to the post-chaise boy, when I jumped out of the post-chaise; when I ran back, I met the coach a dozen yards or more behind my post-chaise; and the coachman had never uttered a word; I ran for the space of a dozen yards rather than where the coach was at the time; the coach was going on at the same time; I ran back and opened the coach door; at the same time, my chaise was a hundred yards off this side the china shop, the corner of Watling-street; which was as near as I can guess, directly opposite to where the fire was at Mr. Brown's; his coach was behind me, I fancy, a dozen or fifteen yards; it was not near Watling-street, in the manner he describes, by fifteen yards; it was four or five yards behind my chaise at the time; I opened the coach door; and after I had opened the coach door, and ran to the horses heads, the coachman stopped, and not till then; the coachman further says, he delivered him to the watchman; I positively swear I had him in my arms for the space of a minute or two, before any body came near me; and it was with difficulty that I could get any body to come near me; at first I had him by the collar with one hand, bringing my trunk, begging somebody to help me; then I called out for help; and Mr. Hoppy threw up the window at the time; then the watchman came after that, hearing the rattle.</p>
               <p>Newell. I can swear I received the prisoner out of Mr. Spode's hands, and not out of the coachman's.</p>

               <p>Can you be quite sure that these are two of the men that stopped the carriage, and robbed you? - Yes, I am quite sure; I never saw them before, I saw them again the 9th of September: We gave an alarm at every turnpike, and to the gentlemen and carriages we met in the way; we took no steps to apprehend them, but I was sent for to see them at a public-house, near Sir Sampson Wright's, I went over the way to see if there was any body I knew, I went into the tap-room, and I saw nobody there that I knew, the patrols were with me; they came in a hackney coach, and I was called from the public-house, to Sir Sampson Wright's, I did not see them at the public house at all; some of Sir Sampson Wright's men, pointed to the prisoners, and asked me if they were the people, and I said they were two of them; when I saw them, there were three men; I was sure the prisoners were two of the men; I could not swear to the third, and I said so at that time; I observed Charrington's face, and Wright went by the side of me to look at me, to see if I had any arms, that could make any resistance, and then I observed him go to the horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a foreigner? - Yes, been in England two years, I am servant to the Marquis D'Haulefort; the Marquis and a lady were in the carriage, I saw the people go to the carriage, but I did not see the things taken.</p>
               <p>The Marquis is not here, nor the lady? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the Marquis at Sir Sampson Wrights? - No, not since he came from the country, not since the people were taken, he went there soon after the robbery, the lady has been there; the lady is not here; the coachman is here.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have heard, that in this country, there is a reward for taking up these people, and prosecuting them? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090073"/>A reward; I have heard since I swore to them, that there is a reward, if they were found guilty.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - Some of the people at the public house, and I heard it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>However, it was not till after you had swore to these men? - It was not; I did not swear to the third, because I was not sure.</p>
               <p>There were three put to the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides being put to the bar, and shewed to you as the men, I take it for granted they had irons on their legs? - They had.</p>
               <p>You was a good deal frightened? - I never was robbed before; I was frightened when I saw the pistol to my breast certainly.</p>
               <p>You know the lives of these two people are at stake on your evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean still to say they are the persons? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wright. Sir Sampson asked him, what he could swear to me by, he said by the colour of the coat, and said I ran up to the horses heads? - I said I swore to him, that he was gone before me, and he looked at me, and then he ran at the horses; I looked to his face, and to his coat, he had a green, or dark coloured coat, and light coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Did you not at first, when you saw these men at Bow-street, speak doubtful of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wright. My Lord, at the first examination, he said he did not know whether we were the people or not? - I did not.</p>
               <p>In the office Mr. Macmanus said, you have no occasion to make any doubt of it, for they are the men; and if you will stick to it, you will do them? - He never said any thing like it.</p>

             came to me and asked me when the tide would ebb, says he I will ensure you 4 s. or 5 s. I rowed him down to Deptford, I made the boat fast; we had two or three pots of porter and some bread and cheese, this was about twelve or one in the day, he came out, and said follow me up the reach; he went up in the luggage boat, I followed him in twenty minutes, I boarded him twice, and he said not yet, I will call you when I want you; he rowed this luggage boat to Mr. Saunders's road, Wapping; I went along side of him, and he gave me some bone in the boat, and bid me row up to St. Catherine's; the prisoner was in the luggage boat with Rankin; we landed the bone, and he called two porters to take it away, he says to me you go with the porter, and this Will Rankin and a stout lusty man was wrangling about some money; then I came to my own boat; I do not know what became of the prisoner; I parted with him at Wapping; when Rankin took the whalebone out of the luggage boat, I only saw the long matted parcels.</p>

Todd, says he; says I, what in the name of fortune has brought you here so soon? and he said, Mrs. Barnes (that was the name of the man I lived with); that man has left you, and is in keeping with a girl; for said he, I was coming from my club last night, and I saw him; he is at Mr. Brooke's or Breary's; I was dressed, waiting for Barnes, to see if he would come; so I said, come along Mr. Todd, I will go directly; and we went to Mr. Brooke's, the hair-dresser in Southampton-buildings; Barnes was not there; when I went down stairs, I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket; and the prisoner went before me; and he asked me what time I should return; he turned towards Hatton-garden; I went home a quarter before eight in the morning; I roved about every where to see for Barnes; when I got home, I found the door hanging on the bottom hinge; and the lock broken open; and the top hinge broke; and my boxes were broken open; and I missed the things in the indictment; part of which were my own; and part intrusted with me; and which I am accountable for; I gave information of the robbery at justice Walker's office; and about four the same afternoon, I heard of my things.</p>

               <p>That was just before the robbery took place? - Just three weeks ago.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutrix. Upon your oath, have you never said that you had been threatened by the thief takers, to be sent to Newgate, if you did not prosecute this man? - No; I never said the word thief taker; I said that a gentleman offered me ten guineas, not to come and appear; his name is Thomas White, a Spittlefields weaver.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know a gentleman of the name Cowperthwaite? - I know him by sight; but he called himself Green to me; it was Friday or Saturday; I never told him so; Mr. White told me that Mr. Green would produce any money to save his life; that gentleman (Cowperthwaite) told me the prisoner was to have 700 l.; he had been down to examine an estate for Mr. White; and begged and desired me to save his life; he told me he was Mr. Green's Clerk.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he ever said one syllable to you of the matter? - Yes; he came to me, No. 20, in Liquor-pond-street, before my landlord; and promised me any money, if I would not appear; my landlord is Mr. Martin, a hair dresser; they came to me on the Saturday, that Todd was committed on the Wednesday; this gentleman came to me, and asked me what it was about Todd's robbery, that he had wrote to him; and he asked me whether I would take five guineas to let him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090079"/>Did this gentleman ever make you that offer? - He offered me so much as this here; with proviso that I would not appear against him, he would make up any money; he asked me how it was; I told him which way he robbed me; and he said, if you tell the gentlemen the same, his neck must swing for it; and he deserves it; he said he would make up any money to me, provided I would not appear against him; and that he was clerk to Mr. Green; but in Liquor-pond-street, he passed as Mr. Green; I asked him if he was Mr. Green? and he said, I am Mr. Green; he did upon my word and honour.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you never told this gentleman that you had been threatened by the runners? - I told him I was liable to be put in Newgate, if I did not appear.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know this gentleman that sits next to me (Mr. Green)? - No; I do not think that was one of the gentlemen that came in; but I think that gentleman next to him came in: (pointing to Alderman Le Mesurier); that gentlemen, I think, spoke to me out in the passage, but I will not swear to it; it was concerning this subject.</p>
               <p>What, did this gentleman talk to you about Todd's having robbed you? - Yes; I will swear that; I recollect his face now; I recollect him speaking to me about Todd's robbery; it was after candle light; I asked him if I could come in? and he said I must bide out; he said nothing more; I never worked at the Pilgrim but one day in my life; I have not been seen in the doors this five years.</p>

               <p>I am just as innocent as you are yourself; for she actually gave me the things to dispose of for her own use; I disposed of part of them about eight, and gave her three shillings; she said she wanted to be revenged of the man she had lived with.</p>
               <p>- GREEN, Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an attorney in Gray's Inn; in the beginning of the year 1783, the prisoner was recommended to me by a gentleman in Lincoln's Inn, as a servant; and that could write; I did not want him then; I took him into my office, and employed him about six months; then he went to my friend's house as a servant; during the time he was in my service, he was very sober and very honest; and I recommended him to my friend as a servant; and he went and lived with him; and some time since that, he has been with Mr. Serjeant Bolton and another gentleman, as a clerk.</p>
               <p>Have you ever trusted him with any money? - I cannot say I ever did; he was not that line.</p>
               <p>Have you ever conversed with this woman on the subject? - I never had the least conversation with her in my life; Todd wrote me a letter, and said they were to take five guineas for making it up; I sent Cowperthwaite, my clerk; saying, go and enquire into this; if he has been guilty, let him take the consequence; but give him a little money, that he may not want; and in consequence of that, I gave a brief to you.</p>
               <p>- COWPERTHWAITE sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you ever ask this woman if she would take a sum of money not to appear? - Never; I say that positively; I have been in Mr. Green's office almost eleven years.</p>

               <p>Had it been paid, as I see it is over due? - The principal part was.</p>
               <p>How can you say with certainty, that you saw it, when you was at the bankers? - I know I put it in when I came from home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090086"/>as I thought I might see the man who drew it.</p>
               <p>When did you come from home? - On Monday, the 10th of August, I came from Guildford.</p>

               <p>Have you any notion, positively, to the time you missed it? - I am not positive to five or ten minutes, either before or after.</p>
               <p>Did any thing happen to you, coming to St. Paul's from the bankers, that would lead you to suppose where it was taken from you? - I rather thought once, I was jostled as I was passing through <placeName id="t17890909-74-crimeloc374">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Have you ever seen your pocket-book since? - Yes, at the publick office in Bow-street; I received a letter from the publick office, and came up from Guildford.</p>
               <p>How long might that be after you lost it? - Ten days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>When you saw your pocket-book, was it open or empty? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who put it into your hands there? - Mr. Shallard.</p>
               <p>What was in it? - This promissory note was in it.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to think, from the appearance of the note, the date of it, and the hand writing, that it is your note? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Do you know, whether after you lost it, any attempt was made to procure payment? - I do not know there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You know Benjamin Caseltine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it you lost your note? - On the 11th of August; on a Tuesday, as I was coming from my bankers.</p>
               <p>A great many people were passing at that time of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you was at the bankers, you pulled out your pocket-book with the nine guinea note; there were other notes in it? - There were.</p>
               <p>On going from Mr. Harrison's, you felt somebody jostle you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If it had been the prisoner, perhaps you would have known who jostled you; you knew the prisoner before? - No, I never knew the man in my life.</p>
               <p>If you had seen him before, you must have known him? - I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Part of this note is paid? - I have received the whole of it since; I had received seventy pounds before I had lost it; and when I lost it, there was eight pounds fifteen shillings unpaid, which I have received since.</p>
               <p>Now, you do not know what date the note bears? - It was dated in February, but I cannot be positive to the day.</p>
               <p>Though you put it into your pocket-book in the morning, you cannot ascertain what date it bears? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Caseltine? - Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Where did you get your pocket-book? - In Bow-street.</p>
               <p>When Shallard gave you the pocketbook in Bow-street, what was in it? - I have not examined every thing in it; there was a note for seventy-eight pounds, fifteen shillings, in it.</p>
               <p>Has there any thing passed between you and the prisoner, in Newgate? - I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Any letter? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Did you send any body to the prisoner ever? - No person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the Court, that as the indictment stated the value of the note being seventy-eight pounds, fifteen shillings; and at the time of the loss, seventy pounds had been received on the note by the prosecutor; and the real value of the note being then but eight pounds fifteen shillings, the Court could not proceed on the trial on that part of the indictment, which was granted; and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090087"/>prisoner was only after this, tried on the pocket-book, value one shilling.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was his house? - He was at home, and in bed; it was about eight o'clock in the morning; and in searching the place, underneath the stairs, I found this pocket-book; I asked the prisoner at the bar, how he came by it? he said it was not his, but he had received it from a prig, meaning a pickpocket; and that he meant to return it back to the owner again; I told him that did not signify at all, I should take it away with me; and the clerk wrote to Mr. Wilkins at Guildford; and he came and swore to it; it had the note in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You went to some lodgings, supposing them to belong to the prisoner; why did you think it was his lodgings? - We received an information that he lived there.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was the prisoner? - I have known him for three years, by passing and repassing that place.</p>
               <p>How came you to know his name? - I know no more of him.</p>
               <p>How did you know his name, by passing and repassing through the turnpike? - I had heard his name mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now, tell us what passed when you met him? - On Saturday night, as I was coming home from pay-table, the prisoner at the bar met me, and asked me how I did? I told him I was hearty, thanked him, and was going on to my lodgings; immediately, he lays hold of me by my left arm.</p>
               <p>Who was with him at this time? - Several more people were with him, all standing together in a croud, about to the number of fifteen; he lays hold of me by the arm, and held me whilst the others picked my pocket of eight shillings and a few halfpence, an handkerchief, and a stock.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance at this? - No; I dared not; I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>Why did you beg your life? - I was afraid they would murder me, they jostled me in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Had they any arms? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long were they in doing this? - About ten minutes, as nigh as I can tell now.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the others? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of you, after this was over? - I came home to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Where did they go after? - I know not; I was afraid if I had gone after them, they would have murdered me.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night, past ten, past eleven o'clock, was it not pitch dark? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Now, my good Sir, you swear to this man by his voice? - No, I knew his person.</p>
               <p>Where had you been, in circumstances to become acquainted with his voice? - I never conversed with him.</p>
               <p>Never spoke with him before? - Yes, in Islington.</p>
               <p>On what occasion; only passing by, good morrow, good morrow? - No more.</p>
               <p>Never drank with him, nor in company where he was? - I do not think I ever did.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt about his voice, nor of his person; you was as sure of his person, as you was of his voice; and as sure of his voice, as you was of his person; now, my honest friend, what countryman are you? - An Irishman.</p>
               <p>This man was taken in custody on Monday; and was examined once before the magistrate; and fully committed for trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he committed the first time? - No.</p>
               <p>The second time? - No; I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Was he not examined the first time, and committed for further examination; examined the second time, and committed for further examination; and at last, examined a third time, and then fully committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I find you understand me well enough, if you will. Was you as sure to him the first time, as you was the third? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, he was not sent the first; who examined him? - Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>I believe, before the third examination, a man of the name of Foreside was taken into custody? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Do you know any number of the other persons among the fifteen? - No.</p>
               <p>The only thing you can recollect, to know any thing about him, is by his voice? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he speak out, or talk as you do now, so low, muttering, you can hardly be heard? - He spoke out.</p>
               <p>As you had been to the pay-table, you likely had had a drop? - Yes; I had a drop; I had drank a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>A pot of beer does not hurt you? - No.</p>
               <p>I wish you could help me to a reason, why this man was not fully committed the first time; did you swear positively to him the first time, second time, or the third time? - At each time.</p>
               <p>How near was you robbed from the Blue-coat Boy? - About three or four yards.</p>
               <p>I suppose a place as much frequented as Newgate-street; there is the Angel on one corner, and the Blue-coat Boy on the other, just running down to the turnpike; is it not an immense thoroughfare of a Saturday-night? - There was not many people passing then.</p>
               <p>This happened on the 18th; can you tell me on what day the prisoner was committed upon? - On the 28th.</p>
               <p>It was a fine moon-light night, was it not; was it a rainy night, or a fair one; can you tell us the state of the moon? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>You had no assistance whatever from the moon; and the principal thing you swear to the prisoner by, is by his voice? - No, it is not; I can swear to his person.</p>
               <p>You never worked with him; never have been at a publick-house with him; never had any dealings with him; and yet out of fifteen people, it was he that robbed you? - It was he.</p>
               <p>How long were they robbing you? - They were ten minutes robbing me.</p>
               <p>Did any body pass by whilst you was being robbed? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090089"/>Do you believe, there is any one ten minutes, from seven o'clock in the evening, to ten o'clock at night, that less than twenty people do not pass; did you ever know a ten minutes, that a great many were not passing? - I cannot say; there was not many people passing then.</p>
               <p>You first lost your hat, and got it back again; so in the end, you was loser of nothing that had a mark upon it; did you get your stock back again? - I never got any thing back again.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you have been long enough in England, to know there is a reward for a highway robbery? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Consider? - Yes, I did hear there was a reward.</p>
               <p>How much? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>No! nor never heard! have you never been told there is a reward of forty pounds, on every person convicted, who commits a highway robbery? - What reward I never heard; no, I never heard any more than twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>That there was twenty pounds for the prosecutor, and twenty pounds to be divided among the rest? - No, I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, who told you there was a reward of twenty pounds? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Consider a little? - I heard it in several places.</p>
               <p>I desire you tell then, who it was in any one place, that mentioned it to you, that there was a reward of twenty pounds; did not you hear it at justice Hyde's? - No, that I never did.</p>
               <p>Where then? - I heard people talking about it in the yard.</p>
               <p>What! strangers to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you hear the people in the yard talking of it? - On Saturday and Friday.</p>
               <p>Court. Now mind what I say to you; you say you heard there was a reward for highway robberies, on Saturday and Friday last; then, what is the reason you first of all told us, you had not heard there was any reward; I want to know that; why did you dare to tell this gentleman, you never heard it at all?</p>

               <p>I am the landlord of the publick-house, the Blue-coat Boy, near the Islington Road; the prisoner at the bar was at my house on Saturday, the 18th of July.</p>
               <p>What time did he stay? - He came in as nigh half after eleven as possible; and went out a quarter before twelve.</p>
               <p>After he went out, was there any thing remarkable that struck you? - I went to bed; I thought I heard a noise in the street; but supposed it was some haymakers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How many lamps are there near your house? - There is one within eight or ten yards of my house, to the right; the other is rather more to the left.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose they were alight? - I believe not, as they are not lighted in the summer quarter.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 5th of August, I was appointed that morning by Mr. Church the prosecutor, to follow carts loaded with tea, from Botolph wharf, the upper station, to Parker's-gardens, the India-warehouse, and in my turn, I did my duty in that, and at the hour of two, I left my station; and prior to that Mr. Church (the prosecutor) came to me, and told me, Madgett, it is almost high water, there is a great glut of work come in, and I fear I shall fall short of men; I, sensible of the many obligations I laid under to Mr. Church, as being a distressed young man with a large family to support, I said I would; I set out for my station again, on coming down thro' the station, I recollected having put a little cane in the scale-house, belonging to the same station, and among some cordage and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090091"/>boards, I found these two hooks, and an old adze, and two old chissels laying: upon that my lord, on taking up this cane, and seeing these hooks, and hearing my worthy Mr. Church (my appointer) say he was short of those hooks, I took them out, and publicly carried them along the middle station towards the scale house, where I intended to deposit them for my own work, but Mr. Wilson, m landwaiter, and a gentleman, the gangsman, crying out, Madgett, Madgett, marker, marker, I immediately repaired to my gangsman; and knowing it was not safe, to lay these hooks out of my hands; I publicly put one into each pocket; I marked forty-five bags of coffee; then I went up into the scale-house and made a memorandum of the transactions, concerning the coffee; the prosecutor came in; it was my duty to make way, which I did; on getting up, I put my left hand to my pocket; on which he said, what have you Madgett? two hooks, said I; he said I have lost so many of these hooks, and I believe your intention is to take them; I, sensible of my intention, said it was not so; Mr. Church took one of the hooks out of my pocket; when I had taken the other out, I went out and staid by my duty, and took care of the coffee: Mr. Church (the prosecutor) happened to come by; I told him, I hope you are sensible that necessity never brought me to that pitch, of thinking those hooks worthy of being picked up out of the gutter, and I hope you will think no more of it; his answer was, he was very sorry for it; I stood my duty till I was relieved by the king's watch, when I went home, and came at six to relieve him; about half past six, the prosecutor happened to come by, I said to him, shall I go to the India work, or take care of this coffee; says he, Madgett take care of the coffee, and see it delivered; very well Sir, says I; I also mentioned to Mr. Church, that I hoped he was sensible of his error, in making a charge of the kind upon me; he said he was very sorry for it; I stood my duty; and about seven, or half past, the prosecutor came, and told me, Madget, says he, you are wanted in the Surveyor's Office; I went with him and he made his charge; and on my defence I was ordered back to my duty; which I went to on the upper station, then I attended the Surveyor's office again, and then Mr. Church made the charge against me, and I made my defence; upon which the gentlemen surveyors said, that they wish propriety, could not discuss the matter, but that they would know the pleasure of the Board; I said what is to be done with me in the evening? one gentleman said was under a penalty of 100 l. for my bondsmen, and it was not safe for them to let me at liberty; then I desired I might be committed to the care of a constable, and they desired to know where my lodging was; that they might search it, told them No. 2, Rose-court, Tower-street; they searched and found nothing, it was the pleasure of the Board, that I should be taken before a Magistrate, I was put into the Poultry Compter without any examination, and then one of the prosecutors said, he would do for me; the subsequent morning, I was taken before the Lord Mayor, and my iron knocked off; and still the rigorous designs of my Prosecutors were such, that I have been credibly informed by one of the turnkeys, that they prevailed so far; or at least forged an order to the Lord Mayor to commit me, whether or no; there are gentlemen in Court I believe on my behalf, I was on the verge of promotion; I should not know to what use to convert them hooks; I could not sell them, as they have the king's broad arrow upon them; and by the 7th article, it is my duty to take care of the weights and scales.</p>

               <p>Did she make any acknowledgment about the things? - She said she did not know how she came by those things.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, some of the gentlemen of the Jury with the lady may be unveiled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. It is very convenient to be sure in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>(The lady put up the veil of her bonnet, which was a considerable depth.)</p>
               <p>Miss Osliffe. There are two aprons, an O is still remaining in one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Madam, before I put any question to you, I wish you should understand, that I do not mean to put any one, from any impertinent motive; but I know no distinction of persons here; I observe this is an indictment for stealing these articles so long ago as December in the last year? - Yes,</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner had lived a servant in your family six years? - Five years and a half.</p>
               <p>In whose service did she live the last nine months? - With Mr. Bowes, a neighbour of mine; to whom I gave her a character.</p>
               <p>When was it that her boxes and drawers were searched? - About a month ago.</p>
               <p>At her master's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe, madam, she was indicted before you made any complaint to a Magistrate; perhaps you do not know the mode of doing business that common people follow? - I indicted her at a justice's first.</p>
               <p>I believe you are mistaken; who was the justice? - Colonel Hubbard of Southgate.</p>
               <p>She was surrendered in discharge of her bail? - She was</p>
               <p>None of these articles of your wearing apparel were new? - None.</p>
               <p>I should think it not impossible, that in the course of six years, you might have given her these things? - It is possible that I gave her a few.</p>
               <p>Now I should think it extremely possible that you might have given her some few of which you did not keep a memorandum; I dare say, you are one of those who do not let their right hand know what their left hand does, in a way of charity; can you now, at this distance of time, run over with me, a catalogue of all the things you have given her? - I cannot, but I had not given these certainly, any one of the things I have charged her with taking from me.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say, you never gave them away to any other servant? - I had no other servant.</p>
               <p>When did you miss them first? - I missed them at different times; I missed different things, while she was with me.</p>
               <p>For nine months; she might have burnt or destroyed them; or taken out the marks? - She might; I have valued them very low; to shew that there was no malice in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Had not this young woman given you some cause for discontent and displeasure after she left your service? - I had very great reason.</p>
               <p>Had she not in the neighbourhood, said some things respecting your - I never heard that she said a word against me.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that she had said, (I do not say with truth,) that some libel or paragraphs about neighbours, had come from your pen? - I never heard that she did.</p>
               <p>What then led to searching the room of this young girl, who had left you with a good character; and was recommended by you to a good service? - She had first lost my good opinion, from her change of dress and behaviour.</p>
               <p>Had not she mentioned your having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090100"/>written something? - I never had written any thing; why should you ask me that.</p>
               <p>Because I am instructed so to do; that is my only apology. Had not there been some little misunderstanding between you and some neighbours, about some supposed libels, which were conjectured to have come from you; and which this woman said had come from you? - Certainly there was.</p>
               <p>Did not those bickerings relate to some libels, or supposed libels, or some jeers; I dare to say, extremely elegant, if they came from your pen? - I do not come here to answer impertinent questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have no difficulty to state to the Court my reason for putting the questions this lady has stated that the servant lived with her six years; she has stated that there were some little bickerings about something, supposed to be the production of this lady's pen; I mean to ingraft on that examination, to prove, that this suspicion never would have fallen on the prisoner; that her box never would have been searched; and that this prosecution never would have been carried on, if the prisoner had not been suspected to have known too much of these epistolary productions of the lady; and which, she, with great imprudence, has revealed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Wait for the question from the gentleman; and if he puts a question that is not proper, we must stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There were some bickerings about some writings, or some publications, in the neighbourhood? - There were.</p>
               <p>There were some persons who suspected you had written them? - There were.</p>
               <p>They were supposed to have been written while the prisoner was in your service? - They were.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner supposed to have known that you had written them? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not that suspicion come to your ears? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there ever a charge in any shape, made against the prisoner, till after these bickerings respecting the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>How long is it since that misunderstanding respecting this letter, or this writing, broke out? - Last June was a twelvemonth; the bickerings have been long forgotten by me.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard that this young woman had said, that those publications really came from your pen? - No; I never did hear it.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry, but I must ask, was there no other subject of dissatisfaction, that you had towards this young woman, relating to money matters? - There was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I should think it would be better for every body, if this went no further.</p>
               <p>Jury. We really think so, for the sake of the lady.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have only to say, that it was not owing to any bickerings, that I prosecuted her for taking these things; but that I was very well convinced they were my own; but as she is now-sufficiently punished, I hope the gentlemen of the jury will consider her with mercy.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Whitcombe-street; on the 9th of this month, about four in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Prince's-court, Whitcombe-street; he was standing at the door of a house of ill fame, with these two hats; he was calling to somebody; and I asked him where he had them he said he brought them from Kensington; and they were his master's in George-street, Grosvenor square; and I stopped him; I heard a woman say she was coming; he rushed from me in Whitcombe-street; he dropped the hats in my sight, and he ran away; I lost sight of him: he was pursued by Cohoan, who took him; and I took him to the watch-house; we found the hats; after that, we went back to Leicester-fields; and within the garden rails, we found five table-spoons, two salt spoons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090103"/>two gravy-spoons, and one tea-spoon: I never saw the prisoner before he ran out of the court; I was close at his heels; he turned to the left, and turned the corner; when he dropped the hats, I ran as fast as I could; I am sixty years of age; I have no use for spectacles on these occasions.</p>

               <p>I am chase-driver; I pounded this ass once; then she had a foal with her about a year old, I believe; and afterwards, the gardener brought her to me, and desired me to take care of her; I saw her about Holy Thursday; that is the day of Bush fair.</p>
               <p>Have you seen it since it was foaled at Lady Stormont's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you can tell us this prisoner's character? - I know nothing about his roguishness, nor yet his honesty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another Counsel for the prosecution. Come now, since that question has been asked; upon your oath, what has been his general character for honesty? - I cannot tell; you must enquire.</p>
               <p>But I will enquire it of you; and I apprize you, that to conceal the truth, is just as much perjury, as if you were flatly to tell me what is false? - I never heard any thing against the man in particular.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I have sworn once.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never heard any thing about his character? now I will give you chapter and verse; nothing about a poney? - It was not a poney.</p>
               <p>Oh! you do know a little; that was not Lord Chumley's? - No; Pitham borrowed it of his fellow servant, who was then in the country; and the poney was lost, and could not be found; and his fellow servant made him pay for it; but he was not accused of stealing it that I know of.</p>
               <p>Now, about Lord Chumley's wood? - I do not know; I will say no more to you; I have nothing more to say; I know nothing against the man.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath; having once or twice said that you know nothing about character; that you know nothing of his roguish tricks; will you permit it to be taken down as your evidence, that this man bears a good character in his neighbourhood: come Mr. Chase-driver, I know something about that neighbourhood myself? - I do not know; why, you are not to hang a man for a thing seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Is his general character in his neighbourhood, a good one or a bad one? - You must go and enquire.</p>
               <p>I will make you answer it, or else you will drive no more chases, except in Newgate? - I never heard any thing amiss of the man, any otherwise than what I told you; any otherwise than what you know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean, yes or no, to say this man's character is a good one? - I know nothing at all about his character, any otherwise than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have lived in Edmonton parish about twenty-five or twenty-six years; he never lived in that parish; I have known him seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Knowing him seven or eight years, you know nothing about his general reputation? - I know nothing against the man.</p>
               <p>That is not my question? - You may talk as long as you like, I shall say no more to you.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you mean to swear you know nothing of his general reputation? - I never heard any thing amiss of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090105"/>him, any otherwise than this horse, and this affair of the Alderman's.</p>
               <p>No other thing? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that seven years ago? - I know nothing at all about seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Was this man's general character a good one? - I can tell nothing about the man's character.</p>

               <p>Did you see the men leave the women? - I saw them get over the rails, I suppose, as soon as they saw me; and they ran all across the fields, when I hallooed thieves; I stood in my chaise, and looked after them; I saw them make a stop in the field, before they took the road; I turned my mare about, and drove round the corner of the houses as hard as I could drive; a witness you will see presently, had got Poynton, holding him by the collar; they were one on one side of the gate, and the other on the other; I could not see them while I was driving back, on account of the houses; I said, hold him fast, for there has been two ladies robbed; I said, where is the other; that man said, he is gone across the road; up comes the other witness, and Waters had taken Poynton; when this was done, I said, secure them fast, I will turn back and meet the ladies, that they may see them; immediately, I got into the chaise, and drove back, and met the young women; I took them to the public-house, and gave the prisoners in charge to the constable; there we searched them, at the publick-house; and I found upon Poynton, the cock of a pistol, and some gun-powder, and some monies; I cannot say particularly; but I took particular notice of that: Price was searched; and, upon him there was found a silver four-pence, a silver two-pence, and a silver penny, and about a couple of shillings; there was a crown-piece which they said was dropped in the road, which I did not see picked up.</p>
               <p>You did not know that they were the same people? - If they had not been pursued, and taken as they were; I did not know that they were the people that committed the robbery; I was not near enough to see their faces.</p>

I told him I did not know; he must go with me till I did know; I took him across the field; and about the middle of the field, he hung back; I pulled him along, and threw him on the grass; the crown piece then dropped out of his hand; and I picked it up, and put it into my pocket; then we took him to the Castle, where they were searched; and the things the ladies say they lost, were found on them; a half-guinea, a four-penny piece, a two-penny piece, a penny-piece; I saw the half-guinea pulled out of one of their pockets; I cannot say which; Harrison, the officer, searched them; they made no other resistance, than Price hanging back in the field; I have had the crown piece ever since.</p>

I ran; and when I came up to the gate, the shortest of the prisoners was standing with two other persons; I said, gentlemen, which is the thief; they pointed out Poynton; I immediately laid hold of his collar; says I, my friend, you have robbed two ladies? he said he had not; says I, go with me; and if the ladies say you have not, I shall not keep you any longer; I took him to Kentish-town; and Miss Naylor said, that was one of the men that robbed us; then Harrison came up, and I delivered the prisoner to him; nobody had hold of him when I came up; I heard he had been laid hold of.</p>

               <p>Did you sleep in any bed with either of these men before? - No, Sir, I never slept in a bed with them of a night, only when they served me so; both these men slept together on the Sunday night, the first night I went there; and I slept in a room by myself; on the Friday night, one of them was gone out, and one was at home; but I slept in one of the beds by myself; there were three rooms up stairs; I slept in one of them every night; the rooms had all beds in them; but there was another boy there; and the boy ran away; one man slept at Mr. Ballard's every night, while the women were there that went away; then there was a married woman and some children; and they used to lay there; and Studbury's sister and me used to lay together; she did not stay in the house long; I believe she staid till the Monday; I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>You had never been put to bed to this lousy boy, till Saturday night? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. My little girl, do you know the name of the boy? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>These two people lay with you, each of them once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They, each of them, carried you up stairs to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did they carry you? - Studsbury took me over the arm, and clapped one hand before my mouth, that I should not halloo.</p>
               <p>Under which arm? - I cannot tell which arm.</p>
               <p>A good wide large stair-case? - It is not such a very wide one.</p>
               <p>How many people could go up at a time? - It is a good long pair of stairs, and narrowish; Burton took me up in the same way.</p>
               <p>How long was this after Burton had broke his collar bone? - He had his arm out of his sling, when he first served me so; his arm was undone before then; I cannot tell how long; I cannot tell whether one day or two; nor which arm it was.</p>
               <p>Has it ever happened to you, to be ravished by any body but these two men? - No, Sir; I never was laid with by any body but them; I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not one o'clock? - I am not sure; it was before dinner; that I am positive of.</p>
               <p>And you always said it was before dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time used you generally to dine? - I did not dine that day; I had no victuals; it was before two o'clock; I generally dined at two.</p>
               <p>What time did Burton lay with you? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>You never said it was between four and five in the afternoon? - No.</p>
               <p>Never in your life, that you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you write? - No.</p>
               <p>Is that the mark you made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your examination was read over to you, before you put your mark to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>My little girl, how long after these people lay with you, did you go before a justice of peace? - I cannot tell how many days.</p>
               <p>Recollect a little; sure you can recollect. Now I will help your memory a little; first of all, you know Studsbury lay with you on the Thursday; on the Friday you told Mrs. Jarvis; on the Saturday, Burton lay with you; and on the Saturday night, they put you to bed to a lousy boy; and on Sunday, you ran away, and on Monday, you told your aunt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you slept at Mrs. Holmes's, was it that you went to the justice? - I staid at my aunt's till the next Thursday; I believe it was above a week after I got to the work-house, before I went to the justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Did you never say this happened between the 8th and 15th of August? - No, Sir; only I said it happened on Thursday; I did not know what day of the month myself; my aunt told the overseers, and they took me to the justice.</p>
               <p>Have you any complaint on you now? - Yes; I have a great deal of complaint.</p>
               <p>You have the foul disease? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You got it then from one of these two people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody else could have given it you? - Certainly not; I have it very bad; and so I had at my aunt's; I told my aunt.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090113"/>Now, recollect yourself, and remember that nobody can hurt you for telling the truth; upon your oath, how often had you laid with that servant boy? - Sir, I did not lay with the servant boy at all; I did not indeed.</p>

               <p>He never offered any rudeness to you? - No.</p>
               <p>You never played nor toyed with him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Nor with any body else, but these two men? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>When was the boy turned away? - On the Sunday night; that was the lousy boy; the other boy would not stay; he went away of himself; not on the same Sunday.</p>
               <p>What was the lousy boy turned away for? - They said he drank the gin; he only gave me a little drop; there were two men came by, and he gave them two glasses apiece; I had two-pence of my own; and the lousy boy persuaded me to fetch a pint of strong beer; he was turned away, because my master had been jawing him; he said he was quite drunk; and he asked me what was the matter; and the boy had been cutting me with a horsewhip, because I would not fetch a pint of beer; and I told him; I was not drunk, but they said I was drunk; just after, I ran away; and about the same time, the lousy boy was turned away; I was not turned away.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, that before he was turned away, Burton carried the lousy boy, or Johnson, into his room, and asked Johnson how his bed came to be so beastly dirty? - I did not see him take him up; I know nothing of it; Burton asked me how came the sheets so dirty; that was on Sunday, after dinner; just before I ran away; I said, I did not know, for I had not been up stairs; no more I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, had not you made the bed? - No; Burton had slept there the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Had you perceived your disorder come on, before you left this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were there any marks on your linen on the Friday? - No; my linen was not bad, but I could hardly walk; the midwife said I must take a dose of salts, and I should find some disorder come from me.</p>
               <p>Then, all the complaint you had before you left their house, was, that you could not walk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was so on the Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, when Burton laid with you on the Saturday, he must hurt you sadly? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>What sort of dirt was it that Burton complained of? - I do not know; I did not go up to see.</p>
               <p>Did not the boy say that you had asked him to go up stairs and lay with you; and that you had done so several times? - He said so when Burton came to ask him the last time.</p>
               <p>Did he charge the lousy boy with it? - Yes; there was but one boy there; that was the lousy boy.</p>
               <p>Then, he asked the lousy boy how it happened? - Yes; and then the boy brought a mane comb, and said I called him up stirs, but I did not.</p>
               <p>What else did he say that you did together, when you got into the bed room? - Sir, he said he had done impudence to me.</p>
               <p>What impudence did he say he did to you? - Sir, he said I was looking the fleas; and he locked the door, and threw me down; I was looking the fleas, and the boy took and threw me down, and got upon me; and clapped his hand on my mouth; and that is the truth; he did all this on the Sunday.</p>

It will be my duty on the part of the prosecution to state to you as shortly as I can, the circumstances which form the leading features of this case, and from which, if from any thing, you are to infer the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. In the first place there will be no manner of doubt from the evidence, that the deceased Wilkinson came by his death by means of the prisoner; it will be perfectly clear that that fatal event was in consequence of a stab with a knife, given by the prisoner; but when that fact shall have been established, there will still remain for your consideration, under the directions you will receive from the Court, two questions; I say two, because I apprehend that the circumstances of the case (as well as I have been able to consider it) will exclude the consideration of a third; the only question will be, whether the crime shall be that of wilful murder, or some smaller denomination of offence; for I have not been able to discover any circumstances that can exculpate the prisoner from all imputation of crime. Gentlemen, I have not found that the prisoner and the deceased had any acquaintance with each other, I have not discovered any circumstance of malice or resentment which could have been felt by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090123"/>the prisoner towards the deceased; the crime imputed to the prisoner seems to have been the result of a general violence of disposition and a general depravity.

            , a witness, was at a publick-house, and sitting in a box, where a woman of the town came in; the prisoner was likewise there, and the woman for some reason that does not appear, told him she was a prisoner and in custody of Benjamin, and asked the prisoner to treat her; I believe he did treat her with some beer, and on that occasion used some very horrid expressions which will be stated; among the rest he said, d - n his eyes (with other vulgar expressions) he would stick the first thief-taker that he should see, or should come near him. What the woman said was not true, she was not in custody, and it was so explained to the prisoner; he continued, however to use several menacing expressions, directed generally to thief-takers, by the appellation of those blood selling rascals, the first of whom that came in his way he would stab; Benjamin was very much alarmed, and left the publick-house, under aprehension his life was in danger from the prisoner. Wilkinson, the deceased, who had no concern in this, came in, and I believe Benjamin informed him of the prisoner's expressions; and the deceased said to him you had much better go home about your business, and not use those sort of expressions; upon which the prisoner transmitted those expressions to Wilkinson, abused him very violently, and threatened he would cut his liver out, at the same time drawing a penknife, the deceased was alarmed at this, and sent for a constable, who came, and he gave him charge of the prisoner; the constable and Wilkinson together seized the prisoner, he resisted very much, and they found it very difficult to secure him; and I observe on the deposition of one of the witnesses it is stated that the deceased struck the prisoner at the bar several blows with a stick, which he had, in order to secure him; it was at this period that the deceased drew from his pocket that knife which he had before shewn, accompanied with the expressions I have stated, and he made a cut at the constable but missed him, and he also attempted to stab Benjamin, but he escaped, and in the instant the prisoner insticted the fatal wound on the deceased; there was a great effusion of blood; the poor man immediately called out he was a dead man, and in about half an hour afterwards he died. Gentlemen, the prisoner can have no apology to make for this offence, so as to exculpate him from all imputation of crime. You have the good fortune to try the prisoner, and he has the good fortune to be tried, under that direction which you will receive from a very learned and a very humane quarter; I am quite sure that every circumstance that can be even strained in favour of life, that can be urged in mitigation of the crime imputed to the prisoner, that can at all soften it down to a crime of a more innocent description than wilful murder, will be attended to. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge on the law upon the subject. It will remain only for me to call to you the witnesses; I shall call all those which I am instructed know any thing that passed on the occasion; and then I am sure the prisoner will receive at your hands, a fair, honest, and merciful consideration of his case; such an one he is entitled to, the laws of his country ask for such an enquiry, and in the result I have no doubt but publick justice will be satisfied.</p>

Benjamin! a man has done some mischief in the yard, I wish you would go into the yard; I went into the yard, and saw the prisoner standing with his back against the wall with a knife in his hand; the yard is a narrow thoroughfare to Nightingale-lane, about a yard and a half wide; the knife was open, it was a little penknife. There was an officer, Alexander M'Call standing in the passage, who was sent for to take him, he was afraid to go near him, he was about two yards from him; when I first went out into the passage, I only saw the back of Wilkinson going out toward Nightingale-lane; he said nothing that I heard; and I heard no quarrel; I had a broom in my hand; the prisoner knew me, and as soon as he saw me he put the knife in his pocket, I believe he shut it; I said to the prisoner when I saw him putting up the knife, what have you done? as soon as I asked him the question,

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a waterman by business; on Thursday, the 16th of July, between six and seven, I was walking up Nightingale-lane, and I came just by the corner, the oil shop, about two doors from the King's Arms in East-smithfield, just as I came round the corner the prisoner came out of the King's Arms with an open knife in his hand, and swore damn his bloody eyes if he would not stick the first thief-taker that ever he saw come near him; the knife was open in his hand, and he put it into his pocket and walked to a post, the corner of Nightingale-lane and East-smithfield, then he took his knife out again, and he had a pair of long canvas trowsers on, and he took his knife and cut a bit of the flap of them off; then he held his knife to Wilkinson, who was standing on the foot-path about two yards from him, talking to two gentlemen; the prisoner kept swearing all the time, damn his bloody eyes and limbs he would stick the first thief-taker.</p>
               <p>Had Wilkinson done any thing to him at any time? - Nothing that I saw.</p>
               <p>Did he strike him? - Never in my presence.</p>
               <p>Did he raise his stick in a posture threatening him to strike him? - No; only put the stick in an upright posture, telling him to go away.</p>
               <p>Was the soldier in liquor? - He appeared a little in liquor, but not so very bad.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any reply to Wilkinson? - He kept swearing, but I cannot recollect the particular expressions; he was damning and blasting his eyes; Wilkinson desired somebody to fetch Mr. M'Call, for he was afraid of his life; and he would give charge of him; when the man was gone for Mr. M'Call, the prisoner walked round the corner of the court, into the passage that leads to the King's-arms; that is about ten or a dozen yards; he kept muttering bad words to himself; I saw M'Call come in half a minute, and join Wilkinson; and then I saw them go together towards the passage; I did not see what passed in the passage.</p>

               <p>What was Wilkinson? - He was an attendant at the office, I believe, which is facing the King's-arms; the next thing that I saw, was Wilkinson coming from the passage; from that way, with his left hand on his left side; and his right hand upon the left; I said, Mr. Wilkinson, are you stuck? and Wilkinson said, I am a dead man, go and fetch Dr. Davis; he walked home not quite twenty yards; I never saw him afterwards, neither alive nor dead; after I saw Wilkinson,

               <p>Mr. Parke. I believe this is a lock-up-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was cutting the flap of his breeches, did he go towards the wall to make water, or anything of that kind? - No; he did not move from there, till Wilkinson bid the man go for M'Call; I saw nothing in his hand but the knife; he stood about four minutes against the post, from the time I saw him come out of the house with a knife in his hand, to the time I saw him go into the passage.</p>
               <p>You say, what the prisoner was muttering, was to himself? - Yes; after Wilkinson had sent for M'Call, he went out of the sight of Wilkinson; and went entirely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090126"/>out of my sight; Wilkinson and M'Call went directly afterwards.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER M'CALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a headborough of Aldgate Parish; I was sent for, near seven, on Thursday, the 16th of July; I went to the corner of Nightingale-court, which is the passage that leads to the King's-arms; Wilkinson told me that a man had drawn a knife upon him twice, and gave me charge of him.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner within sight or hearing at that time, when he gave you charge of him? - No; I did not see him; I do not believe he was; then Wilkinson and me went to take the prisoner; there is only one house between the street and the court.</p>
               <p>When you got into the passage, did you see the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was he doing when you first went into the passage? - Making water.</p>
               <p>What passed between you, when you went in? - Wilkinson said, this is the man I give you charge of, for drawing a knife on me twice; and threatening my life.</p>
               <p>What passed next? - I took out my staff, and told him he was my prisoner, and must go with me; he said he would not; I desired Wilkinson to assist me; Wilkinson laid hold of the prisoner's right arm; and I laid hold of his left arm; we got him along about two yards.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by you got him; do you mean that you took him against his will? - I told him, it is of no consequence, my friend, you must go before a magistrate; and he rushed Wilkinson against the wall with such force, that Wilkinson fell behind him, and lost his hold.</p>
               <p>Was this a very narrow passage? - No, Sir; the part that we were in at this time, was as far as from me to the Jury; I suppose three yards wide. Wilkinson had this stick in his hand by the middle, which is broke; is leather, in imitation of wanyee.</p>
               <p>There is no sword in it? - No; it has never been out of my custody; he held it by the broken part; and he struck him over the back with it.</p>
               <p>Did he strike him more than once? - I believe he might strike him as many times as three, he struck him straight up the back; not across the shouldes.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner do to Wilkinson, at the time he struck him? - He had rushed him against the wall with such force, that he had lost his hold; he jammed Wilkinson against the wall, ready to knock him to pieces; he was a very little man; and the most inoffensive man in the world: then Broad came up, and laid hold of the prisoner by the collar; Wilkinson then got on the side of him again, and laid hold of him; from that spot, he went quietly into the narrow passage, I suppose five yards; when he got into the narrow passage, in which it is as much as two can do to walk on abreast, Broad kept walking backwards, with his hand on his collar; I and Wilkinson held him by the arm; and he fell back; he began to be very obstropulous.</p>
               <p>What did he do or say? - He shoved us; and rushed one way and the other, struggling and trying to get from us; then he made a stop, which appeared to me, to be with intent to throw Broad; Broad is rather bigger than me [the witness was a middle sized man]; we were about in the middle of the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, that is a yard and an half further than the five yards? - Yes; in the act of stopping, he had drawn the knife; I did not see his knife before; nor I did not see him draw it; he had drawn his knife, and made a stab at Broad; and cut through his red cloth breeches; and through the leather lining; when the prisoner saw he had not stabbed Broad, he immediately attempted to stab me; and I jumped back against the door, and avoided the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090127"/>Did he accompany those attempts to you and Broad, with any expressions at the time? - There was not a word said at the time; as I jumped from him, the way was wider; I quite quitted him; and was three feet from him; and he caught hold of Wilkinson by the collar, and stabbed the knife into him; into his left side, with the other hand; when the knife was in, up as far as his hand would let it go, he gave his hand a twist, and with all the heart-felt satisfaction -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not talk of heartfelt satisfaction; do you state facts, and do not make comments upon them? - Well, he did shew all the heart-felt satisfaction; and said, you b - r, I have done you.</p>
               <p>Did he say that, whilst the knife was yet in the body of Wilkinson? - At the instant he gave his hand that turn.</p>
               <p>What happened next? - He

             the knife from the body of Wilkinson; he came towards me; Wilkinson put his hand on his side, and said he was a dead man, fetch Dr. Davis for God's sake! then the prisoner came towards me with his knife in his hand; I went out of the end of the passage, and the prisoner clapped himself against the wall; and seemed very much agitated; he had the knife naked in his hand; I stood at some distance from him a minute, when Mr. Mayne came out; then we both went up; I was afraid before; whilst he stood against the wall, he shut his knife, and put it into the pocket of his trowsers; Mayne said, what have you done, my friend; I pointed to Mayne, to take out the knife from his pocket, which he did: the prisoner said it was done, and it could not be helped.</p>
               <p>As nearly as you can, state his own words? - He said he knew what he had done, and it could not be helped; I went to Wilkinson's; he was sitting on a chair, with his hand on his side, and reaching; I do not suppose he lived an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any examinations returned? - There are not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did you happen to know the prisoner before this? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Did he appear when you saw him first, to be in liquor? - I did not observe that he was; I conceive by his conduct, he must be in liquor; I just put my staff on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>When Wilkinson spoke, did he use the stick in any way whatever? - He did not use the stick, till he had rushed him against the wall, and thrown him on his back; I am perfectly sure of that; nothing could be done by either party, that I did not see.</p>
               <p>What time might elapse, after you came up, to the time the wound was given? - I think it was four or five minutes, but hardly so much as five.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you, constable or a headborough? - I am headborough of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Was there any constable in the passage at that time? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant to apprehend this man? - No; they sent for me to apprehend him, for drawing a knife on this man.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant from a Justice of Peace to him? - No.</p>
               <p>The Judges, Wilson and Grose, who were on the bench, concurred with Mr. Justice Gould (who tried the Prisoner) in opinion that this was an unlawful arrest and imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Gentlemen of the Jury; there is no question whatever, but the prisoner has been the author of this man's death; to be sure, the expressions he has made use of, are horrid and shocking indeed; but we must lay aside every incentive to indignation; we must try this cause with absolute coolness; and consider what the law of the country is; for we must not violate that law, to satisfy our resentments, which may be of infinite consequence; this man retiring into this dark passage, and being there quiet when these people came in; offering to do nothing till they attacked him; the thing being over, it was unwarrantable in these people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090128"/>to seize this man thus quiet, without having an authority from a justice of peace, he was therefore illegally assaulted and arrested by these men; where a man therefore is deprived of his liberty illegally, and does an act that causes the death of the assailant, in any manner whatever, certainly by law it reduces the offence to manslaughter; that is the case; and in this state of the evidence, the Counsel admitting that they cannot vary the facts, I think you should find this man not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.</p>

You have been guilty of a very atrocious offence in killing your fellow creature; in holy writ we find, that whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; your crime has been attended with every circumstance of cruelty and barbarity, scarcely to be paralelled in the records of this court or any other court in this kingdom; and yet you have not been condemned to death, to suffer the sentence of the law as a murderer; your conduct has provoked the just indignation of mankind at large; and yet such is the mild administration of the laws of this country, that the Judges have thought fit, under the circumstances of the case, to direct the Jury to spare your life; but that not from any personal consideration respecting you, but because however provoked by your cruel and barbarous treatment of the deceased, the law of this country is not to be stretched one tittle beyond the letter of it. No circumstance that respects your conduct has favoured you on the present occasion to mitigate your crime; the mistake of the officer alone, who should first have obtained a warrant before he arrested you for the breach of the peace, is the only reason that can be assigned why you should not be ordered to almost immediate execution; under such circumstances the Court will inflict the severest punishment they can on you; and I have one observation to make to you, as a man of your description seems to have very little feeling for others, and that is, that notwithstanding the punishment you will receive, if under any circumstances you should be found killing a fellow creature another time, you will be immediately condemned to execution; the sentence of the Court is, that you be</p>

               <p>That was not in the hearing of the prisoner? - In the hearing and presence of the prisoner; the gentleman said he would call between one and four to give me an answer.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long might you be up stairs do you think? - I suppose not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>After these gentlemen were gone away, how soon did you discover that any thing had been taken away? - An hour and a half before we missed any thing.</p>
               <p>What did you first miss? - Our cloaks, that led us to a further examination, and we missed the other articles of the plate.</p>
               <p>Where had these things been before the prisoner and his companion came to your house? - In the front parlour, the plate was in a beaufet, the key was in the door, and the cloaks were hanging upon cloak pins in the room; I saw them there not five minutes before the gentlemen came to look at the lodging, for I went to fetch the tea cups out of the beaufet; so that I am positive they were there; I am sure they were there.</p>
               <p>How was the door of this front parlour left when you went up stairs? - It was shut but not fastened; there was no fastening at all.</p>
               <p>How long was you absent up stairs? - I dare say we might be ten minutes in going up and coming down, for I asked the gentleman in green, if he would like to look at our first floor; it was let, but the gentleman was out of town; I dare say ten minutes were the outside.</p>
               <p>Upon your missing these things were any steps taken to recover them? - Mr. Yates went to Mr. Booth an attorney in Craven-street.</p>
               <p>I believe you did not see any person that you suspected until the Sunday following? - No, Sir, I was in Kensington-gardens when I saw a person that I suspected; Mr. and Mrs. Yates and me were walking in Kensington-gardens, I think it might be about half after seven on the Sunday evening, two gentlemen passed us, a gentleman in blue and a gentleman in green again; I immediately said to Mr. Yates, good God, says I, that is the man that robbed your house.</p>
               <p>Did you say the man or men? - No, the man, because the other was not one of them that came.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat had the man on you saw in Kensington-gardens? - A blue coat.</p>
               <p>Then you took that to be the same man that had been in a blue coat at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he strike you on the first sight? - He was past the length of this court and more, we met, and they passed us; Mr. Yates said, if you think so, I will turn back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090130"/>and see, for Sir Sampson Wright has told me I had a right to take him; we immediately followed them, and as soon as they saw us, they turned out of the gardens immediately; they were going towards the palace, when we first followed them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there not an entrance to the gardens at the palace, and at this end? - There are several entrances; they came in at one gate, and we at the other; so we met; they were going in a direction towards the palace; we turned about and followed them, they perceived us follow them, and they immediately turned round, to come out of the gardens, at Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>How long had you been going in that course, towards them, before you observed them to turn? - About twice the length of the Court; then they turned; as soon as they perceived us to follow them, they turned to come out of the gardens; but we turned after them; they turned to go short out of the gardens, and we walked by the side of them, and they passed us; we followed them; they went sometimes slow and sometimes fast; we had a hard matter to follow them, that was Mrs. Yates and me had; we met Mr. Watson, and then Mr. Yates determined on speaking to them; Mr. Watson joined Mr. Yates; I heard what Mr. Yates first said to him, when he spoke to him; he tapped him on the shoulder, and said, pray was you at my house on Tuesday night last? the prisoner said, I at your house! I never was at your house in my life: by that time there were numbers of people gathered round us; and the prisoner began to be in a passion, and swore a good deal.</p>
               <p>Had there at that time been any explanation made by Mr. Yates, about the errand upon which he came, or any thing of that kind? - No, Sir, not the least in the world; I said to the prisoner, Sir, you have been at our house several times, for I have often opened the door to you, some time ago; to which he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Was that true, that you had seen him several times at your house? - Yes, Sir, it might have been four months before.</p>
               <p>How many times do you think you might have opened the door to him? - Four or five times.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion was it that you opened the door to him before? - Mr. Newman had come to wish to buy some goods of Mr. Yates, for Mr. Yates to take a note from him.</p>
               <p>Are you now stating that from the information of Mr. Yates, or from your own knowledge? - From my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time, when the prisoner applied to you or any body else, to this business? - For buying the goods; Mr. Newman has said to me he came to do some business with Mr. Yates; people leave their messages with me when Mr. Yates is not at home.</p>
               <p>What message did he leave? - That he would call the next morning, to look at the goods.</p>
               <p>So that you collected from the conversation, that that was some transaction about goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you saw the person in the passage, below, either when you went up stairs, or before you came down again; had you any recollection that you had seen his face before? - Not when I went up; he was not dressed so clean as he used to be, when I saw him; when I came to let him out at the street door, then I recollected that he was the person I had opened the door to before.</p>

               <p>Did you mention that to any body, when you missed your goods? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by name, when he came to the house; did he leave his name? - If he left his name, I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Did it never occur to you to say, that you thought one of the men that robbed the house, was a man that you had seen before: had you described the man by any token; such as that he was the man that came for goods, or that he had been there before? - No, I never particularly stated that matter, till we met him in the gardens; not that he was the man that came for the goods; because when he came for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090131"/>the goods, a Mr. Atkinson always came with him, who generally spoke to me about the goods.</p>
               <p>What did you say about it, to Mr. Yates, before you was in Kensington gardens, about your knowledge of the men? - Why Sir, I do not know; in the course of the week there were several things that passed about such a thing as that; I cannot tell what had occurred to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>You stated to the prisoner at Hyde Park, that he had several times been at your house? - Yes, the prisoner did not say any thing more to Mr. Yates; he used him very ill with his tongue, shook his stick at him, and said he would put a rod in brine for him to-morrow; the prisoner then and his brother walked off to go to Hyde-park (I afterwards understood that it was his brother that was with him); they walked out of Hyde-park, and we after them; and through the Green-park, and into St. James's-park; there Mr. Watson and Mr. Yates met the prisoner again in St. James's-park; they went down Piccadilly; and we went down the Green-park.</p>
               <p>Why did not you continue following them? - I do not know; we went into the Green-park, and so into St. James's Park, knowing that they were going along Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in St. James's Park, before you met the prisoner and his brother? - I never saw any more of them, till I saw them at Craven-street; at the top of Piccadilly we parted.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you see the prisoner? - It might be an hour and an half after I left them, that I saw the prisoner again in company with his brother and Mr. Yates, and Mr. Watson and Mr. Reilly, and the constable; Mr. Burke was not in the room; he was in the passage; he did not immediately go in the parlour; I went into the dining-room.</p>
               <p>What more passed between you and him, or from him in your hearing? - Mr. Burke called me down stairs, to go into the parlour; and the prisoner said to me when I went into the parlour, Madam, I should be glad to know from you, what I am brought here for? I said, Sir, you certainly know what you are brought here for; he said, I know! I wish to know it from you? I said, Sir, I do not think I am a proper person to relate to you, what you are brought here for; but you will hear it from some person that is proper; the prisoner said that he hoped I did not mean to hurt his character; and that he wished to come there to clear his character; and to know what he was brought there for, was what he came for; and he waited to know it; I do not recollect that he said anything more to me at that time; I left him talking to Mr. Reilly; and Mr. Booth was come by that time; but he was not in the parlour with the prisoner; he was in the passage, waiting to speak to me; his brother spoke to me; the prisoner was in the parlour; I should suppose he must hear it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt he did hear it? - I should suppose he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. Was he attending to you? - Yes; his brother walked with me to the other end of the room; and said, for God's sake, you will not hang my brother, will you? I said, I want nothing from your brother in the world, but to restore to my friends what he has taken from them; I said nothing more to him at that time; I went out of the room, and left them all in the parlour; and a good many people were gathered together; they continued together more than an hour in Mr. Yates's house.</p>
               <p>What were they doing? - Talking; I was not in the room; I went up stairs and got my supper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you at any time; hear the prisoner say where he was at the time this robbery was committed? - Yes, several times after, I heard him say several places where he was.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear him say anything about it; and where did he describe himself to have been? - In the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Where was it that he first mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090132"/>where he was at that day? - In Craven-street; on the Sunday evening, I heard the prisoner say, (Mr. Burke asked him if he would give an account of himself, where he was on the Tuesday evening,) that he should immediately be at liberty; for that was all Mr. Yates wanted to know; the prisoner said in answer, good God, he could not recollect particularly where he was; and he said oh! it is very apropos, I was at the lock-up-house from Tuesday, about three; I think he said, till the Wednesday, at eleven; Mr. Yeates immediately went out, to enquire at the lock-up-house if it was true; I forgot the lock-up-house.</p>
               <p>Was it Laver's? - Yes, it was; Mr. Yates had not been gone more than five minutes; he was only got to No. 3, when the prisoner recollected himself, and said, oh! good God, it was Tuesday fortnight I was there, go for Mr. Yates to come back with all the embarrassment in the world.</p>
               <p>I believe, in point of fact, it turns out that on the Tuesday fortnight he was there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is so I am instructed, therefore your Lordship may take it so.</p>

The prisoner immediately sent for Mr. Yates, when he recollected that; he came back; he seemed confused, and said he was very sorry he could not recollect any other place he was at; he walked about the room quite confused; and at last, he recollected; and they said, if any person you know, will say they know where you was on Tuesday night, it will be sufficient; he said, Mr. Price in Northumberland-street; and Mr. O'Brien in Craven-street; and another gentleman I believe, whose name I have forgot, that would say where he was on Tuesday evening; they were sent for, but neither of them came; but I do not know for what reason; he referred to those gentlemen, to give an account where he was that evening, as he was embarrassed, and could not do it himself; I did not hear him give any account at that time.</p>
               <p>In the end, what became of him that evening? - He was taken into custody; and detained that evening in the custody of

            ; I saw him the next morning at Bow-street; I was examined there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner there, in your hearing, give any account where he had been on the Tuesday evening? - No, Sir; he was examined three times; first on the Monday morning; then in the afternoon; then on Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>Then in the end, I believe he was admitted to bail? - Yes, he was discharged the first time; the magistrate asked me if I had anything more to say; and I had never been at a court; and I said no; and he was discharged; he was taken into custody the same day, and examined on Monday evening; then he went to Clerkenwell, that he might recollect where he was, till Wednesday; on Wednesday he was examined again; and then he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Do you know anything more of this matter? - I do not know anything more, than his offering to give a bond for the value of the property; that was in my hearing on Sunday evening; he was very timorous about being taken into custody; the constable told him that he was really not a prisoner; that he would give him every liberty of a gentleman; and if he could say where he was, he should be discharged; and he said he would sooner pay for the property, than have his character exposed in an open court; though an innocent man, he said he had not money at present, but he would give a bond, or something of that kind, for the value.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; this you recollect is a question of great importance to him; are you sure it was him? - I am certain sure it was.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt at all about it? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you from the time you saw him in Kensington-gardens, to this time, entertained the least doubt about him? - Not the least in the world; I can swear positively to him, Sir; if I could not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090133"/>done it, I would not have pretended to have done it.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be dressed in the same way, when you saw him in Kensington-gardens, as he was at your house? - I believe it was the same coat; his linen was cleaner a good deal on the Sunday, which made him appear very different.</p>
               <p>But upon the whole, you are positive he is the person? - I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now young woman, on the 21st of July, about six, it was tolerably light? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>The little girl called you up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who first spoke to you, the man in green, or the man in blue? - The man in green.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation at all with the man in blue? - Not one word then; he said he would wait below.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself speak to him at all? - I asked him if he would please to walk up stairs? to which he replied, I will wait here if you please.</p>
               <p>Now, mark me young woman; you yourself addressed your conversation to the man in blue? - Yes; I asked him if he would walk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Was not it pretty dark in the passage? - There is no light over the door; but the back door is directly opposite, which was standing open.</p>
               <p>When you saw this man in the passage; and you asked him if he would walk up stairs; having seen him as you told the Jury, before several times, did not you recognize him as an acquaintance some way or other? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then he passed at that time a perfect stranger to you, though you had seen him three or four times before? - Yes, Sir, as a perfect stranger; because the business he came on, he did not do; I did not recognize him at all.</p>
               <p>Then you went up stairs with the man in green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now ten minutes is a very considerable time to look at an apartment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One apartment is soon looked at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At first, the man in green did not seem very desirous to look at the lodging, as it was a second floor? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might you be up stairs looking at this second floor? - Upon my word I do not know; not more than five minutes I suppose; five or ten minutes might compleat the whole.</p>
               <p>If you would look at the clock, and see how slow the hand moves, you would see that ten minutes is a long time to look at an apartment? - I cannot justly say the time; the gentleman in green walked into the one pair of stairs, and looked at it; and walked in at the bed room door.</p>

               <p>What became of the little girl? - She went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Was the street door open? - No, it was shut.</p>
               <p>Who shut it? - The child shut it.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday, you was walking in Kensington-gardens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was the Tuesday before, that this circumstance happened of the lodging being enquired after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had lost your cloak, and Mrs. Yates hers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to Mr. Yates about the man in blue, or the man in green? - I never described the people at all to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Did you ever at all describe them to Mrs. Yates? - Never; never in the world; never described the prisoner, any more than we lost the things; we did not immediately suppose it to be the gentlemen that came for the lodging.</p>
               <p>I dare say not; and I dare say it was not that gentleman that came for the lodging: did you at any time say to Mrs. Yates, good God! if it was the man that came for the lodging; surely I have seen that man before? - Yes, Sir; as soon as we had missed the things, I said so to Mr. Yates and Mrs. Yates.</p>
               <p>What did you say to Mr. Yates? - It is of no consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090134"/>Tell me? - When I told him the gentlemen came for the lodging, I did not suppose them to be the thieves.</p>
               <p>How did you describe them, when you took it into your head that they might? - Then I said immediately to Mr. Yates, it must be the man that I left in the passage, that has got the cloaks; Mr. Yates said, what kind of looking men were they? I said, he did not look so much like a gentleman, as the man that went up stairs; Mr. Yates did not stop to ask me anything further about it.</p>
               <p>Does your memory serve you to say, that that was the observation you made; that he did not look so much like a gentleman, as the man who went up stairs? - I think that was the words I said.</p>
               <p>Did you say nothing more? - I think not.</p>
               <p>At first, you say, you had no suspicion that this man took the things? - We had not missed them.</p>
               <p>As soon as you missed them, what was your suspicion? - That the person I left in the passage must be the person: I said nothing more to Mr. Yates at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you advertize the goods, or make any complaint at Bow-street? - Mr. Yates went to Bow-street with a list of the property; Sir Sampson Wright sent to me the next morning; he examined me; and I said to him, what I have said to you; I told him it was one in blue, and one in green.</p>
               <p>What description of the dress did you give of the man in blue; I mean the first time? - That he was dressed in a blue coat, and a striped waistcoat; and I am sure I do not know what hat; but I think he had boots on; because, when I came down, he was whipping his stick, which rattled like boots.</p>
               <p>In Kensington-garden you saw two men; the prisoner was one; and his brother, most certainly, in a green coat, was the person in green, the person that was up stairs with you? - No; I am sure it was not.</p>
               <p>You had not got very far into Kensington-gardens, before they came back? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What did you say to Mr. Yates, when the gentlemen passed you? - When they passed us not the length of this court, I said to Mr. Yates, good God! that is the man that robbed your house.</p>
               <p>Now, mark me; this man's countenance you had seen, when he called three or four times before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, you recollected a countenance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your recollection of that countenance, you concluded he was the man? - Yes; I told Mr. Yates I had seen the man some where, but I positively could not recollect where.</p>
               <p>In Hyde-park, Mr. Yates tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him if he had been at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell the young man at that time, that you was ready to swear that he had been at the house? - I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Did he explain why he asked the question? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, after you parted with Mr. Yates, that this young man went up past Mr. Yates afterwards? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Having seen his countenance before, when he came, you thought it was the same man that came about the lodging? - That was the man I left in the passage.</p>
               <p>When you left this man and his brother, and Mr. Burke and Mr. Reilly, then it was that he asked you, what he was brought there for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why would not you tell him? - I thought it not proper for me to tell him any thing about the matter.</p>
               <p>Why so? - I was unacquainted; I thought it was to be related by some peace officer.</p>
               <p>When you did communicate that he was the person that came to Mr. Yates's house; in what manner did you say it? - Mr. Burke had told him he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>Had you pretended then, to be half so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090135"/>positive as you are now to his person? - Yes, Sir; Mr. Reilly and Mr. Booth had asked me particularly in the passage.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether in the presence of the prisoner, when Mr. Reilly was there, and Mr. Burke was there, you was as sure then, as you are now? - Because I did not know I was to speak.</p>
               <p>When the question was asked you, whether he was the man that was at the house; or if you would take upon you to say that he was at the house, whether you did not qualify it in that way, saying, I think he was? - I said, for my own part, I have not the least doubt but that is the man.</p>
               <p>Was that your expression at that time? Yes.</p>
               <p>To whom did you say that? - To several people that were in the parlour, that asked me about it.</p>
               <p>Did you say that to Mr. Reilly, or Mr. Burke? - I do not know that I did at that time.</p>
               <p>Why, when you went before the Justice, was you equally positive there; because, it is very odd the Justice should discharge him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Equally positive before the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swore that he was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the Justice discharged him out of custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I see your examination has these words; that you</p>
               <p>"believe he was the man;" was that the way in which you swore; did not the Justice say, here is a mistake: in the first examination you say thus,</p>
               <p>"Who believes</p>
               <p>"is the person that stole the said articles:" in the second examination you get into a more positive manner,</p>
               <p>"Who has not the smallest doubt:" and are you equally positive now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house is this in which Mr. Yates lives; is it a shop? - Not a shop.</p>
               <p>Now, you call him a linen draper? - Yes; he has a room that he keeps his goods in, but not a publick shop.</p>
               <p>Where is this room then; is it a mystery, a secret? - Not at all, Sir; he deals in linen-drapery; he has a room, and carries on his business there.</p>
               <p>Is there any sign of the business? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You had one lodger in the first floor; and had the second floor to let? - We had a gentleman in the first floor; and he was out of town at that time; I suppose he was out of town about three weeks.</p>
               <p>What does the family consist of? - Mr. and Mrs. Yates, and myself, the child, and a female servant; we had hired a maid servant that day; and she was not come; and the child that was there, was a child belonging to the nurse that had Mr. Yates's child to nurse; she might be eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Was that the first day she had been in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had she been in the house? - I do not know; I was in the country when she came; she had been there almost a week; for I had been home almost a week; she slept there.</p>
               <p>Where is the child now? - I do not know; with her friends.</p>
               <p>Who are the child's friends? - Their name is Gibbs.</p>
               <p>What way of life are they in? - The father of her is a carpenter; I believe he works journey work with a Mr. Archibald; the mother is in no way of business; she had Mrs. Yates's little girl home to nurse.</p>
               <p>Do you know what acquaintance this child had in the house? - I do not know; the child came out of the kitchen to open the door.</p>

               <p>How long had you and Mrs. Yates been below in the kitchen? - The whole day; I had been to fetch the tea-cups from the parlour not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Who let Mr. Yates in? - I did; I did not miss the cloaks then.</p>
               <p>How long was it after Mr. Yates had been in the house, before you discovered that the cloaks were gone? - I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour after Mr. Yates came home; in the whole, an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090136"/>Now, what sort of situation are those houses? - Iron rails before the parlour windows; but we never leave any windows open, because there have been many alarms of thieves at the tops of houses.</p>
               <p>In fact, you had had nobody to act as servant, but the child, for a week? - No.</p>
               <p>When had it happened to you and Mrs. Yates, to be out, before this day? - The evening before.</p>
               <p>Had you any occasion for your cloaks this day? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you observed your cloaks five minutes before? - I did observe them.</p>
               <p>From the time the prisoner and his companion went away, till you wanted your cloaks, was there any body else in the house? - Nobody came into the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know where the father of this child, the carpenter lives?</p>
               <p>Mr. Yates. In Liquor-pond-street, Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Craven-street; I am a linen-draper; about seven, on Sunday afternoon, we were coming from the palace in Kensington-gardens; coming to London, towards Hyde Park gate, there were a number of people; and two gentlemen went past us; the young woman immediately called to me; says she, that is the man that we left in the passage on Tuesday night? I said, then let us turn about, and look at him; and I said then, immediately, that was him that wanted some goods of me some time ago? and she said, yes, so it is: upon our turning about to walk after him a little way, he looked over his shoulder, and saw us.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him look at you? - Yes; I saw him look very positively in my face; they turned about, and went to town; and walked very fast; and upon our following him, he immediately turned; and with another gentleman with a green coat on, he immediately turned towards Hyde Park gate; he was going towards the palace before, he walked very fast indeed; we followed after him; and I mentioned I wished I could see somebody and I would ask him; and when we came out of Kensington Gardens coming into Hyde Park; he walked very fast indeed, and sometimes ran a little, and we also; when we were almost at Hyde Park Corner, I met one of my friends, Mr. Watson, and I asked him if he would step with me; I took his arm and went up to Mr. Newman, and clapped him on the shoulder, and took him about twenty paces from the gangway; and said to him, Sir, I believe you are the gentleman that called at my house on Tuesday evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that all you said till he gave an answer? - It was; and instantly upon my saying that, he said, you scoundrel, you rascal, you blackguard, what do you mean? I am a gentleman, says he, you do not know any thing of me; yes says I, I do; oh yes, says he, I remember, I believe you live in Craven-street, but you do not know my name; I said, I did not recollect it; but says he, I will lay a rod in soak for you; my attorney's name is Smith, he lives in Clerkenwell; I will lay a rod in soak for you; I will do for you; I said, I did not care what he could do, I wished this young woman could positively swear to him; there came a number of people up, and him and the gentleman that was with him went away very fast.</p>
               <p>Before they parted, do you recollect Miss Allen saying any thing to him? - Miss Allen, I believe, said to them that she knew him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Did she assign any reason to him for her knowing him? - There were a number of people; I cannot say whether she did or no; he shook his stick at me; upon this him and his brother went away very fast; there was a good many people came up, and they got off; we parted with him there; we came out into Picadilly, he was in Picadilly before us; and we lost sight of him, as soon as he got into Hyde Park Gate; we went into St. James's Park, and in coming through St. James's Park, we met him and his brother again; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090137"/>coming as if he had come in at Spring-gardens Gate; he said it was his brother afterwards; upon meeting him there, Mr. Watson was with me; and I went up to him again, and I clapped him on the shoulder, as I did not know what he would do, and I said if I have done any thing to offend you, we had better go and have something to drink, and make it up; when we came out of the Park he wanted to go into the Cannon coffee house; but I said we would go home and have something to eat, and I would make any apology to him as a gentleman; but I still suspected him to be the man; then when we came home he wanted to see the young woman, to see what she had to say to him; and I immediately sent for one of the neighbours, to ask his advice, what to do; and I sent for Mr. Reilley, and we sent for a constable; he had a good deal to say about it, that he did not know what it was we meant to accuse him of in Hyde Park, as a gentleman, and wished to know what we had to say to him; I never said any thing, nor accused him of any thing, till the officer was come, and it was some time after that he was accused; immediately on his being accused with the thing, he flew into a very great flutter, and cried, and threw himself round; and his brother in the same manner, he cried his God, what would he do, he was a ruined man; and what would he do, he was quite innocent, what would he do, and threw himself on Mr. Watson, to support him; and that was all that I heard him say; that he was quite innocent of any such charge, that he was in the country, that he could easily prove where he was on that day; and he still said he was a gentleman; then after he was charged with taking away the goods, he was desired to recollect where he was on Tuesday, and if he was innocent we were to make an apology to him for troubling him; he said should he be obliged to tell where he was on Tuesday; he said that his substance was very much exhausted, and that he was arrested at the suit of Mr. Groves, on the Tuesday, and was at Laver's spunging-house; Mr. Burke then the constable, desired me to go to see; I went out to go to Mr. Laver's; and I was not gone but a very little time when they called me back; and then he said he had made a mistake, that it was on the Tuesday preceding; and it turns out that he had been there that evening; he then said he had been at Mr. Sterling's wine-vaults in the morning, that he had been drinking, and was drunk there the whole day; I knew Mr. Sterling, and upon my proposing to send for Mr. Sterling, he said he believed it was not on the Tuesday, he mentioned some other day; he then asked me what the value of the property was, that I had lost; which I was desired by my neighbours not to put any value, nor to say any thing about it, unless he returned the things themselves; he often told me that he would sooner pay for the property and have done, than have the risk of standing the trial.</p>
               <p>Recollect his particular expression, and do not introduce any thing of your own into it? - He asked me the value of the property, and that would be much better for me than to run the risk of a trial; and the young woman she said she would swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not he add, though he was innocent? - Yes, he said though he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did not he say this, than have his character exposed in a publick Court? - Yes, he said so.</p>
               <p>Always insisting, however, he was innocent? - Always insisting that he was innocent; he referred us to Mr. O'Brien to give him a character, he sent for him, but he did not come; then he mentioned Mr. Price, an attorney, in Northumberland-street, to give an account of him; and his brother went out and staid out, for some time, and came back again; and on his return he said he had found out now positively, where he was; but he said that in the passage.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that they were to give an account, who he was, or where he was? - To give an account where he was that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090138"/>Tuesday night; the prisoner said no more to me, but that he would sooner pay for the property; in the end he was taken away in the custody of Mr. Burke, and the next day examined at Bow-street and discharged; and in the evening taken into custody, and re-examined; then committed till the Wednesday; re-examined, and then admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Before the magistrate, did Mr. Price attend, in the presence of the prisoner? - I do not know, I do recollect seeing him there; I heard in the evening what he said, but not in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Was he examined at the desire of the prisoner, and in the hearing of the prisoner? - It was in the prisoner's hearing that he spoke to the Justice; he said that he was at his house about six, and left the house a little before six; the prisoner brought a Mr. Read there.</p>
               <p>You spoke of the prisoner, as a man that you know on some former transaction; what was that transaction? - One Atkinson came to me, and wanted me to sell some goods to a friend of his, and take a bill; the prisoner called different times at my house, when I was not at home; I went to the Cannon Coffee-house, to meet the prisoner, one evening; he gave me a direction to the gentleman; but by the behaviour of the prisoner, and the gentleman recommended to me; I declined having any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He had been at your house, we have understood, frequently? - I have only seen him once at my house, and once at the Cannon Coffee-house; but I have seen him often in the streets since; I know him perfectly well; he never told his name.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard from Mr. Allen that he had been at your house? - Yes, but he did not leave his name.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen acknowledged to you in Kensington Gardens, her recollection of his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore this man knew a little of you; you knew a little of him; and his person was known to Mrs. Allen? - Yes; whether she recollected him, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why, she said she did, you said that was the man that wanted to have the transaction with the goods; she said it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now at the time these things were lost, who made the discovery of the loss? - Upon my coming home; we was going to ship some goods; I told this young woman and my wife, if they would get themselves ready, I would give them a sail to London-bridge; immediately they went into the parlour, and missed their two cloaks; and they immediately said there was nobody in the house but these two gentlemen, that came to take the lodging.</p>
               <p>Did they describe the persons at all? - Yes, they described the persons, one with a green coat, and the other with a blue coat; and Mrs. Allen said, she knew him, but she did not recollect who he was.</p>
               <p>How long ago might this be, when you had the transaction about the goods with Mr. Newman? - I think it was the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Now when you went out of Kensington Gardens, and clapped him on the shoulder, you asked him if he had been at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you accuse him at once of being the person that was at your house? - I do not know why, but I did not.</p>
               <p>There were some warm words passed between you? - He was very warm with me, but I was cool.</p>
               <p>You have have given me an expression, which I have taken down, and I want to know the reason of this expression,</p>
               <p>"because I still suspected him to be the person that took the things;" but you could have no reason to suspect him, but from what she told you? - And by knowing his former character.</p>
               <p>What made you wish the young woman could positively swear to him? - Because I thought if she could, I should get my property again.</p>
               <p>What made you say so? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090139"/>However that was the expression you used,</p>
               <p>"I wish this young woman could positively swear to you"? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you lost sight of him, where did he go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he went along Piccadilly? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe he went through St. James's Park, out of Hyde Park Gate? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard from Mrs. Allen, that he went along Piccadilly? - I never heard from her.</p>
               <p>Has she never told you so since, that he went along Piccadilly? - Yes, she has told me so, and so did others.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it in St. James's Park that you met again? - It was a little on this side the chairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Has that been since you came home to Craven-street, or was it when you came out of the Park? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you so at the time? - Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you so? - I cannot recollect positively what time; I clapped him on the shoulder, in the same manner, in St. James's Park, and told him if I had done any thing to affront him, I was ready to make him any apology; says he, I wanted to see you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now you see another circumstance has escaped you which you would not tell my friend here, he said to you</p>
               <p>"I wanted to see you?" - Yes, after I came up to him, he said he was going to send to his Attorney, Mr. Smith, who lived in Clerkenwell; and he wanted to see me before; and he asked me what I meant by accosting him in Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him? - No, because I did not chuse to accuse him with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Why not? - Because in case I had accused him wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he object to going with you? - He objected to going home with me; he proposed going into the Cannon Coffee-house with me, to have something to drink, and to make an apology to him, for stopping him, as he was a gentleman; I said you had better go home with me, and we will have something to drink; and if I had done any thing to offend him, I would make an apology to him.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him at your own house, about the charge, before Mr. Burke and Mr. Reilly came? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make known the charge, and in what manner? - That this young woman said he was the man that was left in the passage; and that I had been robbed that night.</p>
               <p>And he flew into a great passiion; and cried out; and said he was out of town; always persisting in his innocence; and saying he would rather pay the value of the things, than have his character exposed, and stand a trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was Mrs. Allen called in? - When the charge was given of the property; she said he was the man that she left in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did he ask her whether she could say he was the man? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>That is very odd, your memory serves you very accurately in other things? - She said he was the man that had taken the property.</p>
               <p>Who asked her about his being the man; was it you or Burke, or Reilly? - It was me that accused him with the property being stolen; and she immediately said he was the man.</p>
               <p>What were your particular words? - I said, I have been robbed; and this young woman says you are the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Was it after your so saying, that Mrs. Allen stood forward, and said he was the man; was that the first time that

               <p>When was it? - I do not know; I was not in the room.</p>
               <p>What led you out of the room? - I went to advise with the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Why, you had called in Mr. Reilly and Mr. Burke; did you want further advice? - If I remember right; I believe I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090140"/>went out to speak to another of the neighbours, to ask him what I should do, before I would charge him.</p>
               <p>Why, when you was in possession, as you have told us over and over again, of the assertion of that young woman, did you hesitate at all about it? - I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Why, had you found any circumstance in addition; have you found any of the property? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you advertized it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the child's parents or friends live, that happened to be in the house at that time? - In Liquor-pond-street; she is about twelve or thirteen years of age; a daughter of the nurse's.</p>
               <p>How far is Liquor-pond-street from you? - It is in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Does the nurse visit at your house? - Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>How long has the child of the nurse lived with you? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>When Burke and Reilly had this young man there, what did they say? - They told him he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt to make any escape from you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he insist on the matter being enquired into? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>You went before the Justice Addington; you made your charge; and he was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he go to, when he was discharged? - He went to Mr. Reilly's.</p>
               <p>What, to the Globe Tavern, the corner of Craven-street; when was he apprehended the second time? - I never had anything to do before a Justice; and I told the Justice he had offered to pay for the goods; and I asked him in what manner I should proceed, so I did not touch his life.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Justice at the same time, that he had declared his innocence of the transaction; and that it was only to keep his character from being exposed? - No, I did not; I called the Justice into the back parlour, and told him I would be obliged to him, to tell me in what manner to proceed against him, not to touch his life? the Justice said, as a magistrate I will do my duty; and he examined him; and discharged him; then Mrs. Allen said he offered to pay for the goods, which the Justice had not been told; and immediately the Justice ordered this warrant to take him up again; to pay for the goods, he thought, that was a sign of guilt; and ordered this warrant to take him up again; then I was called upon again, to give the same evidence, when I was examined, I told the magistrate the whole transaction; I told the magistrate that he did not confess to the property, but he had offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate the whole circumstance, that we have come at here; that the man declared and protested that he was an innocent man; but that to save his character, and the risk of a trial, he would rather pay for the goods? - In the evening, Mr. Addington and Mr. Bond attended.</p>

               <p>During the time he was committed, there was an advertisement, calling together all the people whose lodgings had been robbed? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that many people attended at the office? - I believe they did.</p>
               <p>You saw them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were not they all asked whether that was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not they all say that he was not the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you present when he was admitted to bail? - I asked the Justice; they took bail for him; I had enquired after the goods, and had not found them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a neighbour of Mr. Yates's; on Sunday, after Mr. Yates was robbed, I met him and Mr. Yates, and Miss Allen, in Hyde Park; he said something to me, in consequence of which, he and me went up to the prisoner; Mr. Yates tapped him on the shoulder, and said, my friend, I want to speak to you; the prisoner followed about twenty yards out of the croud; and the first thing Mr. Yates said, was, you was at my house last Tuesday night, Sir? the prisoner immediately flew into a passion at these words; and said, I at your house! what do you mean by that? I never was at your house but once (I think he said) in my life; and threw out some threats to Mr. Yates, what he would do to him for that; and walked off; there was a very great croud came together in a moment, which might be a reason for his going off.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Yates did not say to him, what he had against him? - No; after that, we lost sight of the prisoner in Hyde Park, on this side the Serpentine River; about half way between the Serpentine River and the gate; and we were coming down St. James's Park, towards London; the prisoner, and the gentleman that was with him, who was his brother, met us, I did not see them, but Mr. Yates did; Mr. Yates said to me, there, they have passed us again; now, if you will go back with me, we will follow them, and take them into custody? I said I would go back with him; when we came up to them, we told them that we had a little business with them, if they had no objection to going along with us; I believe Mr. Yates spoke first; and I said to the prisoner, Mr. Newman, this is not a place to talk about business, let us go somewhere where we can talk the matter over quietly; and then Mr. Yates will explain it to you? and he said, certainly, he had no objection to go; and he said, I am come here on purpose to seek you; I did upon my soul; for I wanted the business explained to night; I have known him this seven or eight years by name, not further; but I know that was his name; I do not know that I have spoke to him these seven or eight years before: going through Spring-gardens passage, some words passed between Mr. Yates and him; I heard Mr. Newman threaten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090143"/>to knock Mr. Yates down; but I did not hear what Mr. Yates said to him; then he went quietly with us to Craven-street; I was chiefly in the parlour with him and his brother; there was a little delay in explaining the business; the constable was sent for; and after he came, the business was opened; there was Mr. Booth the attorney; and Mr. Reilly of the Globe, and the constable; the delay was occasioned by sending for the constable; the constable opened the business to the prisoner; the prisoner said, that is a very serious charge; I am very glad that I know the business; it is a very serious charge indeed; but I have it in my power to clear myself of it immediately; he then carried the matter with a high hand, and used some threats to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>I wish you would not describe it by epithets of your own, but tell us what he said? - Then he said, there is a matter which I must inform you of, though it is very disagreeable to me to relate it; but I must in my own vindication. Last Tuesday night you was robbed? Mr. Yates said, yes: last Tuesday morning, says he, I was arrested; and was in a spunging-house in Chancery-lane, from Tuesday morning to Wednesday evening; after that, the constable then told me that he was very glad the business was likely to end so very happily; in the first place, says he, we will send to the spunging-house, to see if you was there at the time; and Mr. Yates and another gentleman that was there, whose name I do not know, were appointed to go; they set out; and as soon as they got into the street, the gentleman that was with the prisoner, that was his brother I believe, said to the prisoner, was it last Tuesday night, or was it the Tuesday before; upon which, the prisoner then immediately said, oh! good Good! it was the Tuesday before, call Mr. Yates back, call him back, it was the Tuesday before; Mr. Yates was called back; and after that, the prisoner's behaviour was very different to what it was before; he seemed very much affected; he carried it with rather a high hand; he wrung his hands, and said, good God! I cannot recollect where I was on Tuesday last; and was in as great distress as ever I saw any body; he was advised to sit down, that he might recollect, which he could not, he mentioned a great many people that would come to speak to his character; I believe Mr. O'Brien was sent for, and refused to come.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner name any other place where he said he had been? - I did not; he said Mr. O'Brien, and some other gentlemen he mentioned, would all come and give him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mr. Price being named? - No, I do not think I do; I do not think he named him; there might be a good deal of conversation which I might not attend to.</p>
               <p>Did you understand that Mr. O'Brien, and the other persons in the neighbourhood, were to come to speak to his character; or did they know anything about him? - Only to speak to his character; he was committed that night; I attended one examination; I was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mr. Watson, you seem to have a perfect memory of what passed, on Mr. Yates's meeting him in Hyde Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He said to him, you was at my house last Tuesday night, Sir? - Yes, he did; they were the very words he used; upon which, he answered, I at your house! I never was there but once, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Then he did not disclaim all knowledge of him, but seemed to acknowledge that he had been at his house; and that he knew him? - Yes, about three or four months before.</p>
               <p>What passed immediately after? - Why, upon my word, I do not know exactly, what might pass, as he was not half a minute before he walked off.</p>
               <p>Now, when Mr. Yates walked up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090144"/>him, and tapped him on the shoulder, and said this to him, where had he left Mrs. Allen? - A little behind.</p>
               <p>Then, the confusion that took place, happened between you and Mr. Yates, and Newman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen was not at all incommoded by this? - Certainly not; I think not.</p>
               <p>She said nothing at all to him? - Not that I know of; I think she did not.</p>
               <p>At that time, she did not pretend she had known him or seen him before? - Not in Hyde Park; for he was not half a minute before he got off, there was such a croud.</p>
               <p>Now then, you can tell whether Mrs. Allen said on that occasion, I know you, I have seen you before? - He did not pretend at all, that he was ignorant of Mr. Yates; he could not, by giving that answer.</p>
               <p>Nor did Mrs. Allen on that occasion, say to him, I know you? - Mrs. Allen might say so; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You have told me that this matter lasted a minute or two; and that when Mr. Yates spoke to him, you was near him; and Mrs. Allen somewhat behind? - She was; I did not hear her say a word; it might be the confusion; Mr. Yates had not explained the business to me; the words might pass, but I did not observe them.</p>
               <p>How far did you go in Hyde Park, before he escaped from your sight? - Not ten yards.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything of him, when he went out of Hyde Park? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he went down Piccadilly or not? - No, I do not; I should rather imagine that he went down Constitution-hill, and so turned back.</p>
               <p>Where was Mrs. Allen? - She might be sometimes twenty or sixty yards behind.</p>
               <p>If she was rather behind, and Mr. Newman and his brother were rather before you, it was more improbable that she should observe, than you should? - It was; she was the greatest part of the way behind; I thought in my own mind, that they had come down Constitution-hill, and had turned back again.</p>
               <p>On the accusation being made in this way, when was it that Mrs. Allen was called on to speak to what she knew of the matter? - After the business had been opened to the prisoner by Mr. Burke the constable.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mr. Yates saying to Newman, I wish this young woman could swear positively to you, in Hyde Park? - No, I do not remember that; he might say so, I was so confused; the people gathering, I might not attend to understand it.</p>
               <p>When did Mr. Yates first tell you anything about his intention of speaking to Newman at all? - Never; he desired me to follow him, but never told me a word of what he was about.</p>
               <p>After the first meeting, what did he say to you? - He told me coming along, the business; and that Miss Allen pointed him out, as the man she left in the passage.</p>
               <p>Where was it, in Craven-street, that Mrs. Allen was called in to tell Burke, or anybody else, what she would say? - I do not think she was immediately called in; I should imagine Burke had talked to her; he was in and out several times; and he seemed to know so well what Miss Allen could say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when Burke went to Mr. Newman, he was not in custody? - Yes; that was before Mr. Yates had gone into Chancery-lane; and it impressed every body that was there, particularly myself, that however one person might be like another, he could not be the man; and Mr. Burke then said, you are not in custody now; you are welcome to go now; he made no attempt to go; on the contrary, I think he said, I do not chuse to go.</p>
               <p>Now, as soon as ever he was desired to recollect where he had been on the Tuesday night, he first thought of this place, Laver's, the officer's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he immediately rectified that mistake himself, before Mr. Yates had gone far out of the house? - Yes, by his brother.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Price sent to? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090145"/>know; I think he was not, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You say, that when Mr. Newman was attacked by Mr. Yates, and Newman had agreed to go home with him, that in that passage they had some high words; and he threatened to knock Yates down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that on that occasion, he had exasperated Mr. Yates considerably? - Yates had exasperated him; Yates appeared in a very good humour at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Yates shewed his exasperation, by desiring him to be admitted to bail, and not indicting him for a capital offence.</p>
               <p>- BURKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Mr. Yates's on Sunday evening; when this gentleman was there; I believe it was about 10 on Sunday evening, the 26th of July, I was sent for to Mr. Yates's in Craven-street; after I took the prisoner into custody, he seemed exceedingly agitated indeed; and cried that he should be ruined; I explained to him why I took him into custody; I told him I was an officer of the parish, and was sent for to take him into custody, on account of a robbery that Mr. Yates had sustained the Tuesday before; the prisoner seemed very much agitated, and asked the consequence of it; I told the gentleman, that that if he could not disprove what the young woman, Miss Allen, had before told me in the passage, that it was my duty to hold him for that night; and to bring him the next day before a magistrate; and I believed, if he could not there disprove it, he would be committed: Mr. Newman asked me what was likely to follow afterwards? I said, if he was committed, of course, a trial would be had; and if he could not disprove it, I was afraid conviction would follow; but I told him I was not much acquainted with such things; but I said to him, Sir, you seem to be a gentleman, and if you can satisfy me where you was on Tuesday night, when the robbery was committed, I will be very happy to discharge you; upon which, Mr. Newman told me he could: and it was now necessary he should explain his situation; on that day, on the Tuesday this robbery was supposed to be done, he was arrested at two o'clock, and had to the house of a Mr. Laver, till between 10 and 11 the next day; and said, there was a gentleman or two in my neighbourhood, naming them, who would satisfy me of the truth of that assertion; I said, Sir, I shall think it no trouble to attend you here, while I send the man of the house to Mr. Laver; and that will be the surest means of being certain; I called in Mr. Yates, and told him, Sir, this gentleman says he was so and so, as I have now described to you; I desire you will take your hat, and go yourself, that you may be sure of the truth of this matter; and know whether it is so or not: Mr. Yates left the room; and in a very little time after Mr. Yates was out of the parlour; a very little time indeed, it was; I cannot pretend to say how many minutes, Mr. Newman seemed to recollect it was the Tuesday se'nnight; I will not be positive; but as far as my recollection can fairly remember, he seemed immediately to recollect it himself; I immediately called the first I saw, which was Mr. Reilly's apprentice boy, to fetch Mr. Yates back; in the course of that time, Mr. Newman again called me aside in the parlour, and asked me over again, what I thought the consequence of this prosecution would be; or whether I imagined the young woman would positively swear to him; I had told him she would positively swear to him; I told Mr. Newman, that though a neighbour, I was an intire stranger to the people of the house; and never had seen or conversed with them before; which was the truth; but that I should advise her over and over, to be very positive in her assertions; and if she did, I thought it would be serious; upon which, Mr. Newman seemed very much distressed indeed, and mentioned his character, which he said would suffer very much by a publick prosecution, by a publick trial; and under that idea; and seemingly under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090146"/>the idea of getting rid of a publick scandal, he offered to pay for the things; on account of some suits he had in Chancery, and the honor of his family; but all the time asserting in the most solemn manner, that he was to every intent and purpose innocent of the fact; I told him that as a constable, I did not think it was proper for me to hear of any conpromise; nor did I think it safe for the prosecutor to accept of any; but if it was, it must be conducted through some other medium; I then urged the gentleman to reconcile himself, and to recollect where he had spent the Tuesday, assuring him my time was not so precious, but I should be ready to attend him, to satisfy the man of the house, and acquit him: Mr. Newman in a very great agitation, seemed at a loss to know where he was; but a brother of Mr. Newman's who was all this while there, said he would go and bring a certain account where Mr. Newman was on Tuesday; that was in the presence of the prisoner; he took his hat and went out of the house, for that purpose; he returned in some short time afterwards; I cannot be particular to the time, it might be half an hour; and when he came into the parlour, he sat down, and said I now have found to a certainty where my brother spent the day on Tuesday; I said I should be very happy to know; and he said, that early in the day, on Tuesday, in the hearing of the prisoner, he went to Sterling's wine vaults, in the Hay-market, where he drank freely, got partly intoxicated, fell asleep, and staid till late in the evening; I immediately said, is Mr. Sterling coming here to satisfy me of the truth of that? he said he was, as I understood his brother, said he was coming; I waited two hours, and no gentleman or others appearing; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any observation on what his brother said? - The prisoner heard his brother give this account, and he did not contradict it, that I am sure of; but I cannot remember whether he said any thing to it.</p>
               <p>Did he hear your enquiry, whether Mr. Sterling was coming? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>He heard the answer, that he would come? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>After waiting as long as you did, did you make any observation on going away? - So far, that I was exceedingly sorry for the disappointment; and that I found it my duty to take care of Mr. Newman till the day following, and that there was no place I could take him to but the watch-house; and I told him any little civility I could shew him I would.</p>
               <p>When did you say to him, you did not consider him as a prisoner? - That was before I took him into custody; that was before I heard what was said by Miss Allen; I thought at all events I would wait to see his conduct on the occasion; and if I found he abruptly attempted to go away, I would run the risk; but in the mean time Mr. Booth, a gentleman of great reputation, came in and removed my doubts; and it was on that I desired Miss Allen to come into the parlour and point out the identical man, which she did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In some conversation Mr. Newman said you are an officer? - I said yes; he said then I suppose I am in custody? I said no, you are not, you are at liberty to go about your business; and he did not offer to go away.</p>
               <p>Protesting his innocence? - I afterwards, by advice of Mr. Booth, conveyed a line to the prisoner; if he would confess the things, and pay for them, article by article; the prisoner said he was willing to pay for the things, but solemnly protesting he could not confess to a thing he was innocent of; he proposed paying for the things by his own, and his brother's bond; I attended the magistrate with him the next day, and then he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he went to? - No, I did not; I found him afterwards at Mr. Reilly's house, the corner of Craven-street; he made no resistance; I found him in Mr. Reilly's Coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner at the Bar, now is your time to make your defence; do you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090147"/>wish to say any thing for yourself, or do you leave it to your counsel? - I leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I believe you live at the Globe in the Strand? - I do.</p>
               <p>You was sent for to Mr. Yates's house, on the Sunday night, when Mr. Newman was taken? - Yes, Sir, I had heard of his loss before; he ordered a shilling's worth of rum and water, and he begged I would go over; I went with it, and I saw the prisoner and his brother; the prisoner said, as near as I can recollect, pray what have you to say against me; Mr. Yates told him he should know it in a little time; upon which, with a good deal of excuse, I believe Mr. Yates had sent for the constable, though Mr. Yates said, I was the person that directed him; Mr. Yates and the constable, both, had told him he was not then in charge, and he might go if he pleased; they did not make any charge at this time; when Mr. Yates gave the constable orders to take him in charge, and opened the whole matter of his losing three table spoons and eleven tea spoons; when I heard what had passed, I heard Mrs. Allen accuse him, and say he was the man that positively was in the passage; I was very apprehensive that he was the man, from what she said, because she spoke so pointedly to him; I went to him and said, Sir, if you are guilty you had better confess, and let the man have his property; good God, Sir, says he, how can I be accused of any thing of the kind; I cannot confess that or which I am innocent; says I, Sir, I would not be in your clothes for the world, for you will be hanged as sure as you are born; and if you have sold or made away with the things, make them some allowance? my God, Sir, says he, will you have me confess a thing that I am not guilty of? then Mr. Booth spoke to him; Mr. Yates told me the property came to sixteen or eighteen pounds; I thought it was a great deal of property for the poor man to lose; I staid there a good while; and when he told me he knew Mr. O'Brien, in the street, I went there to enquire into his character.</p>
               <p>Then at the time you was sent for to Mr. Yates, he knew you went there as Mr. Yates's friend? - Yes, I went there as such; the prisoner came back to my house when he was discharged from the magistrates, him and two or three more.</p>
               <p>Did you see him when he came back the second time? - Yes, the constable told me; I was the person that first acquainted him; and the prisoner was with two or three more in the coffee-room, eating a bit of cold meat; he surrendered directly.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when Mrs. Allen was first called upon to see what she knew of the prisoner? - I think to the best of my knowledge, she said, she believed that was the man that was in the house.</p>
               <p>What was the question put to her? - I declare I cannot positively tell you.</p>
               <p>Then tell me what she said? - That she believed him to be the person that was in the house; that was the word, to the best of my knowledge; I am almost confident that was the word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean speaking of Mrs. Allen, to say that that was the exact expression she used? - No.</p>
               <p>Was she not most positive, and repeatedly positive at that time, that he was the man? - She was afterwards; she said she believed he was the man; I cannot recollect what she said.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not she over and over again, say, in your hearing, that she was positive he was the man, and had not the least doubt about it? - No, Sir, she said, to the best of my opinion, the very words I have told.</p>
               <p>You mean to say that she did not say it? - She might say it unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body say that the prisoner said he had been at Laver's that Tuesday? - I believe it was him.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was the prisoner that said so? - Yes, I am positive to the best of my opinion; I cannot be positive whether it was him or the brother said it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090148"/>Did you hear any things about Sterling's wine-vaults, in the Hay-market; which they said he had been drunk at all day of the Tuesday? - That was mentioned that night at Mr. Yates's.</p>
               <p>Who said so? - I do not recollect I heard any body say he was there all day long; I recollect it was said he was there in the evening.</p>
               <p>Who did say what was said about Sterling's; do you recollect that? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that they waited two hours for Sterling? - I do not know that they waited at all for Sterling.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that he had drank there on the Tuesday? - I heard he was there much about six on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it business of a particular nature; I do not ask you what it was; any thing remarkable that would fix it in your memory? - I had a bill of exchange drawn upon me, which indeed, when he was taken up, it was very fresh in my memory, as I had the trouble of sending into the city to take it up.</p>
               <p>Was the business of a sort that when it was mentioned to you, you would be likely to recollect? - He had been very short of money, and he came for some; to ask me to lend him some.</p>

               <p>You are positive as to the time? - Yes; one circumstance of a letter, makes me positive as to the time; the circumstance of a letter which I gave to the general-post man, which a lady above stairs sent down by her daughter; and says she, do you take care not to be too late; I looked at the dial, and it was not fifteen minutes after six; and I suppose he had been three or four minutes before; he never was out of my presence, till we parted; nobody was with him.</p>
               <p>Did any body join company with you at Sterling's? - Yes; a Mr. Collins came in soon after.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are quite certain as to the day, as well as to the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nine or ten minutes after six? - Yes; I am sure it could not be earlier than that.</p>
               <p>Where is your dial? - In the office.</p>
               <p>What did you pay? - A penny.</p>
               <p>Pray, is the post-man so late as a quarter past six, in the Hay-market? - Yes; they never leave it till a quarter past six; that is the hour of leaving it.</p>
               <p>This was Tuesday, the 21st of July; how soon was you called upon afterwards, to recollect the fact? - The Monday following.</p>
               <p>Did you attend before the magistrate? - Yes; they did not examine me; I attended.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I am a clerk in that office where he called; the Dublin exchange company's office.</p>
               <p>An unlicenced lottery office? - It is not licenced at present; it had a licence last year.</p>
               <p>Why, it was an inconvenience for you to go out at six? - Not at all; I seldom stay there after five.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Newman call by appointment? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You happened to be kept there an hour and a quarter after your time? - I am often there after five, but I have no occasion to attend there after five.</p>
               <p>When you went to Sterling's, did you dine together? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any tea? - No; we had a pint of porter, which we did not drink; and then some punch.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Newman tell you where he had dined? - He told me he came from Mr. Price's; I did not ask him where he dined; we had nothing to eat; we did not sup together.</p>
               <p>Did he propose supping? - I do not recollect he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090150"/>What day of the month was it? - It was the 21st; the circumstance of the letter; the lady had very often asked me what time it would reach Dublin; and when Mr. Newman sent for me to the round-house, we staid so late, that I got pretty tipsy; I can only speak for myself; Mr. Newman had not called upon me for several months before; and I had not been in a publick-house for four years before.</p>
               <p>You had not seen him that morning at all? - No.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you he had been at Sterling's in the course of the day? - No.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you he got drunk there, and fell asleep there, in the course of the day? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Sterling at home? - I saw him there then; he might serve part of the punch; I do not know who I paid the reckoning to; I was so ill for two days after that, I could not be mistaken of the day; besides, the circumstance of that letter; the lady asking me what time it would arrive at Dublin; she asked me several times.</p>
               <p>Can you be quite certain that he had a green coat on that day? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>
               <p>What coat had he? - He had a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Had he any stick with him? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had he no stick with him that day? - I do not recollect he had.</p>
               <p>Do you believe he had, or he had not? - I believe he had not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Mr. Newman and Mr. Read, on the 21st of July? - I was, at Mr. Sterling's punch-house, in the Hay-market, at about twenty minutes after six; I think it was quite twenty minutes; the reason I have to give for it, was this, that going to the Haymarket theatre, the door was just opened; I went to the one shilling gallery, and paid my money; and asked what time it began? and they said, not till seven; I then went over to Sterling's punch-house, where I have frequently seen my friend, Mr. Reed; and there was Mr. Newman and Mr. Reed drinking; Mr. Newman said, Collins, how do you do? I was going to the Son-in-law; he replied, never mind the play, stay and drink some punch with us; in consequence of that, we replenished the bowl, and parted at ten in the Haymarket, each of us going home; I am sure of the day, and as to the time.</p>
               <p>How was Mr. Newman dressed that night? - As to the coat, I do not know; but I can swear to this, that he had no boots on; he had white stockings on; the Monday following, I met my friend, Mr. Reed; he informed me of the unhappy business of Mr. Newman; and I thought it necessary to take a note of the business, which I did at the very time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It does not signify.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I desire to see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I do not resist it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Newman? - Seven years, and upwards; and I never knew his character impeached or called in question before; I knew him equally with Mr. Reed; I knew them both at the same time.</p>
               <p>You became acquainted with them, probably at the same place; where was that? - I am not ashamed to say it was at the King's-bench prison; undoubtedly so.</p>
               <p>You were quite sure he had no boots on; how came you to think that was material? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You was out of breath to get to it? - I do not run so fast as that.</p>
               <p>How came you to mention the circumstance of a man's not having or having boots? - Because I thought it extremely material to the case; the gentleman asked me whether he had any boots on?</p>
               <p>No, he did not, but you knew he would; the favourite farce of the Son-in-law was to be performed that night? - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - A master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090151"/>taylor, at No. 20, King-street, St. James's-square.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Newman very sober when you went to Sterling's? - I am not a competent judge whether a man is drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Reed drunk or sober? - He might be for what I know.</p>
               <p>What do you think now? - I am not a competent judge.</p>
               <p>It is a little unlucky, I think, as you are a taylor, that you could not tell the colour of his coat; I should have thought if you had been a shoe-maker, the boots might have run in your head? - What business have I with the colour of a man's coat, when I do not make it.</p>
               <p>So, you never know the colour of a man's coat, without you make it? - I do not like to look at it; what business have I; upon my oath, I do not know what coloured coat he had on; I was in his company, from fifteen or twenty minutes after six, till ten; upwards of three hours, sitting at a table in a box, at a publick coffee-room or drinking-room.</p>
               <p>Then you walked on together down to the bottom of the Hay-market? - Yes; that I can do in half a minute.</p>
               <p>What made you swear that this man had no boots on, when you sit three hours in his company; and do not know the colour of his coat? - I can see a man's leg that has got a white stocking on; I took more particular notice of it, than of his coat.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether his shoes were buckled or tied? - No.</p>
               <p>I wonder at that; do not you recollect now, that they had ham and sallad for their supper at a quarter past nine? - Not while they were with me; I do positively swear they had nothing to eat in my company, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Now, when you went in together, you was not drunk? - I do not know that; perhaps I might be; upon my oath, I do not know whether I was drunk or sober; I do not know what we drank; I told you before, on my oath, that we had our first bowl, and it was replenished; but how often it was replenished, I do not know; we each paid our reckoning.</p>
               <p>How much did you pay? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of the King's-bench? - These seven years; I have been a man of character these seven years; I do not know what I paid for my reckoning.</p>
               <p>Can you guess within four or five shillings, recollect? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect within four or five shillings, what you paid? - No, Sir, I cannot; I do not think we drank so much a piece; I believe we paid two shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Newman or Reed appear to you to be drunk, when you quitted the house? - No, Sir, neither of them drunk.</p>
               <p>They appeared better for their liquor? - Yes, Sir, I believe they were better for their liquor; for the punch was very good; it is a noted house for good punch</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Newman a stick with him, now, as he was sitting in that careless manner? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You recollect your master being taken into custody? - I remember there was such a thing happened.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me where he had been the week before that; the Tuesday before that? - I think he had been confined in Chancery-lane; not the Tuesday before that, but the Tuesday week before that; he was discharged on the Wednesday; he returned to his own house, at Mrs. Williams's, in King's Road, Chelsea.</p>

               <p>When they came home, had they any supper afterwards? - No, Sir; they went to bed; they walked home.</p>

               <p>Did you observe anything particular in your master's manner that night? - No, Sir; he is not given to drinking; I never knew him above half a dozen times in liquor, since I have lived with him; he appeared to me, to be quite steady and sober.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes had he on? - A blue coat and metal buttons; I cannot call to mind whether he brought home his stick or not.</p>

             Fleming, Mr. Dempster, and several other gentlemen that knew him.</p>
               <p>Did you go out during any part of this transaction? - Only in the passage; and once in the street, only at the door; I suppose we were not gone more than a minute, or a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>What did you say, when you came back? - We were left in the room by ourselves; Mr. Booth told me, for my brother to make restitution of the property.</p>
               <p>My question to you is this; when you came back into the room, where there were several persons, whether you said anything; did you, or did you not, at any time, when you returned into the room, after an absence of some time, say anything where your brother had been on the Tuesday? - No, I did not; for I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Then, you are very positive that you did not say, you were very happy you had found out where he was that he went early to Sterling's punch-house; he drank freely; he got intoxicated; and he staid there till eight o'clock? - No, I did not say so.</p>
               <p>No part of the conversation; I wish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090154"/>not to hurry you, and I tell you fairly that more persons than one have sworn it; attend to the question, whether after the correction of the mistake about Laver's, you yourself did not say, I am very happy now I can state where he was, he was at Sterling's Punch-house, he went there in the morning, he drank freely, he got intoxicated, he fell asleep, he staid there till eight o'clock? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then all that was said in that conversasation, about Sterling's, was that he had been at Mr. Price's, and that he had been afterwards at Sterling's with Mr. Read? - Yes, that was all.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Burke saying, is Sterling coming then, Sir? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Burke that you had left a message, and expected him? - Me! by no means, it is not possible Sir.</p>
               <p>You did not do it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Burke continue there near two hours in expectation of Mr. Sterling's coming, in consequence of what you asserted? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Once more; I am very sorry; it is very far from my wish to intrap you, or to see you in an awkward situation; do me the Justice to believe I do this merely because it is my duty; I have no pleasure in distressing either the prisoner or you; but I must ask you whether in any part of the conversation you stated that your brother had been at Sterling's in the morning, and that he had drank freely, and got intoxicated, and fell asleep? - There was nothing said of his having been there in the morning, nothing at all to my knowledge; nothing by me; nothing by my brother, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>You say you observed Mr. Yates, and those persons following you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way were you walking, towards Kensington? - No, Sir, when we observed them we were coming out of Kensington Gardens, towards Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>Why? did not you turn after you saw them? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that after you and your brother saw these people following you, you did not turn about? - We did not turn about, excepting we might have turned about in Kensington Gardens.</p>
               <p>When you observed Mr. Yates, and these people following you, was not you walking from that entrance at Hyde Park Gate towards Kensington Palace; had not you just before that been walking towards the Palace? - I do not know, I turned round two or three times.</p>
               <p>Just before you went out of the Gardens, had not you been walking towards Kensington? - I will only swear to my recollection.</p>
               <p>What was there particular in these people following you? - I did not observe them so much in Kensington Gardens, as I did in Hyde Park; I had seen them in Kensington Gardens; my brother said, says he, I think these people are following us.</p>
               <p>And upon that you went out of the gardens? - No, Sir, not immediately; I do not suppose we staid five minutes; and I said upon my honor I believe they are following us; so I just stepped on the green, and they followed us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When this matter arose at Yates's, about your brother being at Price's and with Reed; did that come from him? - It did.</p>
               <p>The first you observed of these people, was when you had come out of Kensington Gardens? - Just coming out near the gate, nearest Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>After you had spoken to Yates or Yates to your brother, did you go faster than you had gone before? - Not a bit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg to call Mr. Burke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke called again.</p>
               <p>You have heard the question which I have repeated, more than once, to Mr. Newman? - I have; I am exceedingly sorry I am under the disagreeable necessity of contradicting him.</p>
               <p>Is the account you gave originally true? - Absolutely true; after the discovering the mistake of the time of being at Laver's, and his having immediately sent after Mr. Yates; the first I saw of it was, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090155"/>Reilly the Tavern-keeper with Mr. Newman the prisoner, who seemed then a vast deal more agitated; and so did this young gentleman, insomuch that I believe they cried; however, I then said, Mr. Newman, do not be so warm, recollect yourself; you have time enough to recollect where you was on Tuesday; and this gentleman, his brother, and the prisoner then consulted together, where he had spent the day on Tuesday; they talked of where they had spent the day on Monday; we mentioned Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and I believe Saturday; this was between themselves; but did not seem to fix where they were on Tuesday, or how Tuesday was passed; and it was, I believe, agreed between them, that this gentleman should go out to bring word; he took his hat, and I stopped in the room, he was gone half an hour, if not more; I am sure he was gone about that time; in the time, while young Mr. Newman was gone, I again went into the passage to consult with Mr. Booth, further about the matter; I spent some time in conversation with Mr. Booth, in the passage, while Mr. Newman was gone; I told him that Mr. Newman, the brother to the prisoner, was gone to bring a certain account; I afterwards returned into the parlour, and some very immaterial conversation passed between the prisoner and myself; I sat down by the table, and this gentleman came in, took off his hat, put it on the table, sat down by the table, and made use of these words, I can now, to a certainty, account where my brother was on Tuesday, or where you was on Tuesday; I cannot say whether it was you or my brother; I said I should be exceedingly happy to know that; and when the gentleman sat himself down, he said his brother early on the day of Tuesday, he did not say morning or evening, went to Sterling's wine-vaults, in the Hay-market, drank pretty freely, got intoxicated, fell asleep, and staid there till late in the evening; I then said, Sir, is Mr. Sterling coming forward to satisfy me of that fact; the witness Newman did not say immediately, that he was immediately coming; but I understood him, and I am sure he was heard, that he had left word with Mr. Sterling's people to send him; and he expected them to send him as soon as he came in; I understood him clearly that he had been to Mr. Sterling's; he said he had left word for Mr. Sterling to come, as soon as he returned; I then said I should be very happy to attend them till Mr. Sterling came, because I should be exceedingly happy to see the point cleared up.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that he said he went there early in the day, and staid there late in the evening. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. I could not say it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Does your memory serve you to say so? - I cannot recollect that I said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you deny the whole conversation? - Possibly my recollection may be so bad that I do not remember it; I am sure I did not go to Sterling's; I could not say that I had been to Sterling.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to swear that you did not take your hat and go out and stay half an hour? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never went any where, but where Mr. Booth accompanied you? - I will not say, only to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price has told us that on Sunday evening, a message was carried to his house; did not you carry that message? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear positively that the Sunday evening, while your brother was at Mr. Yates's, you did not go to Mr. Price's: will you swear you did not come back and express yourself in the manner Mr. Burke has stated? - Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. He qualifies that with the word recollection, which he seems to me to have sworn positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean now, Sir, to say, that you never was absent from that house twenty minutes during the time your brother was there? - I do not recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not at Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090156"/>Price's in Northumberland-street? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not say that you left a message for Sterling, and that you expected him? - I do not recollect saying any such thing; I could almost swear it; I think I did not say it; I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is no other than the proof of this young man's memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I think it will be right to call some of the other witnesses to this fact, to contradict this young man, and to confront him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Yates called.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what Burke has stated? - He was gone out about twenty minutes, when he came back, he laid down his hat on the table, and said to his brother; I am happy, I recollect, now I have found out where you was, you was at Sterling's wine-vaults in the morning, and got drunk, and continued there till night.</p>
               <p>What more was said about that? - He said no more upon that head, but he said Mr. Sterling was coming, he was not at home; he had left word for Sterling, who was not at home, but who would come as soon as he came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have heard the brother say before, that he himself had past the evening with Mr. Price and Mr. Reed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then this account of this brother, that young man would contradict that? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>If you had heard from Newman himself, that he had passed the Tuesday evening with Mr. Price and Mr. Reed; this would contradict that account! - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>He said he was happy he had found out where his brother was on the Tuesday night? - I was in the parlour when the brother came in; he seemed to be very much concerned, and cried; he seemed to be very much agitated when he went out, but not so much when he came in.</p>

               <p>Some time in July I was drinking with a young man; there came a man and asked the landlord of the house to buy a table, and then he applied to me, and I gave him fifteen shillings and a pot of beer for it; he asked eighteen shillings for it.</p>

               <p>I went to Long-acre about some business, in June; I was coming home and two young men tapped at a window; and I went in and drank two glasses of cyder, It was at Southampton-buildings; the prisoner was there; I knew him before, and there was a man came in with a table; I cannot recollect what kind of table, it was a kind of mahogany; I am not sure the number of shillings he gave him for it; but he gave some shillings and took the table, and said he would send a man for it, for his arm was tied up; I knew the prisoner at that time; I lived in a house with his father in Union-court.</p>
               <p>Did you never live in a house with this man? - No, never was at his house; he sent for me two or three days ago; the prisoner never slept in his father's house that I know of.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning, after this copper was lost, I was on the causeway; and I saw Howard there; I am positive of it: it was about ten in the morning: the prisoners were both there; I think I saw Hopkins in the barge: there were a great many people there; and he was relating that he had lost his copper; and I said to him, do you think you should know any of the people? he began in his manner, as I do,</p>
               <p>"God d - n, - no - cannot know them - quite dark - rowed away directly;" I am sure Netherhood was there at that time; and I saw Hopkins go into his barge, and stow his copper in the presence of the old man; he said he knew nothing of the people; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - A waterman, and ply at the stairs.</p>

               <p>I am a sorter of letters at the post-office; the Lampetre bag of the 18th of July last arrived at London the 20th; I opened the bag, I found a money letter in it, and this letter bill; the deputy post-master of Lampetre had put the superscription of the letter on this bill; I took notice of the letter by the weight only; it appeared to me to have money in it, and I should suppose gold; I delivered the letter to the clerk of the money book, Mr. Pippard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray when you took this letter into your hand, you say by the weight of it you supposed it contained money; might not any thing else besides money be in it? - Possibly some other substance might; I judged from its weight it was gold, and being minuted as gold by the post-master-general, in the country as containing money, I concluded it was money.</p>
               <p>Was the letter sealed? - I believe so; I have no doubt but it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you concluded it to be gold, from the weight and description of the bill? - Certainly; and it appeared to me to be compact, and in the usual form of money letters.</p>

               <p>I remember, on the morning of the 20th of July, receiving a money letter from Mr. Pippard; I signed the book; it is the custom of the office; I do not recollect the direction; it appears by the entry, to Mr. Hutchins, Bell Court, Grays-inn-lane, Holborn; the name Lovatt, in the column of receiver, is my writing; I delivered the letter to Mr. Girling; it was delivered to me as a money letter; it appeared by the weight to be a money letter; and I believed it to be so; it was sealed, and had not been opened to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver it to Girling as a money letter? - I did, I desired him to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Was it at that time in the same condition that you received it from Mr. Pippard? - It was.</p>
               <p>When did you give it Girling? - In the course of two minutes after I received it from Mr. Pippard.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you deliver it to Girling? - For Girling to deliver it to the person it was directed to; Girling was a letter carrier of that district.</p>
               <p>Court. This was at the general post-office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All this was done in the course of a few minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is, it comes from Mr. Devereux to Mr. Pippard, and from Mr. Pippard to you, then you deliver these letters, that are money letters, to the carriers that take them to the several districts; do you recollect any particular circumstance that makes you remember desiring him to take care of that particular letter? - I remember his telling me he would be careful of the letter and deliver it.</p>
               <p>Were there any other money letters at the same time? - I had no other.</p>
               <p>How comes it you happen to recollect this particular letter? - As being very careful of our employ; I desired him to be as careful.</p>
               <p>Do you do that with all the money letters you receive? - I generally do.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose you did it with that particular letter, from that general practice, or do you remember particularly, that you gave these directions with that particular letter? - Particularly.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember? - I remember it as a circumstance to be very true.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the direction of the letter? - No, I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Why do you think you gave particular directions with that letter? - That he might be careful to deliver it, and bring back a receipt for it, as it was not in my own delivery; I desired him to be particular in the delivery of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lovatt, I think I heard you say you did not recollect any other money letter, or that there were no other that morning; you know it was not your place to inspect into these cases, therefore you cannot say whether there were or not? - There was no other that I had signed for your delivery; I can say nothing to the others.</p>

               <p>Did he call upon you any time in July? - The 25th of July he called; I believe so, as nigh as I can guess, at my apartment.</p>
               <p>What was his business in calling upon you? - He enquired for me of a neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090166"/>down stairs; I came down; he asked me if my name was Hutchins; I asked him to come up stairs; when he came in he told me there was a letter in the post office for me, I am certain of the words; I said what is the matter you have not brought that letter to me? he said, Mr. Hutchin's the next time I come I will bring you the letter; but I never saw him till I went to the post office the next Monday, this was on the Wednesday or Thursday; I enquired for the prisoner, and he came to me; I said to him, my friend, where is my letter; says he, I have not got it yet, but I will come to you in the evening; I never saw his face till I came into Bow-street; it was the 12th of August when I was sent for to go there; I received a letter on the 12th of August, from Mrs. Lloyd, informing me that three pounds three shillings had been sent to me; upon that I went to the post-office, to enquire for the letter I had lost, and the gentlemen at the post-office promised to see me righted; and they directed me to go to Bow-street; there I saw the prisoner; I know he is the man that spoke to me before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The letter was delivered into my care on the 20th, as near as I can recollect; I wish to ask him whether he is positive to the 25th, that I first went to him or not? - It was the 25th of July or the 26th; it was on the Thursday, though I believe at night.</p>
               <p>Court. Might it not be the 20th for any thing you know? - I am sure it was not, because I always keep an almanack in my room.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure as to the day of the week? - I believe it was on the Wednesday or the Thursday the 25th.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to stand there and say positively, on your memory, that it was on any particular day? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Then why did you say just now it was on the Thursday the 25th? - I am sure it was on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was it? - Why the 25th, I believe.</p>
               <p>You will not venture to speak to the day of the month, only the day of the week? - The letter was dated the 18th of July, that was on a Saturday; I went the Monday following; the prisoner came to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I had lost the letter? - He told me he had lost the letter out of his pocket; that was the second time I saw him, that he said so.</p>
               <p>Did not I ask you to write to your friends, when I told you I had lost the letter? - Yes; he asked me whether I had written to my friends or not; and I told him I had sent a letter away.</p>
               <p>Court. When was that? - That was the second time that he came to me; I told him I had written a letter to my friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a person with me, when I came to you? - Yes, a little man.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you as well as me, to write to your friends? - I never heard him.</p>
               <p>Did not you, before a witness, after I had said I had lost the letter, agree on the receipt of an answer to that letter, to take to the amount of whatever was contained in the answer from me, as I had lost it? - I thought I should hurt myself by taking any money.</p>
               <p>The question repeated. - Yes, he did say so; but then, when I received the account of what was in the letter, I went to the post-office; and on enquiring for him, I heard he was in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that he told you he would pay you the money that was in that letter, when you knew what it was? - It was some time in July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the person with me did not offer payment as well as myself? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Did not I leave him my address? - No; he gave me a bit of a direction with his name.</p>
               <p>Court. But you could find him out at the post-office? - Not by that paper.</p>

               <p>Did he say anything more than that? - He said there was a letter at the post-office for me; that was all; and I asked him what was the matter he had not brought it? and he told me he would bring it the next time he came that way; he said no more at that time.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at that time, that it was a money letter, or contained money? - No; the second time, he told me he would look for the letter, and bring it to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am inspector of the letters at the general post-office; I know the prisoner; on the 20th of July, it was his duty to take letters, and deliver them the same day he received them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, may I be permitted to call some persons respecting my character.</p>
               <p>Court. I will tell you; it is for you to make the best defence you can; and you are at liberty to call any witnesses that you think fit, either to disprove any of the facts that have been proved, or to prove any other facts that may explain those facts; or any thing that you think advantageous to your defence; and besides that, you may call any witnesses to your character; and before you call them, you may, if you think fit, address the Jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, the letter was delivered into my care; and according to my usual custom with many letters, I put it into a book which I kept for the purpose; between the post-office and Mr. Hutchins's house, I missed this letter out of my pocket, near Furnival's-inn, where I began my delivery of letters; I went to a friend of mine, and asked him what I should do in the case; whether first to make application to the post-office, or to the person that it was directed to; I had a written receipt from the post-office, in my pocket at the time, which directed me to go to the prosecutor; my friend advised me to go first to the prosecutor, and advise him to write to his friends, whom he supposed might send a letter containing cash; as I supposed by the weight, it did; I went to the prosecutor, and asked him if he expected a letter that day from Wales? he answered no, he did not; but that he had a relation who very probably might send him one; he had a daughter in the country; the person who was with me, said, he had heard me say I had a letter, but I had unfortunately lost it with some other papers, of no value, but to myself; and I immediately begged of him to write to this daughter, whom he supposed might send to him; and whatever it contained, be it what it would, I was very willing to make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090168"/>him any ample recompence; I desired him not to let the post-office know; the person with me told him, if he would not take my word for the payment, he would be answerable for it; the prosecutor said, all he desired, was to the amount it contained; I immediately wrote him my address on a piece of paper; and told him as soon as he received an answer to his letter, I would immediately wait on him with the money; he agreed to that, and said he was perfectly satisfied; I called several times afterwards, two or three times; I cannot recollect the particular times; but he was not in the way; I asked whether he had received any answer; there was a man in the shop who could not tell; I saw him no more, till I saw him at Bow-street; when I was apprehended on the other matter, he then denied what he had said before; and almost denied my being with him at all; I have nothing further to say; and I submit myself intirely to your consideration.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>(Hutchins returned without the paper, not being able to find it.)</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 27th of August, I was in his house at work, in the shop which communicates with the house by two doors; one into the parlour, and one into the passage; my master is a gun-smith; and as I was at work, I saw two young men come in at the street door; I thought they had been going into the house about business, to some of the lodgers; but the gentlewoman over the way giving an alarm, I came out of the shop directly, and saw the two prisoners coming down stairs with bundles in their hands; when they came a little nearer to me, I seized the prisoner Williams by the collar; he dropped one of the bundles he had in his left hand, and made his escape; I am quite sure I saw him drop it; I pursued him about twenty rood, hallooing to stop him; and a gentleman put his foot, and threw him down; then I came up, seized him by the collar, and desired the gentleman to assist me; I did not see the other prisoner taken; I never saw either of them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you be positively certain these are the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure the prisoner Davis was the other man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Williams ever out of your sight? - Not half a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. As there are lodgers, they let themselves in and out, I suppose, by the same door that these people went in at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That door is occasionally left open? - It was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>You was minding your work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know it was fastened in any way? - I heard the latch shove up.</p>
               <p>But whether it was fastened, you cannot positively swear, to your knowledge? - No.</p>

               <p>On the 27th of August last, I was at work in Neale's yard; I heard the cry of stop thief; and I saw one of the prisoners coming very fast, and I chucked up his heels, and collared him; then this young man came and said he had robbed his master's house; that was immediately after I took him; going to Litchfield-street, I took these keys out of his pocket (produces a large bunch of keys); I had seen him before; I know him now.</p>

I said, I will follow you, go where you will, to see what you have in the bundle; and he turned back towards Turnham-green again; and I turned with him; and when he came into the middle of the field, he threw down the two bundles, and said, you may have the bundles, if you will let me go about my business; and I took him by the collar; and he threw himself back, to get away from me; and drew himself clean out of his coat, and ran away; and I after him; I catched him at some distance, and brought him back, and put his coat on again; and he went down on his knees, and begged and prayed to me; and said he had a wife and five children; and he said, should I either hang or trouble him, what was to become of his family; then I secured him, and took him to Acton; and took the bundle; the constable has had it every since.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had nothing to do, being vacation; I went to see the soldiers; and came out with the rest of the people; I might be pushed against my prosecutor; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought a bit of lead to me on the 21st of August, about eight or nine in the morning; he asked me to buy it; he said he had one hundred and a quarter more; and said, he had had it by him six months; there was eleven pound of it; I gave him thirteen-pence halfpenny for it; here is the lead.</p>

               <p>I only produce the lead; I did try to compare it, but could not find it would fit any part of the gutter; it is milled lead, the same as the other.</p>
               <p>Court to Buck. Did you see the prisoner upon the premises? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Thurston. I saw the prisoner upon the premises, with his head and shoulders out of the window, upon the gutter; says I, you villain, this is the hundred and a quarter of lead I was to have had; but I went to Mr. Buck and shewed him the man, I supposed had stole the lead; upon searching the house we found this lead beat up together; it had been cut with a saw.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I know Mr. Clay from this circumstance, my father keeps a wharf for drawing timber and deals; on the 8th of July Mr. Blake the prisoner applied for a carriage to draw some timber from our wharf, on the following flood; I arose between five and six in the morning; I saw the timber on the dock; while I was setting the people to work Mr. Blake came on the wharf, and told me it was the timber, and requested me to draw it; I ordered it to be loaded; he asked me the expence; I told him I could not inform him, as we draw by the load; I charged him seven and sixpence, and asked him where it was to be drawn; he said, to Thomas-street, Tottenham-court-road; he paid for it, and I sent the carriage off; on the 9th Mr. Clay came on our wharf, and enquired after the timber; I informed him where it was; I went with him to Thomas-street; I saw the timber lay there; I knew it again immediately; I shewed it to him; I know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How often did Mr. Blake attend at the magistrates with you, on this subject? - I believe it was twice.</p>
               <p>Was it not oftener? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Did he attend in custody, or voluntarily? - Voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Did you take any part with him to discover a person of the name of Smith? - I did.</p>
               <p>Smith was mentioned by him as the person that sold the timber to him? - He was so.</p>
               <p>When you saw them with Blake, they were not cut up, or altered, but in the same state? - Yes, they were laying in the open street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Blake has now surrendered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he take pains, like an honest man who wished to find that person Smith? In answer to that, I am of opinion he did take infinite pains; Blake called on me once or twice; at another time he met me in St. Martin's-lane, he asked my advice; says he, I am taking pains night and day to find the man; could you direct me to find him; why, says I, advertising him will make him keep out of the way; if you can go down below; I never saw him otherwise, but very anxious on the business; Morgan was the waterman who towed these deals; I never saw him before I saw him at the justice's; I am told he is the waterman; I saw Morgan at Sir Sampson's; and he was at liberty to go away; that was the first examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any ground upon which you can form any belief, as to the time, since you went before the magistrate? - Between the 10th and 13th of July.</p>
               <p>

            ; on Wednesday the 8th of July, I saw the timber all very safe; there were four floats; it was in Church-walk, Rotherhithe; it was late in the evening, between eight and nine; I did not miss them, till I received information, which was the next day, in the afternoon; when I had information, I went down and looked myself, and I saw they had been stolen, from the rope being cut that fastened them; we went to Thomas street, and found it there; it was my timber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe afterwards this man, Blake, attended several times at Bow-street? - Two or three times.</p>
               <p>He came voluntarily? - I will tell you how far; he was not in custody; but I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090185"/>a warrant out, and had taken some pains.</p>
               <p>At last he was admitted to bail, and has surrendered here; and I believe from first to last, he told you he had purchased this timber, of a man, whose name was Smith? - He did.</p>
               <p>I believe the other prisoner, Morgan, attended, and confirmed that story? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was not Morgan discharged at the very first? - I do not know that he ever was taken up; at least it was a very considerable time before he was taken up; two months, at least.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Blake was bound over, not as the receiver, but as the thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not this man take a great deal of fair pains to examine Smith? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. This man came at the regular time of the tide, with his float? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is Morgan? - He is a waterman, and his father is a pilot; I never heard any thing, before this, against his character.</p>
               <p>Did he continue in his business, publickly working in the Thames, from the time he was in Bow-street? - I have no doubt but he did; I had not an opportunity of seeing him.</p>
               <p>He came to the same wharf in the afternoon? - I believe he did; he was employed as the waterman, towing; otherwise they would have taken him into custody.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the last witness; on Wednesday, the 26th of August last, between three and four, the prisoner in company with two other women, came into the shop, and desired to look at some prints for a gown and coat; I was at that time serving the next witness, and a relation of hers in the lower part of the shop; I left them to go to the prisoner; and the other two in the middle of the shop; and went with them to the further and narrow part of the shop; and took a considerable number of prints out of the shop; while I was doing that, a very dirty man came in, and took hold of a silk in the window; I immediately got over the counter to speak to him; he did not speak to either of the women; I turned my back to the women; after he had handled the silk, he said it was too thin for a waistcoat, and went away; I returned behind the counter, and the women found fault, and took more pieces out of the window of themselves; then one of them said they would bring a pattern; I do not know which it was said so; on that, they went out of the shop; I accompanied them to the door; and observed the prisoner had something very bulky under her petticoats, as she walked very bad; the next witness came to me, and said he was certain the prisoner had something; I followed the women, and desired the prisoner to walk into the shop again, which she did; and in the space where the flap turns back to admit us behind the counter, she dropped this piece of print; I saw her drop it; I detained her, and sent for one of the Bow-street runners; she begged pardon, and offered to do any thing for me she could, if I would let her go; and affected to cry very much; she was taken away.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this? - Thirty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>Is it printed cotton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it your master's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Could not you form any judgment at all, when these women were in the shop, at what time she took it? - I conceive she took it when the man was in the shop; I had no suspicion she had any thing, till I saw the bulk before her.</p>

               <p>I am eleven years old.</p>
               <p>Can you say your catechism? - Not exactly.</p>
               <p>Do you know you must swear true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What will be done to you if you swear false? - Go to the naughty man.</p>
               <p>Do you know that you are liable to be punished here in a Court of Justice, if you swear false? - No.</p>
               <p>But do you think if I should tell you you are liable to be punished here, if you swear any thing that is false, that you would? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Sworn. I know the prisoner, his name is Mr. Noble; I was in the room when my mother was ill in bed; the prisoner came there, it was on a Monday, the 3d of August, about half after twelve in the day; I was in the room when Mr. Noble came in; my mother was in bed just before he came in; my mother was asking me what it was o'clock, I said it wanted but five minutes to twelve; I looked at the watch, which was hanging at the side of the fire place; I can tell what it is o'clock when I look.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that clock? - It wants two minutes to twelve.</p>
               <p>Look again; (put her on the table)? - It wants six minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at my watch? - It wants a quarter.</p>
               <p>Court. Wrong in every instance.</p>
               <p>The prisoner knocked at the door; he had a great stick, thicker than my arm, and three horns at the top of it, I opened it; my mother told me to open it; she asked me who it was? I said, Mr. Noble; she told me to tell him to come in, and he came in; and he said, O Christ Mrs. Knight, what a shocking situation you are in; and he asked my mother if she would have any peppermint; and my mother said, she could not touch nothing, if it was ever so; and he said, ever so many wicked words to her, that she should have some, and so he insisted upon it; and so I went and fetched a cream jug out of the closet; and he gave me some money, one shilling, and told me to get a quartern of peppermint; I was not two minutes gone, for I had heard he was so very wicked a man; I was afraid he would kill my mother, or do something wrong.</p>
               <p>If you was afraid he would kill your mother, you could not have prevented him? - No, but I was not sure; when I came back he asked me if there was not a man waiting for him; I said, I did not see any body; he said he expected a man, for he was going to Hampstead the next day to do a job; then he said, there was a man waiting at the corner for him; then directly as he drank the peppermint, he went away; and directly as he was gone my mother told me to run and make an alarm, because he had taken my daddy's watch; and I did not know what an alarm meant, and I ran after him; I did not make an alarm; my mammy told me when I came back what an alarm is; so that I know now; I ran up the fields towards Hampstead; my mother lives No. 2,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090191"/>Cleveland-street, at the top of the rope walk, between London-street and Clipstone-street; it is near the fields; Mr. Strickland and Mr. Howison live next door; their houses join ours; it is a row with ten houses on one side; I was afraid my mother did not want people to know of it, because I thought she did not want my father to know of it; I ran after him to ask him to give me the watch; I told nobody; he never used my mother ill that I know of; I do not know that they ever had any quarrel, or my father and him; It was a large silver watch, with a solid silver trinket, with a seal in it; there was one silver seal, with a red stone in it, and some flower; there was a little cradle, a trinket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came in to look at some breast buckles, on the 25th of July, about four in the afternoon; I shewed him some breast buckles for half an hour, and he said he did not like any of them; and he gave me half a crown, to take two pence for my trouble, which I did; and I went up stairs for the change, and gave it him; and then when I come to put the breast buckles away, I missed one; I knew what buckle it was; it was a remarkable little garnet stone buckle; I put them on the counter, and took them away on a table, on the side of the counter; I am not quite punctual that it was there, when I shewed him the buckles; I challenged the prisoner with it before he went out of the shop; he denied it; I sent up for my master, and then the prisoner produced the breast buckle, and gave it me; and he said, I gave it him with the change; but I did not; my master gave me the change into my hand, and I gave it immediately into his.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I came down stairs the last witness had the breast buckle in his hand, and he said it was given him by the prisoner, whom he taxed with stealing it; I sent for a constable, who searched him; the prisoner had an apron on, and these small pair of shoes were taken out of his breeches; they are mine; I lost such a pair; I know them by the mark within side, a seven and a two; nine pair had been brought in five minutes before, and there were but eight.</p>

               <p>I had been down to Woolwich after a ship, and coming home (I live at Edmonton) I happened to see some breast buckles in this man's window laying for sale; I went in and asked him the price of a silver breast buckle; he said one was eighteen-pence and one was one shilling; I offered him fifteen-pence for one; he said he could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090192"/>take it; he went and asked his master, and he came down and said no; he asked me eighteen-pence for the buckle; he called his master, and said he had lost a garnet breast buckle; and I picked it up from the ground and gave it him; the shoes lay the corner of the counter; and as I was unloosing myself, the shoes dropt right down into my breeches.</p>

             on the same condition, which he refusing, the Court addressed him as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner at the bar, I think it my duty to state to you the very perilous situation in which you now stand; you have been convicted of an offence, for which, by the laws of your country, you have forfeited your life; but by the indulgence of a very kind sovereign, that life has been spared, to give you an opportunity of becoming a better man, in a different situation. I will, for one moment, throw aside the character of the Judge, for the Judge should, in his private capacity, be a friend to the unfortunate; at present, I address you, therefore, not as a Judge, but as a friend to an unfortunate man; and recommend it to you most sincerely, not to throw away that life which you have now an opportunity of saving. Having given you that advice as a friend to a man in a most lamenable situation, I shall now resume the character of the Judge; and tell you, that the administration of the justice of this country will not be sported with by men of your description; and if you do not accept the terms of the king's pardon, I shall order you for immediate execution; having given you this fair notice, I leave you to decide for yourself; but that decision must be made now, because you will not exist perhaps two days; perhaps not one, after your refusal.</p>
               <p>(The question asked.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Death is more welcome to me than this pardon.</p>
               <p>Will you accept it? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Court. Take him back to the condemned cells, and I shall sign a warrant of execution, as soon as I settle with the sheriffs, to prepare for that purpose.</p>

Previous to my trial, my prosecutor was proved to have been in a madhouse at Bethnal-green; and two days afterwards, he snatched his child newly born, and had liked to have dashed his brains out; and he was then sent to Bedlam; his two brothers are there now: and from the improbability of the robbery, and the circumstances attending it, I am sure your lordship will be convinced that me and

I appeal to heaven, that I am as innocent of the charge laid against me, as your lordship; and so is the man convicted with me; and the circumstances attending my prosecutor, has induced me thus to appeal, if possible, that my sentence may be taken into consideration; I am sensible of his majesty's mercy; and certain I am, was my case known to him, he would extend a further mercy towards me; the stewards of Bedlam hospital will testify that our prosecutor was there, and his two brothers were there; Mr. Bowman, of a private madhouse, proved in this court, he was at his house; I have undergone a great deal during my three years confinement; but I do not mean to refuse my sentence, because I know I should offend God; I have imbibed these notions of christianity from my parents, which I should be sorry to deviate from; and I am sure, if my case was known to my gracious sovereign, he would look upon me with an eye of compassion. My lord, what I have said, you will find to be perfectly true.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I think I ought to suffer as a man; I am very sorry I must refuse it.</p>
               <p>Court. I need not repeat to you, what has been repeated to others before; but yet, seeing the dreadful situation in which you stand; I shall observe to you, that you certainly will not be in a situation to appear before your maker, with the aggravated offence of being your own executioner; to go into the other world by the means you now propose to yourself; and it will be too late to accept this offer afterwards; you will be immediately ordered to the condemned cell; and as soon as the execution can be prepared by the sheriffs, a warrant will be signed, and you will suffer death? - I accept it.</p>

               <p>Court. Prisoners, I have sent for you in hopes that the example of the other prisoners, who have been brought up for their sentence, and received the King's pardon, might induce you to spare your own lives; I think it my duty now to state to you, that the Sessions will in a very few moments be closed upon you; when the Sessions is closed you will be ordered for immediate execution; and it will be too late for you to change your mind on this dreadful subject; I have only therefore to recommend to you, once more, to think of your situation, which to you must be sudden destruction, if you do not accept of the terms of the King's pardon; you can have no other chance of saving your lives.</p>
               <p>The three prisoners refused, and were ordered to the cells.</p>

                  <p>Prisoner at the bar, I think it my duty to state to you the very perilous situation in which you now stand; you have been convicted of an offence, for which, by the laws of your country, you have forfeited your life; but by the indulgence of a very kind sovereign, that life has been spared, to give you an opportunity of becoming a better man, in a different situation. I will, for one moment, throw aside the character of the Judge, for the Judge should, in his private capacity, be a friend to the unfortunate; at present, I address you, therefore, not as a Judge, but as a friend to an unfortunate man; and recommend it to you most sincerely, not to throw away that life which you have now an opportunity of saving. Having given you that advice as a friend to a man in a most lamenable situation, I shall now resume the character of the Judge; and tell you, that the administration of the justice of this country will not be sported with by men of your description; and if you do not accept the terms of the king's pardon, I shall order you for immediate execution; having given you this fair notice, I leave you to decide for yourself; but that decision must be made now, because you will not exist perhaps two days; perhaps not one, after your refusal.</p>
                  <p>(The question asked.)</p>
                  <p>Prisoner. Death is more welcome to me than this pardon.</p>
                  <p>Will you accept it? - I will not.</p>
                  <p>Court. Take him back to the condemned cells, and I shall sign a warrant of execution, as soon as I settle with the sheriffs, to prepare for that purpose.</p>

               . My lord, I beg a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090195"/>minutes indulgence, to address myself to the Court; I do not mean to refuse my sentence, in my unhappy situation, which is yet different from my unhappy fellow sufferers. Previous to my trial, my prosecutor was proved to have been in a madhouse at Bethnal-green; and two days afterwards, he snatched his child newly born, and had liked to have dashed his brains out; and he was then sent to Bedlam; his two brothers are there now: and from the improbability of the robbery, and the circumstances attending it, I am sure your lordship will be convinced that me and

I appeal to heaven, that I am as innocent of the charge laid against me, as your lordship; and so is the man convicted with me; and the circumstances attending my prosecutor, has induced me thus to appeal, if possible, that my sentence may be taken into consideration; I am sensible of his majesty's mercy; and certain I am, was my case known to him, he would extend a further mercy towards me; the stewards of Bedlam hospital will testify that our prosecutor was there, and his two brothers were there; Mr. Bowman, of a private madhouse, proved in this court, he was at his house; I have undergone a great deal during my three years confinement; but I do not mean to refuse my sentence, because I know I should offend God; I have imbibed these notions of christianity from my parents, which I should be sorry to deviate from; and I am sure, if my case was known to my gracious sovereign, he would look upon me with an eye of compassion. My lord, what I have said, you will find to be perfectly true.</p>
                  <p>Court. Prisoner, so far, you certainly have done right in accepting the king's pardon; that sort of conduct will give you a chance; if upon the circumstances of your case, there is any hope for mercy at all, (for no man who refuses the king's pardon, and treats it with contempt, can expect after that, to receive any favour from the crown; the best advice I can give you, is to have these circumstances represented to his majesty, as it is to him alone you must make application.</p>

               . I wish to state to your lordship a word or two; I stand here convicted of a robbery; I believe, the strict text of the law in every sense, has prohibited, and forbid in every court of justice, that no lunatick whatever should be permitted to give evidence to affect any fellow subject's life; but mine was affected; I certainly have lost my liberty for near three years, for an offence that I have not been guilty of; I can testify before God, with a clear conscience, that I know nothing of that case whatever; nor the man that has last spoke; but the accusation proceeded from a rancour and malice raised in this prosecutor's mind, which I hope was from an act of insanity; I trust so; but notwithstanding the circumstance stated by Mr. Bowman, who proved to the Court, that he had been at his house for insanity;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090196"/>yet no respect was paid to Mr. Bowman's testimony; and four days after our conviction, his wife was brought to bed; and he dragged the child from Goldsmith-street, Gough-square; this is a truth to every body's knowledge; he dragged it into the Fleet-market in the skirt of his coat; and was going to throw it into the Thames. We did not ought to have suffered an hour's imprisonment on such a man's account; and I trust our hard case will be a warning to courts of justice, and more especially to the learned judges, never more to permit madmen to affect the lives and properties of his majesty's subjects; but I <rs id="s17890909-1-punish787" type="punishmentDescription">

               ; I was intirely innocent; the late recorder, then in his charge to the jury, told them, he thought it was not law, to convict a man without any corroborating circumstance; there was none in my case; as such, I think I should not accept it.</p>
                  <p>Court. If you wish to make any application, you must make it elsewhere; but it is totally incompetent to alledge that here.</p>
                  <p>Prisoner. I think I ought to suffer as a man; I am very sorry I must refuse it.</p>
                  <p>Court. I need not repeat to you, what has been repeated to others before; but yet, seeing the dreadful situation in which you stand; I shall observe to you, that you certainly will not be in a situation to appear before your maker, with the aggravated offence of being your own executioner; to go into the other world by the means you now propose to yourself; and it will be too late to accept this offer afterwards; you will be immediately ordered to the condemned cell; and as soon as the execution can be prepared by the sheriffs, a warrant will be signed, and you will suffer death? - I accept it.</p>

                  <p>Court. Prisoners, I have sent for you in hopes that the example of the other prisoners, who have been brought up for their sentence, and received the King's pardon, might induce you to spare your own lives; I think it my duty now to state to you, that the Sessions will in a very few moments be closed upon you; when the Sessions is closed you will be ordered for immediate execution; and it will be too late for you to change your mind on this dreadful subject; I have only therefore to recommend to you, once more, to think of your situation, which to you must be sudden destruction, if you do not accept of the terms of the King's pardon; you can have no other chance of saving your lives.</p>
                  <p>The three prisoners refused, and were ordered to the cells.</p>
