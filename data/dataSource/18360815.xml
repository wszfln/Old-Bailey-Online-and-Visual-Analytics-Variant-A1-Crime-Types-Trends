               <p>words—he said, "B----y into you, I will have your life, it is no use your thinking of any thing else, for I will have it"—I fell once from the blows he hit me with the brook-stick—I got up again, and he hit me again with the broom, and after he had done that, he put his two thumbs to my throat, and squeezed them as hard as he could to my throat, against the front of my neck, in the middle of my neck—he then left go, and put a rope of my neck, which was in the house—it was his garden rope—it was on the drawers, he reached it from the drawers—it was nearly as thick as my arm—it was a good thickness—he put it round my neck, and made a loop knot, and said he would draw it tight, but he did not, for I put my two hands to prevent its tightening, and he swung me with the rope against the door, and kicked me on the ribs—he then directly up with the hatchet, threw it across his shoulder and said, "I will have your b----y life, as I have split this table"—the table was split in halves—he got the hatchet from against the door where it always stands—he did not touch me with it—he put it down and went to the door—he said, "Ten b----y policemen shall not hinder me, for I will have your life, "and while he was gone to the door I got our of the little window, over the pales, out of the back gate, and met the policeman on his duty—I made complaint to him—he was very near the house when I got out of the back-gate—I begged of him to take me to the station-house, and after leaving me at the station-house, he went and came back with the prisoner in about half an hour—a surgeon dressed my wounds, at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in, on Wednesday, the 20th of July, to see the prosecutrix, at near twelve o'clock at night, at the station-house—she had on the clothes produced when I saw her—I examined her, and found a wound in the head, in the upper and back part of the head—it was very severe contused, lacerated wound—it was so irregular in its shape there is scarcely any applying dimen<lb/>sions to it—it was very severe, on account of its being so much lacerated—it was not a clean cut, but a lacerated, contused wound, with many angles in it, and went to the bone—there was another slighter wound near it, but not near so severe—it was the same description of wound, but very much smaller indeed—it was very near the former one—I did not examine further then—I found no other severe wound externally—we conveyed her home—an examination then took place, and I found there were two ribs fractured—there were several bruises on the arm on the left side—I do not remember any more appearances of injury—the blood on the clothes produced was all from the two wounds on the head—I imagine it was done by driving a comb into the scalp, because part of a comb was taken out of the wound—the comb had been forced in by a blow—I thought there was very great danger at the time—I feared erysipelas might supervene, and there was danger from her extremely exhausted state, from loss of blood—I did not see the prisoner that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner Defence.</hi> Last Tuesday, at half-past twelve o'clock, I came from market with a peck of oysters and some herrings, and I sat at the corner of the Duke of York—this <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> has got a wheelbarrow, and sits out in the street—his mother came up to me about half-past one o'clock in the day, and began to blackguard me—(I happened to be in a little trouble by the family about five months ago, and then she was constantly blaming me about my poor old soul of a mother who is dead)—I made her no answer, and put up with a great deal from her—her expressions were unbearable—the son came there at a little after one o'clock and the sister, and began to abuse me—I made them no answer, but moved my things from them for quietness—there were some stones in the way, and I was obliged to move back again, and I put the things on the pitch—he came there about four o'clock with the witness, with a peck of oysters, and he put them down on the pitch—there was no porter at all—I was sitting down mending my apron—his mother came and struck me across the face—I said nothing, but he got up and walked away, as I did not wish to be injured by him—I have been hurt by them for the last five years, and constantly abused—a woman came up and asked me to open pennyworth of oysters, which I did—my back was turned to him as he came out at the door of the Duke of York—it is not my knife which has been produced—he came out and made a blow across my face—I put my hand up with the knife in it to save my face, and whether the knife cut him or not I did not know at the time—it was not with the intention of cutting him on injuring him—it never entered my head—I should be very sorry to do it—the person standing by was a stranger, and I can not find her out, or she could prove it—I have no witness—nobody knows what has become of me—these people have such sly arts, they have let nobody know what has become of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman cooper, and live in New North-street, Theobalds-road. On the 30th of July, I had been to an annual dinner, and was going to see a mate part of the way home, who lived in the New-cut, Blackfriars-road—on my return back, coming up Bridge-street, I turned up Bride-lane, and the prisoner accosted me, wishing me to go with her—I gave her no encourgement whatever to think that I would go with her, and on coming to the passage in Fleet-street, I parted with her—she went round the church—I turned into Fleet-street—on looking at the clock, I felt for my watch, and found it was gone—I pursued her down the passage—I saw a watchman, and asked if he had seen a woman run that way—he said he had seen two—he sprang his rattle, and on crossing Fleet-street to go the Shoe-lane, the prisoner was brought back; and on going to the station-house the watch was found in her hand, as if she was going to drop it—I took it out of her hand, and kept it till we got to the station-house, and delivered it into the constable's hands.</p>

Day and Martin's firm—I work in the concern as a cooper—the dinner was over between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I was not drunk—I was a little fresh—I was on my way home—I was not so far gone but I had my recollection about me—I had been to see a mate who was worse than myself part of the way home, I had walked from Chalk-farm to see my mate home—I could not be very drunk to do that—I did nothing to the prisoner—she laid hold of me by the arm, pressing me to go with her—I was not with her two minutes altogether—I saw no other woman, but the watchman said he saw two women pass that way—I took no indecent liberties with the prisoner—I am married—my friend is a young man, who, when he is in liquor, is in the habit of sitting down on the steps in the street, and, as he had got a tidy hat on, and was genteely dressed he was likely to lose his things in the street, and I went to see him part of the way home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Lovegrove and Co., Cloak-lane. On the 27th of July I was standing at the door where I live, in Basing<lb/>hall-street, and saw a lad, named Collis, come out of Buckler and Bux<lb/>ton premises, about half-past seven or twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning—he had a bag on his shoulder—knowing he did not be<lb/>long to the firm I suspected all was not right, and followed him to Alder<lb/>manbury—I overtook him, and asked him what he had got—he said, "No<lb/>thing, "and then he said it was wool, but it was not his—I returned, and just after, Billings followed him—he joined him, and I thought it my duty to follow them—they went up Golden-lane to Baltic-street, St. Luke's—I saw them go into a house in Baltic-street—I followed them in just after, and found the prisoner there, in bed—I told him I thought the boys com<lb/>ing there,</p>

I have been lately staying at No. 24, Salisbury-street, Strand, and reside at Crickhowel, near Brecon—about a quarter before twelve o'clock on Friday, the 8th of July, I was going down the Strand, near Bedford-street, towards Charing-cross, in company with Mrs. Stevens—I had a purse, with fifteen sovereigns and other money in my pocket—I felt a little pressure at my side, by my right hand pocket I instantly put my hand into my pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse"—the prisoner Brown was close by me, on the side where the purse had been—a great number of persons were round—I did not see any thing of Williams—my pocket was not cut—the person must have put his hand in, and taken it out—I saw my purse at Bow-street—I believe Brown was seized by my female friend, but I was very much agitated—this is my purse; and the money, I believe, is right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Asher Isaacs. I engaged Allah as my servant, about nine weeks ago—the following day I went to Dublin, and returned on Thursday, the 30th of July—I had been away two months—Allah came to me on the Saturday morning, and asked for the key of the hall-door—I asked what it was for—she said it was to take the milk in—about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was apprised that a man in a flannel jacket had knocked at the door, and that she went away with him for an hour and a quarter—I then rang the drawing-room bell, and asked her who it was that had been at my door—she said, "Those who were welcome"—she was very impudent, and said she would go away that moment—she went up-stairs—my daughter called me up, and said that she was very impudent, and said that she would go away—I said that she should not, if she was saucy, I would send for an officer, and did so—I then went to the door, and saw the prisoner, Bagley, at the corner of Cutler-street—the officer took him, and brought him to my door—he took something from his pocket—he threw it into the dark part of the passage, and we found that it was this piece of velvet—the velvet found in the pas<lb/>sage was the same as that drawn from his pocket—I was not present when these handkerchiefs were taken from him—these are all mine—I saw the of them on the Thursday before they were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cattle-dealer, and live in Cardigan-shire.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was coming up Smithfield with my master, and hearing the cry, "Let him loose, "I went up, and asked what was the matter—I heard the others say, "Let the poor boy go," and I said so innocently, not knowing what it was, the same as the rest—the gentleman laid hold of me, and tore my button off—he would not let me go, and I laid hold of his collar—that was all I did—I did not know who stole the handker<lb/>chief, what boy it was, or any thing about it, till I saw the crowd, and asked what was the matter. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The prisoner was close to my elbow at the time I turned round, and found the handkerchief in the lad's possession—the lad stood right at my back—when I turned round, the handkerchief flew—I took hold of part of it, and the thief the other, and I snatched it off—the prisoner wanted me to let the boy go, but I would not—he tried all he could to raise a mob, and then called on them to <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> me—the lad caught hold of my stick, and I was obliged to let go, and the officer came up—if the prisoner had not interfered, I should have secured the boy who took my handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ward beadle of Farringdon Without. I was in Smithfield at the time this happened—I heard a cry for an officer, and went up—the prosecutor had hold of a about eighteen or twenty years of age—the handkerchief was in the prosecutor's hand—nobody else had hold of it at the time I came up—I asked him if he called for an officer—he said, "Yes, this lad has stolen my handkerchief"—I said, "Have you recovered it?"—he said, "Yes, this is it"—I then said to the lad, "You must go with me"—the prisoner came up and said, "What have you to do with this?"—he was a foot or two from me—(he came round to me—he was standing at my back)—I told him that was my business, I was an officer—he said, "Oh, leave the lad alone, "or something of that sort—I said, "I shall do nothing of the kind"—I went to take hold of the lad, and the prisoner seized me by the collar—I then laid hold of him in my own defence, and was engaged with him for upwards of five minutes—my shirt was torn from my back by his violent conduct, and he completely succeeded in rescuing the lad from my custody, and I lost him—the mob made a great cry of "Tread him down, knock him down"—they backed the horses against me, and the prisoner excited the mob—he said, "Run him down"—I had three horses backed against me at one time—there were between thirty and forty persons round me—several tried to trip me up, but I would not let him go—some persons came to my assistance—the prisoner was on the spot when the boy was struggling with the prosecutor, and he was the means of my not taking hold of the thief.</p>

I was passing along the floor of the warehouse letter C on the 9th July, and saw the prisoner rise from a stooping position between two tea-chests—I passed along the floor, and saw a chest of tea disturbed, which had been previously opened, but took very little notice of that; however, I followed him—he ran to the staircase to get some hoops—he returned again, and then I saw the chest was disturbed—I reported it to Bull, the warehouse-keeper, who took him on one side—Bull said, "I suspect you have tea about you"—he said, "I have"—Taylor, the superintendent, came and searched him, and found a bag containing twelve ounces of tea concealed between his legs—I compared the tea with the chest near which I saw him stooping—it appeared to correspond in quality.</p>

The prisoner was an occasional servant—she did not sleep in the house—on the 15th of July, the policeman came and desired me to look over the tea-spoons—the prisoner was then in custody—the policeman produced some spoons, a small silver box, and a table-cloth—the spoons and table-cloth were my father's, and the box was my own—my father had given it to me—I recognised a pair of gloves at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Piper. Andrews was at the house—he is a man known in the neighbourhood—he was tipsy—I do not remember the prisoner coming in, but he was sitting with Andrews, and drinking with him—my father had made a communication to me about a shilling—after that Andrews called for another pot, and gave me a bad shilling—they drank the second pot—I told him it was bad, and Andrews said a woman who had been there gave it him—I gave it to him back—he gave it to the woman, and gave a good one for it—I afterwards got that shilling from the woman,—I had bit it before I returned it—the officers were not told to come in, they were to remain at the door—An<lb/>drews left the house in company with his mother, and then the prisoner was about to leave, and Spiers, the officer, stopped him at the door—(the woman was Mrs. Baker, whom Andrews had been employed by)—the policeman searched the prisoner, and I saw three bad shillings taken from his pocket—he said nothing—he seemed very much frightened.</p>

On Fri<lb/>day, the 15th of July, at about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was called on, to see the person of John Murnan, at his lodging, at about ten minutes after a scuffle had occurred—I found him perfectly dead—on the Monday following I examined the body—I opened it, and examined every part of it carefully—I found he had an enormously enlarged heart, which subjected him, at any time, from violent excitement, to sudden death—the conclusion I arrived at was, that the man died most certainly from the violence used.</p>

Q.</hi> You have heard the account given of death—that the two man were struggling on the ground, and that the prisoner knelt on the body of the deceased—dose that lead you to any conclusion respecting the cause of his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The excitement, coupled with the weight of the man kneeling on him, would certainly pro<lb/>duce death, I should say—I could not distinguish between his own passion and excitement, and the mischief produced—his death might be produced by either cause—at first there would be a too rapid circulation of the blood, and then a stoppage—I found no rupture of the vessel—there was a slight rupture of the membrane of the brain, but not of sufficient extent to cause death—I found no other cause of death than the stoppage of blood at the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not the excitement, being in a passion and quarrelling with another, produce the rapid circulation of blood which in such a state would end in death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most probably—the excitement of passion alone might cause his death.</p>

               <p>how you get out;" which took my attention from my bag rather, he was so very polite, which made me notice him—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went down to my counting-house—I immediately recollected my bag of silver, and ran out to look for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, but he was gone—I caught sight of him—he went like lightning round Woodstock-street—I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> after making inquiry, but did not overtake him—I drove about for three hours, and went to Somerset-house twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live in Wood-street, Cheap<lb/>side. We deal in stocks and a variety of other things—we make stocks—the prisoner came into our employ about the 7th or 9th of last April—he was warehouseman to attend to the manufacture of stocks—his wife was employed in making stocks—he had been in the trade before; there was a stipulation made that he was not to sell stocks, or do any business of that kind, except on my account—he had a few stock-grounds and about half a dozen stocks, I told him I would take them of him, which I did, and paid him for them—I have got the invoice that he made of them—I</p>

               <p>received some information from Mr. Prior last Thursday week—Mr. Prior has been a customer of mine, but he has not had any thing of me for some time—he requested me to call at his house as he had some goods—I called there the following morning, about nine o'clock and he brought up these four boxes of stocks—none of these have any mark of mine upon them—I believe they are mine—I have no doubt of it—the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday morning—some of them are lined with buff—we had a special order from one house to make some lined with buff, and we made them—that is very uncommon colour to line them with.</p>

P. and J. Neville, and I think perhaps the prisoner, did, before he came into our service—I believe he did—I deal with Rawson and Co., and he dealt there—by your question I understood you to mean that Mr. Bishop and I were connected together in dealings with these houses, something amounting to partnership—I deal with two or three other houses with which he dealt before he came to me, but which he cannot deal with now—there is Nevilles and Foster, Samur and Ball, and Morrison—I do with his wife several times since he was taken up—I mentioned to her that I had taken away some things from the house which I believed did not be<lb/>long to us—there was a gentleman, named Relf, present at the examina<lb/>tion, on my behalf—I believe he is here now—he was not subpœnaed by me—I did not think him of any service—I thought him a man of honesty and truth before the magistrate, and I think so still—we did not differ as to the value of these stocks—there was a part of the goods I thought he could identify, he being the manufacturer of the silk, and he could not—the time at which it was made, according to his account, did not differ from the time I stated by eight or nine months—by three or four—it would not be the slightest inconvenience to me if the prisoner was to set up in business—I should not care about it—my business increased after he came to me—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live near Finsbury-square.

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Richard Wilcox Fairlam, a pawnbroker, in Lisson-grove. On the 3rd of August, at a quarter before nine o'clock, I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner and two others—the prisoner took up a handkerchief, and looked at it—the other two were looking to see that all was right—the prisoner then took down a handkerchief—he went out—I went after him—he saw me, threw it down, and ran off—I pursued, and caught him in a court—he said if I did not let him go, he would hit me—a young man was looking out for him—he caught him, and brought him to Devonshire-street, and the policeman took him.</p>

I have known the prisoner since December last—she worked for me several weeks—on the 13th of July I gave her a basket of linen to take to Mr. Gilbert, of Park Cottage, Waltham-green—it contained various shirts and other things—in return she was to have brought a parcel of dirty things home—she brought back some of the things, and said they were all right—on the 18th Mrs. Kagan called, and told me what she had lost—I then went to the pawnbroker's, where I found one shirt—this is it—it is one I have washed many times—it belongs to Richard Gilbert.</p>

The prisoner lodged at our house for two or three months before this affair—other people slept in the same room with him, sometimes one and sometimes two—a lodger whom the prisoner recommended left us without notice, and on his going I missed two sheets belonging to other lodgers—I told the prisoner I suspected his partner had taken those things which I had lost, and I should go and look after him—he said, "Do, mistress, go down to the West India Docks, and you will find him at the wood-side of the dock"—this was at about two o'clock in the afternoon—I went away at about three o'clock—the prisoner was out then—I left a box, with some money in it, on a chest of drawers in my bed room—I locked my room door, and put the key on the next room table—when I went out of the room about three o'clock the box was safely locked, and I had the key with me—there was a sovereign and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper in it—I had seen it five minutes before—I came back at about five o'clock or later, and went into the room about three minutes after—I found the box moved up to the two-pair of stairs, broken open, and a carving-fork laid by it—it was not in the room the prisoner lodged in—the lock was forced, and the money all gone—the prisoner was not there—I went to look after him, and gave information to a policeman, who brought the prisoner to our house in about half an hour—I told him I considered his partner and him were agreed, and that I was sent away on purpose, while this was com<lb/>mitted—he said he knew nothing about it, that he was innocent—he was detained—he said he received his week's pay at the West India Docks at two o'clock that afternoon; and before I went away he said he had been paid at two o'clock, but had not time to settle with me.</p>

I came into Board's shop while the female prisoner was there—I produce the four spoons which I took out of her hand—I said I thought they must be stolen property—she asked me to go with her to show me the person who gave them to her—previous to getting to the pawnbroker's, I had seen Whitehead talking to a young woman at the corner of Webb-square; and as I passed, something was said about a policeman—the female prisoner said he was talking to her daughter at the corner of Webb-square—I went there with her, and when I got there, he was gone, and the daughter also—I turned down a court, and met the daughter, but did not see Whitehead—I am quite sure he is the person I saw standing at the corner—it is thirty or forty yards from the pawnbroker's—that was hardly a minute before I went to the pawnbroker's—when the female prisoner found he was gone, she said they must have been improperly come by, because he had run away, and she was very sorry she had been taken in my such a person.</p>

On Wednesday morn<lb/>ing last, I was in Mile-end-road, and saw the prisoner Skeggs coming over the Globe-bridge with a cart-load of potatoes—he drew up at the Bell and Mackerel public-house—I saw him take something very bulky off the cart—he rang the bell three times very violently; and these keys were thrown out of window by Skelton—Skeggs then went and opened the gate of a shed, deposited two sacks there, and put the keys on a bench—he then came out of the yard with his cart, and proceeded on his journey; I went and stopped him, and asked what he had left behind—he said he had left nothing behind—another officer came up, and I told him to take him unless he told me what he had left behind—he then said he had left some chaff behind—I took the name on his cart, and let him go—I went back to the house, took the keys, unlocked the place, and found the two sacks, one was full of chaff, and the other had a bushel of pollard—I shut the place up, and took the keys with me—I waited till he returned from market, and took him into custody about seven o'clock that morning—it happened about four o'clock—after taking him, I went to the Bell and Mackerell, and took Skelton into custody—I told him it was for being concerned with the other prisoner in robbing his master of the chaff—he said he knew nothing about the chaff, nor about the keys, nor any thing else—nobody in the house would own the keys—I showed them to him—I then went back to the shed, and found the place open, and the sacks empty—they were the same sacks I had seen in the morning—this is a watering-house by the side of the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and carry on business in Tudor-street, Blackfriars. Fox was my apprentice, and Beattie was my warehouseman, and Webb had been in my service till within a short time of this period—on the 19th of July, during Beattie's absence, I went into the warehouse, and found the type of a baker's bill—I could see by the face of it that it had been stereotyped on my premises—Beattie was not a printer—I made no mention of what I discovered, but as there had been a number of sheets belonging to a dictionary missed, I asked Beattie whether he had found them—he said he had not—I told him he must make it his business of find them, as his character depended upon it—he did not say that he intended to leave my service, but he said he did not care, or some<lb/>thing of that kind—he left the place, and I never saw him afterwards till last Monday, when he was apprehended at a public-house in Wych-street—there was a week's wages due to him all but one day—in consequence of his leaving, I made further inquiries, and from what I heard I obtained a search-warrant, and searched a penny theatre, in a turning out of the New-Cut—the officer went there with me, and behind the theatre we found some materials for printing—the officer took what I pointed out as my property—we found these leads, these quadrats, and this galley, which I know particularly well—it has been in my possession many years, and is one I worked upon myself when I was learning the business—this type of the job which was found at the warehouse I identify as mine—I after<lb/>wards went with the officer to a shop in Brunswick-street—I stood by while the officer took up a drain under a water-butt in the yard at the back of the house, where we found this type, these blocks, and some others—I have no doubt of their being stereotyped from this type—I had never permitted Beattie to take any type or stereotype from my premises—I was not aware that he was in business for himself, or that he was in partnership with Webb—I knew Webb was in business—Webb was taken at the time these were found—the officer said to him, "Now you must go with me to the Magistrate, "and I applied for a warrant for Beattie.</p>

The prisoner came to look at some diamond pins—I spoke to him in French—I showed him some—he did not appear satisfied—he said he wanted to look at va<lb/>rious sizes—I took out a paper which contained a large quantity of dia<lb/>monds—he put his hands on them, which I requested him not to do—he then spoke about a pair of diamond ear-rings, which he said he would ex<lb/>change and he wanted to know what I would allow him for them—he said he would look in another day—I showed him the paper of diamonds which we had from Mr. Desvignes—I had not counted them, but I had every reason to believe the paper contained seventy-eight—I do not know of any having been sold—after he was gone, I examined it, and it con<lb/>tined seventy-seven—I did not go after him, but I sent a person to watch where he went to—I saw him in Queen-street, with Mr. Williams—I asked him, in the French language, where the diamond was that he had taken from our shop, and he said Mr. Williams had got it.</p>

On the 21st of June, I was superin<lb/>tendant of the Marine Society's ship, the <hi rend="italic">lphigena</hi>—it was <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> in the river Thames, off Greenwich—the prisoner was admitted on board the vessel on the 31st of March, by the Committee in London—after he had been on board the vessel about a month, I selected him as my servant—he was sent on shore every morning in the breakfast boat, at half-past seven o'clock, to get spring water—he went on shore on the 21st of June for that purpose, and did not return to the ship—I returned to the ship at half-past eleven o'clock—I had been absent during the night—on my return, I was informed of the prisoner's absence—I went into my bed cabin to put on my uniform coat, and I observed a screw driver on a chair near a chest of drawers—when I left they contained a cash-box—I unlocked the drawer, and found my cash-box broken open—the drawer was locked—I missed about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that box—about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, a few shillings in silver, and a new fourpenny piece—there was a £10 note in the cash-box, which was not taken, and there was some railway shares left in it—a lady's dressing-case was on the table—my wife opened that in my presence, and missed about nine sovereigns from it, seven or eight half-crowns, a gold-chain, a silver pencil-case, a brooch, and several articles—four silk handkerchiefs were taken from the chest of drawers—I heard of the prisoner the same night, but it was a month after<lb/>wards before he was apprehended—on the 24th of July he was brought in custody by a constable—I have since seen the gold chain, a shirt-pin, the garnet drop, and two silk handkerchiefs, which have been pledged—I did not recover any money—the prisoner was brought on board the ship on the 24th of confined on board the vessel one night, taken before the Magistrate next day, and ordered to brought up next day—the witness Ward was taken up, and after some circumstances disclosed by her before the magistrate, he admitted her as a witness.</p>

The deceased was brought to Guy's Hos<lb/>pital, one Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock—I do not re<lb/>member the day of the month—I believe it was about two months since—he was insensible—on any question being put to him, he would utter some<lb/>thing quite unintelligible, but he became worse shortly after—he lived till between one and two o'clock on Sunday morning—after death, I examined the state of his head very minutely—I found a fracture in the back part of his head, extending from a point where I suppose a blow to have been re<lb/>ceived—the brain also had suffered from the violence of the blow, and there was blood effused from small vessels, ruptured—I should say his death was caused by injury on the head—his death was caused by the fracture of the skull which I have described—it was that, the effusion of blood, and concussion also—I have not a doubt of its being the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Winterbourne—we are linen and woollen-drapers, in Blackman-street, Borough. The prisoner came into our service about March—we do the tally trade to a considerable extent, and are obliged to employ persons to make col<lb/>lections by the week—I have got the book that the prisoner kept in his travels—it was his duty to receive money on our account, and to enter it in this book, and account to me every night—his par<lb/>ticular days for collecting were Monday and Tuesday, and it was his duty to enter in this book, the sums received on each of the days mentioned, in this column from the person whose surname appears—there is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Stubbs on the 5th of April; nor of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Carpenter on the 16th of May, or the 27th of June—Stubbs' was a Tuesday's collection, and Carpenter's a Monday's—we have some of Mrs. Carpenter's bills which are in the book—it was the duty of the prisoner to enter on the back of each bill of parcels, the date and sum received by the week—on Mrs. Carpenter's bill there is a sum of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 16th of May, and 27th of June, but they are not in the book, and he never accounted to me for them—the writing on the bills is his—on the 29th of June he did not come, and a letter was received by Mr. Winterbourne.</p>

On the 12th of August, I was taking twelve umbrellas to him, Silver-street, at eight o'clock in the evening—I put them in the passage, where we always put the work, by the warehouse-door, and sat down about half a yard from them—my attention was called by a young woman, and they were gone—I went after a man in white trowsers, who had come into the passage—I spoke to him, and said, "You have got my work"—he said something—I saw the prisoner in Addle-street, and saw him drop my umbrellas—he was running at the time—I hallooed out, "Stop thief"—he was stopped, but not in my presence—the umbrellas were picked up, and given to me—I was about four yards from the prisoner, on the other side of the road, at the time—I saw him again in about ten minutes.</p>
