               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the things again?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. The prisoner was gone when they were missing. I went after him and took him in Broad St. Giles's, at which time he had my watch in his pocket, my breeches on, and my shirt was in his bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260003"/>Lloyd. He own'd he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room where the things, where you or where the prisoner lay?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. They were in the room where the prisoner lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Not above nine days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I had known him no longer. I thought him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>The constable produced the things.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday night I paid my prosecutor's wife for my lodging. I ask'd her where my shirts and stockings where. She said my stockings lay on a chair, and my shirts were in a basket in the room where I lay, which stood on the chest of drawers; there were three in number; I took them up and thought they were all my own; these breeches lay on my bed, which I took and put on instead of my own, by mistake: As for the watch that never was his, it is my own, and he had lent me two guineas upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at this watch again, whose is it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I bought this watch of the prisoner for two guineas and a half, and was to have it a week upon trial. I paid him two guineas, and was to give him half a guinea more if it pleased me; if not, I was to have my money again, and he his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these breeches lying on the prisoner's bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, they were not; they were hanging on a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shirt?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was in a basket on the chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife wash his linen for him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She did; he had but three shirts of his own, which he took, and mine too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his breeches behind him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he did not; his breeches were in his bundle when we took him; he had cut the buckle and strap off my breeches behind, that I should not know them, and tied them with a string. ( The buckle and strap produced.)</p>

            . On Monday the 3d of October, about six in the evening, the prisoner brought this shirt to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I live in Holbourn, and am a pawnbroker. I asked him what he wanted upon it. He said, three shillings, or three shillings and six pence. I look'd at him, and by his dress I thought him to be a hackney coachman. I said, whose property is this - It is my own. - What is your name? - John Hall. I open'd it and saw the letter R. and No. 6 under it. I said, I suspect you did not come honestly by it, I must stop it; where do you live? - I live in the neighbourhood. I said, if you will bring any body to prove you came honestly by it I will lend you the money, or you shall have the shirt again. He went, and said he'd come back again. The next morning he came with a neighbour, who keeps a publick-house. I asked him if he knew the prisoner. He said he did, and that he used his house, but he knew nothing of the shirt. I said, that is not sufficient for me, I will advertise the shirt to-morrow, so you had better tell me whose it is; then he said he wish'd he had been whip'd round Bloomsbury-Square before he had meddled with it. Then I bid him go and fetch somebody that could give an account of it. He did not bring any body. Then I went and took him up and carried him before justice Welch, where he confessed it was the coachman's property, and that he took it out of the stable. The prosecutor came and swore it was his shirt. and described it by that he had on his back.</p>

               <p>Spencer. It was delivered on the 27th of July, and she brought it on the 23d. As I had deliver'd it I cannot swear to it now. The prosecutrix and Mr. Baynham's son came and ask'd me if I had ever a silk gown or jumps of any body's bringing. I looked, and found that on the 28th of July I had taken in such things of the prisoner. I went and brought them down, and the prosecutrix own'd them. She ask'd me what I lent upon them. I said I lent her 7 s. upon them, which she paid me, took them away, and has had them in her custody ever since. (The things produced in court.) As to the spoon, that which I h was like it, but I can't say this is it. The gown and jumps are like what I took in, and I believe they are the same.</p>

We got a search warrant to search Bates's house, but found none of my goods, only a small piece of silk, part of which I lost, and the woman prisoner had the handkerchef round her neck, which we have here, her own property, which tallies exactly with the piece torn off and left in my room.

               <p>Turner. About nine at night. Then the prosecutor was resolved to watch the house all night, fearing he should get away. We knock'd at the door several time and call'd him by his name, but he would not answer. At six o'clock the next morning the prisoner tap'd at the window, and said he'd come out if I would come to the window. We ask'd him if he did not hear a knocking at the door and his name called. He said, yes. We said, then why did you not let us in. He said, because he did not think proper to be put in the hole in the watch-house all night. Then the officer told him he had a search warrant to search the house. He said, he did not know where the key of the door was, he believed his wife had it. We ask'd him where she was. He said in Crooked Lane. We sent a watchman for her thither, as he had directed. Then we were informed that she and her daughter were in his own house, striving to open the door to get out.

               <p>Q. What time was this ?</p>
               <p>Parker. This was but a little before twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Parker. It was very dark. I asked him what he wanted (I am one of his majesty's messengers, and I thought it was somebody come to counter-order me in the duty I was sent upon.) It was some time before he answer'd me. Then he said he was necessitated and must have my money. I told him my money that I had about me was very little, I was only going to Hounslow. I had half a guinea, five shillings, and some halfpence, which I gave him. After that I said to the boy go on, but he being surprised, did not stir with the chaise. Then the prisoner said to me, I believe you have given me only halfpence. Then I told him distinctly what money it was; I suppose he then had pocketed it. He came up again and said, I must have your watch. I said, my watch will be but of little service to you, it is an old silver one, and my name and the date of the year are engraved on it, and it may only deceive you; he swore then his necessity was such that he must have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since?</p>
               <p>Parker. It is here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the man that rob'd you?</p>
               <p>Parker. It was so dark I cannot.</p>

I said if he could prove it to be his own property I would buy it, but to me it did not appear to be made by Mr. Grigg, for the reason before mention'd. I called one of my men down, and bid him go to Mr. Cox, in Long-Acre, to desire him to step to me directly; to which the prisoner complied very willingly, to outward appearance, but the man had not gone past 8 or 10 doors before he went out of the shop and walk'd off. Mr. Cox came, and I shew'd him the watch, desiring him to tell me who he made it for. He said he believed he could tell by his book at home. I waited on him thither, and found it was made for a person that lived with the duke of Newcastle. I went to the duke's house, and on inquiry found out the prosecutor, who had formerly lived servant there. When I asked him if he had been rob'd, he said he had been rob'd (he thought ) by a girl in breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that?</p>
               <p>Bishop. He said because when he tap'd at the chaise door, he tap'd like a lady with a fan. I asked him if he had been rob'd of a watch; he said he had, that there was a green string tied to it, and his name on the inside case (but that had been rub'd out since) then I shew'd it to him, and he own'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after that ?</p>
               <p>Bishop. He was taken by means of the advertisement the Thursday after, and I saw him that afternoon at justice Fielding's.</p>

            . I am ostler to Mr. Beekford, who lets our horses and post-chaises. I deliver'd a horse which we call Black-Jack to the prisoner at the bar, who had hired him about three or four in the afternoon, to be ready at six, at which time he came and I deliver'd him to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Edwards. It was on a Monday in September, but I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Whither did he hire the horse to go to ?</p>
               <p>Edwards. To go to Croydon.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you observe any thing of the horse?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. All I can say of him is, I believe he had a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can't say I was much in fear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any instrument he had?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When he demanded my watch the second time, I perceived something like metal shine in his hand, which I thought might be a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. to Edwards. When did the prisoner return with the horse?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I took the horse of him about 2 o'clock on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you recollect what day of the month it was ?</p>
               <p>Edwards. It was the same night that Mr. Parker was rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the horse now?</p>
               <p>Edwards. He is in my master's stable now.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What day of the week was you rob'd ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On a Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Edwards. How came you to know Mr. Parker was rob'd that night your horse was out?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I was told there had been a robbery that night, by a post boy that return'd at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did not you stop the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Edwards. Because I was alone when he came back.</p>

               <p>I hired the horse he speaks of on a Tuesday evening, and when I came home about two the next morning there was a watchman by the gate, who took the horse of me, and I gave him three pence. Mr. Bishop says I told him I bought the watch of Grigg, it was not so; I bought it of a sailor on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260007"/> road, who wanted money, and told me he was going to Portsmouth. He said I should have it for a guinea and a half, or two guineas, he wanting money to bear his expenses. I was about buying a watch before, so bought that.</p>

               <p>As I was going to Islington to work, I met a woman big with child, who said she'd give me two pence to carry her load to Kingsland-Road for her; it was as much as ever she could do to stand under it. I being willing to earn the two pence took and carried it for her, and these people came and hawl'd me about, drag'd me, and push'd me up against a wall; I never was so used before in my life.</p>

The prisoner said she wanted some stuff to make her a gown, but did not know what to pitch upon, and said she must see several pieces. When I had served the other person I attended on her. There were some ready made goods, scarlet and black cardinals and capuchines, lay on the counter, which I went behind, opposite to her; she pointed over the counter to a piece of stuff, which, she said, she wanted to see. I laid hold on it, and in the mean time there was a capuchine lay upon some other goods, which I saw her take and put it under her cloak. I shew'd her several pieces of stuff after that. She said she liked one piece very well, but we could not agree for price, so I went backwards to my master to know if he could take the money, and told him she had put a capuchine under her cloak. My master came out and shew'd her several more pieces. Then I went to my mistress, a kinswoman of my master's. and asked her if she did not know of such a capuchine lying on the other goods. She said, she did. I said, the woman now has it under her cloak. She came out, went to the prisoner, who was sitting, and took it from under her cloak.</p>

He ask'd me what sort of stuff I wanted I said, something very dark for a winter gown; I pointed to a piece and sat down in a chair; I did not know that any thing lay on it. He asked me 14 d. per yard for it, and then 13 d. I had a guinea and 13 d. in my pocket. We could not agree for price. The gentlewoman came out of the room and said, get up. what is this under you? I got up, and the capuchine was under me. I said, I beg your pardon, I did not know that I sat upon any thing. She said, I stole it. I said, I will go any where with you, for I know myself innocent. My husband is on board one of his majesty's ships, and I have three small children to maintain. I buy and sell old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. to H. Triscom. Are you sure it was not under her?</p>
               <p>H. Triscom. It was not. I took it from under her left arm, under her cloak; she was sitting on a stool in the shop.</p>

               <p>M. Perkins. About two months ago; two slips, two nosings, and a slab, which is part of a chimney piece. He told me Mr. Allen, of Islington, had bought them of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant ?</p>
               <p>M. Perkins. No; he had work'd with us about fourteen or fifteen years ago, and he used to come about our store yard; I never liked him. I order'd my man to go to Islington to see it, as he was the person that cut it all out, which he did, and swore it to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you before the justice with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Perkins. I was, before justice Chamberlane, where he own'd the taking them to me, and said, he hoped I would be merciful to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the marble?</p>
               <p>M. Perkins. To the best of my knowledge I can swear to it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As for the slips I took them, but the slab I did not; I had that by me four years ago.</p>

            . A man came into my mistress's yard in Wood's-Close, and told us of this marble. I was sent by my mistress to Islington to see it, and I can swear to it as her property. I cut it out myself, and was present before the justice, where the prisoner confessed, in my hearing, that he stole it, and also in going along he own'd that he stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it ?</p>
               <p>Insel. The prisoner had sold it to one Mr. Allen at Islington. ( Produced in court.) This is the very same, my mistress's property.</p>

I search'd him, and found both ginger and sugar upon him. I ask'd him how he came by it He said it was the first time, and that he would do so no more if we would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employ'd there by you?</p>

            . I am trusted with merchants goods at Summer's Key, in the warehouses; the prisoner was detected by Mr. Pyke, and had seven or eight pockets in which there was sugar and ginger.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose goods were in the place the prisoner came out of?</p>
               <p>Oxley. There were goods belonging to several merchants.</p>

               <p>Oxley. We have lost goods several times, but could not charge the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How much sugar and ginger was found upon him?</p>
               <p>Oxley. I can't say that, it was not weigh'd; there was the quantity laid in the indictment, or more. I saw the prisoner down on his knees to Mr. Pyke, saying it was the first time.</p>

             is my partner. I asked him where he had them, and he said he had them of Samuel Drybutter (the prisoner at the bar) to mount for him.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know them?</p>
               <p>Grace. I can swear to one of them, because the mark on the inside is my own figuring of what it cost me; as to the other, the mark was rob'd out. Being sure I had never sold it myself, I asked my Partner whether he had or not, and he said no. Then I asked Mr. Allen to go with me to justice Welch. We went thither, and his worship granted a warrant for the prisoner. I went and served it, and took him before Mr. Welch, where I charged him with stealing the two boxes. Mr. Drybutter said that Mr. Cox had deliver'd them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Cox present at the time ?</p>
               <p>Grace. He was, and took his oath that he never deliver'd them to him. (The boxes produced in court. He takes up one of them. ) This I can swear to be my property.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Grace. I believe about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to be a master or a servant ?</p>
               <p>Grace. I always look'd upon him to be a servant to his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not she keep a reputable shop somewhere?</p>
               <p>Grace. She does, in Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she follow the same trade as you?</p>
               <p>Grace. We are in the wholesale way, and she in the retail; she deals in some articles that we do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she not likewise keep another shop in Westminster Hall, on the left hand?</p>
               <p>Grace. I always look'd upon it that she kept that shop.</p>

               <p>Grace. I do, by hear-say.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they have not laid out a great deal of money at your shop?</p>
               <p>Grace. I believe about sixty or seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260011"/>Q. Whether, supposing goods are ask'd for at one of these shops, and the party has not such goods, it is not customary for the wholesale dealer to let the retail dealer have goods to shew?</p>
               <p>Grace. Sometimes it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't the retail customer sometimes desire a thing to shew, when you don't know whether they will buy it or not ?</p>
               <p>Grace. Sometimes we do let them have them so, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you or your partner have not let Mr. Drybutter have jewels, such as a diamond ring, worth thirty or forty guineas?</p>
               <p>Grace. My partner may, but I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal largely ?</p>
               <p>Grace. We have a very considerable business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been frequently at your house?</p>
               <p>Grace. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the delivery of these boxes might not have slip'd out of your partner's head?</p>
               <p>Grace. I apprehend not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you do not, from your own knowledge, know several instances of that fallibility of your partner, as you sell large quantities at a time ?</p>
               <p>Grace. Sometimes we sell a box alone to them that sell again, and sometimes many articles in a parcel; sometimes a hundred pounds worth at a time, and perhaps a hundred articles for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep an open shop?</p>
               <p>Grace. No, we do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not probable your partner might make a mistake?</p>
               <p>Grace. He has sworn he has not made a mistake in this.</p>
               <p>Q. As to a note of eleven hundred pounds, did he not make a mistake once ?</p>
               <p>Grace. He once did drop a note of eleven hundred pounds upon 'Change, but that is nothing at all to the purpose, as to such an affair as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon settling accounts with the prisoner once, whether there was not a book, mounted with gold, omitted, which you should have charged?</p>
               <p>Grace. I do not remember such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come and return you a book worth seven guineas and a half, that you had not mention'd in your account?</p>
               <p>Grace. No; I do not remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual upon surmises of this sort to go and take out a warrant, without calling upon the man to talk with him first ?</p>
               <p>Grace. I don't know whether it is usual or not; but when a person loses a thing and thinks he is rob'd of it, he has a right to do himself justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you don't know that the prisoner at the bar was well acquainted with your dealing with Allen ?</p>
               <p>Grace. I suppose he knew that, but I am not certain; I will go so far as to say I believe he did know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, if the prisoner had feloniously taken these boxes, he would have sent them there with the marks on them?</p>
               <p>Grace. I apprehend he thought they never would have came to our sight again.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a man could not, with the least trouble in the world, take that mark of your's out?</p>
               <p>Grace. He might easily have taken them out; I could rub them out with my finger, and the mark was rub'd out of one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say the mark was taken out of one of them, when you can't swear to it.</p>
               <p>Grace. Mr Allen told me his servant rub'd out the mark from that, and was going to rub out the other, had he not forbid him.</p>

            . I was sent to by Mr. Drybutter, to know if I could mount him these 2 boxes; I was very ill then. About a week after I sent my servant to know what price he would go to, and how he would have them done? He sent word he bought them cheap, and he would have them done cheap.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this of your own knowledge, or by hear-say?</p>
               <p>Allen. He said so since to me, and that was his answer he sent me; they were good boxes, and I did not think the order was sufficient, so I mounted them well, that is, my servant did for me. Mr. Cox having some time before spoke to me to mount some of the same kind, I call'd upon him and said I had something to shew him, saying, they were like such boxes as he wanted me to mount. He and his partner looked at them and said, where had you these boxes, they are not gold, they are not such as we want; who are they mounted for? I said, for Mr. Drybutter. They said one to the other, these are our boxes, and there was their mark upon one of them; and Mr. Grace insisted upon my going with him to Westminster-Hall, which we did. Mr. Drybutter saw me at a distance, and when I came up to him he said, have you brought my boxes. I said, I don't know: I have brought the boxes your servant brought to me, if they are your's. He said, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260012"/> are, so I delivered them to him. He asked me what I must have for doing them. I said, 12 s. a piece. He said, he would give but 4 s. a piece. I had a constable along with me. I would not agree to take 8 s. for them both. He said, I should take one into my possession, and he'd keep the other till he inquired the price. I said, I should keep them both, so took them, and gave the constable charge of him, he having the warrant.</p>

In two or three days after I went there, in order to know in what manner he would have them done. He shew'd me an oval green box, and said he would have them done in that manner. I said, they were very good tortoishell boxes, and would afford a better mount; he said, it did not signify, for he bought them cheap, and he intended to have them mounted cheap.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the boxes back and shew him them?</p>
               <p>Finch. No, I did not.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Drybutter, and carried two boxes to Mr. Allen's, to be mounted, by my master's order [he looks at them] these are I believe the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there?</p>
               <p>Wright. I saw Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last evidence there?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, I did not; I deliver'd them to Mr. Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for all such boxes to be mark'd by your master, or the owners of them?</p>
               <p>Wright. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this that is marked, and see if it is your master's mark or not.</p>
               <p>Wright. It is not marked with any mark that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any goods brought into your shop that are not marked?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, there are.</p>

               <p>Wright. I heard him say a gentleman and lady wanted to look at some.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they put in a place where unmounted boxes are put?</p>
               <p>Wright. They might be for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Allen worked for your master some time?</p>
               <p>Wright. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Wright. I have carried him things to do?</p>
               <p>Q. What is this mark made with?</p>
               <p>Wright. It is made with ink, I fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was conscious he had stoln that box, might he not easily rub that mark out by weting his finger?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send you in the ordinary manner as with other goods, or did he give you any particular caution?</p>
               <p>Wright. He gave me no particular caution, but sent me as he does with other goods in the course of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any order of secrecy?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the day or night?</p>
               <p>Wright. In the day-time.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Allen work for other people besides your master?</p>
               <p>Wright. I believe he works for a great many of the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been at the business?</p>
               <p>Wright. About half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual in trade of fancy to have goods upon sale or return?</p>

               <p>Wright. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master now any goods of other people on sale or return?</p>
               <p>Wright. My mistress has I believe, but I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your master's or mistress's shop?</p>
               <p>Wright. I fancy it is my mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these as publick in the shop as any others.</p>

            . I am the constable. When I came into Westminster-Hall to serve the warrant on the prisoner, Mr. Allen and he were talking about the price for mounting them. The prisoner was unwilling to give him 12 s. a piece for mounting them. Mr. Allen said they were very pretty boxes, and he should be glad if he would tell him where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260013"/> he could meet such. The prisoner answered, he bought them of a Frenchman. He would have had Mr. Allen take one of them for the security of the 24 s. till he inquir'd whether it was the usual price to pay so much money. When I had him in custody he said he bought them of Mr. Cox. I ask'd him if Mr. Cox was a Frenchman? He said, what is that to you?</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not customary for people in that trade to conceal places where they buy such things from others of the trade?</p>
               <p>Blake. It may for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he insist upon concealing where he had them ?</p>
               <p>Blake. No, he did not; as soon as he found the inquiry was for another purpose, and I had sent Mr. Allen to fetch Mr. Grace, then it was he told me he had them of Mr. Cox. We took him to Mr. Welch, and he was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he continued there till now?</p>
               <p>Blake. No, he has been bail'd out these 3 weeks.</p>

            . Mr. Cox and Mr. Grace apply'd to me, and mention'd the circumstances of this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cayter. I am a tobacconist and snuff-maker, and live in Fleet-street. They desir'd I would accompany them to Justice Welch's. I went with them to Westminster-Hall, but was not in the hall till after the prisoner was in custody of the constable. The constable, prisoner, and Mr. Grace went in a coach to Mr. Welch's. I walk'd it there. The prisoner said he had the boxes of Mr. Cox. Mr. Cox was sent for. It took up a considerable time. The Justice wanted to go to dinner, after a short examination of the prisoner. He was told he might send for his friends, and the Justice would be ready at 5 o'clock to hear the case. We went to dinner, and soon after Mr. Cox came to the publick house, where the prisoner said to him, pray Mr. Cox recollect your memory, you deliver'd these things to me, pray consider my character.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Cayter. In Long-Acre. Mr Cox said, Mr. Drybutter I am extremely sorry for you, could I recollect any thing of that nature I would, but I can recollect no such thing, What was you to have given me for them? - 27 s. said the prisoner for one, 32 s. for the other. Mr. Cox reply'd, one of them cost me above two guineas. Well I don't know, said the prisoner, the price exactly, but pray recollect yourself. I will all I can, said Mr. Cox, alledging that he could not then recollect any transactions concerning them, and moreover saying, we never sell these boxes unmounted. Mr. Drybutter desired the privilege to speak to Mr. Grace and Mr. Cox in an adjoining room, which was granted. What passed there I can't tell, but they went from thence to justice Welch, for farther examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem well acquainted with one another?</p>
               <p>Cayter. They knew one another as persons know their customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before the justice?</p>
               <p>Cayter. The prisoner declared he had the boxes of Mr. Cox, and that the price for one was 27 s. and the other 43 or 45 s.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner was talking to the prosecutors, did he speak to them as a man that had stoln any thing, or as one that desired Mr. Cox to recollect himself?</p>
               <p>Cayter. If I could tell the look of a thief, I should take more care myself, and be able to give you an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know of your own knowledge, that he has frequently sup'd at their house?</p>
               <p>Cayter. I don't know that he ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor breakfasted?</p>
               <p>Cayter. I know of no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear he has been there two or three times a week?</p>
               <p>Cayter. I never heard it, but I believe I have seen him there as often.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>There seems to be great weight laid on my saying I had these boxes of a Frenchman. I some time before this had some India boxes seized in Westminster-hall, and I apprehend they came to seize these. They were found in my custody, and I spoke out of tenderness to Mr. Cox, to conceal where I bought them, for they are really French manufactury. I always lived in great friendship with Mr. Cox, and have frequently dined and sup'd at his house. I have known him five or six years, and have been trusted with things to a large amount by him; I was trusted by him lately with a ring of 32 guineas value. If I had been minded to defraud him, I could have done it in jewels and things much more considerable than these 2 boxes. I was apply'd to by a lady now in court for a box,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260014"/> in order to set a picture in, and I was obliged to get one unmounted to have it put in first, or it must have been taken to pieces again. I had these boxes of Mr. Cox on the 3d of September last in the evening; there was nobody but him in the warehouse at the time. If he recollects himself, he said they are inlaid with gold; said I, there is some silver; no, said he, it is all gold, but some of it is colour'd to represent the flower. As to the price I mention'd I was in such a flutter that I could not so well recollect it; and besides I very often do forget, and am forced to send back to the party, to know the price I am to give for things. It is not to be supposed, that if I had stoln these boxes I should have sent them to a man who (I knew) work'd for Mr. Cox, without rubbing out the marks. There was no friendship between Mr. Allen and me, and a to the answer from whence I had them, I had a very good right to keep that to myself; neither had he a right to ask me, it was an unfair question.</p>
               <p>Q. to Allen. Do you work for Messieurs Grace and Cox ?</p>
               <p>Allen. I do; I have known them about three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you for the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Allen. Very little.</p>

               <p>M. Fitzberbert. I wanted a picture to be set in one.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that in such a case, the box must be approved of, before it is mounted, by the customer?</p>

            . I am a shagreen case maker, and have known the prisoner ever since the year 1754.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. All I know of him is, I believe him to be a very honest man. He has been a very good customer, and has always paid me very honestly: His mother keeps the shop, and he has acted as manager; I believe he has laid out near 200 l. with me, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he came frequently to your shop ?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever had an opportunity of defrauding you?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I never thought of such a thing, neither had I the least suspicion of him in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he never been in your house, when he has had an opportunity of taking things?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. No doubt but he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for you tradesmen to let one another have goods, to shew to a customer ?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I have done it frequently, but he generally bought what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call that way of trade?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. That is called sale or return.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he'd be guilty of stealing a couple of tortoishell boxes ?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I can't say nothing to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is customary, upon sale or return, to let the person that fetches them alter them, and after that take them again?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. If he makes an alteration according to his own humour, the goods are his.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the goods were taken to shew a customer, is it not customary for you to fix a price what he shall pay for them, if he sells them?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I always fix a price, and mark it on them.</p>

            . I have known Mr. Drybutter five or six years. I am a bookseller. He keeps a shop in Pall-Mall, another in Westminster-Hall, and, in the season, another at Tunbridge, but I know nothing of that shop; I think I seldom see a shop better stock'd than that in Westminster-Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his behaviour ?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He has bought books of me several times; during the course of our trading together I believe I may have taken of him about 150 l. and what he contracted for he always paid me; there is now about 1 l. 5 s. between us for goods which he had about a month ago. I always look'd upon him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you look upon to be debtor, Mrs. Drybutter or he ?</p>
               <p>Jefferys. I always look'd upon her to be debtor, but I always received my money of him; I did not know but what they were partners.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name did you carry the account in?</p>

            . I am a taylor; I had an apartment of his mother's, from September 1755, till March 1757, in Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's general character?</p>
               <p>Conner. I always look'd upon him to be a man of more honour than to pilfer.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a prosecution against the prisoner for stealing these goods, the property of Mess. Cox and Grace; why was not Cox examined, as his name is so often mention'd ?</p>
               <p>Cox. I am sworn, and can say no more than what Mr. Grace has already said.</p>
               <p>Q. to Grace. Did you ever trade with the prisoner in the way of sale and return ?</p>
               <p>Grace. I believe we have let him have a thing, and the next day he was to bring it again, if he did not sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had kept it, how then?</p>

               <p>Grace. Then we should have charged him a certain price for it, but we admit no alteration in our goods; if we deliver goods to him on this consideration, then we set them down; but these two boxes are not enter'd in my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Cox make entry of all his goods?</p>
               <p>Grace. There may be some omission.</p>

Last Tuesday was se'n-night in the morning, the prisoner was observ'd by one of the watchmen to be lurking about with a copper boiler and saucepan; he watch'd him into the Bull alehouse in Kingsland road, and then came and told me what he had seen. I went and found the prisoner there, and ask'd him where he got these things from? he said he had them at Hackney, of a person that was in necessity, and in fear of being seiz'd by his landlord. I went with him thither, and found what he said was false. Then he said he had them at Islington. I went there, and enquiring about found they belong'd to the prosecutrix. She saw and swore to them.

             pull'd off a ruffled shirt and deliver'd it to my maid to lay by for him, which she did. I saw it lying in the place. On the Tuesday following his mother and brother came to my house. I desir'd them to dine with me on a leg of mutton and turnips. After dinner he call'd me out at the door and said, master I shall take it as a favour if you'll lend me 20 s. which I did, looking upon him as an honest lad. I went up for the money, and as I was counting it he was soon at my heels. After I had lent it him he went with his mother into the Borough. This was the 5th day of his being with me. On the Thursday following I sent him up to clear the club room, and I went out at the same time. When I came home at night I found the pots were not fetch'd in. I ask'd my maid why the boy had not fetch'd them in, and she told me he had not been in the house half an hour. I call'd him but he made no answer. At last he came and took his hat and away he walk'd; after which I went up stairs and found the beaufet door open, where I miss'd a guinea. The next morning my maid miss'd a silver spoon, and the shirt I mention'd. The boy was not to be found</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find the beaufet ?</p>
               <p>Kelly. The lock was tried at very much on one compartment in it, but was not open'd. I sent two men to his mother's, to know if he was there, who return'd and said he was not; then I went, and found he was there. I left word, that if he would come again I would take no notice of what was past, but in the mean time I went and got a warrant from justice Fielding, and when he came I took him before the justice, where he own'd the silver spoon and shirt, and that he had pawn'd them with Mrs. Edwards, and also that he had taken a guinea out of the beaufet, before the constable and myself.</p>

               <p>E. Gibson. It is sign'd by Mr.

               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you was married?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. It is about two years ago; to the best of my remembrance it was on Bartholomew day, in 1755.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. There was but one gentlewoman with me, whose name was Ellis, the parson and clerk, and Mr. Gibson; there were two other people in the church, who, I believe, belong'd to the Savoy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who performed the ceremony?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. The prisoner does not appear to be the gentleman; he that married me had a smoother face, without any pockfrets, but I did not take particular notice of him at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. If you do know him, and say you are not sure, you act contrary to your oath.</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I know it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe him to be the man?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I don't believe him to be the man; he may, but I have no knowledge of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the certificate ?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I gave it to Mr. Pridle yesterday.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. I believe Mr. Pridle will not appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for so believing?</p>

               <p>Q. Is your hand to the certificates, as a witness?</p>
               <p>Philips. Some I fill'd up, and some Mr. Wilkinson himself did, I very seldom sign'd them; some times I did, when desired.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the attorney that attends this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. Mr. Pridle is the attorney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Within these twelve months it has been six or seven hundred pounds detriment to me: there is a prosecution before your lordship in the King's-bench; he has sent somebody to me almost every day, and promised not to appear against me at the Old-Bailey, if I would forgive him. He likewise would leave it to any two of my acquaintance, and give me 50 l. to make me amends for the injuries I receiv'd from him. I sent this answer, '' That whatever was the consequence of it to me, I had no malice against the man, but owed such justice to society, that if it cost me even my life I would bring him to justice.'' It has cost me near 20 l. to remove myself here. I am informed he has sent one Mrs. Pritchard, otherwise Gordon, otherwise Pridle (she went under three denominations) to Mrs. Gibson, to get her to swear to me as the person that performed the ceremony; but upon her asking her, she said she could not swear that I was the man that married her; then she said to her, write him a letter, and say you can swear to him. The injuries I have received will come before your lordship in your lordship's court the 2d day of next term. It was to have come on before, but he has been always out of the way, and we never could come at him to serve him with the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Pridle live?</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. He is an attorney in the Temple.</p>

             twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they married?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. They were Mr. Mason used frequently to come to our house, and Mrs. Snape, then a widow, used to come too. I apprehended she and Mr. Gibson were going to be married.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Mason about the marriage after it was over?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. She came and told me she had been married at the Savoy. I used to see Mr. Mason two or three times a week: when he came to my house two or three days after the marriage, I said, So Doctor, you have tacked two old acquaintances of mine together, mentioning them; he said, why don't you come with Mr. Pridle that I may do you the same office? I ask'd Mr. Mason what made him venture to marry, as there were two gentlemen liable to be prosecuted; he said, he had married a great many hundreds of couples, and that Mr. Wilkinson's licences were as good as the archbishop of Canterbury's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he did marry them?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. Yes, he remembered he did marry them, and that by Mr. Wilkinson's licence.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. This was at the latter end of the summer, about two years ago last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What month?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. About August or September.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I live in Buckingham-Court, Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you once live with Mr. Pridle?</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him last?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I saw him to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you at his chambers?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I called there last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never go by the name of Gordon?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I have. I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your real name?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. My real name is Pritchard. My father was rector of Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not once tried in this court?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I was with Mr. Pridle, and the court was very well satisfied that we were used very ill.</p>

               <p>G. Pritchard. She desired me to call upon her. I have known her from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation about what was to be done to-day?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. No.</p>

               <p>G. Pritchard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never talk to her about this affair?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. Yes, she told me she was very sorry her name was brought in question about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she knew Mr. Mason ?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. She said she did not recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. The very day or two before you went in order to obtain this indictment against me, did not you send me a letter that you desired me to come; did I not come, and was not the conversation in regard to the injustice you know I have received from Mr. Pridle; and did not you tell me whenever I should call upon you to give your affidavit, you would make oath of the truth of what you then told me?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I not ask you, in order that you might do me that justice that you proposed you would, against Pridle and Hodle, in regard to the injustice I have received from them?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. No, Sir, I was out; when I came home I was told there had been two or three constables to take me up, and a gentleman in the appearance of a clergyman was with them. I sent to Mr. Mason to know what he meant by it; he came, and told me he had a warrant against me for taking from him a steel screw (which was my own) to hang a watch on. I said, Mr. Mason you use me vastly ill, but I'll absolutely appear against your; he put me in defiance. Mr. Pridle and he lived together then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This cannot be unfolded till the answer is made, whether or no it was not your own motion to me that Pridle and I might make up all matters, if not you knew two persons that could swear to the identity of my person in marrying unlawfully.</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. That was in regard to myself, but not Mr. Pridle.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this conversation ?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. It was a few days before Mr. Mason was indicted. I told him I should be very sorry to appear against him, but he knew he had done it, and that I should appear and give all the evidence I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Gibson tell you that Mr. Mason had married her ?</p>

               <p>G. Pritchard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner's officiating to marry there?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in the chapel to see him?</p>
               <p>G. Pritchard. No; I only heard him acknowledge he had done so. He said his profits were about four guineas a week.</p>
               <p>[She is sent out, and Mrs. Gibson call'd in]</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Gibson. Was you acquainted with

            ?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I was; I employed this Pridle whom she lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her anything of your marriage?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I don't remember I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. I am not positive; he and she have been with me several times about this affair, and would have had me go with them in a coach to see the prisoner, but I did not go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with a parson at her house before your marriage?</p>
               <p>E. Gibson. No; neither before nor after my marriage. I remember Mrs. Pritchard said the certificate was not Mr. Mason's hand-writing; Pridle said, he knew that very well.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's defence consisted of two parts; one, on supposition the facts were proved, regarding the matter of law; and the other, objections to the evidence upon which the charge is supported. He admitted he did officiate and celebrate marriages at the Savoy chapel without publication of banns or licence properly obtained; but that he did not do it knowingly and wilfully, for Mr. Wilkinson had shew'd him a letter from the bishop of London, and told him an instance of his marrying a certain barrister at law. and that he had some opinions that it was lawful for him to celebrate matrimony under the authority of Mr. Wilkinson's licences; that he never married any minor, but always tendered to them an oath, and if they did swear they were under age he refused to marry them. but if they did swear they were of age, he did marry them without either publication of banns or licence.</p>
               <p>He called no body to his character, but desired to ask Mr. Philips some questions.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not, on my first engaging at the Savoy, tell you I never would do any one act inconsistent with my conscience ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260020"/>Philips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not, as often as any persons presented themselves who appear'd to be minors, deny them?</p>
               <p>Philips. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Altho' they said they were not minors, before I proceeded to the marriage, did I not first order a Bible to be sent for, and make them swear that they had no parents, that they were not under the court of chancery, and that they were of age?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he marry them if they said they were of age?</p>
               <p>Philips, Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If they swore it I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you acted contrary to law.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Wilkinson indicted ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who officiated in August, 1755?</p>
               <p>Philips. Mr. Mason and Mr. Brooks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We did. I attended the trial of Mr. Grierson, in order to prove the Bishop of London's hand-writing. Ask Philips on his oath whether I married after that.</p>
               <p>Philips. Not once.</p>

I said that I did not know that I had, and asked what sort of a person brought them; she said there were two men and a woman brought three cheeses and a ham to her house in Little-Britain, and described a man in such cloaths as the prisoner usually wore. I ask'd if he was cross-ey'd [the prisoner was such ] she said he was; I went there and saw the cheeses; they have been there ever since, 'till this day. [Produced in court.] As to the ham I can't swear to that, but these cheeses were bought for me by Mr.

             at Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire; by the look of them, I have the rest of the same dairy at home. Here is my mark plain on one of the Cheshire cheeses; and here is one of them a Gloucestershire cheese, of which I have some of the same at home, but cannot be positive to that. I cannot say when the prisoner took them: It might be while he liv'd with me for what I know, but whether he took them out of the warehouse, cellar, or shop, I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever sell cheeses in the cellar?</p>
               <p>A. Readman. We take people there to look at them.</p>
               <p>Martha Hill. On the morning after last Michaelmas-day a woman came to me and told me she had four cheeses sent her out of the country, and she wanted to dispose of them; the next morning my maid told me two men and a woman brought them after my shop was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I live in Little-Britain, I sell grocery ware, cheese, and other things; I thought it was a bad affair; so desired Mr. Prentice, a very large dealer near Smithfield-Bars, to come and look at them, to see whose mark was on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought them?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I can't tell that, only by what the prisoner said; he said to me he brought them. They were left in the passage, the shop being shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them first?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. The next morning about seven o'clock in the passage: Mr. Prentice came and looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260023"/> at the cheeses, and took the marks on a piece of paper, in order to shew amongst the trade in the afternoon. The woman spoke to me about buying them. I said to her here are not all the cheeses you mentioned to me; she said she had disposed of one. I asked her how she came by them, she said they came by sea, consign'd to her cousin Readman. I asked her if she had any letter of advice, and desired her to fetch it. She went and did not return. After that came a man with an order for us to deliver them, there was no name to it. A little after came the prisoner at the bar, and asked if a porter had not been for them; we said yes, he said why did not you deliver them, we said we had some reasons for stopping them; after that came a person from Thames-street and desired to look at them, he did, and said they were Mrs. Readman's cheeses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. No; he went away again. We acquainted Mrs. Readman of it, and she came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>M. Hill. I don't exactly know the time, but when I did, I heard him confess he stole them from the prosecutrix.</p>

We went in there and called for some liquor; there were two other men in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner or soldier before ?</p>
               <p>Adams. No, I did not; I called for a of beer, but did not sit down. As we stood talking the prisoner felt at my pocket. I thought may be you will pick my pocket. I had a box in it, but felt and found it safe there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260024"/>Q. Did you say any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Adams. I said you must not pick my pocket madam: I said I had no handkerchief about me. As we were talking after this, I felt and found my box was gone; then I said my box is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you stand at that time?</p>
               <p>Adams. She stood facing me, and the soldier on one-side.</p>
               <p>Q. In which pocket was your box?</p>
               <p>Adams. In my left side pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it?</p>
               <p>Adams. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive it go?</p>
               <p>Adams. The soldier put his hand under my left elbow and lifted it up, and when I put my hand to my pocket my box was gone, but I did not perceive it taken; as soon as I said my box was gone the prisoner flew out at the door, I ran to go after her, the soldier came to the door and stop'd me, saying you shall not go after her, and held me fast. I saw her in the street and said, there she goes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her after this?</p>
               <p>Adams. She was taken into custody two hours after by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the box?</p>
               <p>Adams. It was a shagreen box, and in it ten French horn gold seals, some blood stone, some cornelian and agate, 12 metal fishes gilt, seven stone rings with gold shanks, the stones were set in silver, and one in gold, two boots and a leg; they are all trinkets for watches. One boot and leg were metal gilt, and the other silver gilt, and a metal anchor; after this there was an advertisement for me to go to justice Welch's, I went, and there was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Adams. It was about ten or twelve days after I was robbed when I read the advertisement, but the constable had advertised them before twice in the Public Advertiser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the soldier?</p>
               <p>Adams. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the woman?</p>
               <p>Adams. I told the justice I should not know the woman if I was to see her.</p>
               <p>Court. Why then do you charge her?</p>
               <p>Adams. She said before the justice that she drank with me and a soldier. The justice ask'd her how she came by the things, she said a gentleman gave her them as a present; he ask'd her what sort of a gentleman, she said a little man, a foreigner. [Such was the prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her tell the justice this?</p>
               <p>Adams. No; but I heard the justice say she told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she by then?</p>
               <p>Adams. She was; he told her of it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she make?</p>
               <p>Adams. She did not confess it, but cry'd.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That man gave them to me.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These are the things I lost that night, they are my property; here are all only one agate seal that she has made away with.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know them to be your's?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are of my own making. I am a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cooley. How came you by these things?</p>
               <p>Cooley. The woman where the prisoner did lodge came to me, it happened to be my watch night. She told me she had a suspicion this person had committed a robbery. I went home with her and found the prisoner much in liquor on a bed with one of these French horn seals on her finger. I ask'd where she got it; she delivered it to me. I made her get up and found this black shagreen box in her pocket with the other things in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Cooley. It was at eleven at night or thereabouts, on the 14th of September; the next day I carried her before Mr. Welch, who committed her to Newgate. I advertised the things in the Daily, Public, and Gazetteer papers. Some time after this the prosecutor applied to justice Welch to whom the advertisement directed, where he saw and swore to the things. The prisoner was asked which way she came by the things, she said a gentleman gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor by at that time?</p>
               <p>Cooley. No; this was at her being first brought there.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Holbourn, when this gentleman was near Hatton Garden raving in the street with two or three people round him. I never saw him in my life; people were advising him to go home, and there was a soldier advised him so too; he said no, shew me the beer-house; then he said you had better come and have some beer. I will not go in said I, but at last I did; we had a tankard at one house (he was very drunk) and the people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260025"/> turned him out and would not draw him any more; then he went into another house and said he would have some beer (this was near Holbourn-Bars ) they said he should have none. A woman was coming out of the cellar with some beer, which he took out of her hand; she said if she had known it she would not have drawn it. He said I was his wife, but I never saw him before; he said to the soldier, you I go along with us; the soldier said to me do not you go. I being in liquor went out of the house, the prosecutor gave me the things and said he'd go with me; so I went home with them, but did not know what was in the box till I came almost home, when I open'd it at a lamp and put one of the things on my finger; my landlady went and fetched Mr. Cooley, I told him the things were given me, and he should have them all.</p>

            . On the 25th of July last I had some business at Wapping. As I was coming by Iron-gate to Tower-hill, I saw a great mob of people, so I went a little way round because I would not go through them: I saw a foreigner pretty much beat and abused, and happened to say to the person that was using him ill, it, it is a pity that you don't use the man better, you would not like to be used so was you abroad; the man stepped up to me and said, if you speak another word we'll throw you into the ditch; I said no more, but was soon knock'd down and received several blows about my breast and stomach. I had a bundle of things, such as dimity, handkerchiefs, muslin, and other things in a handkerchief. When I got up and out of the croud I went back towards Iron-gate; the prisoner overtook me and said, Sir you have been used very ill; I said do you know the fellow that beat me, for I design to take a warrant for him. Said the the prisoner, I'll tell you who and what he is, and where he lives. I said if you do I'll be oblig'd to you. We went together to the sign of the Ship, called for a pot of beer, and drank it. I ask'd the landlord to let me leave my bundle for a little while. The prisoner said I had best go to justice Rickards for a warrant; we went there, but he was not at home; then we went to justice Gower's and got a warrant for the man that abused me; after that we went for a constable to serve it. The prisoner all this while pretended to be my friend; but while the constable and I went to take the man up we lost the prisoner. He went back to the publick-house in Tower-street, where I had left the bundle (as I found afterwards) and took it away; presently after I went there and asked for my bundle, the landlord said I had sent a man for it, I said I never saw the man before. Soon after I advertised the goods with two guinea reward, and heard the prisoner was frequently about the streets. About a month or five weeks after I found him in Spitalfields. and took him in custody, when he acknowledged he went without my leave for the bundle, in my hearing, and in the hearing of other witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess he was guilty of stealing the things mention'd?</p>
               <p>Davis. He did, and said. '' Please your worship '' I can inform you of a great many crimes '' that I have committed, and by a gang that I '' belong to.''</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bundle?</p>
               <p>Davis. There were three dozen of silk handkerchiefs, eight or ten yards of printed linen, ten yards of dimity, some muslin, a cheque handkerchief, and other things which I have not laid in the indictment; I have not mention'd half the things: I did not take particular notice of them all.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am a linen-draper, and was carrying them to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the landlord's name that keeps the Ship alehouse?</p>

            . I live at the ship, in Tower-Street. About three months ago the prisoner and prosecutor came into my house and call'd for a tankard of beer, which was drawn them. My boy came into the bar and said, the gentleman desired I'd take a bundle to keep for him. I went out, and, having never seen either of them before, told him I would not be accountable for any thing that was in it, searing it might be suspected I should take any thing out of it. They pressed me very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260026"/> hard, and said they would come back again in about an hour and half. I sent the boy up with it into my room, and in about an hour after that the prisoner came in a great hurry, and said he wanted the bundle his master left here. I sent the boy up for it, which he brought, and deliver'd it to the prisoner, who went away with it. In about an hour after that came the prosecutor. and ask'd for the bundle. Then I said here is some cheat in this. He said it was his own property. I said, I don't know but what you are as bad a man as the other, and I'll send for a constable and make you let us know who you are. He went away, and after that came again with a constable, and wanted to speak with me. Then, after he had told me the affair, I said, if you have been rob'd. I'll appear for you any where. He said, be should be obliged to me if I saw the prisoner if I would take him up. I think it was this day six weeks the prosecutor and two or three men came, and told me they had taken the prisoner, and desired me to go with them to justice Fielding. I went with them to the Brown-Bear, in Bow-street, and in a back room there was a good many people. I immediately went to the prisoner, laid my hand on his shoulder, and said he was the man, and ask'd him if he knew me. He said, yes; you keep the Ship in Tower-Street, where I fetch'd the bundle from. After that we went to justice Fielding's, who committed him to the Gatehouse; but before that he said, if the prosecutor would go along with him he would tell him of two or three of his gang, and also a pawnbroker, in Houndsditch, that bought the things they got this way.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of August I went to receive some money of my father, in St. Catherine's; there happen'd to be a mob so that I could not come by, which was occasioned by a soldier's striking a foreigner over the head, and beating him all of a gore blood. This

After that Davis saw me talking with the Turk; he came to me, and said, did you see the blow given by the soldier? I should be glad if you would go with me. I said, if you will call upon me I will tell you where I live, and go with you. We went to the ship, in Tower-street, where he call'd for a tankard of beer. After that he call'd to the landlord to take the reckoning, and ask'd him to let him leave the bundle while we went to the justice. The landlord said, I will take no charge of the bundle, because I don't know who you are. The boy took the bundle, and we went away together to the justice's, to get a warrant. Justice Richards was ill. Then we went to Sir

I told him I could not stay any longer. Said he, go you to the place where I left my bundle and fetch it. I said, Sir, I can't say I know the publick-house, but I know Tower-Street very well. Said he, go to the landlord, say you come from your master, and desire him to deliver the bundle to you, which I did, and he delivered it to me. I brought it to the house where the prosecutor was, delivered it to him, and he gave me a shilling for my trouble.

            . About July or August my master, who is father to the prisoner at the bar, sent me to look for him, for he wanted him. Coming through Houndsditch I happen'd to see him with a bundle under his arm. I said, where are you going? He said, to carry this bundle to a gentleman. I went with him to a disorderly house. in Partridge-Street, where was this gentleman; he took the bundle, and said he should come along with me directly. On the 15th of September the prisoner was taken up, and carried before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice what was in the bundle ?</p>
               <p>Henericus. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain it was the prosecutor he deliver'd it to?</p>
               <p>Henericus. I saw him deliver it to a man in a linen waistcoat; to the best of my knowledge it was the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it?</p>
               <p>Henericus. I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was it?</p>
               <p>Henericus. At the house of one Benjamin, a Dutch Jew. The prisoner was taken up on Thursday the 15th of September, by Stanley and Plump, and carried before justice Fielding, when he was remanded back for farther examination; but in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260027"/> afternoon the prosecutor came to the prisoner's father, and offer'd to take five pounds to discharge him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Henericus. This was the same day. The Monday following the prosecutor, in company with Stanley at the Bear, told him, if he would turn evidence he should get the reward and be clear'd The prisoner said he knew of no felonies, so could not turn evidence. Then Stanley said he should not be clear'd for ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this Stanley ?</p>
               <p>Henericus. He is a gentleman thief catcher; it is but three or four days ago since he sent another letter to the prisoner's father, to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prosecutor that came to the prisoner's father, and offer'd to make it up for 5 l.</p>
               <p>Henericus. I remember he came there and offer'd to take 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him?</p>
               <p>Henericus. Because he said he was the man that was rob'd and ill used; I am positive of that: he said he was the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was him that the bundle was deliver'd to ?</p>
               <p>Henericus. I remember the glimpse of him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same man?</p>
               <p>Henericus. I can't tell; I will not be so exact.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear he is the man that came for the 5 l.</p>
               <p>Henericus. I swear he is the man that came for that.</p>

            . I am father to the prisoner. On the 15th of September I was in the Synagogue saying my prayers (it was New-Year's Day with us). when the gentleman came in, and enquired for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What gentleman ?</p>
               <p>Bareive. Mr. Davis. I said, Sir, what will you please to have? let me say my prayers and I'll come out to you. He said, your son is under misfortune, for he has dealt very roguishly with me, but if you will I'll make you easy. I said, I want to know what it is. He brought me to the Black-Horse, Rag-Fair, and said, sit down; they were all together. I ask'd my boy what was the matter, who told me this story, that the gentleman employed him for a shilling. The thief catchers said, if you please to deliver 5 l. he shall discharge the boy, for he has got no warrant. I said, I am a poor man, and if the boy has done any harm he must suffer the law. I went away again to the Synagogue, and about three o'clock the gentleman came in at the door, and said, if you'll give me 5 l. I'll discharge him. I said, I'll give you nothing. The Monday morning he was going to carry him to the justice, at which time he demanded of me 10 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Bareive. The thief catchers said he will not discharge him under that. I said, I will not give a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Davis. Do you know any thing of this; did you go and offer to make it up for 5 l.?</p>
               <p>Davis. I never saw this man ( meaning Henericus) before to day, as I hope to appear before God, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive your bundle again of the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Davis. No. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever offer, in the presence of Henericus, to make up this matter ?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, never in my life; justice Fielding gave me street charge to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose, if he would turn evidence against the rest of the gang, this matter should be made easy; but, if not, you would not acquit him for 10 l.</p>
               <p>Davis. The prisoner had pitch'd upon half a dozen people that, he said, were concerned with him in taking this bundle, which, he said, were all Jews, and that one of them was worth four or five thousand pounds, whose chief employ was to buy stoln goods, and send them to Holland. I said, if you do bring these people to justice I'll be as easy as I can with you, but you shall come before the justice; but nothing of five or ten pounds was mention'd.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher, and live at the corner of Tooley street. Mr. Flint lives two doors higher than me, on London Bridge. The prisoner came into my shop to match this lace, a piece of which my people suspected she intended to take. I was at home at the time, though not by. They thought proper to search her. I desired a constable might be sent for, and order'd my maid to search her, which she did, and took out of her bosom these two pieces of lace here produced. She was resolute, and would not let them search any farther. I went to them, hearing a screaming, and took this silk from under her arm; I believe it was next to her flesh.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bennet, who desired me to take the prisoner into the dining room and search her, to see if she had any lace about her. We desired her to take it out, if she had any. My mistress saw some lace in her bosom, and took it out. Then we desired to know if she had any more. She said, she had no more. I ran out and told my master what we had found, who came, and said we should strip her. She went to beat me, and being very obstinate two other maids came up. Then we found the sewing silk, a piece of black lace, and a piece of ribbon under her arm.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Peirce. This was the day she was taken up, before she went to Mr. Bennet's. There was a box shew'd her, but she could not match it. She desired me to shew her another box. I had some time before this a suspicion of her, and would shew her no more. Then she desired to know how we sold our sewing silk, and desired to have a single dram, which was reach'd down to her. After she had been gone some time they sent from Mr. Bennet's, to know if we had lost any thing. I described the woman before I saw her. When we went to look on our silk the boy that reach'd the box to her said, before the silk was open'd, there should be three parcels, but when open'd, there were but two. (He looks at the silk produced.) This answers to the silk that was missing.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Flint. The prisoner came into our shop on the 26th of September, and ask'd for raven grey silk. I took it down and shew'd it her, of which she had a dram. I did not serve her any thing else. She paid me, and went about her business. About three hours after I missed a parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcel that was found upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pratt. I did, which answers to it; I believe this is the same here produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the lace?</p>
               <p>Pratt. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Peirce. Did you miss any lace?</p>
               <p>Peirce. No; I missed none, till such time it was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this lace here produced.</p>
               <p>Peirce. I believe this lace is the property of Mr. Flint.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe so?</p>
               <p>Peirce. We cast up the stock in the shop once a year, and the last year what was left we seal'd with wax at the end, and this has wax upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether the silk did not lie open on the counter for three hours after I went out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Peirce. It was rolled up, and put by directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person looking at silk?</p>
               <p>Peirce. No, nobody but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>As to the lace it was none of Mr. Flint's, it was my own, I have dealt in the holland trade ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260029"/> since I was fifteen years of age. A man owed my husband 70 l. which he made a demand of, and got 20 l. and the remainder in remnants of silks, stuffs, and lace; he is dead since. I went into the Borough to buy a leg of beef, so went into this shop, and ask'd if they could match a piece of lace. The man said, no, he could not I never laid a finger on his goods. I had a dram of silk, and went away directly. Then I went into the other shop, and they could not match it; there was a piece of lace lay on the counter, by the edge of the box. As soon as I moved my basket they said they had a suspicion of me, and began to search me: all sorts of people came in, and they began to pull me; the shop was as full as possible. They had me up into the dining room, and bent my neck quite to my toes. I said if they would let me alone I would undress myself; there was one behind me cutting my lace, one pulling me one way, another another way. I lost a guinea out of my bosom; she talk was put into my bosom by some body that came into the shop.</p>

               <p>' To the truly charitable and humane, friends of ' and enemies to the violaters of virtue.</p>
               <p>' An unhappy gentlewoman, whose husband being ' under unavoidable misfortunes, was necessitated ' to be continually on the foot amongst ' her friends endeavouring to extricate him, was ' way-laid by a base and notorious villain, who, ' under pretence of assisting her husband, inveigled ' her into his power, and cruelly used and ravished ' her, for which he stands indicted these seven ' months past, ever since which he has absconded. ' But upon hearing that he was to be out-lawed, ' and that the poor woman was dangerously ill (as ' she has been for four months since this unhappy ' affair) he put the unhappy sufferers to great expences<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175710260030"/> ' in attending several notices of his surrender ' to trial (at times that he was well assured ' that the poor woman was not able to sit up in her ' bed, much less to appear in court to try him) ' which expence, her sickness, and the loss of her ' husband's time, has rendered them objects of ' unutterable compassion. They therefore are indispensibly ' obliged thus most humbly to call upon ' the truly charitable and humane, to enable ' them to bring this vile offender to justice, who, ' from the strength of money, and the powerful ' friends that he ( vile as he is) has to stand by ' him, boasts that he'll get over this prosecution, ' which so loudly calls for the assistance of every ' virtuous lady, tender husband, and truly affectionate ' parent. This (now) unhappy couple, ' having nothing to back them in this melancholy ' prosecution, but the justness of their resentment, ' fear, that it is absolutely necessary for them to ' have proper council at the trial, to minutely examine ' his witnesses (as they are told he has a ' great many prepared) have it not in their present ' abilities to see council (as he too well knows and ' boasts of) unless charitably aided, as above requested; ' upon the strength of which he proposes ' taking his trial next sessions at the Old-Bailey, ' which begins to-morrow, and has given ' notice to the prosecutors, that he will surrender ' in court that day.</p>
               <p>' Donations will be most gratefully acknowledged ' in this paper, or in person by the unhappy ' sufferers, if admitted, and will be received by ' Mr.

               <p>The prisoner is the sole author of it, what I did was out of charity, he called upon me after he had left it with the printer, and told me he had made use of my name to receive donations for him; I consented to it, not thinking of the consequence.</p>
               <p>Capt. Morris. I n regard to Mr. Frip, I believe he was really innocent, and was lead into it by the prisoner Shortney.</p>
               <p>Q. to Egelsham. Did Mr. Frip come with Shortney when he brought the advertisement?</p>
               <p>Egelsham. He did not; as his name was to it, to receive donations, I went to him and asked him whether he was the author of the advertisement, he told me no. (His wife had said the same to Mr. Spavan before.) Mr. Frip said it was one Shortney that told him he had brought it to our house to be inserted, and after he had left it he called upon him and acquainted him therewith, that he had used his name, and that it was without his knowledge his name was made use of; and he passed it off, thinking it was a good-natured action, and did not trouble himself about it.</p>

The first thing they observ'd was a handkerchief with new linen in it, cut out into short lengths; upon which he was desirous of looking whether he could find any marks, and upon looking found one; there were 24 yards of it originally. He produced a piece of about three nails, and shew'd a mark that he said he could swear was his mark; that she had taken the key to let herself in. She having many followers he thought best to keep her out when she was out, upon which he fastened her out. She came that night, he look'd out and told her he did not look upon her as his servant, and desired her to call in the morning for her wages. When she came he desired her to walk up stairs that he might search her box. He shew'd her the linen and ask'd her how she came by it, she said she bought it of a linen-draper in Covent-Garden, but she could not tell his name, sign, or street. He sent a person with her to see if she could find out the shop, but they returned and she could not find it. He sent for a constable, and before the alderman she confessed the fact. He said she had been his servant about seven months, and had behaved well, till about the time she had warning given her, to go away.</p>

               <p>BRACHYGRAPHY: OR SHORT-WRITING Made easy to the meanest Capacity:</p>
               <p>The Persons, Moods and Tenses, being comprized in such a Manner, that little more than the Knowledge of the Alphabet is required to the writing Hundreds of Sentences in less Time than spoken. The whole is founded on so just a Plan, that it is wrote with greater Expedition than any yet invented, and likewise may be read with the greatest Ease.</p>
