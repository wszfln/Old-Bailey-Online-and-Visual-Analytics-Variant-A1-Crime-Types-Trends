She told me the prisoner had sold the body of it to her husband. We took the prisoner up, and had him in at Mr. Palmer's, a wine merchant. There, upon being charged with the fact, he confessed that he did it, and that he was alone when he did it</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what he meant by the words did it ?</p>
               <p>Gerrard. They talk'd of nothing else but the Tankard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reason. On the 21st of Sept. about 4 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I would buy a bit of old plate? There was another person with him who stood at the gate. The prisoner pull'd out of his apron an old body of a tankard, and said his father was dead and left it between his sister and him, and bid me be exact in setting it down, that he might not wrong her of a halfpenny. I asked him where he liv'd. He said he was a neighbour, and served his time to a carver. I bought it of him. In the evening I saw an advertisement concerning it; then I went to one Mr. Norden, and he and I went about to look for the prisoner. I found him on the Tuesday after. He persuaded me to let him go to his mother. I took him there. She gave me my money again, and I let him go, not knowing the consequence. There he took me aside, and said he took it himself, and that no-body was with him at the time. After that he was taken again, and brought before Mr. Fielding: there he attempted to impeach one Gentery, upon which Gentery was taken up; but did not say Gentery was concerned in this, but in other robberies. Gentery wanted to be admitted an evidence; but they neither of them would make an ample confession, so the justice said they should both be tried.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tankard body old or new?</p>
               <p>Reason. It was an old bruised battered thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Reason. I am a silversmith and sword-cutler.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith. I bought the cover of a tankard on the 21st of Sept. but can't say who I bought it of. I believe the prisoner is the man. He told me he serv'd his time to Mr. Gibson; and appeared a creditable man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give per ounce?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I gave 4 s. 6 d. per ounce, in the whole 25 s. There is no hall mark upon it. When first he came to me, there was a lame man with him who had a crutch.</p>
               <p>The cover is shown her.</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I believe that is it, but I don't swear it, for it has been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you his name?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. He told me his name, but I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak positively to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. Upon my oath I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner like the man?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I think he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the cover out of your custody?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. Mrs. Reason and the constable, and the prisoner's mother, came to me and paid me my money again, and took the cover away. I thought they had made it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the cover?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your custody?</p>
               <p>A. Montgomery. I believe I had it till the Wednesday after.</p>

            . I am the constable. I was ordered to search Mr. Reason's house, with a search warrant, for the body of a tankard. Mrs. Reason told me she could have me to a place where the cover was. She then took me to Mrs. Reculus's for the body of the tankard. After that we went to Mrs. Montgomery; there lay the cover in the show glass. Mrs. Reculus paid her 25 s. for it. This is the cover, it has been in my custody ever since. Mrs. Reason there compar'd the body and that together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body delivered to you at Mrs. Reculus's?</p>
               <p>T. James. Mrs. Reason might bring it from her own house for what I know; I did not see it before she took it out to try if the cover fitted. We went before justice Fielding, and he ordered the tankard into my custody. I was at the taking up of the prisoner, which was about a week after, at his mother's house. He voluntarily owned to me, he unhappily did this fact by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>T. James. He said he took it from Mr. Gerrard's at the King's Arms in Compton Street, from off a little shelf in the bar. He mentioned

            . I keep a silversmith's shop. The prisoner came to me about 8 o'clock in the morning, and asked me if I would buy a spoon? I looked at it, and asked her whose it was? she said she came honestly by it. I said it was not hers, stopt it, and desir'd her to tell the truth and she should have nothing done to her. She told me a man took her down into a cellar, at a baker's, and pull'd off his coat and laid it upon a sack, then pull'd off his breeches, and laid with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say this at first when you stopt the spoon?</p>
               <p>M. Reason. At first she told me she found it in the dust; I told her it did not look like that. I sent for a constable, and the mean while she said as before, and did not hesitate at all. I sent the constable down to the owner of the spoon, to see if he had lost one. The prisoner said the man was to provide lodging for her, and take her in keeping.</p>

               <p>He took me in the cellar, laid a sack on the ground, and laid with me; he said he had no money in his pocket, so gave me the spoon, telling me to bring it the next night at one o clock.</p>

               <p>T. Twells. He had been with me three weeks before. I miss'd the prisoner and the key. I was obliged to break open the stable door, and found the horse was gone. I was told by an ass-man that the prisoner was riding on him towards Hounslow; I went, and by making enquiry upon the road found the gelding at Belsound, at the Black Dog, the house of one Pryer. The prisoner was then taken up, and had before a justice of the peace.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house the 20th of July, about six o'clock; he asked for a dram of anniseed, after that he called for a pint of beer; he got off his horse; the ostler cleaned him; the horse sweat prodigiously; I asked him whose horse it was, and he said it was one 'Squire Buckley's, and that he was going to Salsbury to sell him, being ordered by the 'Squire so to do. I asked how the 'Squire came to trust him to sell him? he said he would sell him to me if I would buy him; I examined the horse, to see if he was lame or ailed ought, and found he was in health and sound. I asked him what he asked for the horse? he said 10 guineas; I then thought he stole him; I asked him if he'd take 5, and he said he would take 5 guineas and a half; then I gave him a guinea earnest, and said if he could prove he came honestly by him I would give him the rest, if not, I would take him before a justice of the peace. Then he said he brought him from the stable at the King's Arms in Swallow Street, and (upon my threatening him thus) he said if I would give him another guinea he would grab out his business. Then I charged a constable with him, and had him before 'Squire Goodchild, at legton. He told the justice he brought the horse from the King's Arms in Swallow Street. The justice desired I would go and find if there was any truth in that; and take him back till I returned, and then bring him again for his re-examination. I went; and when I came back again this Twells, the groom, and another man were in pursuit of the prisoner, and had got him at my house. The next day we went with him to the justice's, there the prisoner confess'd the whole of taking the horse out the stable, and I took the key out of his pocket; there his mittimus was made.</p>
               <p>Archiba'd Trumble. I went along with Major Burton's groom to - and was at the taking of the prisoner into custody. on Saturday the 21st of July, and heard him confess taking the horse out of the stable, and riding away with him.</p>

I laid hold on him; he threw it on the ground; I held him by the collar with one hand, and took the handkerchief up with the other. Then I sent to Billingsgate for a constable; before the constable came the prisoner pulled out a claspt knife and opened it. One Mr. Wright, a shipwright, who knew me, coming by, assisted me, for there were then two other persons who I believe belonged to the prisoner, for they wanted to get him loose. The constable came and took the knife from him; then he was taken to Guildhall and charged with it, but he there denied taking it.</p>

               <p>I was going down Darkhouse Lane eating, a bit of bread and cheese, with my knife in my hand, and the gentleman took hold of me, and accus'd me of picking his pocket; I saw it lying on the ground, and had taken it up; I said, Sir, if it is yours you may take it from the ground for I took it from thence, and flung it down again: and before I could put my knife up he took it out of my hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him drop the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>J Neal. I can't say I did.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to let his hands go before you had felt pockets?</p>
               <p>J. Neal. I had sent for a constable, so did not think it so well to search him till the constable came, and seeing I had got him safe in the house, I let go his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>J. Neal. He said but very little; he pretended to say a man in the room dropped it, but that man was known in the house to be a man of reputation.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>J. Neal. It cost two shillings, and it is almost new.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth one shilling?</p>
               <p>J. Neal. To be sure it is worth that (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

I had a basket of fruit against a post near the chapter house; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket as he was going by, on a Saturday night about 7 o'clock; the prosecutor was walking along with another gentleman, and the prisoner went between them, and with his right hand took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's right hand pocket; he made an attempt to put it under his arm. I ran to Mr. Neal and told him his pocket was pick'd, and went and held the prisoner fast by the neck till Mr. Neal came to him; after that, I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief in the Crown ale-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw the handkerchief fall from him?</p>

            . On Saturday was 7 night, I was along with Mr. Neal, I had hold of his arm, going by the chapter house, a man dressed in blue, I suppose it was this last evidence, said to Mr. Neal, you have had your pocket picked of a handkerchief. Mr. Neal ran and took hold of the prisoner's wrists and I his right arm. The prisoner said I saw a man throw a handkerchief into the rails, I felt with my stick and found it to be a cabbage leaf. We took him into a public house: Mr. Neal then let go his hands, after which I saw a handkerchief lying under his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>
               <p>Magniac. No, my lord, I did not. By the position it lay on the ground, it appeared as if it had slid down from under his coat.</p>

               <p>I was in that house, there were twenty or thirty people, one said here is a handkerchief lies here, now he has dropped it; another said, no, he has not, I was looking at him all the time. A gentleman said, turn him out of the door, I said don't turn that man out. When he was out, I said, let that man in again, but they said he should not come in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the watches taken away?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, they were both hanging in my window; there was a steel chain to one, and a catgut to the other. I had an occasion to go up stairs, upon which I locked the door and went up, and, at my coming down (not having been gone above two minutes) I found the sash was forced up, and the watches gone, and that some pencils and other things had fallen out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash fastened down?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. It was not properly fastened down. I had put in a nail to fasten it down, but it was too little for the gimblet hole. That night I went to justice Fielding's, and advertised the watches, but never heard any thing of them, till irish Ben turned evidence, which was about 6 weeks after. Then I heard one of them was at a pawnbroker's in Chiswell street. The prisoner was taken up; he then owned they had sold the other watch to a Jew in Angel court, Devonshire square. I went there but the Jew was gone.</p>

            's. I asked him to get up, he said he had got a watch in his pocket, marked with two fives and a one; I said, where did you get it? he said in St. Giles's, and after that he said at Hawkins's, at a stick shop in St. Giles's, and shewed me the house, as we were walking that way, and took out a hammer, and said, this is the hammer with which I wrenched the window up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230009"/>Harper. It was about a week after the last execution.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this watch.</p>
               <p>Harper. He takes it and opens it. This is the same watch, at that time the glass was loose, and he told me it was advertised; that it was advertised in a wrong name. About two days after I asked him if he would sell it, he said, yes, I will; then he asked me to go with him to a pawnbroker, a little man in Chiswell street I went and staid at the door while he went in and pawned it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hawkins. Do you keep a stick shop?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I have a row of sticks stand for sale at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value the watch at?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. At 3 guineas, I value them both at six pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Irish Ben told justice Fielding that I got the watch of a suckey cull, please to ask the pawnbroker about it.</p>
               <p>Erwin, to the question. I did hear the evidence say, that the prisoner told him he had it of a suckey cull, and Mr. Fielding said, Ben, what is the meaning of that word? his answer was, he could not tell.</p>

               <p>About three weeks ago I left work about nine at night - and went to the George alehouse, in Broad St. Giles's. I sat drinking there about an hour, going home at the end of Middle Row, a man came pushing against me, and pushed me down. I said, what do you mean by that? he said, don't be angry; I said you are a scoundrol for your pains; he said, let's drink together, so I went with him to drink. In about half an hour after we were there, he pull'd out a watch. I said, what is it o' clock? he said it was about a quarter after 10. I thought it strange to see such a poor ragged man with such a watch. I said to him you'll get yourself in some damage if you are seen with this, for he did not look as if he was used to wear a watch; he was in liquor, he came home with me to my own door; then he said, do you live here? I said yes; then he said, I wish you could help me to a chap for my watch, I said I cannot to night; he said if you'll take care of it I'll come on the morrow, and go along with you and sell it; so he delivered it to me, and I never saw him since, or before. I wore it in my pocket a fortnight.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nash. I am a coachmaker, the prisoner worked with me about 5 weeks, till he was taken up he behaved very well with me.</p>
               <p>Justice Olney. I have known him about fifteen months. I am a coachmaker, he worked with me that time, he behaved extremely well, I never missed any thing the time he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What might he earn a week ?</p>
               <p>Olney. He earned a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to part from him?</p>
               <p>Olney. Because business fell off.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He was within the length of the handkerchief, the prisoner offered to kneel down and beg pardon, and said it was another boy that went to pick my pocket.</p>

We got a warrant from justice Rickards, and took them up, and charged them with it before the justice, and they both denied it. I advertised the things, and on the 8th day the carpenter of the Dawkins, captain Beladine, came to me and told me he had seen on board their vessel cordage and such sails, and that one

Away ran the prisoner up into an alley; I followed him; he ran into a house, and we through the house; there lay the prisoner all alongside; I thought he had been dead; he tumbled out of a window; there we took him.</p>

When I arose in the morning, my breeches were missing, which I had hung upon a chair; after diligent search they were found in another room, opposite mine; in searching them there was no money at all, and the watch was gone, which I had wound up at going to bed, and laid in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten the door?</p>
               <p>Hall. N o, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come into the room after you were in bed?</p>
               <p>Hall. The Chamberlain did to take my candle away. I gave direction for advertising the money and watch in the Daily Advertiser, a day or two after, the purport of which was to apprehend the person that did it, and a reward for so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Hall. I never saw him before I saw him under examination before justice St. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Hall. He made no sort of confession; he absolutely denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Hall. About 11, or 5 or 10 minutes after.</p>
               <p>Question from the prisoner. Had you a candle or lamp burning in your room?</p>
               <p>Hall. I had a candle a little time, till the chamberlain fetched it away.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Did any body come to bring you water, or white wine whey?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230012"/>Hall. No.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Was you awake when the chamberlain came for your candle ?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Do you remember his coming in a second time ?</p>
               <p>Hall. No. I do not.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Are you sure he shut the door after him?</p>
               <p>Hall. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. I think you say in the advertisement you have lost a pinchbeck watch ?</p>
               <p>Hall. It is so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The watch I had was a gold out-side case, and pinchbeck gilt within. The watch produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hill. I am a watchmaker; I remember particularly well I made this watch, and remember selling it to Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you sell it him?</p>
               <p>Hill. About this time 12 months, about the 28th or 29th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the watch?</p>
               <p>Hill. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it gold or mettle?</p>
               <p>Hill. It is mettle; I sold it for such.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe I had 5 guineas for it, with a shagreen case to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the in-side mettle or gold?</p>
               <p>Hill. They are both mettle.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Hill. I sold it for such.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire some goldsmith may examine it, I will not take it upon his word, I know it if it was mine.</p>
               <p>Question to Hill. Is your name upon it?</p>
               <p>Hill. No. it is another name.</p>

            , a waiter at the Saracen's Head, came to me and described the prisoner at the bar, and told me he was gone Hounslow road. Then I went in pursuit after him; I enquired for him at the Red Lion at Hounslow; I heard of him when I came to Cranford-Bridge. I still pursu'd. When I arrived at Abington a gentleman's servant said he was a mile and a half on the other side Abington. I got Mr. Clemings, the Landlord at the Lamb at Abington, to go along with me, who said, very likely he may be at dinner at a place called the Dog-house. We had over-shot him, for after we were gone, he was seen going out of Abington. Then the people sent a man and horse for me back again. When I got back to the Lamb Inn they had just got him into a room. I charged the constable with him, and charged him with the robbery; then he swore that watch would be his death; he should never be quit of it. He had, before I came, throwed the watch over the house. and it was picked up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him what he meant by that expression ?</p>
               <p>Hutton. No, I did not; the prisoner was carried before the justice, and the watch produced there; he desired to have the watch in his own hand; the justice held it in his hand, but would not deliver it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say upon seeing it?</p>
               <p>Hutton. He said he believed it was the watch he had flung away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own he had thrown it away?</p>
               <p>Hutton. He did; the justice said if I would swear to the watch he would confine him, otherwise he could not keep him above six days; as I could not, he advised me to come to town for the prosecutor to swear to the watch, or he must be acquitted. I told the justice it was a long way to go, and may be I could not find him immediately, so as to bring him in time. I asked the justice if I could not take him up to town; the justice said he was afraid he would be rescued from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how he came by the watch?</p>
               <p>Hutton. He said he bought it for half a guinea, and that he bought it too cheap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why he throw'd it away?</p>
               <p>Hutton. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention that he bought it too cheap as a reason that he flung it away?</p>
               <p>Hutton. No; after some little time the justice said he would deliver him to my charge if I would take care of him to London. He delivered the watch to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Hutton. His name is Ellway; this was 3 miles beyond Abington. I took the prisoner to Abington; the goaler there had no handcuffs, so he sent me a pair of irons; thinking they would take up too much time putting on, I bought 2 horse-locks and got a chain and put them on him, and took him in a post-chaise to London. I left Abington about half an hour past 3 in the afternoon, on the 25th, and came to London about half an hour past<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230013"/> I in the night. I took him to justice St. Lawrence, and he there owned he had such a watch, but said it was disfigured by the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch there produced before him?</p>
               <p>Hutton. It was. He was re-examined on the Friday, and on the Wednesday following he was examined again, when Mr. Hall was come to town; then the prisoner owned the watch.</p>
               <p>Q Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Hutton. Much about this time 12 months the prisoner was caught in my house taking away some glasses and decanters; I never saw him but that time before this</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said before the justice I had a watch like that, and if they would let me look into it I would tell whether it was or was not mine; but they would not permit me to see into it.</p>
               <p>Court. You may look upon it. (he takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot be positive whether this is the watch I had or not, it is very much like it.</p>

            . I keep the Crown at Abington; the ostler at the Lamb came to me and told me there was a highwayman gone forward, and his master was gone after him; he wanted me to go along with him to help to take him; we saw the prisoner about half a mile out of town; the ostler went up to him, and said, how do you do, John? where are you going? said Tapling; what's the matter? I rode to him, and said, you must go back; he said he would; there were a pretty many people; I brought him to the Lamb; he gave his bundle to the ostler, and said he was going to make water; I saw him put his hand into his pocket and throw away a watch; then I told him he was detain'd for a robbery at the Bull and Gate, Holbourn; he said he was sorry for it; I saw, as the watch was up in the air, that it had a white face; in the mean time I told the people he had thrown a watch over the house; then I had him into a room and told him I would search him for fear of pistols; I felt on the outsides of his cloaths, and did not perceive any; he pulled off his wig and put on a cap, and said, this thing he should lose his life for; he should die for this thing; this he repeated several times; I said I hoped not, why do you think you shall be hanged for it? He said he bought the watch, and that he bought it too cheap. I said, what did you give for it? he answered, half a guinea. He pulled out a guinea and 9 s. and gave them to me, with a direction to send them to his son, a child he has in the country, and said he should never see it any more. Then I went with him to a justice of the peace, and told the justice I had got that money, and asked whether I should give it to the child or give it to him again. The justice ordered me to give it to the landlord at the Bull and Gate, and said, perhaps the guinea might be sworn unto. Coming back from the justice's to Abington the prisoner said he was sorry for it, and said several times he should be hang'd for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own the robbery ?</p>
               <p>Strange. No, he said he did not rob the gentleman, he bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you reconcile that of denying the robbery, and saying he should be hang'd for it?</p>
               <p>Strange. I said to him, if you came by it honestly, why should you be hang'd for it? he said, I know I shall die for this fact; because I bought the watch too cheap, and cannot find the man that I bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him who he bought it of?</p>
               <p>Strange. I did; I asked him if he was a Frenchman or an Irishman? he said he was something like a Jew; but could not tell the size of the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was told me there that I had robb'd the tapster at the Bull and Gate upon Black Heath, and he has but little kindness for me, and I have none at all for him, and that was the reason I said I should be hang'd for it, for I know, if he had said so he would swear it; after that I was told it was a fact committed on Hounslow Heath; and after that I was told it was a gentleman was robb'd at the Bull and Gate; then I made myself easy, because I knew I was not nigh there, and it was not in their power to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Question to Strange. Did you hear any such talk there as he mentions?</p>
               <p>Strange. No, I never did, not a word about Black Heath; I told him myself it was for a robbery at the Bull and Gate, London.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The tapster said it was on Black Heath.</p>
               <p>Strange. The tapster was not there at the time I told him where the robbery was committed.</p>

            . I am tapster at the Bull and Gate, Holbourn; I remember Mr. Hall being at our house on the 14th of Sept. When his money and watch were missing, and we had intelligence of the prisoner's being a suspected person and gone that road, I went with Mr. Hutton; we set out on the Wednesday about 4 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Tapling before ?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I did very well; he liv'd about 50 or 60 yards of us; he was waiter at the Blue Boar and George. We out-run the prisoner; we were in a post-chaise; then people came after us and informed us the prisoner was taken, so we came back and found him secured at the Lamb Inn at Abington; he was sitting in the middle of the room; I said to him, how do you do? he said, d - n my blood I now am sure to be hang'd for that d - n'd eternal watch that I threw over the house, naming number 2.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he say he should be hang'd?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Upon the account he bought it clandessinely; he said he bought it for half a guinea; I asked him where he lay that night? he said at Hemmings's Bagnio.

               <p>Robinson. He said d - n that number two, it will be the death of me. I understood him, as our rooms are numbered, and the room that Mr. Hall lay in was number 2.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other expression to make you believe he meant the room Mr. Hall lay in?</p>
               <p>Robinson. No.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Upon my first coming into the room I said I was informed I had robbed you of 30 guineas on Black Heath, and a gold watch; did you not say I should be hang'd, when I asked you this question?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. After that it was said I robbed him on Hounslow Heath; they were cautious in saying it was a gentleman that had been robbed at the Bull and Gate. I knew, my Lord, if this fellow said I robbed him he would swear it. Pray, Mr. Robinson, let me ask you one question; whether I did not ask you, upon your first coming into the room, whether I had robbed you of 30 guineas and a gold watch ?</p>
               <p>Robinson. No, he did not ask me that question then; but he did some time afterwards say to me, did I rob you of that gold watch and some gold ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then he said, No, you have not robbed me, I shall do you no injury at all.</p>
               <p>Question to Robinson. What answer did you make him?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I said, what do you mean by asking me that question? I never had a gold watch in all my life. I don't remember 30 guineas being mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q Did the prisoner at or before the time he said he should be hang'd say any thing concerning the reason of his being hang'd, because of your being willing to swear to the robbing of you ?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He offered to shake me by the hand, at my first coming into the room, which I refused; then I said to him, Mr. Tapling, what o'clock is it? he made answer, G - d d - n my blood I'm a dead man; at this time he had not said any thing of my being robb'd.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. He seems to hang upon number 2, I suppose he means that is the number of the room where Mr. Hall lay; I understood him it was the number of the watch, the last figure was 2.</p>
               <p>Question to Robinson, Did you or he mention number 2 first.</p>
               <p>Robinson. He mentioned it himself, I had not mentioned it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was any higher in that house than in the one pair of stairs room; I could not think of the numbers having never seen them.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Did you see me lurking about the house?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I should have made a very good defence if my witnesses could be found; I had two persons that could prove the buying of this watch, but they are at a great distance; I was desired by my father to put my trial off till the last day, and now my father is gone, and my principal witnesses and counsel are not here. I have no other thing to say for it, I bought the watch at Charing Cross, in the street, for half a guinea and 6 d. a man had it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230015"/> sell, and several persons were bidding money for it as well as myself, there were 8 or 10, or more.</p>

            . On the 10th of Sept. last I had been riding about my ground, as I was coming home I heard a knocking at a stile of mine; between 9 and 10 in the morning I rode across the field and there was the prisoner. I thought he was stealing my gate-irons, I seeing they were not gone I bid him go about his business; he us'd me with a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230017"/> deal of ill language; he had got a bundle with him. I told him I thought he had got some stolen goods there: he said, to let you know I have none of your gate-irons, I'll let you see; he opened the towel or napkin, there; I saw these brass pillars and a plate doubled up together; then I rode to some of my men and desired them to follow me; they did, we took him, and carried him to justice Green, he sent him to New Prison; he told the justice he had them of his mother in order to sell to buy some tools with the money.

I never saw them at Enfield, only I saw the case they were packed in; I have seen them in Hanover Square at my master's house there, and the case was broke open when I missed them.

I met this man with a girl; she left him; then he said to me I want to speak with you. I said, what do you want? he said no harm; he took up my cloaths; I said, what do you want? then he wanted to put his hand to my breast, after that he said he had lost his watch, then he stripped me as naked as ever I was in the world; I had neither shoe, stocking, cap or shift left on.</p>

She said come down the court. I went with her; she asked me to give her something to d, I said I should give her nothing; she held me fast; I don't know that I chang'd five-words with her; I never pull'd one rag of her cloaths off. After I charg'd her with taking my watch, the people of that house came out, then she strip'd herself; but she had time enough to give the watch to some of them before that; then a man brought out a candle, I could see her face plain, and she was not out of my sight before, so I knew her again.</p>

               <p>Austin. It was after she had snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to her, or she to you before she snatched your handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>Austin. Nothing at all; I told her if she would not give me my handkerchief again I would charge the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this woman, if she had had a mind to have rob'd you of your handkerchief, would have ask'd you to go along with her?</p>
               <p>Austin. I did not know what she meant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her for a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>Austin. Yes, but I did not know where the pipes were.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think she intended by it?</p>
               <p>Austin. I think she intended to keep my handkerchief, and for me to go along with her. When I said I wou'd charge the watch with her, she said to another woman that was along with her, Don't leave me, Nan. I call'd the watch; then the said she did not care, and I should go to the watch-house too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Austin. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have your handkerchief in your hand?</p>
               <p>Austin. There had been a parcel of fellows came by, and they had shoved me in the mud, and I was wiping myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the say when you charg'd the watch with her?</p>
               <p>Austin. She told the watch I had given her the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He gave me the handkerchief to lie with me; he cannot deny it except he swears wrong. Did I not go along with you and you us'd me as another man does a woman, and after you came from the pipes you call'd the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know where the pipes are; what he says is intirely false.</p>

            . A little after 10 o'clock, I was upon my duty, the prosecutor call'd, watch, I went to him; he said, this woman has rob'd me of my handkerchief. I took the woman and brought her to the watch-house, and said to Austin, friend, you must go along with me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Stroud. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Stroud. She said he gave her the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That watchman never saw me in his life.</p>
               <p>Stroud. She is a very bad woman; we have had her in custody divers times. We have carried her to the Counter, to London Work-house, and to Bridewell; she goes by the name of Irish Peggy in the night-time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times can you swear you have seen her?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I can swear I have seen her 10 times. In the seven years I have been there I believe we have had her in the watch-house ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in the last three years?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I can swear to half a score.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not been in London three years.</p>
               <p>Stroud. She was three months or thereabouts in London Work-house about a year ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He did give me the handkerchief indeed to lie with me, and he did lie with me, and gave it me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230019"/> afterwards: he never spoke a word to me after that till he came to the watch-house. Then he began to rail against me like any thing. There were two other watchmen heard him say he gave it me to lie with me, and they would not let them come here.</p>
               <p>Oarm. The prisoner is one of the most notorious whores we have in the whole ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had a witness, but she is gone, to prove I am an honest woman, and work hard for my living.</p>

I saw the prisoner catch his hand very quick from the gentleman's pocket. I ask'd him if he had lost any thing ? he said, no; his handkerchief was safe in his other pocket. I searched the prisoner and found four linen handkerchiefs and an old one in his pockets. I knowing the prisoner to be very common about Cheapside, walking backwards and forwards, I took him to Guild-hall; after he had been examined by Alderman Cockayne, coming out to go to Newgate, he said he ought to have been transported seven years ago; and then he had been a clear man by this time coming home again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Tuffnell. I shewed the Alderman the handkerchiefs. The prisoner said his mother was a Washerwoman, and he was sent to the Fleet-market with four shirts tied up in the four handkerchiefs to four people, but could not tell the houses or people's names.</p>
               <p>Charles Hill. Coming out of the Mansion-house last Tuesday was se'nnight, I saw a young man walk between the palisadoes and a gentleman, and he put his hand in the gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him?</p>
               <p>Hill. As close by him as I could stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that young man?</p>
               <p>Hill. The last witness took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tuffnell. Did you take any other person in custody at that time?</p>
               <p>Tuffnell. No, none but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Hill. Tuffnel asked the gentleman if he would stay and see him searched? he said, he had his handkerchief in his other pocket. Then Tuffnel searched him, and took him to the Compter, and after that to Guild-hall.</p>
               <p>The handkerchiefs were produced in court, all of them looked as though they had been worn in the pocket since wash'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been at work, and came home to my mother; she said she was very ill; I said I was very sorry for it; she sent me to carry 4 handkerchiefs, with a shirt in each, to the persons she washed them for. She described the houses, and told me which handkerchief belonged to such person. (The old silk handkerchief was my own pocket handkerchief. I delivered the shirts; the people said they would not pay me, they would pay my mother when they brought their dirty linen. Coming back I push'd against this gentleman, and a man came, and said, I know him to be a disorderly fellow; they took and dragged me to the Compter directly. I made no resistance at all.</p>

I thought I saw a glimpse of my handkerchief coming out of my pocket, by a quick motion.

I believe she lay two hours or more. When she got up I asked where she would go and lay ? she said at nurse Watson's (who was one of the nurses of the house.) I thought the prisoner belonged to the House. She desired I would wait upon her to the gate and see her in, and she would come in the morning and return me thanks. I saw her in at the gate, and when she had got a little way she ran; I went back and found my watch gone, which I hung at my bed, and had done for 19 years; when I had wound it up I always hung it there. I ran and called to the corporal of the guards if he had let any body out ? he said, yes, a servant to an officer of the guards, and that she said she would be back presently, Egad, said I, she will not come back any more, for she has got my watch. I ran after her, but could not find her that time; but she had not had the watch above an hour before she was stopt with it at the Round-house in St. Martin's Lane. She was carried before justice Cox, and there she swore that doctor Ward's man gave it her for 3 or 4 shillings. There was a seal which I valued; I desired her to let me have it and I would give her a shilling, tho' it was not worth a penny; she said if I would go back with her to Bridewell she would give it me, which I did and gave her the shilling.</p>

After Mr. Hanson had described the watch, the justice said, he believed it was his; she said she had it from doctor Ward's man, who gave it to her for 3 or 4 shillings; when he came he denied it. When the prosecutor claimed the watch and seal, she said she would give him the seal for a shilling if he would go back to Bridewell, and he went and had it.</p>

               <p>Mary Turton. Last Wednesday was se'nnight, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going from London to Newington; being in a field beyond <placeName id="t17541023-38-crimeloc189">Newington green</placeName>

He said, your money, madam, your money. I hesitated a little time, I did not know whether he designed to rob me or not. Then he said your money, madam, and your purse. I said I have no purse; I took out what silver I had, and gave it into his hand; I believe there might be about 8 s. of it. Then he said I have taken up this trade for want, and am in great stress, and have been all about to enquire for work and can get none. He then went away; so when I thought myself clear of him, I called to a man and a boy, whom I saw in another field, and said I had been robbed by a man, and pointed which way he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man that robbed you when you pointed ?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. No, I did not. After they understood me, I saw them run the way that I pointed. I told them that I was going to Newington, and desired if they took him to bring him to me. I went on and met other people, and sent them after them. I had not been at Newington, at the house of Mr. Carter, a boarding school, above three quarters of an hour before they brought a man to me, I went out to him and said, you villain, you robbed me; he made me no answer as I remember, there was a great croud about him. I desired the gentleman to let me go into the parlour, which he did and shut the door, and saw no more of him at that time. Then they sent for the constable and secured him, and I took coach and came home. The next morning I went to justice Fielding's, and the man was brought there, but could not then swear to his face, but swore I thought him to be the man. I looked at the pistol when I was robbed, and not at the man's face. I told the people the man that had robbed me was in a dark coat, and the man they brought had a dark coat, and he answered the description.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you now say you believe, or are you sure this is the man?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. I believe that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the man they brought to you?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. The very same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the justice's, when charged with it?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. He denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you see a mask on the man's face?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. No, I saw none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, I hope the person's face might be perfectly seen, and what sort of buttons were to the man's coat?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. I can't describe them.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What waistcoat and breeches?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. I don't know</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether the person's hat was flapped or cocked?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230023"/>M. Turton. I think it was flapped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said before the justice she thought it was a tinderbox pistol.</p>
               <p>M. Turton. No. I said I looked earnestly on the pistol, and was not sure at first whether it was a tinderbox or not, but I saw afterwards it was no tinderbox.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone?</p>
               <p>M. Turton. No, my daughter, a girl about 14 years of age, was with me, and she was very much frightened as well as myself</p>
               <p>Joseph Saunders. Last Wednesday was se'nnight, about two in the afternoon, I saw a man along with the prosecutrix, in a field behind Newington green, I was in the next field spreading of dung. I saw him also go from her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from her at that time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. About 100 yards.</p>
               <p>Q Were they any time together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They were together but a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what they were doing?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him before he came to her?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other but they two together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. There was the gentlewoman's daughter. After the man was gone she called to me and said that man has robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man when she called to you ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, he was in fight then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might they be distant from each other at the time she called ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. About 60 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was then in fight ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I am sure he was. I ran after him about a mile and a half, and never lost sight of him till he was taken. I called out for assistance, and a soldier whose name is Hewit, ran and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken?</p>
               <p>Saunders. We took him between Canbury house and Newington green.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone when the gentlewoman call'd to you ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, my brother, a little boy, was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He is about 10 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the prisoner when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I believe I was about 60 yards at the time. We then carried him to Newington town to the gentlewoman. Upon her seeing him, she said this is the man that frightned me, and said he had a pistol in his pocket. We searched him, and the took a pistol out of his pocket. Produced in court. There was no flint in it or charge, there was only a piece of paper put down the barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon this ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He said he did it for need. that he had got a wife and two children, and his wife way to lie down again, and that he had been about to get work and could get done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention what his trade was?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He said he was a taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the person which you saw with the gentlewoman ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was his coat ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What buttons?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hat cocked or not?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was cocked all round, but when we took him he flapped it. I went with him to justice Fielding's, the prosecutrix was there. The justice asked him what he carried that pistol for, he said for fear any body should molest him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any gunpowder or ball upon him?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I don't know that there was either.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you speak to this witness soon after you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. As soon as I thought myself safe from the person that robbed me I called. This was one of the people at work in the field. I also saw more people coming.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this witness at work at?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I saw some heaps of dung near him, I think he was spreading them about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come near you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, he d id not, but he ran towards the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you called to him, did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not, but I pointed the way he was gone. I saw the man at work in the field a little before I was robbed, and while he was robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his making use of that expression, of doing it for want, at the time he was brought back to you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. To be sure he said something, but I was in such confusion, I can't upon my oath mention what words he said; I believe he made use of words to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230024"/>Q. from prisoner. Did you never lose sight of me ?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you say you lost sight of the man to the soldier, or you had taken him sooner?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the fields all open from the place the woman was, to the place where the prisoner was taken?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, we took him in a lane.</p>

            . I was going from the Thatched-house, Islington, last Wednesday was se'nnight, between 2 and 3 o'clock towards Newington-green, by the river side I saw 3 men running, one was at some distance before the other two, they cried, stop him, stop him. I thought at first they had been only playing of tricks; when they came up almost to me, they told me that man had robbed two gentlewomen; then I pursued him, and caught him, and held him till Saunders came up; then I asked him where the gentlewomen were gone, he said to Newington, or Newington green. Then we took the prisoner to Mr. Carter's, and the gentlewoman came out to him into the yard, and said, this is the rogue that robbed me, and said he has a pistol in his pocket, without a flint in it. I searched his pocket, and found one without a flint in it, with a bit of paper put down the barrel, and no charge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Hewit. He seemed to be very sorry, and said he did it out of want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did what?</p>
               <p>Hewit. Why, did the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what trade he was?</p>
               <p>Hewit. He did, he said he was a taylor, and that he had been enquiring about for work at several places that day, and could not get any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him for any thing else, besides the pistol?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No, we did not, I can't tell whether he had any money in his pocket or not,</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured clothes had he on?</p>
               <p>Hewit. He had a brownish coat, with yellow buttons, and his hat cock'd up all round. As I had hold of him in the yard he desired I'd let him go and speak to the gentlewoman, to try to get off. I went in with him, he told the gentlewoman he was sorry for what he had done, and he would do any thing that lay in his power to make her amends. She said she could not say any thing to him till the morrow. She was prodigiously frightned. He was taken away by the constable, and the next day carried before justice Fielding. The justice asked him how he came to carry pistols? he said, that was in his own defence, fearing any body should molest him.</p>
               <p>Q Did he say he was in debt?</p>
               <p>Hewit. No, he did not.</p>

            . On Wednesday was 7 night, betwixt two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going to Newington, and saw Saunders pursuing the prisoner; the prisoner had passed me. Saunders said he had robbed two ladies of some money, upon which I ran after him, and got before him to stop him; the soldier was just upon him, and laid hold of his collar. We took him to Newington, to the house where the gentlewoman was, she came out and said that was the man. I saw the pistol taken out of his pocket. The prisoner seemed very still a little time, after that he said he did it for want; that he had no work to do, and could get none, and was obliged to do it. He said he was a taylor. They sent for a constable and took him to New-prison, and the next day before justice Fielding, but I was not at the justice's the first time, I was on his second examination.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish, and had just been with a person to New-prison, as I met them bringing the prisoner there, which happened to be the same day he was taken. I said I had heard he had got 15 s. from the people he had robbed; upon which the prisoner said he had got but eleven. He pulled out eight shillings and sixpence, and a half crown, and said he had never a farthing when he came from home, and said, here is all I have got, and delivered it into the turnkey's hands. Then I asked him how he came by the pistol; he said he gave five shillings and six-pence for it in Holbourn; and confessed he took from the prosecutrix and her daughter eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Was your daughter robbed at the time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She was, of half a crown, and a six-pence. I am not certain how much money I had in my pocket, it was about 4 s. and the rest of my money was in six-pences. I swear rather under than over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you had in your pocket to the amount of 8 s. 6 d?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, my lord. I do believe I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take all you had?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. By accident there was six-pence left behind.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of Oct. about 9 o'clock in the morning. I set out from home to seek for work: I am a taylor; the first place I called at was at Mr. Eaton's at Islington, finding no work there I went on to Newington, and called at Mr. Dickson's, in Church-street : the next I called at was Mr. Myers's, in the same street : the next was at Mr. Griffith's, in Church street; not meeting with work there I went on to Tottenham High-Cross; from thence to Edmonton. Meeting with no work, I from thence returned back for home. Coming up Church-street again, keeping straight along by the river side, I saw two or three men come running towards me from out of the fields on my left hand; I did not know what their intent might be, I ran from them, and they pursued me: After that I met a man, and went on about two fields farther, and then I saw another man coming cross the fields towards Newington-green; that man crossed over one of the bridges on the right hand into the fields, I kept straight along. These men still pursued me. By that time I got cross another field they got pretty near me; they called, stop him, stop him. There were two men coming along, one of them was a soldier. I turned from the river to the left hand down a lane, and before I had got twenty yards down it, a man crossed the fields and jumped down from a bank upon me, and said, d - n you, I have catched you, you have robbed two gentlewomen in such a place. I, in running, was not able to speak, or say any thing in my own defence. The man went to strike at me, I held up my arm and desired him not to use him ill. Then the other came and said he is my prisoner, and catched me by my collar. Then Saunders came up to us, and the others inquired of me where the gentlewoman was to be found that had been robbed: Saunders said at Newington. Then they took me along the river side, going along Saunders said I lost sight of him a good while, or else I had not let him run so far as he did. When I came to Newington town, I untied my hat, because I would not be exposed to the public. Then they took me to several places to inquire for this gentlewoman, and at last they found her. Then she said, that is the man that robbed me, and he put a pistol to my breast and wanted my money. There were about 30 or 40 people about me. Somebody there produced a pistol directly, and said they took it out of my pocket. I never had any occasion to use any such thing. After that they charged the constable with me, and took me to New-Prison, and put me into a little room, where there were many irons hanging about, which was a great shock to me, that had done no ill in my life before. The turnkey said, if you have any money about you, I'd advise you to give it to me, and you shall have it safe again from my hands. I was much obliged to the man, thinking he would save the money for me. When the constable came the turnkey pulled the money out of his pocket, which I gave him, and said, young man, there is the 11 s. you gave me last night, and gave it to the constable. I was taken before justice Fielding, there the gentlewoman was examined concerning what had happened; she told him it was a man in a darkish coat that did the robbery, she did not swear to me.</p>

            . I am a taylor, the prisoner served me in the capacity of a clerk, he came about the beginning of last Dec. and served me till the latter end of March. I believe, during the time he was with me, 400 l. went through his hands. I then did really believe him to be as honest a man as any. He had a great deal of liberty to have robbed me of a hundred pounds. There were very few weeks but he laid out 20 l. for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has he?</p>
               <p>Walker. He has a wife and 2 small children, and she is ready to lie down again.</p>

            . I was driving the coach in which were my master and mistress. About 20 yards before we came to a place called Branns, between 12 and 1 o'clock on Easter Monday, the prisoner bid me stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Partridge. I did not then; I kept on and did not stop; he bid me stop again, but did not; then he held a pistol to me, and swore, d - n your blood if you don't stop I'll blow your brains out this instant; upon that I stopt : then he rode to the coach door and said, d - n your blood ( to my master ) deliver your money and your watch. I saw my master deliver his money and watch to him; and when we were coming home the Saturday after, we met the prisoner, in the same dress he had before, unmask'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you meet him?</p>
               <p>Partridge. It was about 300 yards this side Padington</p>
               <p>Q What colour were his cloaths?</p>
               <p>Partridge. He had a chocolate coloured great coat, a cinnamon coloured coat, and a velvet crimson coloured waistcoat; the same coloured cloaths, and a brown cut wig, he had each time. I told my master, here is the man coming that robbed you. Then he ordered me to stop; this was 20 yards before he came to us; he was then unmask'd. I took much notice of him as he pass by us; by his dress and size I imagined him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the same horse?</p>
               <p>Partridge. No, he was not; he did the robbery on a dark brown horse, with 2 white feet behind, but then he had a bay horse; he was then going the Harrow road. I never saw him after this till I saw him in Newgate; then they put him amongst, I believe, 14 or 15 people; I was desired to go in and lay hold of the man, and I went and took hold of the prisoner by the arm, and said, that was the man that robb'd my master; he is the man I saw at Padington; and he is the man I saw masked. As soon as I set eyes on him at Padington I recollected him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before he stopped you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230027"/>Partridge. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. He says he never saw me before he was robb'd; how should you know me if my face was mask'd?</p>
               <p>Partridge. I only knew him by his dress and size when I met him again coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him speak?</p>
               <p>Partridge. Yes, I did, but I cannot swear to his voice, for when a man is masked it alters his voice.</p>
               <p>John Lane. I keep the Gray-hound in Drury-Lane; the prisoner once dined at my house, along with a gentleman; he told me he was a doctor; he brought some physick for the gentleman; I believe it was some time in August last; he lay there one night. In the morning he came down stairs and called me into the dining room, and asked me to lend him 5 guineas on the watch (producing a gold watch ) I said, you are an utter stranger to me; he said, I am going to Oxford to see a brother, and I'll be up again on Monday; this was on Friday; so I lent him 5 guineas upon his watch, and have had it ever since, he never came to redeem it. He then went by the name of Joh nson.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Matthews. Look at this watch; do you know it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. This is my watch, this is the watch that I lost the time I mention.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Partridge the coachman to Newgate, at the desire of justice Fielding, to see whether he knew Mr. Flemming, and he desired I would take particular care that he was put amongst a number of people, to see if he could find him out. I told the keeper what the justice sent me for. After he was turned in to find him out from about 10 or a dozen, he particularly distinguished him from the others. Before we went from the justice's the justice desired the coachman to look upon the table, and see if there was any thing he knew; there lay a gold watch and a silver one; the coachman said, that gold watch is my master's, that he gave 28 guineas for it and 5 guineas for the seal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When the coachman came with Mr. Pentilow to view me, there were 3 or 4 more about my fire with me; a person named Grizon saw me both noted and pointed at; he had a proper description of me, and it was a considerable time before he could fix upon me, and when he did he was ready to drop down. Will your Lordship indulge me to have him brought down? he is an entire stranger to me, I never changed ten words with him in my life; I do not deny having the watch in my custody; I had it of one Mr. Prescote in Bow-Street; he and I were prodigiously intimate; I lent him 8 guineas upon it. I hope the court will be so good as to remember my character on my former trial. See number 447 in last session-paper.</p>

               <p>Straton. I don't know that he was there; I was surprized at the coachman knowing him; I thought that he knew him perfectly well, and the prisoner changed his cloaths too at the time.</p>

I had missed money several times, which was the occasion of my marking some halfpence, which I did at a baker's near me. I marked 6 s. worth. At night, on the 14th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230028"/> Sept. I took out all the halfpence from the drawer and put in the marked ones, and on the next day (being Sunday I made an enquiry and found some were taken out; I made a general charge, and said, I had lost some halfpence; the prisoner came into the parlour and said she had took them out, and produced them with others not marked. I asked her what were in her box; she opened two boxes, in one she said there was something that was not her own; I found a loaf of sugar and a small parcel of tea, and 5 single pounds of sugar. We made a farther search, and found under the bolster of her bed another loaf of sugar tied up in a handkerchief, and in a closet (where were foul linen) there we found two parcels of tea, in quantity about a pound in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What might that be worth?</p>
               <p>Austin. It might be worth a dozen shillings, I have valued it at 6 s. After this I laid them all together, and called two servants up stairs, and let them see how I had been used by her; she confessed then before them, and has also done since, that she took those things out of the shop, and the reason she gave for so doing was, she said, she thought somebody had divers times come into her room and tumbled about her things, and she wanted to know who it was that came into her room, and by that she should find, by people saying they had found those things, who it was that came there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Austin. She has lived with me 2 years and 2 months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not used to lay out money to buy things into the house?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, she did not, except she came and asked me or my man for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not she the liberty to go to the till?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, she had not for a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not take money in the shop?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, she did not; once the porter and she were at home together, and she took a penny for that which was worth a groat or fivepence; so she is not a fit person to serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had the halfpence ?</p>
               <p>Austin. She said she took them out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. To what purpose did she say she took them out?</p>

             were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say she took the halfpence out to lay out for the family ?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend her immediately after you had searched her box?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, I consulted with a friend what to do; and when I came home she was gone, and I cannot say I was sorry then, but I did not think things to be so black as they appear since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not come back again ?</p>
               <p>Austin. Yes, she did. I think on the Tuesday; then I was not at home; she wanted her cloaths</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come after that ?</p>
               <p>Austin. Yes she did, the next day; then I sent for a constable, intending to call her to an account for what she had wronged me of. She accounted for some things that she had lately bought, by saying a person died and left her money.</p>
               <p>Q Did not you give her some cloaths?</p>
               <p>Austin. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not charge a constable with her?</p>
               <p>Austin. I said she has given an account how she came by some things; and it was possible she might go and live at some farm-house, and get a livelihood without injuring any person; and while we were consulting this she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come again?</p>
               <p>Austin. She came again the next day; I said you have a consummate impudence; then she disappeared immediately. After that she was sent for to Mr. Rhodes, a publick-house; I was there in order to apprehend her, and did when she came.</p>
               <p>Q Were both her boxes locked when you went up to them?</p>
               <p>Austin. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Could other people have access to this room?</p>
               <p>Austin. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard she is with child ?</p>
               <p>Austin. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear by whom?</p>
               <p>Austin. I have heard she was by me.</p>
               <p>Council for the crown. Upon your oath did you ever give occasion for such report?</p>
               <p>Austin. I never in my days had any concern with her; I never showed an indecent action, or used an immodest expression to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man?</p>
               <p>Austin. I am not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brockass. On Sunday the 15th of Sept. I dined at Mr. Austin's. I lived next door to him then. After dinner he went down stairs to fetch up some tobacco. When he came up he said he had been robbed, and called his servants into the dining-room, and asked them about the money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230029"/> two of them denied it, the porter and the journeyman; the maid, being the third person accused, confessed having the halfpence and produced them. She said she took them out with an intent to put them in again, and that she had done so twice before, and had put them in again; the last time was the Sunday night before, and had put them in on the Monday morning following. She said her master having had a suspicion of her, so she took them that he might find her out. Mr. Austin insisted upon seeing if she had any thing concealed in her bed chamber; he first examined some band boxes, and after that a little trunk that was locked; there were only cloaths and money, silver and gold; after that he persisted seeing into a large box. She said, Sir, here are things that are not mine in it. There we found a loaf of sugar and a handkerchief, in which were 4 parcels; and 2 loose papers, whether they contained tea or sugar I cannot tell. After that I examined about the room, and found in a closet among some cloaths, 2 paper parcels; and under the bolster of her bed I found a sugar load tied up in her handkerchief. Upon examining her about the tea, she said she took it out of the top canister in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she acknowledge the sugar was her master's, or whether she had it from another place?</p>
               <p>Brockass. I cannot particularly say she acknowledged that to be his; she, in general, acknowledged putting them there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words, that it must come out, or she took the tea out of the cannister?</p>
               <p>Brockass. She said she took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was she there ?</p>
               <p>Brockass. She was Mr. Austin's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. The only maid servant?</p>
               <p>Brockass Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say it was tea to drink?</p>
               <p>Brockass. I am certain she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bid you go and search in the closet?</p>
               <p>Brockass. I went of myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think to search under the bolster of her bed for sugar? Did Mr. Austin direct you to go there?</p>
               <p>Brockass. No, he did not; he was talking to her of what a wretch she was, and I began to search about at that time; I looked at the tester of the bed, and in every corner of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not she have made her escape if she would after this.</p>
               <p>Brockass. She might.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself ?</p>
               <p>Brockass. She said she suspected her master would have been looking about in her room to see if he could find any thing; and she put the sugar there thinking he would find it upon her, she having had her things and letters tumbled about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the meaning of what she said ( that she had had her things tumbled about, and she put them there to know who tumbled them about?)</p>
               <p>Brockass. It might. The halfpence produc'd in court.</p>
               <p>Brockass. These she brought and deliver'd to her master; they are marked on the Britannia upon the head with a file. She told him she took them out of the drawer, and that she had put them to her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard it reported there was a familiarity between her master and she?</p>
               <p>Brockass. I have heard it reported since she went to prison; there was no suspicion or report about it before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the neighbours observed nothing at all by her appearance?</p>
               <p>Brockass. The neighbours observed she went very fine in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live near the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Brockass. I lived about three months next door to him; I never suspected any familiarity between them. I really believe there never was any.</p>

            . I know nothing of the halfpence. On the 14th of Sept. Mr. Austin came to me and said he wanted to speak with me; he with a good deal of concern told me he had great reason to suspect some of his servants had robb'd him; that he had mark'd some halfpence, and missed some out of his drawer last Saturday; I said how did you mark them? he said he scratched them with a pin. I said that is not the way; let's mark some more; then he went and scratched five shilling's worth of halfpence, and with a three corner'd file, we mark'd about four shilling's worth of them before a customer of mine came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who marked them?</p>
               <p>Sibley. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you mark them?</p>
               <p>Sibley. I gave a little scratch just by the head of the woman, on all alike; he marked the other shilling's worth, or thereabouts, I can't say to a halfpenny, but I looked at every one of them. I told them to see if there were 5 s. or not. I said, you should do a few more; then I marked a shilling's worth of my own, and he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230030"/> me a shilling for them.

            . I have known the prisoner about a year or two, I never saw her before she came to live with Mr. Austin; she has several times bought goods of me, and paid me very honestly; I never heard any thing of her but that of a reputable person.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did she buy of you?</p>
               <p>Uraim. They were linen goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How much at a time?</p>
               <p>Uraim. Ten or a dozen shillings at a time. I know nothing of her more than her coming to buy goods of me.</p>
               <p>Jos. Reves. I have known her about a year, as a house-keeper generally reported.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>Reves. I believe she behav'd becoming that of an honest servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any thing ill of her?</p>
               <p>Reves. No, only her being free with her master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she would be guilty of stealing sugar and tea from her master?</p>
               <p>Reves. No, I don't think she would.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge of her being familiar with her master?</p>
               <p>Reves. No, I do not; it is generally reported that Mr. Austin and she were familiar by the manner of her dress. Mr. Sibley gave a relation of a case before she was confined in goal 5 or 6 months. He was joaking with Mr. Austin, as men will do. Mr. Austin said, you have nothing against me; I mind not your joaking. Said Mr. Sibley, you once borrowed a pair of boot-straps of me, and I asked you for them : you said you could not tell where they were, and said to your servant, do you know any thing of them? and said they are leather, with holes in them; She said, O! they are in my master's great coat-pocket upon my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sibley. Do you remember any thing of this conversation?</p>
               <p>Sibley. We had got to a neighbour's house smoaking a pipe one afternoon, joaking about Mr. Austin's maid going so fine, and better than trademen's wives; she would be dressed by ten in the morning, and our wives could not till four in the afternoon; I said, I can make you blush. No, said he, you can't. Said I, do you put me to the challenge? then I said, I'll out with it; and said some time ago you borrow'd a pair of great-coat straps to buckle a great coat on before, and I went there, and you was not at home; and presently your maid came in. I said to her, do you know any thing of a pair of great coat straps I lent your master to buckle on a great coat? She said, O lord! I believe they are in my master's coat-pocket on my bed. I said, what has your master's coat to do upon your bed? She said, I put it on my bed to keep me warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe they were familiar together?</p>
               <p>S ibley. Upon my word I don't think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe it then?</p>
               <p>Sibley. I can't say what I might believe then?</p>
               <p>Q. to Reves. By what do you look upon her to be honest?</p>
               <p>Reves. She has come to our shop to buy salts and other little articles, and always paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to say she is honest?</p>
               <p>Reves. I have no other reasons only by that.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem to accuse the master of too great familiarity with her. Will you now come and give her the character of an honest woman, because she came to your shop and paid you for some salts ? If she was her master's whore, could she be honest ?</p>
               <p>Reves. I say so, because she generally bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you reckon that, having a good character, if what you say is true?</p>
               <p>Reves. There may be a great many people in England guilty of fornication that will not rob.</p>

               <p>Palmer. I believe it was 4 l. per year.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merrit. I was her opposite neighbour 12 months ago, but am now removed; I always took her for a sober honest person; I never saw to the contrary; I do not look upon her to be a person that would be guilty of stealing tea: I would not now scruple taking her into my house was she at liberty.</p>

On the 8th of July at 11 at night I went down as usual into the warehouses, to see if all was safe; there is a door that comes out into Durham-yard, that was safe locked and bolted; there was a passage from this door which was locked, which leads into the other warehouse, which I call the second warehouse, in which was an iron door which was then locked, in which was a chest in a cavity in the wall, in which were these things mentioned in the indictment; it is a place of security to preserve things from fire. In the morning about 7 l ordered the porter to take down some broken glass, which he, attempting to do, found the door that enters the stairs from the house fastened within-side.</p>

               <p>Q. Had that us'd to be open?</p>
               <p>Holland. It did, to go down; he call'd to me to shew me that he could not open it: I attempted to open it but could not; then I sent him up into the shop for an iron instrument with which we rench'd the door open, and on the inside found the key push'd in above the latch to prevent its rising. I asked the porter if he did it; he said no. I sent him then for the broken glass, he went and returned, and said there was something amiss below. I went with him, when I came to the bottom of the stairs I found a parcel of bricks, and this instrument, (producing the head of a paviour's new pick-axe.) I found the iron door open, and the lock taken off the wooden chest that was inclosed within the iron door, was three parts or better drawn out; it had a sliding lead which was pushed back, and two bags that contained the cash mentioned in the indictment, were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the bags there?</p>
               <p>Holland. I am sure there was that money in them, I put it there my self the day before; the notes were there also.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest locked?</p>
               <p>Holland. No, it was not. About four yards from that iron door I found a box open that had several pieces of plate in it, which box was some time before delivered to me to be put into the chest by Mrs. Nobbs, lapp'd up in brown paper, tied and seal'd, and said it contain'd plate, the property of Mrs. Mallery. When I went into the other vault, which had a door out into Durham-yard, I saw four holes bored in that door, one under each bolt, and two that came opposite to the wooden bar that went a-cross, and the box that the lock shot into I found had been forced from the door-post, from this I imagined it must be done by some body that had lived in the house; and the prisoner being the last person that went away from us, I suspected him; so the next day I went to a shop in a passage, either Red Lion or Gray's Inn passage, near Red Lion square; I am not sure of the name, where his aunt and mother live; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230032"/> asked if they knew

             I saw. I observed there had been two or three pinches taken at the frame of the iron door to force it out. After which I imagine they took down the brickwork in order to get two hands in, by which means the nuts of the screws were taken off with-inside, then the door was thrown open; the lock was found amongst the rubbish.</p>

            , and live in her house. I was out of town when this affair happened, and had been ten or twelve days; I am not able to give any account of the quantity of money put into the chest. The note for 31 l. 10 s. was transacted when I was abroad; the place that was broke in the cellar was built on purpose for the security of books and money. When I came to town I suspected the prisoner on the account of his telling me he was going into the Excise, when he gave me warning to leave my service; he had left me just a month when I was robb'd; and from the situation of the place, I was pretty certain it must be some body well acquainted with the house that broke it open. I applied to one Mr. Mellish, one of the Commissioners of the Excise, to know whether such a person was appointed for the Excise or not. He went the next day in order to be satisfied, although it was not his turn, he called, and told me there was no such person appointed, nor no such had made application; this confirmed my suspicion. Upon this I advertised the note and money, and described the prisoner, with a reward of twenty guineas for his person. He was taken up by one that knew him, and when he was brought before Mr. Fielding, I was sent for; he there made a full and ample confession, not only of the manner in which he did the burglary, but where he bought the instruments; that he bought a cooper's auger somewhere in Hockley in the Hole; and that he likewise bought a pick-axe with which he forced the lock of the vault door next to Durham yard, and with the same pick-axe pull'd down the brickwork, in order to get at the lock of the iron door; and that he took away the bags out of the repository, and that he got in about the hour of twelve; and I think he staid there about an hour. Mr. Fielding then ordered him to be searched; there were taken out of his pocket 7 guineas and a half, some silver, and a medal, which I have here, and a very remarkable half crown, a William and Mary very finely preserved. Mr. Fielding asked him whose money it was; he said his master's, and that he had it out of his bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean by his master ?</p>
               <p>Nobbs. He pointed to me. Mr. Fielding bid me put them in my pocket and keep them by themselves. The prisoner gave an account of this without being asked; he also, which was remarkable, mentioned the pick-axe, which at that time had not been shewn to him, which we found among the rubbish. He has made several confessions of this; I only mention the first, which Mr. Welch and Mr. Gee heard, being by at that time.</p>

I deposited money and a Jernegan's medal, with other things, with Mr. Nobbs; She looks at the William and Mary half-crown; this is very much like a half-crown of mine I lost at the time mentioned; mine was very curiously preserved, and so is this. As to this medal, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230033"/> are more struck with the same die; I can't swear to it, but I had such a one.

I thought no harm at all, two or three days after I was over-against the watch-house at St. Catharine's, the watchman came and took me by the collar, and said I was his prisoner, and ask'd me if I knew of such and such things? I said yes, but I did not own I stole them.</p>

I saw it in the room about half an hour after five, and missed it about half an hour after seven; I went to inquire for his mother, but from one end of Canon-street to the other, I could not find such a name.

I went to the Sun-tavern and sent the drawer to the pawn-broker to know if the watch was there that was pawn'd the last Sunday-night, by

He pulled out a watch, the glass was broke and he had lost the two hands; he wanted to know where one Mr. Valentine lived, to have a glass put in: we were coming back; he said he wished he knew who would let him have some money upon it, and asked me if my master would lend him some on it? my master was in another room; I called him out and asked him; he said he did not chuse it, but sent me with him to Mr. Leach the pawnbroker; there was the servant man in the shop; he pulled off the outside case and the pendant came out; he looked upon the works; the prisoner said that watch kept as good time as any watch in England. He wanted 12 s. on it, the man let him have half a guinea. He put down Smith in the book, I did not hear the christian name. The prisoner went back and lay at our house that night, On the Sunday following the prosecutor came to our house and enquired about it, and I went to the pawnbroker's and asked him if that watch, that was put in last Sunday night, was gone? he said no.</p>

After I had taken the prisoner I heard him confess to the prosecutor he had taken the watch out of his house, and went and pawned it; I went with him to the pawnbroker's; he asked for the watch he pawned for half a guinea; the woman went up stairs, as we believed, to fetch it; presently came down her husband, and said, what do you want here? the prosecutor asked for the watch pawned there for half a guinea such a day; he looked at him, and said, I have it not. The officer said, you had it of this man ( meaning the prisoner) and it is stole. He said, I know nothing of it, you may get it as you can.

               <p>Q. Did you see her sign it?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I believe I saw her sign it, or acknowledge it to be her mark, and also that I swore her, which is always done previous to the caption. I have no doubt in the world but that the person who signed this information was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a place erased, and also an interlineation in another place on it; did you observe them before it was sworn?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I can't say I remember them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. I saw the woman at the bar come to Guildhall, and heard Mr. Thomas administer the oath to her. I kept the door there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say this is the information, which she swore, without alteration ?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to live with her?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. I was with her to appraise some pawned goods to make a sale of them; she brought them with her from Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what reason she gave for her saying so?</p>
               <p>S. Jacobs. I know not the reason. But she said they were a combination of thieves and blackguards, and Mr. Salt at the Gatehouse was the biggest of them all, and that she would make beggars of them all; I have heard her say she did not know them to be acquainted with them. She sent for me, when she went out of her house, and said, Mrs. Jacobs you are a very honest woman, your word will go in a court, you never was brought in question; you must swear that Thorp, Ashmore and Rowland came every day to the door, and threatened to have us out life and limb when we came upon trial (this was after she could not get bail) She told me she was sadly afraid Mr. Waters does not do me justice; come along with me and let me examine him. He gave her but little encouragement in her affair, and she seemed to be afraid of him. She said also, that Stevens's character was so bad that she would not take her trial with him, for if she did she should be cast; and you must say he is gone you know not where; she said she would say so, and then I might after her; said I, can you say so before the face of a judge, when you put him out of the way for a day or two?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in her house?</p>
               <p>L. Jacobs. I was 4 months there; I never saw her since because I would not swear it. The reason of my going to her first was, my husband had pawned some things there, when she lived in the Broad-way, Westminster, and she was gone and we could not find her; at last we found her in Goswell street, and she said we were forced to come away from there because there was no peace.</p>

I remember on the 17th of July, when Mr. Stevens was arrested, it was just by Mr. Thorp's door; Mr. Thorp was looking out at his window; Mr. Stevens shewed his supersedeas; they abused him very much; the man made the best of his way to his own apartment; Mr. Thorp followed him to his own house, that is Mrs. Blynn's,</p>

               <p>BRACHYGRAPHY: OR, SHORT-WRITING, Made easy to the meanest Capacity.</p>
               <p>Wherein the persons, moods, and tenses, are comprized in such a manner, that little more than the knowledge of the alphabet is required to the writing hundreds of sentences, in less time than spoken.</p>
               <p>The whole is founded on so just a plan, that it is wrote with greater expedition than any yet invented, and likewise may be read with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>Improved after upwards of thirty years practice and experience, and is of itself a sufficient Instructor.</p>
