Some time afterward, I recollected that I had not taken out of the pocket, a canvas bag with three ten pounds, and a twenty pounds bank note. I went to his house, and asked for him; he was not at home; I asked the man for my coat, I unbuttoned the pocket where I had forgot before to search, and the bag and notes were gone. I was much vexed, Mrs. Bates asked me what was the matter; I told her, in the cloaths there was a canvas bag and bank notes. She asked me if I could remember the numbers; I told her I could not just then. I went to the bank, and enquired of the clerks whether any body had been there with the notes for cash; one of the clerks examined, and told me there had not; I told him I had sent my cloaths to the taylor's to mend, and there were some bank notes in the pocket; I desired him, when they should be brought, to take notice of the man; that the taylor was a tall man in a dark grey coat. I saw him come home. The clerk of the bank came and informed me the prisoner had been at the bank with a note. He said he passed him in Honey-lane market; I went to seek him, and I presently saw him go by. I called him; at last he turned about and came over; I took him into a parlour, and said I gave him my cloaths, that in an inside pocket there was a canvas bag with fifty pounds in notes. He said he saw nothing of it. I told him, he had it. He said no. I told him I knew he had been at the bank, and bid him go home and bring them to me. He went, but did not come back. The next morning I charged a constable with him, and took him to the bank. He said, he never was there in his life: this was on the 20th, the day after he had changed a ten pound note. The clerks said they knew him. He still denied it. They told him they were sure he was the man, and told him what a dangerous thing he had done, and desired him to go with me and make it up. I said, if he would give me sundry notes for the ten pounds he received at the bank, I would make it up, but he refused to do that. We went; and had a hearing before Alderman Hopkins, who sent him to Wood-street compter.</p>
               <p>On the Prosecutor's cross examination, he said that it was before breakfast he sent for the prisoner, and delivered him a coat, waistcoat, and breeches to repair; that after breakfast he went to see after the notes, and found the prisoner at work on the cloaths; that he did not examine the pockets before.</p>

            . I live just by the prosecutor; I was at his house the morning he lost the notes, and he acquainted me with the affair. He told me one was a ten pound note he had given me cash for; it was an old note with a good deal of writing upon the back, and the inside had writing on it. I do not recollect the number. I told him if I could see the note I could almost be positive to it. I saw it afterwards at the bank, I was sure it was the note, for I changed no other note with him.</p>

This bank note being an old one, he was ordered to go into the accountant's office, and have it examined, which he did; then he brought it in to me to mark for payment; I gave it him again, and told him to write his name and place of abode upon it; he went, I saw him write on the note, Brown, Stanhope-street, May fair; he only wrote Brown at first, I asked him whether he had a Christian name, he hesitated a little, and said John; I put the word John to Brown; he went and received the money for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boults on his cross examination said, that the prisoner came with the note between eleven and twelve o'clock; that the prosecutor had been there ten or fifteen minutes before to describe him; that when he saw the prisoner come in, he told them the taylor was come, and that he was positive the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court to Mr. Haywood. Is this the bank note you sent to Mr. Bates?</p>
               <p>Haywood. I believe it is by the number of writings that are upon the back: there was a scruple when I changed this note, there was so much writing upon the back; I did not take so much notice of the names.</p>

            . I am in the service of the bank. On Monday morning the 19th of June, the prisoner offered this note for payment; it being an old note, he was to get it examined; after it was examined, he wrote his name, John Brown, Stanhope-street, May fair; before this, Mr. Bates had been with me, and had given me a description of a man he suspected had these notes; in consequence of which, Mr. Boults desired me to step after this man, and see where he went; turning up an alley which leads to Honey-lane I missed him; I went and told the prosecutor the man he described had been. The prisoner came by soon after in the dress I had described him in; he was called into their house, and charged with it, but he denied it. I saw no more of it till he was brought to the bank by the constable.</p>
               <p>George Hall. I am a teller at the bank of England. I paid the prisoner a ten pound note in the name of John Brown. I asked him if his name was Brown; he said yes; I paid it about eleven o'clock.</p>

There wanted several places mending in the lining; he said, do what is to do, and let me have them; I told him what there was wanted doing. My man did not come to work that morning at six, I went and called him, he came to work some time after; then I went to White-street, and measured Mr. Hunter for a waistcoat and pair of breeches, I did not leave him till half after eleven o'clock; then I proceeded through Lincoln's Inn and several other places, and we parted on Snowhill. I never was in the bank before Tuesday morning in my life.</p>

            . On the 23d of June last, I lost twelve forks and one knife; I saw them about two hours before they were taken away. I missed them about two o'clock; I had laid them in the window of my tap-room; they were found an hour after.</p>
               <p>(The Knife and forks were produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Williams. I live next door to the prosecutrix; I was standing at my door, when the prisoner was there; I saw a knife and some forks falling from his pocket; I believe the prisoner took them up again and put them into his pocket. Hearing the prosecutrix had lost some knives and forks, I went to the prisoner who stood at the door, and felt them in his pocket; he would not let me search him, but made off. I found them afterwards in a ditch about one hundred and fifty yards distance from the house.</p>

               <p>Wm Williams. I am a serjeant in the regiment the prisoner is in, I have known him about sixteen years in the regiment, I never heard him charged with theft, he has been guilty of breach of duty, owing to his getting now and then in liquor.</p>

I asked him where he came from, and where he was going; he said, he was going to Gloucestershire, he said he had served a Mr. Emery, a butcher in Newgate market; I told him the man wanted to get his money from him, and if he came honestly by the money, I was going to town, and would take care of him; he then said, he had told me a lie, that he never served a butcher, but found the money in Newgate market. I took him to the roundhouse for that night; I came to town, and enquired in Newgate market, but could not find Mr. Emery, but I heard there was such a man in Fleet market, I went and informed him of it.</p>

The box was locked; I saw the money in it on Sunday, and missed it on Tuesday morning. The prisoner slept with me on Sunday night, and absconded on Monday afternoon about five o'clock. We found him at Westminster, at one Newman's, a private lodging house. He had nineteen guineas and a half upon him in a purse (the money produced by Wright) Here is one guinea particularly marked, I can swear to it; I had taken a deal of notice of it: A goldsmith was going to clip it with a pair of shears, I prevented him, and told him I would run the risque of getting rid of it.</p>
               <p>H. Wright. I apprehended the prisoner, and found the money upon him, and a key; I tried the key to the box, the money was taken out of, but it would not open it.</p>

            , at the Star in Blackman street; the two prisoners came to our house once or twice to hire horses; Girdwood had hired horses at out house about a month or six weeks, and the other about a fortnight, Girdwood used to come by himself to hire them, they used to come together to ride out; they usually went out at twelve or one at noon, and generally returned at ten or eleven at night but never later; sometimes, indeed they kept them till next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their having horses the 7th of June?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. Yes, about that time, as they paid for them, I took no account: the horse M'Allester rode upon was dark brown bay, with cropt ears, he never rode hardly any other; the other was a bright bay, with a stripe in the face.</p>

I am a constable; on the 1st of June, about a quarter before eleven, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, by two watchmen, who charged him with breaking open Mr. Stone's cellar, in Great St. Helen's; I examined him, and found in his pocket a tinder-box with tinder; a flint, steel, a bunch of matches and a bit of candle, (producing them) he said, there were two other men concerned with him in taking this vermillion out of the cellar, but would not tell their names. He said, they brought it up and he took it from them. When he was taken by the watchmen, he threw this key from him ( producing it) which opens the padlock of the cellar.</p>

I went up to the door and saw the prisoner, and the three bags of vermillion at his feet; I asked him what business he had there, he said he was only making water; I told him he must go to the watch house, and give a better account of himself; I called another watchman to assist me, as we were going to the watch-house, I heard him drop something, the other watchman picked it up, it was a key, which I saw tried to the lock.</p>

               <p>Godfrey. It was said, if he told who the men were, and Mr. Stone and Mr. Pugh, got their things again, he might be admitted an evidence.</p>

After they had been there about ten minutes, my husband came in, and Emanuel followed him immediately into the shop the other remained then before the glass, my child took notice of the shew glass, she went out and found the glass broke; when Emanuel came into the shop, he asked for two mourning rings, after my little girl had gone out and perceived that the shew-glass was broke, my husband shut the door and said no one should go out, upon that Emanuel said d - n your, blood why don't you pay for the buttons and let us be gone; upon which Hunt produced two guineas, my husband took the two guineas and said he would keep them till they produced the man that had stole the buckles; Cox was committed, and he, as I was informed gave information with respect to Ward; for next morning, Ward was taken up upon the parade; I saw Ward and knew him, though he was then in his regimentals: when at the shew glass he was dressed in a different manner.</p>

               <p>Salmon. Destruction to the soul. (she is sworn) I was in the church yard, the maid came for me; I went into the shop; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120017"/> came in, the two men were then in the shop, and two at the shew glass. I saw Hunt go from the shew glass, sometime before he returned again; and in a quarter of an hour after, he came into the shop, with Cox. I went behind the counter; and then my mamma shewed them some buttons; there were two more then at the glasses: the Jew was there, and Ward; my pappa, came soon after; Emanuel came into the shop directly after him, and asked for two mourning rings. I saw a man leaning, with one hand over the shew glass; and I am positive, I saw him put some buckles into his handkerchief; but I did not see him take those buckles out of the shew glass, and then he went away: I could see enough of the buckles. Upon this I beckoned my pappa out of the shop, and told him, a man had run away with the buckles: then my mamma went out for a constable, and I was sent out to call in a neighbour; we were there a considerable time: as to Cox, I know him very well, he had been at the shop before, and had bought some buttons. Cox was committed.</p>
               <p>Hunt's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to the shop, and asked the prosecutrix, if she had any buttons; she asked seventeen shillings a dozen. She took them off the paper; I bargained with her for some waistcoat buttons; I took out two guineas to pay for the buttons: he took the two guineas, and said, he had been robbed, and he would keep the money: I insisted upon it, they should send for a constable; they fetched over a green grocer; he said, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Emanuel's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in the shop before the gentleman came home, asking the gentlewoman, if she had a ring to suit me? he came and said, he believed he had. He took out a drawer, and shewed me some; I said, the mourning was wore off, and they would not do; he said, he had no other. The gentlewoman was rubbing the buttons upon a piece of leather; he said, are your two guineas weight? I said, yes: he snatched up the two guineas, and ran out, and saw the glass broke; and then said, he would stop the two guineas, for he imagined, some of our gang had taken the buckles out: we knew nothing about it. He went out for a constable; he was gone half an hour; then he sent his wife out for an officer. A gentleman came in to buy something, who knew me; and he said, he would insure me; when the constable came, I insisted they should search me; he would not; we were in the cellar an hour and half; the green grocer was sent for, he did not know either of us.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is as false as God is true: one Marks, a Jew, came in, and said to him, I know your father, to be a hard working man, but you are a great villain.</p>
               <p>Ward. I would beg to ask the prosecutrix, whether she saw me?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, I saw him at the Glasses.</p>

            . I am a country fellow, upon the 6th of June, I was enquiring for a place about the Minories; a man, whose name is M'Oris, came to me, and told me, if I would go with him into a public house in <placeName id="t17750712-36-crimeloc162">Queen-street</placeName>

We then went to the Hoop and Horse Shoe, and there they began to play at shaking a halfpenny, and putting it under the candlestick; then M'Oris said, he hoped Gibbons would do by him, as he did by the gentleman the night before; that was, give him a shilling for every guinea he could show; then M'Oris pulled out two guineas and an half, and he gave him two shillings; then M'Oris said, Gibbons was a captain, and he gave countrymen a shilling for every guinea they could shew. I then pulled out two guineas and an half, and he was to give me half a crown, when the landlord came in; then they invited me to play with them, I told them, I did not choose to play at all; they played again, and M'Oris said to me, let me have your money; no, I said, I did not chuse that at all; upon that, he took hold of my left hand, and took the money out of my hand; he held the money in his hand, and shewed it to Gibbons, and said, see this young man has two guineas and a half, I hope you will do by him as you did by me; one of them asked me what o'clock it was, I pulled out my watch to see, and put it in again? as soon as I had put it in, M'Oris took hold of the chain and pulled it out, and said, it was a good watch, and threw the watch and money into Gibbons's hat; then they walked together up and down the room with the money and watch; I said, they had taken my money and watch, and I did not chuse to loose it in that manner; then M'Oris bid me come to the door; when we came to the door, there was the landlord and a constable waiting to take them for swindling somebody else. I told the landlord they had taken my watch and money. Gibbons was taken, but M'Oris got off. When Gibbons was taken to the watch-house, he dropped a parcel of counterfeit guineas in the coal tub, I never saw my money nor watch after they walked up and down the room, together with it. On Friday following, as I was going to work at the cooper's in Barnaby-street, about five o'clock in the morning, three fellows overtook me on London bridge, and asked me if my name was not so and so, and if I had not lost my watch; I said, yes; they said, if I would go with them they would let me have my watch again; I told them, I did not chuse to go with them; they said, it was but a little way, and if I would release Gibbons out of prison, I should have my watch and money again. I then observed the chain, seals and key of my watch, hang out of one of their pockets; the key is a very remarkable one; it being very early in the morning, I was afraid to attempt to stop them, lest they should knock my brains out, or use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He swore to an innocent man before Justice Sherwood.</p>
               <p>Grabham. I took up a man who I thought to be the other man, and swore to the best of my knowledge he was one of them; and to the best of my knowledge h e is; I know the prisoner is one of the men, he never departed the room till he was taken.</p>

On the 6th of June, the prisoner and M'Oris came to my house; I have often seen them there; I suspected them to be sharpers; I got a constable to take them up, when they came out. M'Oris made his escape; we took Gibbons, and carried him to the watch-house; he was not searched in my house, but when we came to the watch-house, he dropped a purse of counters into the coal basket, and he was searched, and a draught found upon him.</p>

            . I know nothing of the prisoner, the prosecutor took me up for another person, who was concerned with the prisoner, and swore positively that I was the person that defrauded him of his watch and money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor called on me one Sunday in prison, and told me, the man that had run away with the property, had sent a friend to offer him the watch and money, not to pursue the prosecution; he said, he was afraid to do that, because of his recognizance; but if I would send the watch and money to him, he would not appear against me; I will call a person to prove that.</p>
               <p>- Roberts. Last Sunday was week, I went down to Clerkenwell Bridewell, while I was there, the prosecutor came in and enquired for the prisoner, he came down the yard, and the prosecutor said, well Mr. Gibbons, how do you like this; he said, not at all; the prosecutor said, well, if you will, tell me where the man is, that has got my watch and money, I will endeavour to get you out, and if you will give me my watch and money, I will not appear against you; he said, he should not be hurt, if he could help it, but that he could not do any thing without consulting his friends; he said, he did not think he took it, but he believed he knew where the man was, that did take it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I am a labourer, I live in Vine-Street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Every word this man has said, is totally false, I never said he was not the person that took the money; I had occasion to go to Clerkenwell, and called on Gibbons, and asked him, whether he liked being there better than swindling, and robbing people.</p>

            . I live in Coleman-street. The beadle, and one Chapman, came to me upon the 3d of July, to know if I would take any goods into my warehouse; they said, it was for Pixley, who was standing by them; he said, the goods were to stay a few days to sell them. I told him, I could not spare the warehouse for more than a day or two. They were taken out of my warehouse by virtue of a search warrant.</p>

Last Monday was a week, the 3d of July, I was in Fleet-market, Mr. Pixley came and spoke to me; he said, there was a woman in Moorfields, had given him a bill of sale, he wanted two people to witness it, and he would give them half a guinea a-piece; he said, the woman was gone away, there was two indictments against her, and he was afraid people were going to take the goods away; he asked if I would witness it; I told him, yes; we went to the Bull and Garter; there was another man, who would not sign it; we came to the door, out of the house, and Reeves came up to us; after some little time, he asked him if he would sign it; he then asked me, if I would; he agreed to witness it; it was signed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120026"/>

I asked him, if it was Mrs. Carter's writing, he said, no; she is gone away, and will never come again, I want to secure myself, to put the bill of sale in force; he said, if you will go with me, I will treat you with a coach to put this bill of sale in force; he called in a street, and took two constables to keep the peace. I saw them all in the house together; I was not there when they entered; I heard the daughter say, it was a bad affair, and it was not their mother's writing.

            . I am a constable. Mr. Pixley was a customer of mine. About the middle of March, I was talking with him at a public house; he said, he was under misfortunes; then he said, he had been arrested upon a false debt on Mrs. Carter's account; he wanted me to be bail; I did not care to do it; he said, the debt was small, and his father was to be one bail, and that he had a bill of sale upon her goods; the debt was six pounds or upwards. I was bail with his father on account of his having the bill of sale, to prevent us coming into trouble. After being his bail, the action was removed to the court of King's bench, and back again. I talked to him about it; he said, he had the bill of sale to indemnify us all; I kept myself easy till the 3d of July, then he came to a public-house in my neighbourhood, and desired me, as a constable, to keep the peace, while the bill of sale was put in execution. I told him, not to be in too great a hurry; he said, he heard she was moving her goods, and they would be gone by Thursday. I declin'd, as I was concerned, and desired my brother constable to go; he said, he had got two people at the top of Great Bell-alley, who were the prisoners, Reeves and Thorpe. We came to Mrs. Carter's, Mr. Pixley knocked at the door, one of the daughters opened it: he stood at the door to keep the door open; I came in after Pixley, then the rest of the people who were with us: we went into the parlour; the daughter asked what was the matter; Pixley replied, matter enough, he would not go to jail for her mother. The daughter seemed much flurried; I told her to be quiet, he was come in upon a bill of sale. I asked Pixley where the bill of sale was; and saw it was witnessed by Reeves, and it was signed

            . I had it to peruse; I suspected it was a forged bill, when the children made such work about it. After the bill of sale was read, Pixley went out, and brought in Mr. Swaine, the broker; when he did that, the daughters resisted, and said, it was a forged bill of sale, it was not their mother's hand-writing. Mr. Swaine asked me if I knew the mother; I said, I had seen her. but had no particular acquaintance with her; he asked if there was any particular acquaintance between Pixley and the mother; I told him, I laboured under an execution through their affairs: he then proceeded to take an inventory of no more goods than the value in the bill of sale. Mr. Pixley would not consent; afterwards he did consent to it; and after that, it was to be for the whole. I then told him, if he took more, he would commit a felony; then again, they agreed to take to the bill of sale.</p>

               <p>I think I have been acquainted with Mrs. Carter near a year and half, or two years, during which time when she had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120027"/> trouble, she has sent for me, and I have assisted her with money several times when she was in custody and indicted; I bailed her out of Wood-street Counter: then she was indicted for keeping a disorderly house, I paid the money in court; I then took a house for her in Aldermanbury; I paid seven guineas for the earnest of that house for six months: she could not stay there long, for the house was such a great nuisance, that the neighbours all complained, and the girls made such an uproar they could not stay; she then applied to me to look out for another house: I did and got her one in Sommerset street, Whitechapel; she did not stay there above a quarter, before I was arrested for the rent; she then desired me to get her another house, which I did. The house she came from in Moorfields, I took it, and paid six guineas; I then told her, I was a good deal uneasy, that I had advanced so much money for her and had no security; she said, she would give me any security I could desire, that I was the greatest friend she ever had in the world; My wife was in company with her, and said, it was odd, she did not give me security; she came in two days after and gave me this bill of sale, though I had no design to put it in execution; she signed the bill of sale the 12th of March last, it was not witnessed when she wrote it.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of July, about ten or eleven o'clock, I went into the Bull and Garter, in Fleet Market, I met Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Pixley; I never saw him before, he said he had got a bill of sale; he asked me if I would go in; Thorpe, I, and he, went together to Moorfields; I stayed there till the goods were all taken away.</p>

               <p>James Lane. I am clerk to the depute clerk of Edinburgh; I saw the prisoner at his office on the 25th of May, about five or six o'clock. Lewis came and acquainted Mr. Trotter, that he, with two others, who were at the George Inn, had committed a robbery in London; they were sent for, Lewis came in first, and produced a number of these things (a box of things shown to Mrs. Templer who deposed to them.) Lewis said, the reason for coming to Mr. Trotter's, was, he had been uneasy ever since the robbery was committed. I wrote the declaration, I have here brought signed by the prisoners, before Mr. Trotter. The declarations were read over to them; they did not attempt to alter or vary them in any part of them. Jackling was searched; and a diamond heart found upon him, and the wrench he broke open the bureau with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire them to make these declarations?</p>
               <p>Lane. They were not told, they must do it. Mr. Trotter admonished them to do it, as the way to make reparation, and the more can did they were, it would be better for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promises made, that they should not be punished, if they would confess?</p>
               <p>Lane. Mr. Trotter gave

               <p>Lane. Not that I heard</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Lewis, he was examined with a view to be a witness, you say, Lewis was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120029"/> person that came in and gave the information?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, the last time he came, he was brought into custody; but before, he came, being uneasy in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Muggleton, how came he before Mr. Trotter?</p>
               <p>Lane. An officer brought him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Lane. He made the declaration you have here in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he made this declaration, what was said?</p>
               <p>Lane. He was admonished to say nothing but the truth; he was given to understand, that the information was given, and it would be of no use to conceal any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he threatened what would be the consequence, if he did not tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. No, he was not, he was given to understand, that the crime was of a very heinous nature.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to get by telling the truth? Was he advised to tell the truth, as if it would be of service?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, that it was better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That could be of no service, if it was to be made use of, it convicts him.</p>
               <p>Lane. It was the Bailiff's mind to say what he did, I know no other reason for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sworn?</p>
               <p>Lane. No, it is not the form to swear them.</p>
               <p>Q. All that was said by Mr. Trotter, was, that it was better to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Lane. He was advised to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then acting under the influence of the magistrate, he consented to be examined?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, he said, it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing further said?</p>

               <p>Lane. Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no circumstances of favour held out to him?</p>
               <p>Lane. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any threats?</p>
               <p>Lane. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he told what would be the consequence if he did not tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. That there was less favour to be expected, if he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he have less favour shewn him than he has now?</p>
               <p>Lane. The lady he has robbed would have had a much worse opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood he was to have some favour shewn him if he told the truth?</p>
               <p>Lane. I did not understand any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke to Muggleton?</p>
               <p>Lane. Mr. Trotter said, he was brought there for a heinous crime, upon the information of an accomplice, and it would be better to tell the truth, and that it would entitle him to more favour from the lady, the more candid he was in his declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say upon your oath, Mr. Trotter made use of that expression, if the lady had any favour to give him?</p>
               <p>Lane. I understood it so, I understood when he mentioned it, that it was meant of the lady only.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the same admonition given to Jacklin?</p>
               <p>Lane. He was present when Lewis made his declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to Jacklin?</p>
               <p>Lane. Not that I remember, they were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the signature at the bottom of the declaration Mr. Trotter's writing?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, I saw him write his, and the prisoners, their names.</p>

            . I lost fifteen guineas and a-half. I was exceeding drunk last Saturday night, that is true; and coming home, in Long Acre, two women met me, and inveigled me to go home with them, that was the prisoner and another woman; I am sure I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Dont treat it with levity.</p>
               <p>Stone. I do not treat it with levity; I went to bed; I waked in a quarter of an hour; and finding myself in a room by myself, with my cloaths gone (for I could find none,) I ran down stairs, I laid hold of somebody, and called out, I have been robbed of a great sum of money. There was somebody there, said, what do you want? another voice said, what do you want? like a woman's voice. I thought Lord Jesus Christ, I shall be murdered here; for I was pretty well sobered. I got near the sash, thinking, I had better jump out of the window than be killed by them. I there cried out. Watch, murder and thieves! as loud as I could. The watchman came at last; though there were lights all round, nobody would open a window, or come out; at last the watchman came. I said, for God sake, assist me, for I shall be murdered in this place, I have unhappily come into. I ran down to him; I came up again to the door where I had been sitting at the window, the door was fast against me; the watchman threatened to break the door open. I had nothing but my shirt on; I found my gold watch upon the table. I said to the watchman, I have saved my gold watch, thank God: he said, I must have that. He took it, he produced it at the watch-house, and before the justice, without the outside case. In about five minutes, he went away with the watch; to call assistance, and brought a whole possey of watchmen. They broke open the door, and found two men and two women. I described the person that was with me, as being without a tooth; here is the girl that went home with her: the two girls went home together. I said, do you go about your business; and away she went. She is here, and will prove, that the prisoner is the same person that was with me. The money was in my breeches pocket, and a bank note for fifteen pounds: they did not take that. When the watchmen broke into the room where the two men and two women were; they said, go up stairs. I went up into the two pair of stairs room; there I found my cloaths and the bank note in my pocket, and sixteen shillings worth of silver in the other; the fifteen guineas and an half were taken away.</p>
               <p>Court. As you was very drunk, are you positive you had the fifteen guineas in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Stone. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. How came they to spare your bank note, do you think?</p>
               <p>Stone. Because I imagine they supposed it to be waste paper, and did not know the value of it.</p>

            . One Lyon, a constable, and I, went to look for the prisoner, from an information the gentleman gave of her, we heard she had been at the Bull and gate, at Holborn. We heard she had been at a night cellar where people drink beer; we sat at the door till it was dark; by and by the prisoner came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120035"/> with a man; we did not know her, then till the landlord of the house told us. She had been there before with a black capuchin; she had none on then. I went into the box, I did not know her then. I put my finger to her tooth; I saw her tooth was broke; I said, this must be the woman: we had better search her. We searched her, she had five shillings in her pocket. I asked her, if she lived in such a place, or knew one Scott that kept the house: she said, no. Then as she went along, we desired Mr. Lyons to search her. Mr. Lyons took her into a room; we could not find any thing more upon her. Mr. Lyons talked to her some time, and then she acknowledged she had six guineas and a half of the gentleman's; she said she took it from his pocket.</p>

Raymond's and company, for acceptance; then I went to the bank to take out some bank post-bills; I put the bills into my pocket book. Coming through Pope's Head Alley, some persons came against me, and gave me a thrust; I thought it a mere accident, and did not take any notice of it; but by the time I got into Lombard-street, which is not a dozen yards further, I felt for my pocket-book, and missed it. I did not know who to suspect: I went immediately home and acquainted the gentlemen with it; we stopped payment at the different houses; and in about a month after, these three identical bills were discounted at a bank at Ipswich. I have the bills in my possession, they were drawn upon Raymond and company, payable to

             The prisoner came to me upon the 26th of July, 1774, at Sprawton, near Ipswick, Suffolk, he asked a millar, a neighbour, who stood at the shop door, what the wheel-wright's name was? he told him. Bickmore. Then the prisoner asked me, if I could help him to an honest man that could be intrusted to carry a parcel for Lady Harland? my master said, I might go. The prisoner wanted to hire a horse, he asked the miller to let him one. The miller said, as it was for Lady Harland, he would not charge any thing; then he charged him a shilling; the prisoner said he would give him two, or a bottle of wine. I mounted the horse; he called me aside, and gave me a parcel, as though it was a letter, and bid me go to Garrat the banker, and bid him send lady Harland thirty pounds; he said he was going that way, and he should pass by and see me: but there are two roads, he did not know that; and he went one road and I another, so that he missed me. I got the money at the banker's, and sent in the cash to Lady Harland, as the prisoner had ordered me. Lady Harland was surprized. I received the cash of

            , Mr Garrat's clerk. I told Lady Harland, the gentleman told me, he should be at parson Jackson's, would see me pass by, and meet me there. She bid me go to parson Jackson, and tell the gentleman, I had delivered my message. I went there; he had not been there; I went on about my business; I was to bring twenty or thirty pounds in cash to Lady Harland, and the rest in bank notes. As I was coming from parson Jackson's a well-dressed man came riding along the road, and says, the young, man my master is greatly uneasy about the cash; he thought you had rode away with it. I said, no, that was not my disposition. He said, I must go further on the road for his master. I went on, and saw the prisoner. He said, where is the cash; I said I had left it at Lady Harland's, as he had ordered me. He said, how came you to leave it there. Then he ordered the servant to go back with me, and say, I had met the gentleman, and that it was a mistake. I went back, and I got the cash from Lady Harland, and the notes, and gave them to the man. My master thought I had been gone a long while; he asked the meaning of my staying. I told him; she suspected the fraud, and went and told Lady Harland. Lady Harland sent for me two hours after, and gave me a house to pursue him. I pursued him to a place called Kendall, and several gentlemen went with me; but he was not taken then.</p>

On the 24th of July, 1774, I let the prisoner have a pair of horses for him and his friend; they went off at five in the morning; he came in the name of Thomas to me; he lived just by where I kept a livery stable then; he had had one or two before; he desired me to let him have two of the best horses I had, at five in the morning; I thought it odd he should introduce a friend that was a stranger. I went with the horses to see them set off; he gave my man a shilling; said, don't make yourself uneasy I am going to a gentleman's house; if I am not back by Thursday, I will send you a line. He did not come back for ten days; he said he belonged to some people, who, I afterwards found were what they call swindlers. Sir

               <p>My Lord-Mayor would not take cognizance of this man's affidavit; he was perjured before my Lord-Mayor. He came to the Compter, but was not admited to see my person, the Lord-Mayor granted me that indulgence, that nobody should see me. Another thing is, Mr. Morgan can justify, that the very countryman never mentioned that he ever saw my face again; the countryman said, I gave him a parcel, contained in a large piece of brown paper; that he went to the banker's, and got something, which he gave to another man, and that he never saw me again.
