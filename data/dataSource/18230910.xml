I took him out of the coach, and searched his pockets; he had nothing in them. I then took him to Mary-le-bone watch-house; he wished to see Mr. Williams, who afterwards saw him at the watch-house. I found in his shoe, between the inner and outer sole, three duplicates; I asked him if he had any more; he said he had had more, but they were destroyed; that one Daniel M'Carthy had got some more; he gave me his address, at No. 7, Dudley-court, near St. Giles's Church.

            . I am a painter and glazier. I have hawked fruit about the town; and occasionally, within the last year, have sold fruit at her Ladyship's house; I dealt with the prisoner for it. During the time I was going backwards and forwards to the house, the prisoner employed me, eight or nine times, to pawn plate; he was indebted to me for fruit, and gave me the plate to pawn to raise money to pay me. I pawned it at Sampson's. I offered him the duplicates, but he desired me to take care of them; I delivered some of the tickets to him (looking at the three found on the prisoner); these are not any of them. I may have given him one or two, the rest were taken from me at the watch-house. I pawned the last property in December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were often at the house - A. Yes; the fruit was sold for her Ladyship. I never applied for payment to any one but Darby, as he always dealt with me. I have seen her Ladyship and Mr. Williams occasionally, but understood from Darby that he was the confidential servant. My first bill might be 3 l. or 4 l.; they might take 1 s. or 3 s. worth a day. I kept a shop in Castle-street part of the time. When I pawned the plate, I kept the money, as it was to pay me; when there was more than my bill, I delivered him the balance; I understood from him that her Ladyship wished it to be pawned. The last I pawned was for five guineas; at that time there was 6 l. 16 s. 5 d. due to me. I delivered the bills to Darby. I may have pawned to the amount of 18 l. or 19 l. in all. I served fruit regularly every day, for eighteen months, till her Ladyship went to Windsor; they sometimes took 6 s. worth at a time. I returned him 2 l. in December, and 10 s. or 15 s. at other times. I always went down the area, to the prisoner's room; I do not know where the plate was kept; I may have seen some in his room; I pawned the property as he gave it me - in the evening.</p>

As he returned to the door, I thought I heard something fall from the counter; I suspected him, followed and stopped him, and asked him what he had got under his coat; he said nothing; I pulled out the parcel of stockings, and took them to Mr. Beeston, without securing the prisoner; he was taken in about an hour.

I am no relation of the prisoner, but have known him about three weeks. On the morning of the 24th of August, I was awoke by the noise of some dogs; I got up, saw two men on Mr. Heath's wall, and two deals against the wall. The prisoner was lowering down a table from the wall. The watchman was calling four o'clock, and they ran into a house opposite to my window. I saw them take something out of the drawer of the table. This was in Angel-alley. While I was dressing myself the prisoner took a bundle under his arm, and the other took the table. I went down to find the watchman, but could not. I called up Mr. Heath, and took him to the place; they had left the deals and taken the table, which was found up the court where the prisoner lived, and about one hundred yards from the deals. I described the prisoner, and he was taken that afternoon, and am certain of him - I had seen him in company with the other man before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not shew me 3 s., saying Mr. Heath gave it you, and you would stick to it that it was me - A. Heath gave me 3 s. for my trouble. I went up stairs directly, and did not see the prisoner again till he was apprehended.</p>

On the morning of the 24th of August, about half-past three o'clock, I was called up by Anson, and saw the table, which had just been lowered, and two men on the wall. I knew the prisoner before, by seeing him in the neighbourhood - I saw him put a deal over the wall next to the prosecutors' wall; Anson called me to look at him.</p>

            . I am a drover. On the 1st of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Smithfield, and saw a sheep pass me; the prisoner was driving it; he had a string round its neck, and his left hand on it, and his right hand wielding the tail, forcing it on as fast as possible: it being after market hours, I thought it was something wrong, and followed him to the corner of Cloth-fair, he turned the sheep into Cloth-fair; and there marked it with ochre down the back and across - I was too far to notice whether there was any mark before. I followed him to a butcher's shop; he turned the sheep into the shop, then took the string off its neck and tied its three legs; it was taken round a screen, where the butcher stuck it; I heard the sheep struggling after having been stuck. I then called the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"Harvey, you wretch, whose sheep have you got there slaughtering? some poor drover will have to pay for that." He then used a hard expression, and threatened to beat my brains out. I went from the shop with him, and ordered the butcher not to touch it till I brought somebody to witness the brand-mark, ochre-mark. I went with the prisoner over towards the other side of Smithfield; he said the sheep belonged to Dibbens, a butcher, over the water - I said,</p>
               <p>"God bless you, George, if it is his; but I will not leave you till I know the rights of it." He came with me from there to near Long-lane, where I saw a drover, and asked him to come with me to look at the marks on the sheep. I said, in the prisoner's presence,</p>
               <p>"Joe, I consider there is a sheep that has been wrongfully dealt with here, by Harvey; will you come with me?" but he refused - I said then I would find an officer. I went up Long-lane, and the prisoner left me; I found Stanton, and took him to the butcher's, who took the skin in his charge.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Cloth-fair. I have frequently seen the prisoner. On the 1st of August, between five and six o'clock, he brought me a ewe sheep - I had not seen him on that day before; he asked me to slaughter it for it was lame. It was marked down the back and across the loins; the ochre did not appear fresh exactly. I saw no other mark on it. I heard Hughes ask whose it was; he said it belonged to Dibbens. I do not recollect Hughes telling me not to meddle with it; but as he said it was some poor drovers, I did not proceed further with it. The officer took the skin away, and on Monday, the 4th of August, I was fetched to the office; the prisoner was in custody. I have known him as a drover some time. The officer had the carcase on Saturday morning.</p>

I counted them directly I got them out of the shed, and there was only thirty. I drove them to Newgate-market. The officer produced a skin to me on the Saturday - It was then marked along the back and across; it was not marked so when master bought them - I know it to be the skin of one of the sheep, as I had marked the three lame ones on the rump with ochre, which mark was on it then; I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100006"/>see a little of it, and swear to it being the skin of one of the three lame ewes, for it slipped aside while I was marking it, which made the ochre slip aside.</p>

Mr. Dibbens employed me on the 1st of August to drive four sheep out of the market; he was taking them home himself; I drove them out, and the prisoner put himself forward to help us oat with them - we got down Cow-lane; two of them ran back into the market, and one was run over. Dibbens told me to take it to Carpenter's, the butcher, to be killed, which I did, and persuaded him to take the other three home in a cart. I saw them put into the cart, and he went in the cart with them, being in liquor. This was about four o'clock - I went home, and came out about half-past six, and Harvey said he wanted to speak to me - he said he had picked up a sheep; I said that was nothing to me; he said it was all right, it was a gift - I said that would not do for me; I was going away, he called me back and said, Dibbens had four sheep, and if I would say he had five that would do, and he would see Dibbens, and if Dibbens would say there were five that would clear him. I said I would have nothing to do with it, and walked away - he wanted to talk further with me, but I would not. I heard Matthews's man (Lynch) the same night enquiring about it, but did not tell him what I had heard, as I did not know that it was his sheep.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of August, in consequence of what Hughes said, I went to Barnes, the butcher, and found a sheep stuck; It was skinned in my presence, and the skin delivered to me. I shewed it to Sales, who said it was Matthews's - he shewed me a mark on the rump, which I think slanted. On Saturday morning I found the prisoner in Mr. Carpenter's slaughter-house, with Dibbens - as soon as I went in he said,</p>
               <p>"Stanton, here is a pretty bother about this sheep" (Dibbens's sheep then hung in the slaughter-house) he said</p>
               <p>"Here is the owner of it, and I have done with it." I told him he must account to me for the sheep he found in Cloth-fair - he said that was Dibbens's; Dibbens said nothing to it. I asked Dibbens how he marked his sheep; he said sometimes one way and sometimes another. He shewed me the skin of the sheep at Carpenter's, and said that was his mark; it was not like the skin at Barnes's in the least - but Dibbens said he sometimes bought from different people, and then he marked them with their mark. I asked him whether the sheep I had got in Cloth-fair was his; he then pointed to the one which hung up, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is mine;" that was all he would say; but he said the one at Carpenter's made up his right number, for he had but four. I told the prisoner he must go with me - he said he would not, and resisted a good deal, but I got assistance, and took him by force to the Compter. I have the skin, Matthews and his son both claimed it.</p>

            . This is the skin of one of the three sheep - here is a trace of my slant mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past two o'clock I stood by the Ram Inn - Dibbens came, and said he had four sheep, and wanted me to take them home for him - I said I could not. Rockett came up, and said he would help him in with them, as the constables were clearing the market; he tied these four sheep down, and got drinking till near four o'clock. I told him to take his sheep home; he was so drunk he could hardly walk. I helped him with the sheep; two ran back, and one was run over - he said he had bought two more, and that he bought them of Veal, but did not know what was become of them. I found this one in the pens, and thinking it was his, I took it to the butcher to kill.</p>

On sunday, the 17th of August, I went to dine with a friend, at the corner of Percival-street, Goswell-street - I left there about nine o'clock at night, and was returning home with my wife and family; I was quite sober. My wife had a child at her breast, and I was leading my eldest boy. I proceeded down Union-street, towards Spitalfields-church, and when I came to the corner of <placeName id="t18230910-8-crimeloc40">Gun-street</placeName>

As I advanced towards the middle of the road, he met me, and made a spring at me, and struck me on the breast with his arm, and at the same moment took my watch-seal from me - the chain broke with the snatch, and part of it went with the seal, key, and ring; it was a gold seal, which I had taken out of pawn for 30 s.; the chain was steel. He rushed against my breast - I put my hand down, and missed it, and immediately pursued after him, calling Stop thief! I ran down Gun-street on the left-hand side of the way, and was interrupted by another, who struck me on the breast - I immediately recovered from the blow. I pursued the prisoner; he was out of my sight about a minute; when I saw him again he was stopped. I looked at him, and immediately recognized him, and am certain he is the person. I have found none of my property. When he got to the watch-house, I said it was a pity a young man should be guilty of such a thing, and if he would produce my property, or tell me where I could get it, I should be sorry to go on with the prosecution - he said he was innocent; I said,</p>
               <p>"If you were it would be hard to swear against you if I was not positive," but I was certain of him; he was stopped within two or three minutes after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100007"/>night - A. Ten minutes before ten o'clock; it was a fine star-light night, but not moon-light. I never saw him before; I only saw him as I was crossing the road; it might not be more than half a minute. I saw him leaning on a post. The gas-light shone right in his face. I was agitated when the push was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of your seeing him, and your being robbed another person knocked against you - A. Yes, and when I got up there was a crowd of people holding him. I never said I might be mistaken in him - I said it would be impossible for me to swear to him, provided I had not such a good view of his face; his hat was on, but it did not hide his face. My eye was fixed on him as he leant on the post, and when he came from the post towards me, I looked steadfastly at his face. I do not know what became of the other man. The prisoner's landlady came to me after he was examined - I told her I was positive of him. I never said I would let him go if his friends would give me money. I was not agitated till I was robbed. I thought my watch was gone, and ran off immediately. I felt my seal safe just before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of August, I was going to the watch-house at the end of Gun-street, and passing the end of Gun-street and Union-street, I saw the prisoner leaning against a post - I went up to him, taking him for a person I knew, but when I got close to him, I found he was not. I am certain he is the man who stood against the post. Two or three minutes after, I stopped at the opposite corner for a necessary purpose, and in the mean time I saw a man, woman, and children passing the post where he stood. I saw the prisoner step from the post to the edge of the curb, and lift his left arm up, but whether he took anything I do not know; he immediately ran down Gun-street, and the prosecutor called Stop thief; I immediately pursued the prisoner - he was stopped in Artillery-passage. I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner into the passage; he was stopped immediately - I am certain of him. The prosecutor came up, and asked us to stop for him to see if he was the person, and when he saw him he said he was. He was taken to the watch-house, and said there, that he was innocent. The people asked why he ran away; he said there was a window broken close to where he stood, and he was afraid they would take him for breaking it. I heard no windows broken, and next morning I looked all about the street to see if any were broken, but could find none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you examined every pane of glass in two or three streets - A. No. I examined the windows at five o'clock in the morning; I examined both sides of Gun-street. It happened on my beat, but was ten minutes before duty. I have been on that beat nine years, and never saw him before to my knowledge. I saw him for two or three minutes; but did not speak to him; there was a gas-light close to him; the prosecutor said another man gave him a blow on the breast. I only lost sight of him as he turned the corner; he was the first who was running; I was seven or eight yards from him, and did not see him throw anything away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Whitechapel, down Union-street, and saw a female, who turned down Gun-street; thinking I knew her, I went after her, and about three paces down the street, I heard something break, and heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a man running, and ran after him; whether he ran into a house or not I do not know. I went down to the bottom of the street; several people were running different ways - I was taken hold of, and asked what they took me for; they said they heard a cry of Stop thief! and did not know whether I was the man or not. This gentleman came up in two or three minutes - I said,</p>
               <p>"Does this gentleman accuse me of robbing him?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, but I suppose if you was not the man you would not be stopped," and that he could not say positively that I was the man. I was taken to the watch-house, and there they asked if he was sure I robbed him - he said it was hard to swear to a man, and as so many people were alike, he would not swear, but no doubt as I was stopped I was the person. I declare to God that I am innocent. He was nearly an hour in the watch-house, and when the prosecutor was asked if he would give charge, he said if the constable thought proper he would. He persuaded him to give charge of me, and to enquire if I had respectable friends.</p>

            . I live in Union-walk, Kingsland-road. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years; he was apprenticed to a Mr. Evans, of Old-street-road - he has lodged with me for the last two years, and is a paper-stainer, and an honest industrious character - his master has been dead some time, and since that he has been jobbing for himself. I saw the prosecutor the morning after this charge was made - I asked him what was the matter; he said this young man was in charge on suspicion of taking his seals and chain - he said the young man who had his seal was by the watch-house door. I said, why do you wish to take him (the prisoner) up then; he said I do not wish to take him up if he will tell me who has got my seal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to go after this person - A. A person called on me (I think from the watch-house.) and asked if I knew Hughes, as he was in the watch-house on suspicion of taking a gentleman's seal. I am sure he said he was there on suspicion. I saw the prosecutor next morning at the watch-house, before eleven o'clock. Many people were by.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the prosecutor expressed a doubt of the prisoner being the person who robbed him - A. Yes, he did; because he said the person, who he believed had his seal, went by the watch-house door that morning. I said it was a pity he charged him, if he was not certain of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he doubted about him - A. No; he said there were three or four in the gang, and he believed this young man was with them - but the man who he thought had his seal went by the door.</p>

I had a Kingswood box, fourteen inches long, and six deep, containing the articles enumerated in the indictment, except the two watches and seals. The value was about 1200 l. or 1400 l. My house is in Berkley-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I missed the box on the morning of the 14th - it usually stood in my wife's dressing-room, where we generally breakfasted; he was in the habit of coming into this room, and seeing the box and its contents, for he travelled with me, and I always took the box with me. I saw nothing of him after five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th, till Monday following, the 18th, when he was in custody. I had advertised in the Newspapers on the 14th, and received a letter, purporting to come from Messrs. White and Dodson, in consequence of which, I went with Westcoat, the officer, in a direction for Portsmouth; but on the Guildford-road, about twenty-five miles from town, I recognized Clark in a chaise, with one Worger. On coming up with them Worger produced several articles to me, which had been in the box, and I identified them. Some conversation passed between me and Clark; he said voluntarily that he had broken open the box, in a copse by the road side, about two miles beyond Dartford, and left the box in the copse, and had disposed of the gold and silver watch, to two different persons in the town of Chatham; he could not name them. I discovered them by his description. Next morning I went to the copse, beyond Dartford, and the man at the turnpike told me where I should find my box; it was given up to me, about a hundred yards from the copse, by a person who had found it. I went to Chatham, and found my gold watch in possession of Slowman, a Jew; and the silver one I recognized in the window of one Price, at Chatham. When the box was found, some things still remained in it, in a secret drawer. All the property found on the prisoner was produced at the office, and sealed up in my presence, and have been in my possession ever since. Worger afterwards produced a chain. I have recovered every single article, and produce the whole, sealed up, also the box.</p>

In consequence of information I received, I went to Portsea on Sunday, the 17th of August, and next morning I found Clark in a bed-room at the Blacksmith's Arms, public-house, there. I had great difficulty in getting admittance; I found several articles of jewellery in a chair in the room, tied in a blue handkerchief, with two shirts. I found the whole of the property, which is now sealed up, in a box, which I afterwards gave to the prosecutor. I brought him to town, and met the Colonel - he gave me the whole account of the transaction, which enabled me to find the watches. He said where he had thrown the box, and sold the watches. Here are a pair of diamond ear-rings, necklaces, and other property in this box.</p>

            . I am groom to the Colonel. On the 13th of August, Clark left his service, about five o'clock in the afternoon. In the course of that day, about three o'clock, he sent me to take a sixpence to the soldier, Downes, at the Hole in the Wall, public-house, in Grosvenor-mews, Berkley-square. I found Downes there, and gave him the 6 d., and told him to wait until Clark came - he was to get a pot of beer. He asked how long Clark would be? - I said I did not know, and left him in the taproom.</p>

On the 13th of August, about a quarter past six o'clock in the afternoon, I saw both the prisoners there; Clark brought the box produced into my room, and put it in a chair - I know it by the lock. My sister-in-law let him in - Clark came up stairs first, put the box in a chair, and asked for Mr. Dry, saying he had something for him - he kept pushing the lock of the box: Downes said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, don't open it." I said my husband would not be at home until one o'clock. I saw no cloth; they did not remain in the room above three minutes, and took the box out with them. I let them out at the street door, and on returning found a cloth on the chair where the box stood, rolled up all in a heap. I gave it to the Colonel, who gave it to Collins in my presence.</p>

On the 4th of August I saw the prisoner come up the area steps - I ran to the pantry, where I had left some plate, and missed the property described in the indictment. I called to the footman to pursue him, as I was undressed - I put on my coat and waistcoat, ran out, and saw him on the other side - the footman had got beyond him. I seized him, and told him to deliver up what he had under his coat to the footman; he did so, and a silver fork dropped from the parcel he was delivering. I took him back to the house. The value of the plate is above 20 l.</p>

            . I am a farmer. On Tuesday, the 10th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was riding along Whitechapel - the prisoner called out,</p>
               <p>"Turner," and asked me to buy a four years old mare of him; I said I would not buy, but I would change it for one, if he had one to suit me, and asked where it was - he said he could not shew it to me then, as he was going into the City, but asked when I should be at my stable; I said between six and seven o'clock - I got home at eight. He called to me as I was going home, and said he was sorry he had sold the four years old mare; he was then on a mare, for which I gave him a mare and two sovereigns to boot. I took her to Romford-market on the Wednesday morning, and tied her up with another horse to sell. Mr. Lowe came up, and looked at her - I asked him to buy her for 8 l.; he fetched his father, who asked if I knew who I changed her with; I said with Snell. The prisoner was crossing the road at the time, and I pointed him out; Lowe said it was stolen. I asked him to go with me to the prisoner, which he did; I said,</p>
               <p>"Jem, this gentleman says the mare I had of you is stolen" - he said he knew better, for he had changed for it on Tuesday morning. He went down the market to find the man who he had it of, and rode away on my mare, towards town. I rode after him nearly two miles; he got off the mare - I took it. He ran across the fields, and got away. I went back to Lowe, and he had the stolen mare at the public-house, and detained it for the owner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. The father was not quite so certain of the mare - A. No; the son said he knew it. I have known the prisoner since Christmas, buying and selling horses at fairs, and at Smithfield - he lives near Whitechapel. He mentioned Baker as the man he bought her of. He saw me in the fair with the mare, three or four times before Lowe came up, and he brought three or four persons to buy her of me, and never tried to conceal it. I told him on Tuesday night that I should take it to Romford, and he said he should go there also, and that he had changed for this mare that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When Lowe claimed it did you not tell the prisoner you must have your own back again - A. Some people said so, and he rode off directly.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. In consequence of my son and Read losing a mare on the same morning, my son came to town - I went with him to look after them. about twelve o'clock on the Wednesday, he said he had found Read's mare. I went up with him to Turner, and after some conversation I told him it was stolen; he pointed across the market to the prisoner; we went up to him, and Turner told him the mare he had changed with him the night before was stolen. Snell said it could be no such thing, for he had got two men in the market that saw him buy it the day before, and he would go to fetch them; he rode down the market, as if with that intent - Turner said,</p>
               <p>"Snell, don't go away." We watched him till he got to the bottom of the market: Turner said,</p>

               <p>"He is off;" he rode after him, but returned without him. On the same evening I returned to Hackney, and met the prisoner on foot, in some meadows, by Hackney-marshes, and asked where he was going - he said to the King's Arms,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100011"/>at Bow, to meet Turner and the man he bought Read's mare of. I said he must go no further without somebody with him - he said he was not going to be taken by me, and immediately ran into the marshes, and I after him, calling Stop thief! Lethbridge ran out and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your oath, did he not say he changed for it on Tuesday morning - A. He did not in my hearing. He said he had two men who saw him buy it - he did not mention the name of Baker.</p>

            . I am a labourer to the East India Company. On the 4th of August, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner brought me the permit for these two chests, and asked me where they lay. I called Price. my partner, who shewed them to him. I asked Price, in his presence, who they were for. Price had the permit in his hand, and said they were for Francis and Child. I said I was surprised at a truck coming from them, for I never knew them send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100012"/>a truck before. The prisoner said that the carts were gone another way: he put the chests on the truck, and went away with them; he was alone. In about three hours the prosecutors sent for them, and we found they had been improperly delivered. I saw him in custody about a fortnight after, and am certain of him - his face was familiar to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you seen him before - A. I think I have seen him in our yard, fetching teas; he was in my view nearly a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 23d of August, I received information, and went with a search-warrant, to a stable in Seven-star-alley, St. George's in the East, and found a man there named Whitall; and in one corner of the stable I found a chest of green tea, not opened, and another standing on it, which had been opened, and only about 14 lbs. in it. I left it in charge of an officer, and went in search of the prisoner, whom I found at a house in Elbow-lane, and asked his name; he said Craig. I asked where he got the two chests of tea which were at Whitall's stable; he said he would tell me when he went to the stable; I took him there, and he said he bought it of Mr. Norman, of Sun-street, Bishopsgate, and hawked it about in a cart. I said the stable was an improper place to put tea; he said he was going to enter it on the Monday, and that he had lost the permit. I took him to the office. The chest weighed about 84 lbs.</p>

I was on the opposite side, and saw Kelly or Brooks give Tanian something, which she put into her apron; they crossed over the way, and went into a haberdasher's shop.

            . I am a constable. I was applied to, and took Tanian, and on our way to the Compter, she said she did not steal them, but would tell me who did, and directed me to No. 13, Lilly-street, where I found the other prisoners, and took the shoes from under Kelly's petticoats.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>KELLY'S Defence. This young woman took me with her to buy some ribbon. I went to look at a pair of shoes - I sat on a chair and tried them on; she stood at the window. I offered 3 s. for the shoes, which he would not take, and we walked out; she then said she had two pair of shoes; I said I thought the shoemaker was looking at her. Tanian came up, and she asked her to carry them home, and said she gave 3 s. 6 d. for them.</p>
               <p>BROOKS'S Defence. I was in distress. We came out of the shop and met this woman - I asked her to carry the shoes; she said she did not think she could, as she had two children to carry.</p>
               <p>TANIAN'S Defence. I met these two women in the market - Brooks said she had a pair of shoes for herself, and another for Kelly, and asked me to carry them while she went to another place. I had two children, and said I could not; she forced them into my apron, one pair fell out; they picked them up, and walked away. I told the officer where they lived.</p>

The prisoner came to me again, two or three minutes after twelve o'clock, to my lodging, and I just saw the deceased outside the door, but did not speak to her; they stopped about three minutes, and did not say where they were going. The prisoner came to my lodgings again between one and two o'clock that night - I met him on the stairs; he appeared very wet; I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Eliza?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Poor thing, she is no more - she is drowned;" and he began crying. He followed me up stairs; I got a light; he was very wet indeed; he said they had been to the bridge together, and she had unfortunately drowned herself, and he had used every means in his power to save her, but could not; that they had been to the play; and that distress occasioned them to do it; that he meant to make away with himself - he was in a great deal of trouble, and was hardly himself; I could not understand at times what he did say; he remained in my room until between seven and eight o'clock - I then pressed him to pull off his wet things, he would not do it before. I knew he was very badly off in circumstances.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever see a man in more anguish of mind than he was when he came to you - A. Never; he seemed in very great grief - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100014"/>had been intimate with him, and we had differed about his extraordinary affection for the deceased. He had asked me to let her sleep with me that night; I was not agreeable to it at first, but consented, at his great intreaty - I sat up for her till twelve o'clock, when he came to bring her - I saw him no more till he came in all over wet; every part of him was streaming wet; he said he had done every thing he could to save her, and wished me to go and alarm the people immediately; and told me to go and tell her mother, which I did; he would have gone himself, but he was not in a state to go; the mother lived in Boswell-court, Carey-street - she brought an officer at nine o'clock next night, and gave him in charge; he did not make the least effort to get away; he was a most humane and feeling young man I ever knew, and would not injure a worm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you been living with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her at the door, did you ask her to come in - A. I called Eliza, and she ran by the door immediately, and I saw no more of her - I had differed with her once or twice about him, and with him about her; he begged of me to treat her well, saying that she was deserving of good treatment - I heard from him and from her that he had proposed marriage to her.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Jermyn-street, St. James's. On the night, between Friday and Saturday, the 27th of July, I saw the prisoner coming from round the corner, from the Market-lane, about half-past one o'clock; he was knocking his hands about, and saying,</p>
               <p>"My God, my God, what have I done. Oh dear, oh dear." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have done something I am sure, and I shall take you to the watch-house;" I asked him where he was going - he went and rang the bell of Bell's house, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right, it is all right." Holiday, who lodges in the house came up, and I asked if he knew the prisoner. He said</p>
               <p>"My man what are you?" he said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right, my name is Dyson;" Holiday said,</p>
               <p>"Your wife I believe lodges above me" - he said, Yes. He opened the door with his key, and let him in. I noticed his clothes - the upper part of them were not wet, for I stood close by him for two minutes or more, but I did not notice his legs; if he had been very wet I must have seen it. I saw no wet about him. I did not notice him lower down than his body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Grand Jury - A. No; neither before the Coroner or Justice. There is a gas-light close to the door. I could see as clear as I do now; there was nothing to lead me to observe his clothes - I did not feel them. I will swear the upper part was not wet; he had his hat on. I did not observe his hair. He was at the door when I noticed his clothes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night in question, I saw the prisoner standing at the door in Jermyn-street, about a quarter before two o'clock - I asked what he wanted there; he made no answer. I opened the door; he went into the passage - I asked where he was going; he said,</p>
               <p>"It's all right, my name is Dyson;" Mrs. Bell was at the bottom of the stairs; she went up, and he after her.

            . I am a waterman. On Friday night, the 25th of July, at a quarter before eleven o'clock, I left my boat, moored near Westminster-bridge, on the Middlesex side, under the arch. When I left it it was ebb tide, and there was not sufficient water for a person to drown; it was a-ground - the tide was leaving her. I went to the boat about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, and found her above Old Palace-yard, about a hundred yards from where I left it; she was fastened to another boat, afloat, in deep water, sufficient to drown a person. I went to Vauxhall in her, and observed a bonnet under the seat; it appeared to have been put there. When I got to Vauxhall I washed the boat - her benches, seat, and back board were very dirty, as if there had been a scuffle in it, as if one or two persons had scraped their feet all over. There was no water in it, except a little from rain; there are piles alongside the Speaker's wall, above the place where I found the boat - it was further out in the river than where I had left it, but there is a causeway two feet above the ground; she would not have been afloat at twenty minutes flood. She would not have floated between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you left her did you make her head fast - A. Yes, I chained her to the pier; it was high water about four o'clock; she was clean when I left her - there were mud marks about her in the morning, which shewed somebody had been in her who had been about the banks of the river. I found her between the speaker's gardens and the bridge; she would have been afloat at two o'clock where I left her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person comes from the bridge to the boat, is there sand or mud - A. A person might go to the bridge without getting mud, but might get mud in going from the bridge to the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. A man not used to get a boat off, and fasten it again, might tread about on the back were the marks were - A. The benches and back board were muddy; a man standing on the back board must fall into the water - the part of it which stands up was muddy. The painting was scratched; the scratches were not there the night before. The mud on the back board appeared to be done by their scraping their feet against it; they could not stand on it without falling into the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person to be pushed over, behind the back board, might their feet come against it - A. They might. The marks appeared to me to be done by people struggling about. If they had walked in the mud, and then into the boat, there would be the prints of feet; but it was the scraping of feet. There was a watchman on the bridge right over the arch where the boat laid.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the body of the deceased at the request of her mother, on the morning of the 1st of August - I understood it had been six days in the water. It was in a very advanced state of putrefaction. The head was exceedingly swollen, of a dark purple colour, and very much disfigured. I observed no other marks, except those of putrefaction - the head was swollen, which appeared to me to arise from extravasation of blood, and if my opinion be right, it must have arisen from external violence. I did not open the head; but it appeared to be from extravasation. I opened the body; the lungs were gorged with black blood, which proved she died from suffocation, from drowning. The appearance of the face arose in my opinion from extravasation of blood, in consequence of blows. I am not acquainted with any other cause, which could produce it than external injury previous to death. I do not think a blow on the body after death could produce these appearances. I do not think that the blow occasioned death, but occasioned the marks on the face. Suffocation from drowning was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not suffocation from drowning occasion the blood to go towards the head, and produce swelling in the face - A. I do not know, but I suppose a person strangled would have the face black - the return of blood from the head would be prevented, and make it of a dark colour; but I make a distinction between strangulation and drowning. I never examined a drowned body before.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I examined the deceased in company with Mr. Jeffries - the head was exceedingly swollen; there appeared marks of violence on the face, arising from extravasation of blood, produced by external violence, previous to death - they appeared chiefly on the left eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The state of putrefaction had considerably advanced - A. Yes. I have seen three or four drowned persons, after they had been three days in the water. I never saw one that had been six days under water.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not putrefaction discolour and enlarge the body - A. Yes, but not the peculiar sort of discolouration - the head does not swell except from extravasation. The marks were distinguishable from the general swelling of the body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the skin of the face broken at all - A. No. I did not open the head, as I thought it evident without, that external violence produced it. The faces of all drowned persons are swollen, but not so much as this. Death from suffocation is followed by darkness in the skin to a certain extent; but the colour on this face was different - the discolouration would be all over the face, not partial, as this was.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a blow of the humane hand produce it - A. I should think it would. I observed no marks but these; they were under both eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not suffocation produce the marks under the eyes without external violence - A. Not to this extent; it would be the same colour I should think. I consider in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100016"/>my judgment that the marks were produced by external violence previous to death.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and saw the deceased's body, and was led to suppose that external violence had been used, as there was a considerable discolouration, more under the left eye than any where else. In my judgment it must have been produced by external violence previous to death. The mark ran as a blow would, if produced by the side of a hand; it proceeded from under the eye, nearly up to the temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many drowned subjects - A. Two or three; one had been taken out immediately after the accident - the other two had been two three days in water. A body being six days under water would certainly make a difference in its appearance; but I can judge what those effects would be. I have been seven years in practice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would a blow given by the hand, producing such a mark, would it have stunned a person - A. I should think so, but if the body was so disfigured I cannot say on what part the blow was given. Dissection would have been the best way to ascertain the matter correctly - she was pregnant, and about five months gone.</p>

            . I re-examined the body before the Coroner's Jury, on the 2d of August, and observed the face and head a good deal disfigured and swollen. I examined the part particularly, and divided it with a knife, and found no extravasation, nor any one circumstance to induce me to believe that external violence had been used - I examined under the eyes, and cut open that part. I have often seen drowned persons, and saw nothing in this case different from what would arise from putrefaction and suffocation. When a body is immediately taken out of the water the face is dark, and the body swells eventually.</p>

            , ESQ. I am Coroner, and have the notes of what the prisoner said on his examination before me, which I took at the time. I cautioned him to be very particular in what he said. I have seen a great many bodies of persons whose death was produced by drowning, without suspicion of violence, and have seen all the appearances in them, which this body had. (Examination read.)</p>

            , of No. 11, Sherrard-street, Golden-square, waiter, saith, that he and the deceased cohabited together, as man and wife, not being so; he knew another woman who claimed to be his wife, not being so. They were all together on that day and evening; was to quit that lodging on that day - quitted the house about nine o'clock on Friday evening, the 25th of July last, and proceeded by her desire to the Haymarket Theatre, and remained till the conclusion of the performance was over - they then went together to Jermyn-street; the young woman walked on, and I stopped at the lodgings of Mrs. Bell, according as she had made me promise that I would see her again that night; she enquired where this unfortunate young woman was, as she had appointed to sleep there that night - that I requested Eliza to do so, but could not prevail on her; left Jermyn-street with Eliza, and walked down the Haymarket to the Westminster-bridge, went down on the left hand side of the bridge; were some time talking on that side of the bridge, and then walked under the arch to the other side the bridge, and she got into a boat and I followed; she then got from that into another boat that was close by it - was some time in the boat talking to each other; was then standing with one foot on the side of the boat, and she was leaning on me to the best of my recollection. Suddenly found myself in the water; not able to swim, never being able to swim in my life, but struggling towards the young woman, as I supposed, in the water; got hold of the boat, and got into it, and looking round and not seeing the young woman there, I supposed she likewise was fallen in; called Help, help, help, several times - Murder and help, again. I then listened, but did not hear anything in the water, but presently saw something above the water, which I supposed to be the young woman - I then cried, Eliza my dear, and strived to push the boat to get towards her, but finding the boat was fast, went to the other end, and pulling a bit of rope, which appeared to fasten it, it came easily undone, and then with one of the things they row the boat with, pushed the boat towards where I saw the young woman above the water; my strength in the agitation was not sufficient to push the boat as I wished it to go - she had disappeared again below the water, and I saw her a second time; she appeared to sink under the water directly. I could not get near her with the boat, and dropped down the piece of wood I had in my hand, and prayed to God to spare her life. Could not for some time get the boat to that side of the water to get out of it. When I got out of the boat, I came up the stairs as far as the end of the bridge, saw a man apparently intoxicated, and a dirty looking woman; seeing him in liquor did not inform him of what had happened, but went straightway to the house where Mrs. Bell lodged at, and rung the bell - before she came down a person who lodged in the house came and unlocked the door; I walked in - the watchman came from the other side of the street - came to the door, and the person who lodged in the house, appeared not to know me; told them my name was Dyson, then went up stairs; left Mrs. Bell on the stairs, coming to answer the door - told her that poor Eliza was no more; and begged her to go to her mother. On farther recollection, thought she would not get in, there being a gate, and therefore delayed it till later in the morning. She went to her mother, and I remained in the room until she came back - some little time after she came back it was time for the young person to get up, who slept with Mrs. Bell, and I went outside the door till she had dressed herself. When I came in, Mrs. Bell requested me to take off my wet things - I asked her if she supposed dry things could be of any consequence to me after what had happened; she still persuading me, I pulled off my wet things, put on a dry shirt, and went into bed.</p>
               <p>That it was my intention to destroy myself, and when the young woman found it was my intention, she determined on doing the same. I tried to prevail on her not to make away with herself, had written a paper, with an intent to put in my pocket, that I intended to drown myself - I accidentally left the paper on the table, and she got it and read it, and by that means it was that she found that I was determined to make away with myself.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On Wednesday, the 30th of July, I was mowing in a field with the prisoner and his brother - we finished about seven o'clock in the evening. The prisoner said to his brother,</p>
               <p>"B - r your eyes, you told master I could not mow more than an old woman;" he swore a great many oaths, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know I can mow your legs off" - William said,</p>
               <p>"You know you can't mow, and can't keep up in company;" the prisoner swore if he did not get out of his way, he would break his scythe in pieces - they both had their scythes in their hands at the time; the prisoner chopped at his brother's scythe two or three times with his own scythe, and at the third or fourth stroke he missed the scythe in consequence of his brother dropping his down, and stuck his brother in the side - his brother dropped his scythe, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am ruined for ever," and walked out of the field directly, and went up stairs into a house. The prisoner kept on chopping the ground and the grass up, and said nothing; he stopped there. He seemed a little fresh, but not much in liquor. I went up stairs to see William - he died on the Friday morning at one o'clock. He struck at him three or four times; William never struck him. The prisoner stuck his scythe into a tree before he said anything to his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike the tree for - A. He seemed in a passion; we had been mowing together during the afternoon - there had been a heavy shower; his brother and him went in doors, and after they came out he used these expressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When a man says,</p>
               <p>"I can mow your legs off," does not it mean, I can mow so fast that you cannot mow quick enough to get out of my way - A. Yes, that is the meaning of it. He said,</p>
               <p>"I can mow your legs off;" his brother said,</p>
               <p>"No you can't, you can't keep up in company." I had only known them a fortnight, and never heard them quarrel before.</p>
               <p>Q. When the blow which stuck the deceased was struck, did he happen to turn his scythe - A. His scythe dropped down certainly, and the prisoner's scythe passed upwards, which it would not have done if the brother had not dropped his scythe; he had been standing with the blade up, and dropped it, which suffered the prisoner's scythe to pass over.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Winchin, of Ryeslip. My mistress's garden joins the field where the men were mowing. I was in the garden on this evening, and heard them at high words; I went up to the hedge, and looked over into the field - I could not hear what passed but saw plainly; they were a hundred yards off. I think it was the prisoner who I heard swearing - he was whetting his scythe when I first saw him. I heard him say to his brother, that he could not mow, and never could mow in his life - I think it was the prisoner who said so; I saw him in the act of mowing, and cutting towards his brother, who appeared to be standing still; I do not think that he was mowing. I heard him use an oath, and say he would mow his legs up, meaning that he could mow better than him. I saw him cut towards his brother's scythe, and heard the scythes make a great rattling together. I think he cut three or four times towards his brother's scythe, and was too far off to say whether his brother struck again or not - I saw him attempt to keep the blows from his legs, and heard some one say,</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, there will be mischief, or an accident;" I cannot say whether it was the deceased or the third man. I saw the deceased drop his scythe, turn round, and go towards the house - he put his hands to his bowels, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am ruined!" and saw the blood run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The three men were in the field - A. Yes. The prisoner's brother was on his left, and he was mowing towards the left side. I do not mean that he was directing the scythe towards his brother's body. His brother put his scythe down, to stop him from mowing his way.</p>
               <p>MR. BARLOW SLADE. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased, and found him wounded in the lower part of his body - his bowels were nearly out; he died of that wound.</p>

On the 8th of July, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was at the White Horse, public-house; Dance and the prisoners were there. When I went in, Dance sat by himself - he was rather in liquor; he got up, and Insworth collared him, and sat him down again; Dance moved to get up, and he sat him down again, and Blagrove went and put his hand up the chimney, and smutted his face - he said nothing, and Blagrove did it again. He moved to go out at the tap-room door, and Hill secured and threw him against the settle, violently - Blagrove and Insworth were both in the tap-room at the time, sitting down, but did not touch him at this time. Dance was thrown down so violently that we took him out of the tap-room - he could not get up himself. We washed his face. and I left him in the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long were you there - A. An hour; I left at a quarter to six o'clock. I saw a woman in a red cloak there. Dance did not appear much in liquor. Insworth's face was not blacked. They were larking with Dance.</p>

            . I saw the deceased pushed against the settle; Blagrove had hold of his coat flap, and Hill had his hand against his breast to set him down, but there was no intention of throwing him - he was very much intoxicated, and fell against the settle with his right side. I carried him out - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my loins," and groaned very much, but never spoke afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100018"/>Cross-examined. Q. When did you leave the house - A. I was there all the evening. He fell down from intoxication.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS. I keep this house. The deceased was taken home in about two hours. I took all the care of him that I could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The care you took was to send him to the privy, and leave him there for two hours - A. No; I sent people to mind him - he might be there an hour. I sent him home in a wheel barrow, having nothing else.</p>
               <p>G. J. R. G. DICKENSON. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on Saturday morning; two ribs were broken on the right side, and there was about two ounces of coagulated blood on the brain, which occasioned his death. A blow or fall against a hard substance would produce this - his general habit of body was continual intoxication; but whether it arose from intoxication I cannot say - the fall might extend the vessels. It is my opinion that the fall occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he was drunk at the time, is it not probable that intoxication might rupture the vessel - A. Yes, without any blow. There was no external injury on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Considering that he was drunk, do you think the violence he received from being forced down accelerated his death - A. I do; when I hear that he was thrown down, I believe his death was accelerated by the rupture of a blood vessel. The rupture might be very gradual - he might only feel a head-ache for five minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard that he was drunk, is it your opinion that the violence of the fall accelerated his death - A. Certainly if he fell; his head was injured. If he fell with sufficient violence to break his ribs, that might rupture the vessel.</p>

I had fastened the doors with a pin, which they took out. It cost my mistress eight guineas, and is nearly new.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 31st of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Queen Ann-street, with this coat across his shoulders - I asked how he came by it; he said he bought it of a gentleman's coachman about a week before. I took him to Marlborough-street.</p>

I got up about twenty minutes before seven o'clock in the morning, and found a pane of glass cut, over the spring of the window, and the spring pulled back - the sash had been opened, and the sliding shutters pushed down, which enabled persons to get in. My till, which was safe overnight, was taken, and left in the summer-house in the garden, and its contents gone.

On the 28th of August, I was at work in the warehouse - the prisoner came up, walked about, and went into the front ware room, where this work was, and I saw him let some numbers drop on the floor, and when I looked he was picking them up, and putting them into his pocket - he went down stairs very quick; I followed and overtook him before he got to the bottom, and asked where he was going - he said he was going away; I asked what numbers he had in his hand - he said nothing that I could understand. I took him up into Mr. Saunders's room, and took the numbers out of his pocket - he said he had bought them. I said I was positive that he took them out of the shop; he had said nothing to me about buying them before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not between the stairs and Mr. Saunders's room - A. No. he was below the room.</p>

             for fourteen years - the prisoner was twelve months in their service. On the 21st of July, I saw a bottle of oil concealed behind the stove in the warehouse. I told Perry to be in attendance - the prisoner left a few minutes before eight o'clock in the evening. I observed him rather bulky, and found the bottle gone; I gave notice to Perry who took him. I charged him with stealing the oil; he said he merely took it to make some blacking.</p>

               <p>"Wright, oh! Wright, a notorions house-breaker." He made no answer, but was taken to the watch-house, where I found Young in custody; he said he lived in Peter-street. I went home and examined the state of the house and found the iron bolt of the shutter burst off, the shutter forced down, and three coach plate-glasses, which had been taken out that afternoon, removed from where they were at bed-time, and placed near the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you keep a servant in the house - A. No; I fastened it up myself; they entered at the right-hand shutter by the door; when the shutter was moved anybody could get in; the bolts were broken; they were safe when I went to bed, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. The shutter must have been forced down by somebody standing in the street - A. Standing in my yard; he might dirty his clothes by rubbing against the coach wheels; my kitchen is under the shop; we did not secure Wright in the kitchen, but followed him up stairs; he could not escape, for the front of the house was surrounded by watchmen; I gave him in charge immediately we got up stairs; Gazley is not here. I found a tinder-box and pieces of candle under the carriage where the glass had been taken out.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Gazley, and sleep at his house, which is next door to the prosecutor's. I had been to the stable with my master's horse, and returning about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, went to my bed-room, at the back of the house. I came into the front room with a light, looked into the street, and saw three men and a woman under a gas light over the way, the men were pointing to the house; I will not say that the prisoners were there at that time. I went and called master, and said I thought they came after no good; they went away at half-past twelve o'clock, and after the watchman had called half-past twelve, two men came back; they had not been at Chamberlain's door above a minute before there was a light, the shadow of the light appeared to come from his door; the shortest of the two men came back and looked up the street towards Newport-market where the watchman stood; my wife then came and said there was a noise in Chamberlain's back yard. I immediately went into the back room, put the window up, but could see nobody; I returned to the front room, and saw the two men, the shortest went up the street, and the other down the street from Chamberlain's door, the watchman then called one o'clock, and at half-past one, the same men both came back together from St. Martin's lane; they came right to Chamberlain's house, and the moment they came, I could see the shadow of a light again; the short man went away to the railing in front of Chamberlain's house, that was Young.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon you to say that was Young - A. Yes, I swear that; I am quite sure of it; he leaned against the post, and stooped over to see if he could see the watchman, and then crossed the road, and looked again for the watchman, then went up and stood at Chamberlain's door about half a minute, then got over my master's iron railing, squatted himself down behind a packing case, and I called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man all this time - A. I could not see him; I think he was in the house. When I called the watchman, Young jumped over the rails, and ran away. I came down into the street with a light, and found the watchman at Chamberlain's door; he knocked at the door, a person opened it, but my light was put out, I did not see who it was. Nobody but about five watch-men, my master, myself, and another man, went into the house. I am sure Wright did not go in with the watchman: when I went in the watchman laid hold of him in the house; I found a screw-driver on the packing case behind, which Young had been concealed. I saw the watchman take Young.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to say you saw the watchman take Young, or take a man - A. I can swear he took Young, for there was only the watchman and him there, his back was towards me at the time. I saw him take the same man as ran from behind the packing-case, I am sure he is the man. I saw him again at Marlborough-street, and knew him by his face; I had a view of his face by the gas light, he is the man; I cannot be mistaken, he is the man I call the short one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You saw him from a window, is that up two pair of stairs - A. Yes. Q. Who went into the house while you went down, you cannot say - A. The watchman was there before I left the window.</p>

               <p>"I do." I said</p>
               <p>"Why don't you get a light;" he said,</p>
               <p>"The boy is coming with one." I saw no boy, and called for a light outside the house, which was immediately brought, and I gave it to Wright, supposing that he belonged to the house; he took me down stairs, and pointed to a kitchen door, within, which he said he thought the thieves were. I broke it open by his direction, and we proceeded to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100023"/>up the chimney for them, found none, and Wright was recognized.

               <p>"Watch." I ran directly, he sung out</p>
               <p>"they are breaking into the house, stop that man." I saw Young run from Chamberlain's door, followed and never lost sight of him till Lewis met and stopped him. I said</p>
               <p>"What have you been doing?" he said he had been doing nothing at all. I brought him back, and said</p>
               <p>"You must have been doing something, or you would never have run away;" he said he, had been easing himself there, and when he heard watch called he ran away; I said it was very simple to run away for that.

I cannot swear that it was the prisoner - a man and a woman, (who were tried here two years ago) followed us into the room. I wished to get out, thinking I was not safe; it was the general desire that I should treat all the company. I wished to go for the liquor myself, in order to get out, but was not allowed; a man stood at the door, and seeing my alarm, the wooden legged man said I owed him 3 l. - he threw me on the floor with the black woman's assistance, and took 12 l. 7 s. from my pocket, I have recovered none of it; they seized me by the neck-handkerchief, and attempted to strangle me; the man with a wooden leg asked if he should cut my throat two or three voices answered him</p>

            . On the 28th of June, about half past six o'clock, I was with Woodward at the King's Head public-house, Crouch-End. My master had information that Mr. Rugg had been robbed, and said that the three lads were gone up Mount Pleasant; we went after them, and overtook the prisoners on Stroud Green, about a mile and a half from Mr. Rugg's. Woodward got up to them first; when I came up, Norton ran away and I after him; I saw a man and called Stop thief! he detained him till I came up; I took him to the other two. They were very loth to go back; we took them to Mr. Rugg's, who said he knew they were the persons who had been into his house, and if they would deliver up his things they might go about their business; they declared that they had got nothing; he said he knew they had, and the sooner they gave it up, the sooner they would go; King and Norton delivered up a good many things; Rawley said he had nothing; Mr. Rugg said they were to go about their business; I said they should not, and while I was speaking Francis came and took them. Mr. Rugg would not give up the property.</p>
               <p>MR. RUGG. I have all the property here, and can swear to it. Rawley said he was perfectly unacquainted with the others, that they merely overtook him.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner. On the way to the watch-house, he wanted us to take him to his friends to make matters up, but Ashdown said he should go to the watch-house; he said voluntarily, that he took the coat. I asked what he had done with it. He told different stories, and at last said he gave it to a friend, who had pawned it, but where it was he did not tell.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner, in consequence of information from Mrs. Finch, at Illingdon, about three miles from her house, on the 15th of July, and found the handkerchief round his neck; a hat on his head, and a pair of ear-rings in his pocket. He told me, before the Magistrate, where he had sold the other things; I went to where he directed me, and found a gown, waistcoat, and jacket, at a shop at Paddington, and another waistcoat at another shop; he said voluntarily that he certainly stole them, and wished to let the man know where they were.</p>

I took the key from my pocket and opened the door; the prisoner rushed out of the house, struck me in the face with his fist, pushed me back, and rushed by me - I immediately followed, and the watchman stopped him without my losing sight of him - I had gone out at seven o'clock, and left my father and mother at home. He ran towards Bloomsbury-square at first, but seeing the watchman he turned back towards me, crossed, turned down Bury-street, and while I was at the corner I saw him taken. I am certain of him, for I never lost sight of him. I went in doors; found nothing taken,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100026"/>nor any of the inside doors opened; he had not got beyond the passage. He said I was mistaken in his person.</p>

I saw it in the cutting room on the 1st of July, which is at the bottom of my garden, and connected with the dwelling-house, it is all enclosed by one wall. On the 22d of July I accused the prisoner of moving some calico, he said he moved it to measure some ferret, this roused my suspicion. I measured my cloths over, and missed this; and went to his lodging, where I found him. Mr. Hall, said in my presence,</p>
               <p>"I am come to take you into custody, and where is Mr. Sadler's property;" the prisoner went to a table and delivered up five duplicates, three of them were for the property stolen; he said he was sorry for it, and hoped I would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not tell him if he would go with you and finish a jacket he was about, you would give up the prosecution - A. No, not any thing the sort; I asked him to return and finish one which he was working on, with a view to get him apprehended, and he did return. I have known him a long time, and have been his friend all through life, and supplied him with money when starving, and introduced him to my friends - I did not lead him into expences. I have seen a person who passes as his wife, but cannot say whether he is married.</p>

            . His evidence at Marlborough-street was not as he now says. I produced the cloth, he took hold of it, examined it, and the clerk took down his deposition; and after he swore to the cloth, I said, by referring to my tickets, it was not the cloth, but some the prisoner's father had pawned; and at the second examination I brought the right cloth. The duplicates produced are what I gave for this cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. There is a mark on this cloth which enables me to speak to it; they were in one piece when they came to my house, and here is the end on one piece. I can swear to it from the shade and list, there are as many different shades in black as blue. I lost cloth of the same sort as the others.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to me - she had formerly lodged with me for two months, and said she had called to pay the rent she had left due; she did not pay me. I gave her leave to sleep with my servant - she remained with us till Wednesday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, when I went out, leaving her at home; my wife went out soon after. On the Monday night I had seen 16 s. and a sovereign in the drawer in a table which was in the room where she slept with the servant. I gave my wife four sovereigns to put there. I returned at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon - she was still in the house, but the money was missing. I said it must be her or the servant - she said she had taken none. I sent for a constable, who found a sovereign in her pocket, and a half-crown in her left pocket. I locked the drawer on Monday, and took no money out myself.</p>

I received four sovereigns from my husband on Monday, which I put, with 20 s., in silver, into a little box, in a table drawer of the room where she slept. I locked the drawer and took the key; there was a sovereign and some silver there before. I went to the drawer on Wednesday at two o'clock, and found it unlocked; it appeared to have been forced by a knife. I found only three sovereigns and 11 s. 6 d. I got the officer, and charged her with it; she denied it, and said all her money was in her box - none was found in her box; but a sovereign, a sixpence, and some half-pence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100027"/>were found in her pocket; she said it was her own. She was intoxicated every day, and did not pay us what she owed, which was 2 s. 6 d. The servant was not searched. The bed-room is on the ground-floor - the street door is kept open in the day-time.

            . I am servant to Hooper - there is no other servant. The prisoner came to the house on Saturday night, and slept with me. A boy named Ned lived in the house - he went into the room as well as us, but did not sleep there. I saw that the drawer was a little broken on Wednesday. I did not look at it till two o'clock, when my mistress came home. I never saw the prisoner do anything to it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had resolved to leave the house, in consequence of improper proceedings occurring there, and as she refused to stop she was charged with this robbery.</p>

            . I have a house in the City, but live in Spa-fields. On the 23d of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was going home. I had been drinking in the early part of the evening, but at the time in question I was not so much intoxicated - feeling myself giddy in the head, I stopped in the <placeName id="t18230910-46-crimeloc257">Pig-market</placeName>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner close to me - I had a view of his face and his person; he had white trowsers on; he began to ask me a variety of questions, in a hurried manner, and during that time I felt my gold seals and chain either snatched or cut from me - I felt them go; the chain was attached to a ribbon; I immediately charged him with the theft, and he ran away; I ran after him, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief," and secured him less than forty yards off, I suppose. I got hold of him, and at that moment the watchman came up, and finally secured him; I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it a dark or a light night - A. It was neither day nor twilight, but there is a strong gas light in the centre of the market.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you identify the man? - A. He had white trowsers on, and the suddenness of the transaction led me to notice him; he could not have been above three or four yards from in yet any time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the early part of the evening when you were very much inebriated - A. About four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Were you not so drunk at twelve o'clock, that you did not know what you were about - A. Yes, I was; I understood the Jury to ask what time I left my residence; I had not been drinking at four or five o'clock; I admit that at twelve o'clock I was very drunk; I spent the evening at Mr. Smith's; near Moorfields; I have only been there three or four times, and don't know the sign of the house. I was there the whole of the time; I cannot say at what time I left; I paid for something next day which I had broken at Smith's. I will not undertake to swear that I recollect anything that passed there - the ribbon was attached to my watch, and the chain next the seals.</p>
               <p>Q. When your watch was down in your fob the ribbon could not be seen - A. Certainly it could, it was a very large ribbon. I have been told that a person at Smith's put my seals into my fob; I will not swear that I recollect leaving Smith's, or where I might have rambled before I went into the pig-market; I was finding my way home; I might have gone to the west end of the town to find the pig-market. I took the prisoner first; I never said that the watchman took him first; I was resting my stomach against the pens.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that immediately on turning round you taxed him with robbing you - A. I have not; I did not strike him; I believe I attempted to do it after he was in custody of the watchman, not before - I never said that I turned round and struck him immediately, saying nothing about his running away. I did not come up to him in Long-lane; I am not aware that anybody was with me, or talking to me in Long-lane. I went before the Alderman next morning; the hearing was put off, because it was said I was much irritated, but I swear I was sober; I have said I was sorry this occurred, on account of the prisoner's family. I have said I was sorry for this proceeding, but I coupled it with that remark. I went to Guildhall, thinking the examination would be there. I remember apologising to a person, believing I had been rather rude to him, being irritated. I never said I was come to quash the business; I have been at Smith's house; I was not drunk both times; I never charged any man with robbing me who was assisting me home when drunk. I know that on one occasion I was very ill at Smith's house, but did not lay on the floor, for Mrs. Smith offered me a bed, and I went to lay down. I never laid on the floor drunk there, that I recollect; I have spent the evening there three times, and called in twice, but only had a glass of cider and beer.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who is Mrs. Smith - A. I had been to her house; she is the landlady of the public-house. I was there one morning, and she said</p>
               <p>"I did not think you would have gone so far." I was with nobody till I arrived at the pig-market. I never expressed a doubt of the prisoner's robbing me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the time you found his arm round your body till you stopped him did you see any person till the watchman came - A. There was no other person.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came up, did you say to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Where is your pall" - A. I believe I did at the watch-house, from the observation which the watchman made. The impression on my mind was, that in these cases there is always more than one person.</p>

            . I am a watchman my beat is in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100028"/>Long-lane, and part of the pig-market; part of it comes into Smithfield - there are some rails there. On the 23d of July, I recollect seeing Mr. Gregory leaning on the rails - it was rather better than half-past one o'clock; there was a person on his right side, standing up, but what he was doing I cannot say. I was about ten yards off; it was not day-light - there was a gas-light in the centre of us; I could have distinguished them without that light, as there were other lights near. I heard the prisoner ask Mr. Gregory several times where he was going to, and which way he was going; I am certain of his person - the last question he asked was if he was going towards the bridge - I did not hear Gregory reply, but the prisoner jumped away from him, and Gregory went after him directly, calling Stop thief! Gregory stopped him himself. I never lost sight of either of them; he caught hold of him by one side, and I on the other. Gregory said he had robbed him of his seals and chain; he said he had not. Gregory accompanied us to the watch-house, at St. Sepulchre's-church - he told me not to collar him; I held his cuff, and he went on quietly. When we arrived at the watch-house Gregory laid the charge before the officer of the night; the prisoner said he had not robbed him; that he was a respectable man; he was searched, and his own watch, a penknife, and nineteen duplicates were found on him - I do not recollect whether the knife was in his waistcoat or trowsers pocket. I left Gregory at the watch-house, returned to the pig-market with my lanthorn, and went to the place about where the prisoner was stopped, which is between twenty and thirty yards from where they were at first - I could not see anything in the passing where the people pass, but went aside, and saw Godfrey pick up a gold seal in the enclosure, five or six yards from the path - it was thrown over the rails, nearly opposite the spot where he was taken, and two or three yards further on I found the chain, part of a ribbon, and the seal - I cannot say whether the key was with it; the ribbon appeared to have been cut rather slanting. I went to the watch-house - Godfrey would not deliver the chain and seals to Gregory till he described them, which he did satisfactorily, before he saw them. I believe he was a little in liquor; but he seemed more overcome with passion than liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time was it when you first saw them together - A. Better than half-past one o'clock; I had been in Long-lane that night from ten o'clock. I saw nothing of Gregory till I saw him leaning on the pens; the prisoner stood by his side, asking him questions, but I never heard Gregory answer; I did not see him shew fight, or any blows pass. The pens are gathered up together. The seal was found near a wall, by a house; the other was two or three yards further on, on the left hand side, not on the spot they walked. I have seen Mr. Gregory twice since at the Mansion House, and twice at Guildhall, and saw him one night when he was going home, when my box was at the Bull's Head, public-house, at the corner of Smithfield-bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with him - A. I had no business to have conversation with him. He told me the people wanted him to make it up; his wife said it should not be made up; she was with him. This was a little after ten o'clock one night. I never heard him ask the prisoner where his pall was, to the best of my knowledge I swear I never told him that he did. I had a glass of gin that night, but he drank none - I did not think it odd for him to treat me. I never saw him drunk at the examination. I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober. 17 s. or 18 s. were found on the prisoner; every thing found on him was returned. He was dressed in white trowsers, and a surtout coat; the coat was unbuttoned at the watch-house, to get to his waistcoat pocket. I cannot say whether it was buttoned when he was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the ribbon you found fit the ribbon of the prosecutor's watch - A. It corresponded with it, and appeared fresh cut. He had a bundle of papers in his pocket.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. Williams brought the prisoner to the watch-house between one and two o'clock; Gregory and the watchman came with him; Gregory charged him with having robbed him of a gold chain, two seals, and a key, and stated that he was coming through the pig-market, was taken very ill, and leaned over the rails for ease, and on a sudden discovered some person behind him; turned round and saw the prisoner, who had his hands round him, and he thought for improper purposes, but very shortly after he missed his seals, and on turning round, the prisoner ran away; that he immediately pursued him, calling Stop thief! that he caught him in the footpath, and at that instant the watchman came up and secured him; the watchman agreed to the statement, the prisoner denied the charge. Gregory was in liquor, and gave his account rather in a violent manner; he accounted for it by saying, he felt so indignant at the prisoner, supposing he wanted to use his hands to an improper purpose, that he was enraged. I went to the spot with Williams, and found rather a large gold-seal; Williams picked up a gold chain, seal, key, and piece of ribbon attached to it; there is an enclosure on one side of the footpath; these things were found about six yards from the footpath, both on one side, in such a situation as they would be if thrown there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Where were the seals found - A. On the left hand side of the pathway coming from Barbican, on a vacant spot of ground in the pig-market, and about six yards from the path; there is a gate at the further end, which is generally shut, except on market days, to keep people from the vacant space; if shut, a person must get over to get into it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor got to the watch-house, do you remember his trying to strike the prisoner - A. He was prevented; I remember his saying at the watch-house</p>
               <p>"Where is your pall?" I have since told him that he did say so; I think he acknowledged it, but will not swear it; the first examination was between twelve and one o'clock, and was put off on account of his demeanour. The prisoner had a variety of papers about him in different parts. I cannot say whether his coat was buttoned. I think the knife was in his waistcoat pocket, it was not open when it was found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Among the things found was there a watch ribbon - A. A ribbon was attached to the chain, it appeared to be cut as clean as possible; the prosecutor's watch had part of a ribbon attached to it, and it exactly corresponded with that part of it.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. Williams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100029"/>brought the prisoner in about a quarter to two o'clock; Gregory charged him with taking his chain and seals; Gregory seemed rather violent and a little in liquor I think; but he gave his statement exactly as at the Mansion-house. I found a watch, chain, seals, seventeen shillings, nineteen duplicates, and a small penknife on him; he denied the charge, and gave no particular account of himself; Godfrey and Williams went out, Gregory remained with me till they returned, and brought what I now produce in the state it was brought in except that; the large seal was off separate, I have a piece of ribbon which I took off the watch in Gregory's possession; he described the seals and chain exactly before he saw them; I took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Will you put the ribbon together, and say where they correspond - A. It has been rubbed about at the different examinations, the ends have been tezaed out, and do not correspond now, but they did; they appeared to me to have been cut; his coat was buttoned to the bottom when he came to the watch-house; I could not get at his waistcoat pocket without unbuttoning it - he had papers in his breast pocket, and in different parts. I will not say whether there were any in the same pocket as the knife. I believe Gregory said to him,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you have a pall, where is your pall." I believe I told him at the second examination that he had said so - he said he did not see any pall, and did not know of any, that he might have used the expression, but did not think that he did; he talked very sensible, but seemed a little intoxicated, and in a great passion at the watch-house - he was the worse for liquor next morning at the examination, which was about twelve o'clock, the Alderman adjourned it because he was irritated in mind. The ribbon appeared to be cut clean, not torn.</p>

            . They are my property, and were in my possession the night in question - I know it was safe before I was attacked; the watch was protected only by the ribbon.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long might this person be near you in the pig-market - A. I cannot say, I went to Smith's next morning, before I went to Guildhall, and drank some porter, nothing else. I do not think I drank a quart; I drank nothing else prior to going before the Alderman to the best of my belief - I have no recollection of taking spirits, a man named Keeve was with me; that the street-keeper was there, and drank with me. I did not have a glass of brandy, and another of gin at Smith's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long defence stated the case, he had witnesses to prove, that he left Golden-lane at half past one o'clock, and overtook the prosecutor and another at the end of Barbican; they asked where he was going, he said over Blackfriars-bridge, and he said he would walk with him; but on arriving at the sheep-pens, the prosecutor proposed going to the Bear public-house to drink, after which he stopped to lean against the pens in the pig-market, and on the prisoner enquiring if he was going on, he placed his hands to his small-clothes, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me of my watch;" that the prisoner called him a scoundrel, and he might have struck him; the prosecutor called the watchman, and gave him in charge. The prisoner then stated the evidence he should produce, as appears from the following witnesses.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and live in Golden-lane. On the 22d of July, at seven o'clock, I came home and found the prisoner at my house; he came to settle some accounts for me, and when he had done that, he had some business of his own which he wished to do up stairs at my house, as after that he should be able to spend the evening with me - he came down between eight and nine o'clock; we supped and had some grog; he left my house at half-past one o'clock, he lives near the Coburg Theatre; he had a frock coat on, and some papers in his waistcoat pocket, supported by the flap of his coat; it was a single-breasted coat, and being buttoned tight, was the only way he could secure the papers; he said at my house he had lost some papers before, and took pains to button his coat, so as not to lose these - he buttoned it down to the bottom, nearly to cover his waistcoat pocket. I saw him mend his pen that night with a knife, which I believe he took from his waistcoat pocket; I do not know where he put it; it is five or six minutes walk from my house to Smithfield. Smith's house is the Golden Key, in Tenter-street, about ten minutes walk from the pig-market.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Golden Key, public-house, Tenter-street. Gregory was at my house the night he was robbed, and left about half-past eleven o'clock, the house was closed at eleven, but it might be twelve before I got him out; it was not above ten minutes past twelve I am positive; he was very much intoxicated, I do not think he knew what he was about exactly, he had been there three or four hours drinking. He was at my house three months before; he was drunk when he came in and went into the skittle ground; three bowls of punch were taken there, and when he came out he was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time lay on the ground at your house - A. Yes, that was three months ago. He was then so insensible, that I got two men to go and order a coach for him, and when they came in he had fallen down by the side of the door - he jumped up and accused them of robbing him. They had only lifted him gently up. He asked whether they wanted to rob or murder him. I could not get him out of doors for two hours. On the night of the robbery, before he went away, Mr. Smith told him his seals were in a very dangerous state, as he was not capable of taking care of them, and they were fastened into his waistband; but he was so intoxicated that before he went he took them out again, and went out with them in their usual state, the chain and ribbon were visible. For three months before, when he was in the skittle-ground, he lost the ring which fastened the watch to the chain, and I fastened it to the chain; the chain was shorter as the ring was gone. On the night in question no part of the ribbon could be seen, when his watch was in his fob. He broke a pane of glass which he has since paid for, he did not recollect breaking of it; and, moreover, he said he was a complete madman when drunk. He called next morning and apologized for his conduct, and paid for what he broke, and drank some ale and a glass of brandy; he drank some porter with some gentlemen who were playing there, and vomited in the parlour. Keeve was there at the time. He left our house at twelve o'clock that morning, and was by no means sober; he said he met a man in the pig-market, and felt his arms round his waist, and he felt so indignant that he turned round immediately, seized and held<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100030"/>him tight; I said</p>
               <p>"Was it possible you could hold a man in that state." After he came from the wall, he said the man ran two or three steps - he has said many times that he was sorry for what he had done, and the proceedings might be quashed, and he should not have proceeded if it had not been for the officers. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gregory, I am sorry you should have proceeded so far - you have not lost your property, and consider the man's family" - he said, if he had the least shadow of a doubt he should not have proceeded, but the officers had urged him on. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not say he was sorry for the proceedings on account of the man's family - A. He did.</p>

            . I travel round town for a silk shawl warehouse, in Maiden-lane. On the morning after this circumstance I called at Smith's, between ten and eleven o'clock, Gregory was there playing at bagatelle with the street-keeper. They and another person drank a pot of porter or half-and-half. I played one game with him myself for a glass of gin - all four had a glass each. Gregory was taken ill, and had a glass of brandy before - he certainly was in liquor; he said he had been robbed in the sheep-pens; that the person came to him and put his arms round his waist while he was sick; that the man ran a distance from him, but he overtook him - I had nothing particular to do, and accompanied him to Guildhall - nobody asked me - the Alderman requested him to come next day, that he might be more on his guard, and not quite so irritated. I told him if he would be advised by me, he would drop the subject - but I knew the officers had urged him on, and he has told me he would not have gone further if they had not urged him. I have seen the prisoner before, but never spoke to him.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Tenter-street. I saw Gregory at Guildhall on Thursday morning. The officer asked if he was inclined to proceed in the same kind of way as he had the day before. He shrugged up his shoulders, and said he should not - that he was so drunk the day before, he hardly knew what he was about, and must make the best of it - that he did not intend to proceed farther, and must put an end to it - that is the substance of what he said.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We wish you to give us the exact words - A. That is the substance - he said he must make an apology for the behaviour the day before. The officer told him to go to the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Cannot you tell us the name of the officer - A. No. I lodge with Smith. I am not in any business now - I merely mentioned being a linen-draper, as I was servant to Messrs. Kinder, of Cheapside, eighteen months ago, since which I have been arranging accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go to Guildhall - A. I heard the circumstance stated by Keeve, and from the description given of the violence of the prosecutor, and the respectability of the prisoner, I went from curiousity. The prisoner was a perfect stranger to me. Keeve mentioned about his respectability. It was talked of commonly in the house. I was a linen-draper on my own account for three years - that is five or six years ago.</p>

On the 2d of July, about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I went to the house. I got in by knocking the cook up. I went and found somebody had taken the wire pannel out of the dairy door; anybody could then get through; it was safe the day before; there were prints of feet in the garden; they had got a chair off the lawn, and got over the wall into the yard, which brought them to the dairy. I found some tallow-grease in the yard, close by the dairy door; it was not there the day before; a candle had been lighted there. I missed the shoe brushes, two pair of boots, and two pair of shoes from the knife-house, which stands by itself, and is enclosed in the same yard with the dwelling-house; the dairy is under the same roof as the dwelling-house, but you must come out into the yard to get into the house; they had only entered the dairy and knife-house. Three baskets of linen were taken out of the dairy; one of the baskets was set in the yard, but the linen gone.</p>

I fastened the house up; the cook and I were up last, and went to bed together - the last time I was in the dairy, was at dusk, the window was shut; when I got up in the morning, I found the wire pannel taken out, and missed three baskets of clothes. I have seen some of them since, part are my own and part my master's; there was grease outside the door, which was not there the day before; it appeared to be the droppings of a candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who had the management of the dairy - A. The cook; there is no casement, it is only the pannel of the door taken out, and secured by wire, to admit the air; it was secure the day before. It was dusk when the cook and I took the clothes into the dairy. I will not swear that she did not go there with a candle afterwards; it was dusk, between eight and nine o'clock; we went to bed between ten and eleven. I saw part of the linen at Worship-street, last Saturday week.</p>

I asked him if there was any property at his house belonging to Crisp, or that he had sent there; he said there was nothing but an old shirt. I searched his house, and found a handkerchief.</p>

There was a whole month's linen except the shirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are not several of the things you have sworn to, without any mark - A. Yes, I swore to them at the office. The officers found other things which I could not swear to; they have not been produced.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The wire-window was never taken out I suppose - A. No, it was fastened in with the beading; it is part of the door.</p>

            . I am married and live at Islington. I found two decanters and a jug in a chest of drawers, belonging to Mr. Street, who lives with his wife in my room. I have seen Bellenger at my house, but never shewed them to him; I asked him how they came there; he said, he brought them there for safety, fearing his children might break them; I never gave him leave to bring them; I had only known him for five or six weeks. I believe he has three or four children; he has no place to lock things up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not tell you he found them in a chaff room that was open to every body - A. He said he found them in the back way; his back way is open entirely; he said he left them, fearing his children should break them, that he might deliver them if there was an advertisement.</p>

On the 15th of July, about two o'clock in the morning, I was suddenly awoke by a knocking at my door - I got up, and by the light of the lamplighter's torch, I found my window shutter down, and the window broken, which I had fastened up myself the night before. I found my door was tied with a cord, got a person outside to undo it, and the lamplighter came in. I missed several copper and tin goods out of the window. I fastened the house up, and went into Boston-street, and at the end of that street there were several boys and girls lurking about some carts. I went to the end of Boston-place, and on looking round the corner, saw James and

I knew them before perfectly well - not hearing their conversation, I went into Boston-street, to get behind them, and when I came round the watchman came up - they had moved from where I saw them, and joined some girls and boys, and went in among some cottages; this was about half-past three o'clock in the morning. I then went home for a quarter of an hour - I returned again into Boston-street, and on looking round the corner, I saw Crawford and Charles Dixon place themselves against a white cottage, opposite Boston-street, and very soon after Phillips and

The parish labourers came to sweep the streets. I requested one of them (Pheney) to go to the opposite corner, and see what they were about; he very soon returned, beckoning to me. I went over, and found a basket containing copper and tin goods - I did not see the prisoners at that time; they were within ten yards of the spot where the basket was at the first conversation.

Yes; I saw it again at the office on the 16th of July; here are particular marks behind it - it is all stiff with beer, where he has been in the habit of carrying pots on his back.

I had locked the door when I went out - all the drawers were taken out, and every thing value able gone. I lost upwards of 300 l. of property.

            . I am a single woman. Mr. Spiller bought me this pelisse at Jones's shop for 30 s.; he keeps a public sale shop. I have often bought things there - it hung up in the shop. I went to him on the 25th of June, and asked him if it was stolen - he said, No, I need not be afraid of wearing it - this was after I had seen Mr. Giles. It had been turned, and that I turned it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You saw Mr. Giles on the 25th - A. Yes, I met him him in the Strand, and saw him after that at No. 4, Off-alley - it is difficult to speak to a thing after it is turned - all the work is taken out. I gave the full value of it. I wore it upwards of a month after Giles saw it. I bought it the end of April or beginning of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to meet Giles at this house - A. I met him in the Strand, and he told me immediately he got into the house, that the pelisse I had on was his; he gave me the name of Thomas, Cleveland-row, St. James's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. All that passed between you, was his claiming the pelisse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. GILES. These waistcoats are mine, and the pelisse my wife's. About five or six weeks after the robbery I met Bell in the Strand, wearing this pelisse; she is very much like Mrs. Giles's sister. Her two sisters had pelisses alike. I was going to speak to her, but found out my mistake; I merely went with her to find out where she bought it; I gave her a wrong address, not choosing her to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know the waistcoats - A. By the make; here is a mark of soapsuds which I frequently make in washing myself; there is a cut at the corner; my waistcoats are all made in this way. My servant absconded the morning after the robbery.</p>

I finished an octavo edition of Lingard's History of England in June last. Beeman collated it principally; to see that the sheets were placed correctly. In consequence of information, I examined my stock, but did not complete the examination, till the latter end of August, and found I was fifteen or twenty copies short; eight volumes to each copy. I was printing it for Mr. Mawman. Mr. Fellows was his foreman; I accompanied him to Cahuac's shop, Blackman-street, Borough, on the 5th of August; I went in alone; he was a stranger to me. I said to him,</p>
               <p>"Do you sell Lingard's History of England?" he answered</p>
               <p>"Yes;" I asked the price, saying I should want several, he said</p>
               <p>"He had them, and I could have them, and the price was 3 l. a copy." A gentleman was in the shop; I came out, joined Fellows, and we went in together. Fellows began to speak about an account due to Mr. Mawnan, and then said,</p>
               <p>"However, that is not what brought me here exactly, but something much more important. I understand you have been offering about Lingard's History of England, at a very reduced price, which seems the more extraordinary, as you were at Mr. Mawman's sale not a month ago, and refused to purchase any." Cahuac seemed very confused, and said</p>
               <p>"Oh, I never had but two, I have only got two." I said</p>
               <p>"How can that be, for just now you offered me several;" Fellows said</p>
               <p>"You know you have offered a respectable bookseller six within the last day or two, and therefore you had better mind what you are at." Fellows had a good deal of conversation with him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cahuac, you have at any rate been guilty of a great indiscretion, to say the least, in buying a book, so as to be able to sell at such a price already; pray who did you buy them of?" he said he bought them of a man. I asked what man, and where; he then said he bought them behind a counter. I asked what he gave, he said 2 l. 10 s. a copy, and paid the money down on the counter. I asked frequently of whom he bought them, he said he knew neither the name nor address, nor was he quite certain he should know the person, but thought he should; that the first circumstance which led him to purchase them, was a man calling representing himself to be a messenger from the Bench, stating that he came in behalf of a prisoner there; we asked him to take us to that man, as we were near the Bench; he said</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know that he is a messenger; only he said he was;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Really you give us no information, I am very sorry for your own sake, that you cannot give a better account," and left the shop</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have known Cahuac some years - A. I never heard his name before. Fellows told him, if it had not been for the auctioneer he would not have trusted him. I understand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100037"/>that to be the first time he attended the sale. It was on the 5th of August we went to him; at that time we were not certain that any copies were actually lost - he said he had the copies, but they were at the binder's, being boarded for him. We went again ten days after, and seized some sheets, as ours, but found no copy of Lingard's History of England, on his premises - he was committed to Horsemonger-lane. I printed 1015 or 1025 copies. I rely on the number from the nature of printing; when paper is given out by one hand, it is wetted by another - if there is any trickery, the whole office must be aware of it, if they print less; it depends on my servants whether they are stowed away properly. I hear that four hundred copies were sold at the sale; 3 l. was the lowest price, with a copy given in with twenty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. When Cahuac was informed you were robbed, did he not go about with you, and give every assistance he could to detect the person who robbed you - A. When he was apprehended, going along, he was terribly frightened, and offered to go to the gaol to point the man out if he could see him. Beeman was apprehended previously. We went to the gaol, but were not allowed to see the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He mentioned no name - A. No. Beeman was not a prisoner in the Bench. I have three or four warehousemen; they all have access to the warehouse. I may have a hundred men; they have no business in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it the duty of any other man to collate the work - A. Clapperton and him collated it; it is put by as soon as collated. On going to Cahuac a second time, we found part of the wrapper of a magazine - I told him it was impossible that could have come into his possession in a fair way; he said he had many such things. I could only deliver 998 copies of the work, some of which are not perfect. I assisted in taking stock - we were nearly a fortnight about it at intervals.</p>

            . I am principal assistant to Mr. Mawman, of Ludgate-hill; he is proprietor of Lingard's History of England; a new edition, in octavo, was printed this year, and a trade dinner given, at which the booksellers fix the price of books; there are sale prices, lowest sale prices, trade and publishing prices - the reduced sale price fixed at the dinner was 3 l. to those who took less than twenty-four copies, and those who took twenty-four had a bonus of one copy, that is the lowest price it could possibly be obtained at by any one. Cahuac was at the dinner, and heard this agreement; it was declared publicly by Mr. Mawman; being an article of importance he called the attention of the meeting particularly to it; those who did not buy at the dinner were to pay 3 l. 4 s., to be delivered in sheets only, not stitched. The trade price would be 3 l. 8 s., the selling price, in boards, is 4 l. 16 s.; to a general customer; it was stated at the dinner, that after that day nobody could have them under 3 l. 8 s. Mr. Bensley afterwards delivered 405 copies to Mr. Mawman, or his order. The trade dinner was on the 23d of April, and the work published on the 24th of June. It has never declined in price. Mr. Dowding, the bookseller, sent us some information, in consequence of which I examined Mr. Mawman's stock; there was no deficiency, in consequence of which I sent to Mr. Bensley, and went with him to Cahuac's shop; he went in first, came out, and I went in with him. I had a demand of about 20 l. on him, and after applying for it, I said I had an unpleasant business to mention; that I was informed he had copies of Lingard to sell much below the price. I was certain they must have been stolen, and that probably he would say from whom he had got them, and I should be obliged by his informing me. He hesitated for a moment, and then said he had bought two copies from a person in his own shop. I said I was sorry to find he was endeavouring to mislead me, for I could produce a person to whom he had within a day or two offered six copies. He then admitted that he had bought six, but had had no more. I urged him to tell me the name or address of the person of whom he bought them. He said he did not know his name or address; he went on to say that he had had various dealings with this same person during the three or four former months. I said I thought it strange he should buy quire books of a stranger. He said his dealings with the person commenced in consequence of an application from a messenger or turnkey of the King's Bench. I requested him to walk over there with me, and point out the person. He hesitated for a few seconds, and said he could not tell whether the man was or not what he stated himself to be. I said I thought it strange, as he declined purchasing a single copy at the sale, that he should venture on purchasing six of a stranger (six copies would be forty-eight volumes, five hundred pages to a volume). He said he thought the price asked by Mr. Mawman, 3 l. too much, and therefore did not purchase at the sale; that he gave 2 l. 5 s. a copy for these. Nothing further passed; we left the shop. I found three copies that day at Mr. Renshaw's, in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At the time he said the person who offered them was in the King's Bench, Beeman was not in custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The only copies you found were three of Redshaws? - A. Yes, Mr. Bensley had delivered four hundred and five; they, of course, had got into circulation. There had been no reduction in price.</p>

            . I am an officer. On 14th August, about eight o'clock, in consequence of information, I apprehended Beeman in Fleet-street; I asked him to feel in his pockets, as I apprehended he had something not his own. I asked him to feel in his fob, as that was the only pocket in which he did not feel. He said he had no fob. I put my fingers into his fob, and found something interrupted my getting them in. I asked him to undo his waistband. I found he had a fob, and said</p>
               <p>"You have a fob." He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, if I have, there is nothing in it." It was doubled up; I unfolded it, and took out of the fob two papers. He said they were two memorandums of his. I asked what memorandums; he said only two memorandums that he took some time ago - I asked how long ago; he said between two and three years. I took him back to his master's, and the same evening went with Pople to his lodging, No. 13, Thomas-street, Stamford-street, and found among other things, this paper (looking at it) on a rack on the mantle-shelf. He was taken to Guildhall next day, and then to Union Hall. I produced the three memorandums there, and on the 16th went to Cahuac's, and executed a search warrant there, but found no Lingard's History. I had been there nearly all day on the 15th, but he was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100038"/>at home. I observed two or three account books on his counter. He came home that evening, and next day they were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Beeman had an opportunity to send to his lodgings before you went - A. I went as quick as I could.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Fisher's-alley, Water-lane, Fleet-street, (looking at the paper found at Beeman's lodgings) this is my writing. On the 18th of July, I bought of Cahuac, at his shop, or agreed to buy, six copies of Linguard's History of England, octavo, at 2 l. 10 s. a copy, five copies only were delivered during my absence. I found them at my shop when I came home one day. My brother sent them to be boarded. On the 1st of August, I exchanged three copies with Mr. Renshaw, for Cumming's Digest - the other two copies were returned by Mr. Agg, the binder, as imperfect - in consequence of which, I went to Cahuac with a list of the imperfections; on the 2nd of August I left it with him; I told him I had made three perfect copies out of the five, and there was a list of the imperfections of the other two copies - he said he would see to it, and have them made perfect. Mr. Fellows called on me on the 5th of August, and after that Cahuac called at my shop on the subject of the sixth copy. I told him I was positive it never had been delivered - he said, he thought it had. I sent for Agg, who told him he only received five. After that I went to Cahuac, and told him Fellows had called on me, and asked me how I became possessed of the work, and I had told him I had them of him - he said that was right. I saw no more of him till the 14th or 15th of August, when he called, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will take those imperfect copies of Lingard out of your way;" and I accordingly delivered them to him in my shop, which is in the City.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Mr. Bensley - Beeman was under warehouseman. He and I collated this work. (looking at Agg's list of imperfections). I found this on the desk in my master's warehouse in July, and asked Beeman where it came from. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is just left." I said,</p>
               <p>"This won't do - this is a very pretty note, where is the return or waste sheets - it is usual to return spoiled sheets, and we send perfect ones for them." He made no reply that I recollect. Here is some writing at the back of the paper which I believe to be Beeman's; I have seen him write two or three times a day. I put the paper on a nail, kept for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are still in Mr. Bensley's service - A. Yes; nobody but me and him, and the three boys, have business in the warehouse - it is distinct from the printing-office.</p>
               <p>Q. If Beeman had the paper to make up deficiencies, could he not have kept it in his pocket, and made them up secretly - A. Yes, unless he was careless enough to leave it there. He did not object to my looking at it. I put it on the nail to answer whoever might call for it, that I should not give those sheets. I told Beeman it was a very irregular note - no application being made. I turned it over and said, I believed the writing on the back to be Beeman's; he might have moved it if he liked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you assist in taking stock - A. I counted the copies, and gave Mr. Bensley the account. I made as many perfect books as I could, and looked over the waste sheets and ascertained the deficiency - whole volumes, and parts of volumes, were deficient. I gave the paper out to be printed - we should have a considerable quantity more than we had.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you take stock so as to satisfy your mind of the deficiency - A. Yes, the work should run twelve or fourteen sets over one thousand, but it was under one thousand; nobody ever called for the deficiency with my knowledge. It is my place to look out the binders' imperfections. They leave the lists and call next day; there is</p>
               <p>"Mr. C" written on the paper. I cannot say whether it was there when I first saw it. I cannot form a judgment whose writing it is in. It struck me strange that any book should be delivered out so imperfect; there is in one case twelve sheets wanting together.</p>
               <p>This list was here read - it was an account of various sheets wanted to complete the work, and stated to have been bought of Mr Morgan, by Anderson, Piccadilly.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Piccadilly - there is no other of my name there. I bought none of Lingard in July or August, nor ever sent to Mawman's or Bensley's any demands for deficiencies. I never saw this paper till to-day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100039"/>Beeman - A. Perfectly well; he was frequently at my house with books, and for books formerly.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you have bought Lingard, what did you give for it -

            3 l. 12 s. in boards. I bought it at Whittakers'; the price in sheets was 3 l. 8 s.</p>
               <p>MR. HARMER. I am a solicitor. I was present when Beeman was examined at Union Hall, what he said was not written down. I am certain that the paper found at his lodging was produced. I asked if he chose to give any account of it; he said he had it from some of the binders; he could not tell the name.</p>
               <p>The papers produced were here read. That found at Beeman's lodging, written by Cooper, and delivered by him to Cahuac, was an account of imperfections and deficiencies; those found in Beeman's fob were two duplicate lists of various works, among which were eleven copies of Lingard's History of England, at 25 s. each; the prices annexed to all: the total amount was 18 l. 0 s. 6 d., and 9 l. 10 s. deducted us received.</p>
               <p>MR. BENSLEY. All the books mentioned in this list are printed by me. I never sold Beeman any of them, or allowed him to dispose of them.</p>

               <p>BEEMAN'S Defence. It was impossible for me to take a copy off the premises at any time, for I never went out of the office alone; as to the note found at my lodgings. I took it home on Saturday, instead of putting it on the nail; as to the note found in the desk, I shewed it to Clapperton, and said, I had told the boy who brought it, that it was impossible he could have the sheets; he said he came from Anderson's, Piccadilly; I wrote that on the back. I never saw Cahuac, till I saw him at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Cahauc put in a long written defence, stating that he never saw Beeman till he was in custody, but bought the copies in the fair way of trade, and if he had been allowed bail, he could have traced the man from the King's Bench, where he had originally been.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked where I slept, I said in St. Giles's. Two men were brought against me, who had a full view of the person who robbed Mr. Ledwick - neither could swear to me, but said it was a taller man. At my first and second examination, the prosecutor would not undertake to say I was the person; but at last swore to me, as he was instructed by the officers.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND. Two men were brought up, who are not here; he said he slept in St. Giles's, and was in St. Giles's at nine o'clock. Mr. Ledwick never doubted about him. I took one Pearson also; but the prosecutor could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>MR. LEDWICK. These two men were very loth to come, and gave me a false name. I swore to him at first, and had no doubt at all of him.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 20.</p>

On the 22d of August, the prisoner hired a gelding of me, to go to Bromley, in Kent, and was to return next morning by eleven o'clock; he took it away, and never brought it back.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you shew him more than one horse - A. No. There was no conversation about selling it if he liked it - he asked the price of a small mare; I said I did not want to sell her. He was to pay 15 s. for the hire of it, and said he should return by eleven o'clock. I had a letter from him on Sunday, saying the weather was so bad he could not bring his wife home, and he should be back that evening or Monday morning; I have lost the letter - it was dated Bromley, Kent. I received no further communication from him.</p>

            . I am foreman at Mr. Osborne's commission stables. On Friday, the 22d of August, the prisoner brought this gelding to be sold, and entered it in his own name. It was sold to Mr. Robinson, a coachmaster, for 12 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Robinson yourself - A. Yes; it was a very wet day when he brought it. He first called about five o'clock, to say he had a horse for sale, and wanted Mr. Osborne to advance 5 l. on account; that he had money to pay, and wished to sell the horse. I said I could not advance unless I saw the horse then, he fetched it - he said nothing of a man stopping him for money.</p>

I told him, I apprehended him for a robbery he had committed at Hounslow, and began to search him for a watch; he said voluntarily, that Curtis had got his watch and other things again; that two persons pursued him from Chertsey, and overlook him, and promised, if he gave up the property, he might go about his business. I asked if either of them was a constable, he said he believed so, and that they were employed by Curtis.</p>

I could not get in - I went to the window and found the sash half up; I got in and missed a band-box, which I had left in the window, it contained this property, except a gown and shift, which were taken from another box. I found a gown in pawn, in the middle of June last - we lost 5 l. worth of property. The prisoner told us, he was a messenger to the Mendicity Society, and used to visit us, and was at the house five days before the robbery, but never came after.</p>

               <p>"You shall give me some gin, or pay me for being here." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I shall not give you gin, nor yet pay you." She said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I will have some." One of the women held the door, while the prisoner and another woman took my money from my pocket by force; they took altogether twelve sovereigns and twelve shillings; one caught hold of me by the side and tore my pocket, and the prisoner took the money out of my side pocket. I was holding the door all the while, trying to get out, being alarmed; they let me out directly they robbed me. I noticed the house so as to know it again. I went before the Magistrate immediately it happened, and went to the house with an officer, but could not find her. I saw her in Whitechapel on the Thursday afternoon, and shewed her to the officer, who took her. I am positive she is the woman - I never saw her before; they tore my breeches on getting the money; they could not get it without.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What are you - A. I buy hay on my own account, and sell it again. I have worked for Mr. Owen, of Cheshunt, for five years. I went to this house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and was quite sober, and only had a pot of beer since breakfast. I was not there ten minutes, before I tried to get out; the passage door was shut, but it was not dark. I was robbed close by the door; the prisoner came to the door when I was trying to get out, the other two held the door till she came in; as I was pulling to get out, she put her hands into my breeches pocket and took the money. I charged nobody but her with it. When I saw her, she stood tossing up for oysters; I did not speak to her, but fetched the officer; there was light in the passage; one Sweden had paid me the money.</p>

            . I am a turner, and live in Motley-court, Chapel-street, Holywell Mount. I was directed to go to this house to see if it was a light passage. I went there in the middle of the day, and when the door was shut, it was so dark I could scarcely see my hand - it is a winding<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100042"/>stair-case, and there is no light. I could not know any person whatever out of the place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you know of this woman, how came you to go there - A. I was desired to go by her mother and father. I saw no window on the stair-case, I did not go on the stair-case - I could see no window any where as I stood - I found the door ajar I believe, and opened it, and was directed to take a view of it on behalf of the prisoner. I shut the door, and saw that it was so dark it was impossible to see a face - I saw nobody there. I recollect now that a woman came from above.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you there - A. The mother pointed out the house to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this young woman lives there - A. I cannot take on myself to swear.</p>

             re-examined. I went into the passage, but do not recollect whether there was a window in the side - there is an open slip where the people live - it is light enough with the door shut to see a person's face.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You would call it a dark passage - A. It would be totally dark, except for this slip which is near the street-door, and communicates with the room below, which has a regular side sash - if I met a person there, I should know him again, there may be a sliding shutter to this slip.</p>

On the 7th of August I left my chambers, to go into the country; and the day before I deposited in a cupboard under the window, a gold watch, with a gold seal fastened to it by a ring. I had deposited other property in a cupboard under the book-case some time before, but might not have seen it for three weeks before I left town - both cupboards were locked when I left town, and the key of that under the book-case was put in where the gold watch was. I took the key of that cupboard with me; I returned late on the evening of the 11th of August, and on the 13th or 14th, I missed the gold watch, seals, and key, and having heard of the prisoner's apprehension, I examined the other cupboard on the 16th, and missed several mourning rings and a gold musical seal. I do not recollect whether one of the rings had the name of Judd on it, as they came into my possession as executor; the watch was worth 7 l. I have known Cockerill several years, he is related to my clerk, and had leave to come to my chambers whenever he pleased. I have a private door which shuts my chambers in from any other, there is one common stair case.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Booth. He went out of town on a Thursday, and on Saturday, between seven and eight o'clock, Cockerill came to chambers, and said he wanted to write a note; he took a candle and went into master's room, where these cupboards are - I did not go in with him, he stayed there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and then left; he came again on Sunday, but was only in the office, and I was with him all the time; he came again on Monday; I asked him to wait in the office till I came to him, to shew me the way into the City; I went away to dress myself, returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he was gone; I had told him master was coming to town that evening; he could have gone into master's room if he liked.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Ship-yard, Temple-bar. Cockerill brought a desk and box to my house, and desired me to take care of them. This was about a fortnight before I carried them over Blackfriars-bridge. He came to them several times. Thomas generally came with him. Thomas once came alone, and unlocked the desk, and locked it again, but what he did with it I cannot say. The prisoner Moore has often come to my house with Cockerill. I believe she was there on the Sunday before I carried the things. I know she was there on the Friday or Saturday before. Moore brought me a note from Cockerill, which I have destroyed, and, in consequence of that note, I took the box and desk over Blackfriars-bridge. Moore, and another young woman, went with me. I delivered them to Cockerill at the foot of the bridge, and received 1 s. for my trouble. This was on a Tuesday, I believe.</p>

I went up, and he was given to me. I was taking him to the watch-house, and on looking at his feet, I saw he had a pair of my shoes on, and asked if he had any of his own - he said, Yes, he had left them under the foot of my bed; where I found them.

               <p>The prisoner in a long defence stated, that on returning from the Docks, he drank more wine than he should, it being a rainy day - and had tasted the wine he went to clear, which was very powerful; he found himself next morning at his lodgings, and missed most of his money - but recollected leaving it with Mr. Seal; there was still a deficiency which he could not make up, in consequence of which he did not return.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLS re-examined. When we clear goods at the docks it is uncertain what the charges are; I thought there might be some deposit to make in order to clear the wine, which was my reason for giving him so much; he did the business we sent him to do.</p>

               <p>"Here is my hat." When I heard the alarm nobody but him was in sight; he did not appear drunk; the prosecutor appeared confused, and said the blow had stunned him so he was insensible; he did not appear to me to be in liquor; he did not strike the prisoner.</p>

               <p>"Pray, Sir, will you have the kindness to tell me my nearest way to Sadler's Wells?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think you cannot go nearer than down Wood-street, and when you get to the bottom, turn up White or Redcross-street, that will take you to Old-street, then turn to the left, which will take you to Old-street-road, and you will be in a straight direction for Sadler's Wells." I walked on the pavement, and he continued in the road, where he was when he first spoke to me. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am a perfect stranger in London, and have only been here a few days; and am a carpenter, and have been at work in the Commercial-road, and, to tell you the truth, I am so exceedingly exhausted with the heat of the evening, and fatigue of my day's work, that I am ready to faint." I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think you are an Irishman, by your accent; I have met with great hospitality in that country; I am known to the landlord of this public-house (the Woolpack, in Hart-street) close by, if you think proper to go in I will give you a little refreshment;" we went in, and the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ackroyd, step into the parlour" - the tap-room is exactly at the entrance, and the door wide open; I said,</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I'll step in here for a few minutes, we are not going to stop long." I ordered a pint of beer, sipped it, and gave it him to drink; and when it was gone, I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you have any more?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am thankful for this." I got up and went out; he followed me, and as I left the door, he said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I think there is a person stands there, who is a very suspicious character." I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, it's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100047"/>nobody who knows any thing of you or me; it is somebody who is going to take some beer, I suppose." I walked on and he behind me, till we came to Cripplegate-buildings.</p>
               <p>"Now Sir," said he,</p>
               <p>"I am as much at a loss which way to go, as when I first met you." I pointed over to Lower Whitecross-street, and said,</p>
               <p>"Go right forward in that direction, and when you get to the top turn to the left, that is Old-street, and will lead you to Goswell-street-road." I had myself to go to Mr. Arnold's, a chymist, in Aldersgate-street, who I do business with; so my nearest way was to turn out of Whitecross-street, about a hundred yards, as far as the Grapes public-house, which I did, and then had to turn to the left; he was to go straight on; so I wished him good night, and he did the same, and left me ten or fifteen yards; then turned round quick and called after me, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh Sir, it strikes me at this moment, if you will tell me where Barbican is, I shall know where I am, and which way to go;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Barbican, is within a few yards of where I am going; he joined me following me behind, at a short distance, and on crossing Redcross-street, he got a few yards before me - and we proceeded thirty or forty yards up Paul's-alley, he being a few yards before me; and when I passed the corner of the court, I said, I thought it was later than I expected as Mr. Reeves's, the pawnbroker's shop was closed.</p>
               <p>"Now," said I</p>
               <p>"if you take the first turning to the right, it will take you into Barbican, and then you will know where you are;" the words had scarcely escaped my lips, when he turned round as quick as lightning, and struck me a dreadful blow in the eye; I never had a morsel of rest for six or seven nights, the pain was so excruciating; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes your blunt or your life immediately." I collared him, and said</p>
               <p>"You ungrateful scoundrel, sooner than I would give you a shilling, I would sacrifice my life on the spot;" I dragged him back towards Redcross-street; he cried out</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, for Christ's sake, let me go, leave me alone;" but I was determined to have him punished. I held him at arms length, and he displayed all the energy and power imaginable, striking me whenever he could, in all parts of my body; I got him to the end of the court, called out Watch, and called for assistance, and in the course of a few minutes, I was surrounded by a number of friends, who I knew; the watchman came up and did not know the cause of the tumult. I had fast hold of him, he wished to get loose; he struck my heels; I fell with my head on the stones, but I never quitted my hold; he kept calling out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake let me go, you will strangle me." The watchman then interfered, but seeing he was a feeble man, I kept hold of him; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I am in the hands of the watchman, let me go;" but I would not till we got him to the watch-house. I then gave charge of him, for demanding my blunt or my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you come from - A. Bradford, in Yorkshire. I have lived in town since 1811 or 1812. I rent a first floor, and am married - we were about half an hour together. I have mentioned all the conversation which passed. Paul's-alley, is one side of Hall's brewery; the other side is a dead wall. I have lodged where I do now, since Good-Friday. I lived in Jewin-street before that; I once sold some goods on commission for Mr. Brown, of Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; we parted because he could not supply goods. I took the benefit of the Insolvent Act in 1812 or 1813. I was never in prison but at that time. I did not owe 200 l.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Moor-lane. As I came down Red Cross-street, at a quarter to ten o'clock, I heard a cry of Watch; I crossed over to Paul's-alley, and at the end of the alley saw the prisoner and prosecutor scuffling. He gave charge of the prisoner. I took hold of him. He made no particular charge then, but said he had insulted him, or something to that purpose. He said nothing then to lead me to suppose he intended to rob him. We pulled him along, and in Red Cross-street he hustled with us, then turned round and tripped the prosecutor up. We all three fell together; I pulled him up, and the prosecutor kept hold of him by the neck. He said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go, d - n you, I am in the hands of the watchman." He turned himself about, and hit the prosecutor over the face. The prosecutor kept hold of him till he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you and the prosecutor had hold of him, did you hear from the prosecutor any charge against him of attempting to rob him - A. No; blunt means money; I did not hear him say that the prisoner demanded blunt; but, as we went along, he said, I suppose you wanted to diddle me if you could. I heard nothing about blunt, but what passed at the watch-house I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is it from where you took him, to the watch-house - A. About a hundred and fifty yards; we might be about five or ten minutes going there.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner and prosecutor were at the watch-house about five minutes before I came, as it was not ten o'clock. He gave charge of him for an assault, and said they were in Paul's-alley, near Reeves's door; that the prisoner walked before him, and turned round all of a sudden, and caught hold of the breast of his coat with both hands, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean to do; d - n you, have you got any blunt; d - n you, I will have your blunt." That he collared him, and said he should have none of his blunt; when a dreadful scuffle ensued, and both came down together, but he kept his hold. I took the charge down as an assault, and asked the prisoner. in the prosecutor's presence, why he had been guilty of this behaviour, and if he had struck the prosecutor. He said he had, and did not wish to deny it, and would strike him again, or any man who behaved indecently or unmanly to him. I asked what he had done.

               <p>JURY to ACKROYD. Q. When you came to the alley, you told him the first turning to the right would bring him to Barbican; how came you to send him up that dark alley - A. Because I was going into Aldersgate-street, and Jacob's-wells is a thoroughfare into Barbican.</p>
               <p>To TAYLOR. Q. Did the prosecutor hear the prisoner say he had taken indecent liberties with him - A. Yes; I cannot say whether he made any reply - his eye looked red, and in the morning it had turned black.</p>

I had locked the door; I opened it as usual, and found my bed-room door broken open; but no outer door was broken. Wellman was in custody - they must have had a false key. I am sure I had shut the door, and took the key - it is a spring lock, and fastens without turning the key. I found a box under the bed broken open, and property stolen - I found part of it the same night. I have seen Wellman, but never near the house. A sovereign, two dollars, and two half-crowns, were taken from the box - the drawers were open, but not broken. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth above 3 l.</p>

I cannot say whether it was the prisoners, but I saw a third man walking backwards and forwards before the door; I think he was stouter than either of the prisoners; we called Stop thief! the two men ran and then separated, the third man whistled and called, Dick, then walked towards the wharfs; a gentleman came out of the wharf-gate and spoke to him, and then he walked off.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to No. 16. Helmet-row, on Tuesday the 2d of September. Attfield occupies a garret there; I found some letters there directed to him. I found a time-piece stand, a looking-glass, and an old painting there; he was not at home - Day waited in the room below for him, till twelve o'clock at night, we then saw him. I asked how he came in possession of the looking-glass and things; he said, on the Thursday night before, (which would be the 28th of August,) about nine o'clock, he bought the stand and picture at a house kept by one Templar, a cobbler, and that one Hammond was with him, and bought the looking-glass at the same time. I asked who they were bought from; he said he did not know; he said he left his room to go to his place to buy the property. I asked what messenger came for him; he said a boy was sent for him. I took him into custody, and afterwards took Templar and a boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, ATTFIELD. Q. I told you I could describe the man, but did not know his name, except that he was called Jem? - A. he said something of that kind.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of September, I was working for Mr. Thomson, a plumber and glazier. I went down the Edgware-road about eleven o'clock. I had been settling with my master, and had 13 s. 6 d. or 14 s. in an old pocket, which I used as a purse. I had been to a public-house, but drank nothing but a pint of ale; and when I was near the Hop-pole public-house, the prisoners met me, went by, and passed me again, then turned back. and met me again; I am certain of their persons. One of them hit me a violent blow with his fist, and knocked me down; the other knelt on my stomach, and held my hands down. I could not call for assistance, for they stopped my mouth. Elgar turned my pocket inside out, and took all my money, which was half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. Elgar said,</p>
               <p>"Now let us take the fellow by his heels, and drag him down to the Cut, and chuck him in, for then he cannot come to appear against us." The other said,</p>
               <p>"No; let him alone, he has had enough of it." Elgar said,</p>
               <p>"If you offer to cry out, or offer to make the least resistance, you b - r, we will kill you;" and then said he would drag me down to the Cut. Bardon then said,</p>
               <p>"No; let him lay where he is, he has had enough of it, we have got his money, that is all we want." They then left me. I was not able to get up immediately, but did as soon as I was able, then went home, went to bed, got up early on Sunday morning on purpose to look for them. I went to and fro in the Edgware road, where I met the watchman. I went by the King's Arms public-house, and there saw them both sitting drinking. Nobody pointed them out. I only saw them at the window, which was open, as I passed. I knew them directly, and told the watchman those were the people. They did not see me looking at them, they were busy talking and drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, recollect that they are on trial for their lives - are you quite certain of them - A. I am perfectly well satisfied that they are the men. I have not recovered my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of night was this - A. About eleven o'clock, or rather later; there are watchman on the road. I told a watchman of it the same night, immediately I could see one. I swear that I was not in the least the worse for liquor. I never said I only lost 4 s. 6 d., or that the other man knocked me down. I had been drinking at the Union, public-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100050"/>Oxford-street. I told the watchman I could not think of the name of the public-house that night, but next morning I recollected it. I live in Wood's-mews, Grosvenor-square, and work for gentlemen's coachmen, in the stables - I had been working that day for a plumber, named Thompson, in Dorset-street, Baker-street, and had worked three days for him - he paid me 2 s. 6 d. a day; he paid me at his own house about seven o'clock. I had been doing nothing particular afterwards, except getting refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the Edgware-road - A. I was walking down there - it is not in my way home; it was rather a light night. I was taking a walk; I think it was moon-light, but cannot say. I did not know the prisoners before - I saw their faces by the light of the lamps; it was on the side of the road, and nearly under the lamp; it was an oil lamp, and a fine night. The watchman who I first told of it is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you go down the Edgware-road - A. Merely for a walk. I was a quarter of a mile from home when at the public-house - Edgware-road is not above a quarter of a mile out of the way. The watchman I spoke to overnight is the same I spoke to in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the Edgware-road, and was so on the night of the robbery - I think the moon went down about twelve o'clock - it had been shining that night; this robbery was not on my beat. I did not see the prosecutor till a quarter past five o'clock in the morning; nobody complained to me of being robbed before that. There is a watch-box adjoining the Hop-pole; he complained to me about being robbed in the morning; his face was all over blood, which was dry, as if it had happened some time before, and his clothes spotted with blood, from top to bottom - he said he came to watch for them, and afterwards came and said he saw them. I got Carpenter's assistance - we all three went and took the prisoners in the house. He charged them with the robbery in their presence - they said nothing in the public-house, but on the road to the watch-house, before we got to Tyburn-gate, they both denied the charge. I cannot say whether there is a lamp where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At eleven o'clock all the watchmen were on duty - A. Of course. I did not see the spot where he says he was robbed - he said it was near the Hop-pole.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been two persons scuffling and attacking another, and talking about murdering him, must it not be heard - A. He told me one clapped his hand over his mouth; he told me of their threatening to drag him to the Canal if he made any alarm. The road is very wide. One Brewer was the watchman of that beat, and is so still. I heard nothing from him of any robbery - no other watchman told me he had heard anything of it - he said he had lost his purse and money. I believe he mentioned 4 s. 6 d. at the watch-house, but it might be 14 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the watchmen go their rounds, or are they always in their boxes - A. They go round; Edgware-road may be three quarters of a mile out of the prosecutor's way home.</p>

            . I am a ground-digger, and live on Maida-hill. I was at the Devonshire Arms, Devonshire-street, last Saturday night, sitting on the left hand side of the tap-room going in, in a box or seat; I was sitting with Elgar, Bardon, and Whitaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else - A. I forget the young man's name (looking at the last witness), that is him. I went there nearly at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners go there before or after you - A. We went in together, and staid from ten o'clock till about ten minutes to twelve - the prisoners were not out of my sight during that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100051"/>COURT. Q. Where did you go afterwards - A. Home to bed. I looked at the clock coming out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the same room before with the person whose name you do not recollect - Yes, and have drank with him,</p>
               <p>Q. I mean, George - A. Yes, I only drank with him once before, which was some time that week, at the same house; we drank our beer out of the same pot, and George paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he treat you as a perfect stranger - A. I drank with him on account of a young man who was with him, and knew me - neither of the prisoners were there then. When we came out on Saturday, the prisoners crossed to the New-road, Baker-street; I left them and went home; we were a quarter of a mile from Edgware-road; I do not know the Hop-poles.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You drank with George once before in that week - A. Yes, several persons were drinking there at the same time; they were acquaintances of mine, and as I went into the house, one of them handed me the pot - George did not hand it.</p>

             re-examined. The robbery happened as near twenty minutes after eleven o'clock as I can recollect. I am sure it was before twelve. I did not speak to a watchman in the evening, only in the morning. I spoke to none at night. I was glad to be out of the way.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not say, that as soon as you could, you spoke to a watchman, and told the same watchman of it again in the morning - A. I was glad to be off; I enquired for one, but could see none.</p>

            . I was called to apprehend the prisoners at the public-house. Thorn's face was very bloody, he was cut over the eye very much, and his clothes were bloody - he charged the prisoners with the robbery. They made no reply, but went quietly away; but as they went down the road, they said they had not robbed the man, he was telling a very great falsity - they had not robbed him, or ill-treated him, and had not the money. They said they were at the Devonshire Arms, at eleven and at twelve o'clock, and could not be in the place he said; I did not ask where they had slept. The Hoppoles is full a mile from the Devonshire Arms.</p>

I missed hay several times, and on Sunday, the 26th of July, I got up in the night to watch, and a little before three o'clock in the morning the prisoner came. I was behind the stack, and saw him get on the stack which had been cut - he cut a truss up, and tied it up. I peeped out, and saw it tied up - and said,</p>
               <p>"You are the fellow I have long suspected," he said nothing - I called out as if somebody was near to assist me, and he ran away - he had cut more, but not tied it up - he came to work on Monday, and I gave charge of him.</p>

            . I live in Little Earl-street, Seven-dials. On the 1st of July, about half past one o'clock in the morning, I was at the Fox and Goose public-house, King-street, Seven-dials. I had been locked out the night before, and met Smith, who said he was locked out, and that he was going to walk the streets; we walked about for two or three hours, till we saw the King's Head public-house open in James-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was there, and asked us to drink with him, and we asked him to drink with us; there was a bustle in the house soon after; and I told Smith to take care of his watch, and as his fob was very large, I put it into my fob and bound it up in my apron; I left the King's Head about seven o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100052"/>the morning, it was then safe, and I was quite sober; the prisoner came out with us and went into the Fox and Goose with us; we sat down in the tap-room - Smith and I rested our heads on the table, and went to sleep; the prisoner then set in the opposite box to us; I am sure the watch was safe in my fob, for I bound my apron tight round it. I had not laid on the table long before Smith awoke me, and asked for his watch; I found my apron untied and the watch gone, and the prisoner was also gone - he was taken next morning, and I saw it taken from his watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had no watch of your own - A. No, we were in the streets from eleven till three o'clock; we had about two pots of beer between us, and were none the worse for liquor - my apron could not come undone of itself.</p>

            . I am a pearl worker. On the 1st of July, I was locked out, and met Pawley in the street about a quarter to twelve o'clock; we had been together that night, but separated to go home; I met him again, and we agreed to walk about as it was a fine night - we went into the King's Head; the prisoner was smoking his pipe there; he came up to me with a pot, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are locked out like myself, will you drink with me;" I did so, and passed the pot to Pawley; he afterwards drank with us - we were quite sober. We left the house about seven o'clock in the morning; I had given Pawley my watch to to take care of - he put it into his fob and bound his apron tight over it, it could not be seen. I said, I thought we could get in now - the prisoner asked which way we were going, and said he was going our way, and followed us without being invited - and at the end of King-street, he said if we would go into the Fox and Goose, he would treat us with whatever we liked - I sat down and went to sleep with my head on the table, being tired with walking about so long. I was awoke soon after by a young man - the prisoner was then gone - I awoke Pawley, and asked for my watch - his apron was loose about his heels, and the watch gone - I got an officer. I found the chain and one seal in pawn; a person afterwards brought me a seal which was attached to my watch.</p>

When I came down stairs the prisoner was in the tap-room, and the two witnesses asleep. The prisoner said they were his friends, and Pawley had property to the amount of twenty guineas - and I said, he should awake them - he said, he was afraid of Pawley's dog - after that, he went over the table on his hands and knees and struck Pawley, who was too sound to be awoke. I saw him put his hand under the apron which was rolled up, and put his hand into his pocket he then came over the table and went out. I awoke Smith immediately, and the watch was missed - nobody but the prisoner could have taken it; nobody else was in the tap-room.</p>

Harvey's pockets appeared bulky - I crossed over and told a person to assist me - then ran and took Harvey; Jones went on towards Edgware-road, and was taken in my presence soon after.

            . I live in Merlin's-rents, Shoe-lane. On the 29th of August, between five and six o'clock, I was sitting in the court nursing my child; Watson, who lodged in the court, was up in her room. A coach stopped at the end of the court. Smith ran up the court from the coach. Watson came down to him, and they both went together to the coach. I saw him take a bed out of the coach, and give it to her. She took it up stairs; then he took out a large parcel in a sack or sheet, and followed her up stairs. She lodged at No. 6. I saw Barber looking out of her window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was in the sack you do not know - A. No. I had seen Smith several times before, but never spoke to him. I understood that he lived with Watson. They were large bundles. He had top-boots on, which appeared soiled.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Merlin's-rents, on the second floor. On Friday evening, the 29th of August, I was at tea, and saw Smith come up the court. He appeared in a great hurry, and went up to Watson, who lived above me, and called her; she followed him down the court. and presently she came up with a bed, tied in a blanket, and he brought a large white parcel; he returned and fetched a sack, which had red letters on it. Watson's is the back room on the third floor. Smith frequently came to see her. I have seen him go out early and late of a morning, but did not see him come home at night. I saw him on the stairs-one evening, and saw him go out next morning.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WILDEN. I am a constable. On Friday, the 29th, in consequence of information I went to Merlin's-rents, and was on the watch from five o'clock till nine. I was on the other side of Shoe-lane, and saw Watson pass me with something in her apron. I asked what she had there; she said a gown of her's and her sister's, which she had had some time. I asked where she lived. She said in Shoe-lane. I took her into Merlin's-rents, and found a piece of gingham on her. The officers brought Smith down stairs. I sent him to the watch-house. We went into the room with Watson, and asked which room she lived in. She said she sometimes slept in that room, pointing to the back room, third floor; and there we found the bed, a bag with red letters on it, full of calico, and a piece of sheeting. She said the bed was hers. Smith said he knew nothing about them.</p>

On Sunday the 24th of August, I left home about seven o'clock in the morning, and dined with my father at Thames Ditton - the prisoner was in bed when I went out. I returned on Monday morning at ten o'clock, but did not go into the house till two o'clock. I then received information, and about four I called the prisoner into the counting-house, and told him he had been seen leaving my house with a box or drawer containing something, and asked what it was, and where he took it; he denied taking any thing out; he left the counting-house, and in consequence of what my clerk said, I called him in again, and said</p>
               <p>"I am informed you are rather flush of money to-day; I should be glad to know how you got it?" He said his mother gave it him. I said I would see her in the evening; he went into the shop, and in about five minutes I found he was gone. He returned in an hour and a half in a great perspiration. I asked where he had been - he said, into Shoe-lane to buy oil. I said, it could not be so, and sent for an officer; we examined his box and found several letters, but none of this property. I said I was positive he had taken something, and should give him in charge. He then cried and said, if I would let him remain till morning, he would tell me all about it; but I gave him in charge for stealing a number of panes of glass; and on Wednesday morning, the officer brought me this letter (producing it), which I know to be his writing. I have glass on my premises, and missed two boxes of window glass from a room on the floor he slept; we searched Elliott's premises by a warrant, but could recognise no glass; but I found a box there which I have every reason to believe is mine, but have no mark on it.</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Elliot, glazier Little Gray's Inn-lane. Dear Sir, I am sorry to have to write to you - but it is concerning some glass I sold to you last Sunday morning, which I am now confined about in Gilspur-street Compter, and if you will give me a call before one o'clock to-day, I shall be obliged, as we can settle about it.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Bride's. Mr. Arding sent for me on the 25th of August, to take the prisoner for stealing this glass. On going to the Compter, he said he took it and sold it to a poor man who he did not like to mention, as he had a large family. He afterwards said, it was Elliott, of Little Gray's-inn-lane. I went there next morning, and found Elliott lived near there. The letter was brought to me by the watchman, of Giltspur-street, from the Compter, to take to Elliott. I then went there with a warrant, and found the box.</p>

On the 15th of July, I placed myself in a room adjoining my parlour, looked through a hole in the wall - the prisoner was in the room waiting for me. I saw him go to a glass-case, and take out a prayer-book, two song-books, and another book - he put them into different pockets, and stood there till my wife came. I then went and got an officer, who searched him, and found them on him; also a case which I had missed some time.</p>

On the 10th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I had just left these things on a sideboard, the street-door was open; I went down to the kitchen to fetch some water, returned in two minutes, and saw the prisoner run out of the passage. I gave an alarm, and he was stopped before I lost sight of him, and saw him put the spoons and ladle on a step in the square, as he ran.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Are you sure you did not lose sight of him - A. I did not; there was no crowd to hinder my view of him.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old, and am servant to the prosecutors. On the 21st of August I was sweeping the pavement opposite the private door, and was crossing round to go into the shop, and met the prisoner Ward with the guitar, about a yard from the door; part of it was under his coat. I asked what business he had with it. He said something about a Mr. Jones; I took him back to the shop, and took it from him. I then knocked at the private door for assistance. He followed me, and was secured. I did not see Bowden.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say he went into the shop, and accidentally brushed against the guitar and threw it down, and was ready to give it up again - A. No; he said nothing but Mr. Jones. He might have said he brushed against it and knocked it down.</p>

            . I am a constable. About seven o'clock in the morning I was watching the two prisoners, in company together, at the corner of Moor-street, Seven Dials, and followed them into Bond-street. They went into ten or twenty shops. I saw Ward go into this shop. I turned round and missed Bowden. I turned round again, and found Ward in custody. Bowden was on the other side of the way at the time Ward entered the shop. Battle charged Ward with stealing the guitar; he said he was very sorry for it. I took Bowden next day, at the King's Arms, public-house, in Moor-street. He denied being with Ward. I knew him before.</p>

               <p>WARD'S Defence. I called in to ask for a piece of music. Nobody was in the shop. I knocked three or four times, and as I came out my coat struck against the guitar, and threw it down; I picked it up, and went to the boy to tell him. He accused me of stealing it. I asked to see his master, and told him how it happened, and in twenty minutes Yates came over, and asked for the property; he then took this guitar out of the window; it is not the one in question. I never saw Bowden.</p>
               <p>BATTLE re-examined. He said nothing of the kind to me. He could not brush against it. There was a frame to keep it in. His arm might brush it down, but his coat could not.</p>

Wyman took it into the yard; they did not see me; I was on Mr. Hunter's premises. The moment Osborne delivered the hay he drove on, without stopping to drink; the house was not open. Smith then gave Wyman a truss of hay from his team - he came out again, and Smith gave him a sack from under the cart, which contained about two bushels of something. I watched the teams away; then went home and wrote a letter to Mr. Byng, to inform him. I apprehended all three men by a warrant. Osborne and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100059"/>Wyman denied the charge. Wyman denied knowing the men at all.</p>

I wrote to Mr. Byng the same day - he lives fourteen miles off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not men often borrow hay on the road, and pay it when they come again - A. I cannot say; I watched the teams back in the afternoon; the horses fed out of the usual crate as others, and I saw them put their own hay into the crate for the horses.</p>

Osborne delivered a whole truss of hay from his cart to Wyman, who put it into a crate, which stood to receive it. Osborne drove on, and the next cart came up, driven by Smith; he left a truss of hay, and something else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a constable - A. No, Conway employed me to go with him. I was about six yards from the house; we watched for another opportunity to take them.</p>

Osborne left one truss with Wyman to make some money of it; he took it into the yard. Mr. Byng did not deal with him. I was taken up for what I did, and allowed to be a witness, and have come from prison now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Byng - A. Two years; my team was behind Osborne's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he did not borrow hay, and this was to repay him - A. No, I never borrowed any. Conway took me up, but I had no conversation with him. Osborne has been fourteen or fifteen years with Mr. Byng. When I saw my master, I told him the truth. I had thirty-eight trusses in the waggon, one for the horses, and one to leave with the hostler.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, the prisoner went out with my father in the evening; I am sure the trowsers were then in the parlour window; he came back alone in about five minutes, and said he knew of a place for me, and wanted pen and ink to write the direction, but I would not leave the room. I was looking out of the other window - he staid a short time and told me not to tell my father that he had been back, on any account; he went out with the tail of his coat wrapped round him - nobody but him had called - my little sister and I were alone in the house, and before my father returned, I missed the trowsers, and went to look for him, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had been in disgrace with your father - A. My father beat me, saying, I must have left the door open, or taken the book myself, and the prisoner said, it served me right.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Had not you some conversation with the prisoner about your son before this - A. I said he had left the door open, and been at play while the books were stolen. I sent for the prisoner next day, to say I had a place for him, and then secured him.</p>

On the 14th of August, about a quarter to one o'clock, I stopped the prisoner, going through the turnpike-gate at Battle-bridge, with this coach-glass under his coat; he said he was going to Kentish-town - I asked what he had got; he said, only a piece of paper, but I found the glass; he then offered me 5 s. to let him go, and said he would tell me where he got it. The other patrol asked him where he stole it; he said from Mr. Gower, of Old-street; part of Gower's premises are in Old-street; he was liberated from the watch-house next day, by mistake. I went to Gower's, and this glass fitted one of his landaus.</p>

The prisoner came there about a fortnight before this circumstance, to ask for work; he assisted us three nights in the business, and then my master sent him after a situation; he did not come again till Tuesday evening, the 9th of August, and as a favour wished Mr. Burnet to let him work with us till Saturday, to learn a little, that he might be better able to go into his situation. Mr. Burnet allowed him, and about half-past eleven o'clock that night, when I came to work, he was down in the bake-house - I said</p>
               <p>"How do you do, John?" he said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Sir." I asked why he did not return on the day he left; he said, he did not like to trouble my master. I proceeded to work - and after that offered him a sack apron to assist us in making the dough; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, happen to make it your self." I accordingly helped my fellow-servant Robins to make it, which took rather better than half an hour; and after I had washed my hands, I turned round to him, and said</p>
               <p>"John, I don't think you are very fond of work, and that won't do - for in London, bakers work very hard;" (it might then be about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock;) he said, he liked work very well. I said, I thought, by his refusing, he did not; and that is all that passed. I then jumped up on the board, took up half a pound of meat, which I had bought, and some bread and beer, which master allows us, and said "John, will you have some meat?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Ah, thank you." I accordingly made room for him to sit down by my side, which he did; I gave him about half my meat, he eat it and drank with me - Robins sat on the other board. After I had done, he removed from his place, and wished me to lay down, and said, he would mind time for me; I said, I did not particularly wish him to sit up, for I should be sure to awake - he said he was not tired, and would sit up; I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are fresh, as you have not been at work, and may sit up, if you are disposed, but I don't wish it." He asked at what time he should call me; I said, if he was awake, he might call me at half-past two o'clock. I laid down, covered a sack over me, and went to sleep - it was then about one o'clock - I slept till about twenty minutes past two o'clock, when I was awoke, by feeling some person cutting my throat - it was perfectly dark, for the candle was out; there was only me, him, and Robins in the place - I jumped off the board, and jumped against some person, who kept cutting at me, and just as I jumped off the board, I received a cut in the hand, and when I got my hand up to my throat, I felt the blood and the wound, and received a cut over my hand and finger. I called out Murder, and continued to struggle with him, as he continued to struggle with me. I felt that it was the prisoner, and could tell him by the feel of his body; he was stout, and I knew that it was not Robins, for he was calling for assistance. We struggled together for about five minutes - I was calling out all the time, and at last I threw him down, and fell uppermost upon him; I got up directly, and attempted to escape up the ladder into the shop - he was close behind me; I turned round on him, and felt a razor in his hand, and took it from him, and by so doing cut my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no talking all this time - A. I was calling out, but he never said a word; he was catching his breath very hard, as if out of wind. As soon as I got the razor out of his hand, I attempted to make my way up the ladder into the shop - I got one foot on the ladder; he tried to pull me down, and when he found he could not, he ran upon a level behind me. I threw up the trap with my hand and all this while was calling out, and just at that moment, he endeavoured to put his hand into the left side of my neck, where it was wounded, and by so doing to tear the wound wider; he never said a word. I was calling as loud as I could all the while, and when I got into the shop the watchmen were knocking at the door, hearing me cries. He still continued to tussle with me, till he saw my master on the stairs with a candle - he then ran down into the bake-house, but before my master came down, I could see by the light from the lamps in the street that it was him, and swear to him, as the shutters do not go to the top of the windows; he went down into the bake-house, and was brought into the shop by the watchman, a very few minutes after, from the back-yard - he could not have got there without going through the passage, and up the coal place. My master let the patrol and watchmen in. The patrol asked him how he came to do it; he said he did not do it - that he was reaching for the razor over my head to cut his nails (it was in the paste-board box,) and after he cut them, was putting it up again, and it fell down, and cut my throat. During the three days he was there before, he used to lay down, and sleep very sound without any covering whatever, on the bare boards of the bake-house - this was a fortnight before.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Burnet's service. On the 9th of September Wetton and I had slept in one bed-room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100062"/>till half-past eleven o'clock, then went into the bake-house, and saw the prisoner there; Wetton asked me to make the dough along with John, the prisoner - I declined making it with him, because I knew he could not make it so well as Wetton; so Wetton and I made it; we might be half an hour or twenty minutes about it. He then asked John to come and have a bit of supper with him; he said, Yes, and supped with him on the same board, and I had my supper on the other side of the bake-house, and after supper Wetton was going to lay down - I had to get some coals, and when I came back, I sat on the board, and took a pipe of tobacco; they were then still eating - some rats came from under the trough; Wetton threw a knife at them; then Wetton went to sleep. I did not hear the prisoner say anything to him. I went to sleep, and was awoke by Wetton crying Murder; I kept on saying,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with you, are you mad," thinking he had awoke out of a dream; but I found him and the prisoner skirmishing together - it was quite dark. Wetton went up the ladder, and the prisoner behind him, and I after him. Wetton said,</p>
               <p>"Murder, for God's sake come down Master, for I am murdered" - he said so frequently. I did not know that it was the prisoner, except from knowing that nobody else was there. My master came down in his shirt, with a light - I saw then that it was the prisoner who was struggling with Wetton. When the light came he went down into the bake-house, and I heard him crawling up the coals, next the bake-house, to get into the yard - two watchmen came in, and went with me into the bake-house, with a light - we could not see him; so we went into the yard, and there found him. One of the watchmen brought him in; he was charged with attempting to murder Wetton, and said he did not do it, that he had been paring his nails, and was putting the razor up again, and it fell out of his hand, on Wetton's neck. I saw Wetton covered with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you drank together - A. We had three pots of small beer, among us, not porter; a pot each.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it usual to keep the razor open - A. It has no handle; it was in a box, on the ledge, on the brickwork - it could not be seen by anybody; it had been left there by a servant who was gone. I did not hear the prisoner say a word. I was so frightened, I rendered no assistance - I did not know what to be about. I really do not know how I got off the board, or what I did or said, I was so alarmed. We have no handkerchiefs in where we lay down. Wetton was covered with a sack, but his neck was not covered; he had his shirt and drawers on. The razor was not exactly above his head; it was quite blunt.</p>

            . I am patrol of Castle Baynard Ward. I was alarmed by the cries of murder, and went to Mr. Burnet's house as quick as possible. Another watchman was at the door before me. I heard a scuffle in the shop, and heard Mr. Burnett's voice, and heard a voice saying,</p>
               <p>"He has cut my throat with a razor." I sent the watchman to one door, and told him to let no one out. I stood at the other, and knocked. Mr. Burnet opened it. I went into the shop, and saw the prosecutor all covered with blood. I could hardly see a bit of him but what was bloody. He was holding a cloth or handkerchief to his neck. I went into the bake-house, as they said the man was there, but he was not. I came into the shop, and the prisoner then stood there. They pointed him out as the man who had done it. He said nothing. I asked what induced him to commit so wicked or so rash a deed. He said he did not do it.</p>
               <p>"Why," said I,</p>
               <p>"there is nobody else to do it but you." He said,</p>
               <p>"I was paring my nails, and the razor fell on his neck." I asked how he came by the razor. He said he found it in a box on the shelf, over the board which they make the bread on, and it fell from his hand when he was cutting his nails, and he pointed to his fingers, to shew me that he had been cutting his nails, but I cannot say that they had been cut. I looked round, and saw the blade of a razor laying on the shop counter. Wetton said in his presence that it was the blade of the razor he cut him with, and that he forced it out of his hand. The prisoner said nothing that I recollect. I took it up, and kept it. (Producing it.) I took him to the watch-house, returned, and assisted Wetton to the hospital.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the prisoner's hands bloody - A. Yes; and his shirt; there was a great many marks of blood over his body. The razor was very bloody.</p>

             bad attempted to cut his throat, as he laid asleep on the boards. Hogan was then about two yards behind him. I took him by the shoulder, called him a villain, and asked his reason for so doing; I do not recollect that he made any answer. I pushed him down stairs into the bake-house - a lodger brought me down the key; I opened the door, and let Scanlan in, and sent him into the bake-house, telling him to take the prisoner to the Compter. I asked Wetton if there had been any altercation between them; he said none. The prisoner was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. HURLOCK. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend Wetton, on the 10th, between two and three o'clock in the morning, at the hospital, and found he had received a very extensive wound in the neck; the cut was of considerable extent; but very superficial, not deep at all; no material part had been divided. I observed no tearing or laceration - he had a small wound higher up the back of the neck, a small one on the shoulder, and others on the fingers; he had three or four wounds, none of which could be the result of an accidental fall of a razor; had the wound on the neck been of any depth, unless immediately stopped, it would have been attended with death; it occupied a full third of the neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the razor out of the box. cut my nails with it, and in throwing it up again, it fell on his neck - I made a leap off the board, and knocked out the candle with the side of my head; I made a grasp to catch hold of the razor again. He leaped off the board, and caught hold of me, and knocked me down; and when I caught hold of the razor, I let it go.</p>

On the 29th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the water-closet, and saw him standing on the cill, putting something on a beam; as soon as he was gone, I went and examined the beam, and found a dozen of tape, No. 145. I replaced it, and the same day went again - it was gone. On the Thursday, I found two dozen of bobbin there, which was mine. On the 1st of August, I found two dozen and fifteen of bobbin, which went in the evening. On the 5th, I found half a dozen of tape, and fetched Mr. Woolmer, who examined it - he placed an officer, at the door, and in the evening when the prisoner was going home, the tape was found on him - he said it was his first offence.</p>

Two years ago, I met the prisoner in Finsbury-square, about five o'clock in the afternoon - I had seen him before, in company with a gentleman; he asked me to go out on horseback with him; I consented, and he went home with me - my watch was on the table; he noticed it, and said one of the hands were broken, and he would get it mended, and return with it that evening; I entrusted him with it for that purpose, and did not see him again for twelve months after, when I met him in the City-road, on one of the Paddington-stages - I stopped the stage; he got down. I asked him for my watch; he said, that going from my house that evening, he was arrested, and put into the Bench, and had since that been to France, and brought me home a chain and seals to the watch, and if I would let him go home, he would return at seven o'clock that evening with them - we parted, and I did not see him again till three weeks ago, and then gave him into custody. My watch was produced at Worship-street; it is worth 10 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did he call with this gentleman - A. Frequently, for two years before; he might call alone.

I am certain he never gave me 2 l. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a young lady who see company - A. Yes, I am. He did not visit me as such, but his friend did. His friend has been abroad ever since.</p>

There was a mob, and I found the prosecutrix holding the prisoner, and accusing him of stealing her watch; he wanted to go to the watch-house. I took him to the Compter - he acknowledged receiving the watch; he said he took it from her house; but that he had seen her two or three times since, and had given her 2 l. for it - she denied that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he gave her 2 l. for it at the Theatre, and if she returned the 2 l., he would return the watch - A. That was before the Magistrate.</p>

On Sunday, the 30th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I heard a noise, and found my private door open, and the prisoner with one foot on the step. Another door must be opened to get at it. I asked what he wanted. He muttered something. He had something in his hand, which I thought was a great coat. I went into the parlour for a light, and in returning to the door, saw him running down the street. I ran round another way, and met him running into his own house, in George-street, with the blanket in his hand. I seized him, and he threw it down, and gave him in charge; returned, and missed the blanket. It was safe on Saturday night. The prisoner pretended to be very drunk, but ran very well.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 6th of July, at half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner Sullivan over in Smith's nursery, and Wheatley outside the pales. I was calling the hour, and I saw them just before I set out to call the hour; they were about a hundred yards from my box. I saw Sullivan hand over what appeared to me to be blue flowers, and as I came along calling the hour, Wheatley met me, and when about thirty yards from her, I saw her with flowers; before that, I saw her put these two pots down on the front of a gentleman's house. I came up to her and said,</p>
               <p>"Where have you been rambling to all night." She said,</p>
               <p>"I have not been rambling; I have been in bed with my husband." A brother watchman came up. I said she had no business there; and I went to Sullivan, who was still over in the nursery, and said,</p>
               <p>"What business have you here?" He said, he was ordered there. I asked, who by; he said, by his master, Mr. Potter, a bricklayer, of White Conduit-fields; he said Mr. Smith gave him orders to send a man to take care of the nursery, and his master sent him there; I collared him, and we took both to the watch-house, with the plants, which Mr. Smith claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who has had them since - A. Mr. Smith. I saw them in Wheatley's hands, and saw her set them down on the coping-stone. I did not see the plants in her hand till she came to the coping-stone.</p>

            . I am a watchman at the top of Barnsbury street. I was calling half-past three o'clock, and coming down John-street, opposite the nursery, I observed one of the pales had been pulled down. I crossed the road immediately, and saw the print of a foot in the soil, and outside the place were loose blue flowers, and on looking up the road, I saw Wheatley about fifty yards off. I went up to her, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" She said,</p>
               <p>"A few flowers." I said,</p>
               <p>"Then, you must come with me." Two men immediately came up; one said,</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with the poor woman - you have no charge against her, and have no business with her." I said,</p>
               <p>"I had a reason for what I was doing." One of them immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Come, I'll give you two shillings to let her go," and she offered me a shilling herself. I refused, and in going towards the watch-house, she said,</p>
               <p>"I am not well - don't go so fast;" and in turning in to Barnsbury-street, she said,</p>
               <p>"Let me take a pinch of snuff;" she put her hand into her pocket, but took no snuff out. The men came up again and laid hold of me, and wanted to take her by force, but I sprang my rattle and they set off. I took her to the watch-house. Sullivan was inside the place when I first took her, and Paddington was speaking to him. I did not see Paddington speak to Wheatley myself; we took them to the watch-house, and Mr. Smith claimed the plants.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her with a bunch of flowers in her hand? A. No, she had put the plants down before I came up - she was fifty yards from where I saw the flowers strewed about; the plants were kept in a house close to the paling.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I know these plants to be mine; I found the pales broken, and footsteps inside the garden, and a good many flowers gone.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN. The woman is innocent of the crime.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 16th of August, in consequence of suspicion, I watched him. I let him in at half past seven o'clock, and went up, as if to breakfast, but remained on the stair-case. I had placed half a hundred weight and a stool on the soap, so that it could not be taken without moving one of them and I put the soap knife in the drawer. In a very few minutes, I heard him move the stool and weight, open the drawer the knife was in, and heard him cut the soap, and throw the knife into the drawer; he then opened the cellar flap and ran down. I immediately informed my father; I had counted the soap on the previous night, and on going down to a bin, which had contained fifty two cakes, I missed two; nobody but him had been in the shop; my father engaged him in the shop, while I went into the cellar - I could not find the two cakes, but found the others concealed. I sent him into the Borough after dinner, and watched him - he went into Maid-lane, and remained there two hours. I went home before him, and when he returned, I asked where he had been so long; he said the customers had kept him - he went home at night, and I followed him, he lives in Aldersgate-street; he went in a direction for Smithfield, and near Bartholomew-close; he went down some alleys and I lost him. On Monday morning, I told him what I had seen; he said he had taken the soap away on Saturday night, and told me where he had put it to take it again on the Monday morning; and in consequence of what he said, I went with two officers to Barnett's house, Field-lane, he keeps an old shoe-shop, no other business was carried on there. Harrison and Botfield went with me, we found him at home, at half past twelve o'clock, and told him we had come to search the house for some soap; he said nothing; we found part of a cake of curd, and four squares of Windsor soap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100070"/>under some linen in a chest of drawers, in the back room. I directed the officers to look under a bed in the same room; he said it would not turn up, but they turned it up: he then said,</p>
               <p>"Under that bed is all the soap I have got;" we found a large chest under it, and one rather smaller which contained thirty one pounds and a half of soap, and the large chest appeared to have been full; it would have contained a hundred weight and a half; he was very much agitated and confused, and said he had taken it in exchange for goods, but did not say of whom or when; we took him before the Justice. When I took Day; I asked him how he got the property away on Saturday; he said he took it away in the dust kettle - and under Burnet's bed we found the very two identical cakes covered with cinders, they were cut in half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long was Day with you - A. Ten or fifteen months; he gave me no information that I was not in possession of before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you find Burnett's wife there - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he did not know that there was any thing there that did not belong to him - A. No, not in my hearing; there is a glass door, looking into the shop, it had a curtain to it. The two cakes of soap are worth 3 s. 6 d.</p>

I saw him in the front shop, and told him I had a warrant, he immediately walked into the back room with me - I said my warrant was to search for soap, he seemed alarmed, and said nothing. I found four squares of scented soap, and a cake of curd in the drawers. I proceeded to lift up the bed - he said nothing to me, his wife then said,</p>
               <p>"You will, find all I have got there." I found twenty-one cakes in a box, and another large box, which appeared to have had soap in it.</p>

I dressed, and came down into the counting-house, and found all the articles stated in the indictment moved from the places where they were the night previous. They were taken from the counting-house cupboard, and put on the desk, ready to be taken away. He brought the prisoner into the counting-house. I said the scales were gone.

               <p>"There they are, Sir." They were on a chair. I said</p>

There are no shutters to it, as it is enclosed in a yard. He said he got into the yard at half-past eight o'clock, and secreted himself by a waggon.</p>

I turned aside, and put my hand on a man's back behind the passage door, just outside the counting-house. I brought him out to look at him by the gas. It was the prisoner. I knocked up my father-in-law; took a light into the counting-house, and found these tools moved out of the cupboard. Four cupboards had been forced open. I found he had bored above the lock of the desk with a gimblet, and sawed it about three-fourths of an inch deep to get it open. He said he hid himself behind a waggon about eight o'clock at night among some straw, and after that got in at the window.</p>

On Saturday, the 15th of July, a piece of cloth laid on a pile, near where the prisoner was working, and on Monday I found it had been undone, and a yard and three-quarters cut, and rolled up in a different manner - it was torn across. I put it in the same situation, and desired the foreman to look at it every time he went up, and about two o'clock he gave me information; I found a hand round it, which I had not put on. I fetched an officer, who searched the prisoner, and found three-quarters of a yard concealed under her gown. I then measured the cloth, and found that quantity deficient - my servant girl found it on her. I compared it with my cloth, and found it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any interest in the business - A. None; he has no partner. The prisoner and her mother were occasionally employed by us; it is not the custom to pay women with remnants of cloth, nor are they perquisites. I may have given her mother a remnant of cloth, and may have given her a bit, perhaps, as broad as my hand. The cloth this was cut from, is delivered to the person who sent it to us. I have no mark on it - it is superfine cloth; the list corresponds. I have sold her cloth of various descriptions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say that anybody had given it her - A. No, my Lord; she begged for mercy.</p>

            . About three weeks ago, I saw the prisoner at Douglas's wharf, where I ply as a coal-porter; he brought a bundle with him, and came and asked me to go with him to the Cannon, public-house, in Hungerford-street. The bundle was a sack rolled up, and tied round with string. He said I was to draw two shillings of Hornsby, the landlord, for this bundle, and tell him they were to be delivered to

I kept the Cannon, public-house, in Hungerford-street, until the beginning of June last; I remember Burrows coming to my house, about a month or six weeks before that; a person was with him who did not come into the house, but stood at the door. Burrows brought what appeared to me a sack or two sacks, rolled up and tied with string. I was in the bar; he said he had got a parcel from Purfit, and was desired by Purfit to ask me to lend him (Burrows) two shillings to pay the man for bringing the parcel, and Purfit would pay me when he came in the evening to take the parcel. I took it, and lent him the two shillings.</p>

I kept the sack in my room, and used it as a rug - they took nothing out of my room in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you do with sacks - A. We use them in our business. I paid Hornsby nothing for it. I do not think it was so long as four months ago. I was taken up on suspicion of stealing it. It was a corn sack - it was not fit for the coal-trade.</p>

On or about the 1st of January, I was in Hammersmith church-yard, going home, and got into conversation with a woman, and walked with her. I had seen her before. The prisoner came up, and stopped me. I am sure of his person. I knew him well before, by seeing him in a boat. He was employed about the barges. He came up, and said something which I did not hear. I asked him if he meant to rob me of my watch. He said nothing to me, but got hold of it, and I got hold of it. We were both tussling for it together. He got it away, and 10 s. out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman - A. I do not know what became of her. We were walking together when he came up. They went off together, after robbing me. I did not know where she lived. I gave an alarm, but did not see him again till the 24th of July. I gave information as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not cry out, Stop thief! - A. There was nobody there. I met a person, and told him of it. They went towards the water-side, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many houses about - A. Yes; I told several people of it two or three minutes after; as Walker, who is here came up, who had met the prisoner, and accosted him by his name. That was in my presence. I told the man the prisoner had robbed me of my watch and money. He said he knew him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Hallet, is that you?" and he answered Yes; and the woman was close by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you immediately lay hold of him - A. No; they went off. I was four or five yards from them when the man spoke to him. I pursued as far as I could, and lost him. I had the woman taken up a few days after, and she was discharged. She lives somewhere in Hammersmith, but I do not know where. I was quite sober. I asked Walker where the prisoner lived, and understood it was on board a barge called the Good Intent. Walker did not run after them, but said he knew them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not the woman you met a common prostitute - A. I did not know it then. I did not go with her for that purpose. I met her as I was going to the church-yard, between the Broadway and the church. She came up to me. I did not tell her to leave. I never charged her with the robbery. nor ever preferred a bill against her. I had her taken up for being in company with him. A bill went before the Grand Jury, and was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, had not you the man taken up before Mr. Hanson, the Magistrate - A. Yes; I preferred the bill against the woman some time in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his Lordship she was taken up four or five days after - A. It was in April, not before. I rather think it was in April. I quit forget when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this man first taken up - A. On the 24th of July. He was never discharged. He was never taken up before by me or my directions. I knew he belonged to a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give information to the officer, and have him taken up - A. I did not; he was gone. I told the officer next morning that he belonged to the Good Intent. I knew that before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you Mr. Walker taken up on this charge - A. Yes; at the time the girl was taken. I cannot say exactly when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. COURT. You have been in company with Walker; have you not learned from him when he was taken up - A. It was in April Sessions. I cannot say when it was, or in what month; Walker went as a witness against the woman. I did not charge him with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know the man at the bar has been constantly in his employment, from January till he was apprehended, and be very cautious how you give your answer - A. The officers were after him every day. I do not know what he was about. I had been to the George, public-house, but was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, was not Walker locked up on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100075"/>this charge all night with the woman - A. I believe he was a little while.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you not say you asked the prisoner whether he was going to take your watch - A. Yes; he had hold of it then.</p>

On the 10th of June, about one o'clock, I was taking a bundle of linen to Mr. Roberts, Bells-buildings, Fleet-street, and in Gray's Inn-lane, near Mecklenburgh-square, the prisoner came up to me, and asked me to go to No. 3, Mecklenburgh-square, to ask for a trunk - I was to ask for Miss Wilson, who, he said, was his sister. I said I would, if he would mind the basket, and I went, leaving it in his care. I rang the bell, and found Miss Wilson lived there, but she knew nothing about the trunk; I returned in about minutes, and he was gone with the basket. I do not know what was in it - it has not been found. I saw him again on the 25th of June, at the bottom of Britannia-row, Islington. My father was with me, and I told him he was the man - he went for a constable, and was taken in the fields begging. When the constable came, he ran away, before I mentioned what he had done. I am quite certain of him - he was dressed the same as when he had the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you leave Pentonville - A. About twenty minutes past twelve o'clock. I got to Gray's Inn-lane nearly at one - he told the Justice he could prove he was elsewhere at twenty minutes past twelve. I always said it was near one o'clock when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner and your father any words a few days before - A. He had been talking to him the same day about ringing the bell; my father fetched me, and I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When he sent you on this message was he dressed as he is now - A. No; he had a black coat and waistcoat, and shabby boots with a piece cut out, and blue pantaloons, and was dressed the same when he was taken, and had the same boots on. I looked at the clock at the Rodney's Head, public-house, when I set off.</p>

            . I am in the coal trade, and work at No. 1, Field-street, Battle-bridge. On the 10th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was sitting at a public-house door; this boy came and enquired if I had seen any man with a basket of clothes. I told him no, and he went away across the fields. A few minutes after, I saw a man come from Wellington-street, with a basket of clothes on his head, and his hat in his hand; he had a black coat and waistcoat, blue trowsers, and shabby boots, with a hole cut in one of them - the boy having asked about a basket, made me notice him. The prisoner is the man. I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100076"/>him before the Magistrate on the 28th, and am certain of him. The boy came to me again, and I told him which way he was gone, and he went after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you drive a coal cart in the streets - A. Yes. I was eating my dinner at the door, it might be about half-past twelve o'clock. I did not look at the clock, the boy did not describe his dress to me. I know it is the same face. I described his dress to Jones before I saw him. I saw him coming down the street - I am near sighted, but the street is narrow.</p>

             to go round and meet him at the top of the lane, fearing I should not overtake him. I went towards him, and before I got half way up, he returned back into the fields. I let him pass me, and took particular notice of his dress and the boots he had on - he went forwards and returned four different times, and when he saw me making haste towards him with Jones, he ran away. I pursued and took him; Jones was always positive to his person; he had a blue coat, blue trowsers, spotted handkerchief, and boots - the right boot had a bit cut out - the boy had described the dress before I saw him - he denied the charge, and said he was begging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a bull-fight in the fields - A. I saw none - he gave different accounts of his lodging, and I could not find them out - he took his boots off at my desire, and I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing more of the charge than what I heard at the office. It is totally founded in fraud. I told the Magistrate I could prove where I was at the time of the robbery. The constable said I had a bad pair of boots on, and offered me a pair of shoes for them.</p>

On the 10th of June which was the day of the boat-race on the Thames, I saw the prisoner at the Black Horse, public-house, Old Boswell-court, where I lodge. I first saw him there at two minutes past twelve o'clock, and left him there twenty minutes after twelve, for I looked at the clock - several people were in the house. I believe he was dressed in black. Mrs. Deer keeps the house. I returned there at a quarter before two o'clock - he was in the house then, reading the newspaper.

            . My husband keeps the Black Horse, public house. On the 10th of June, the day of the rowing-match for Mr. Kean's prize, I saw the prisoner at our house between twelve and one o'clock - he staid till near three, when he went to the rowing-match. I saw Stevenson talking to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the house all the time till he went to the rowing-match - A. I think he was. I was in the tap-room most of the time - he could not be absent without my knowing it. I did not notice his dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your house full or empty - A. There were not a great many people there - he usually staid at our house an hour or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason for noticing how long he staid on this day - A. Yes; he was by my meat, which was roasting most of the time - he was not absent from twelve to one o'clock, because he was by my meat while it was roasting. I took the meat up about half-past one - he was talking to me nearly all the time - he was always dressed in black. I did not know him as beggar - he always paid his way - he was at our house every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no reason to notice him one day more than any other - A. I should not have noticed it, but my mother coming to town the evening before, brought the day to my mind. He said,</p>
               <p>"Who is that lady - I think I have seen her before?" I said, it was my mother, and then he shook hands with her. That was between twelve and one o'clock. I saw him every day till he was taken up. He generally came about that time; he seldom had above a pint or two of beer; he staid longer that day, on account of going to the rowing-match. I have no bar-maid; I always attend the tap-room, and my husband the bar. The prisoner paid me his reckoning that day (in the tap-room, I believe). The bar commands a view of the tap-room. He shook hands with my mother at the tap-room door. She has left town. I know she came on the 9th, because it was the day before the rowing-match. He never spoke to my mother before in my presence; she had just come in from walking. I always go into the tap-room at twelve o'clock. I looked at the clock; everybody when they are cooking looks at the clock. He did not leave from twelve to one o'clock, because I was there all the time. He was not absent long enough to go there; he never went out of the house. I have tried of course to bring this day to my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at first you had no recollection of it? - A. Not till I turned it over in my mind. Two or three particular circumstances brought it to my mind; one was, a man calling, with a saw, who went away at twenty minutes past twelve, for he looked at the clock, and said that was the time. I cannot say whether the prisoner had his dinner there that day; he might have had it while I was having mine.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From twelve to half-past one o'clock was he continually talking to you in the tap-room? - A. Yes. He lodged in Clare-market, with one Collison.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Clement's, and am also a porter; and live in Clement's-lane. On the 10th of June I went to the Black Horse, at a quarter to one o'clock, and might have staid there an hour, or an hour and a half: the prisoner was there all that time; he was not out of my sight above five minutes. I left him there at two o'clock, or a quarter past, and asked him to go with me to see the rowing-match, as I could procure him part of a boat; he said he would. I went home, got my wife ready, and called for him about three o'clock, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know him before? - A. I have known him nearly twelve months, by meeting him at the Black Horse. He was dressed in dark clothes; I believe a black coat and waistcoat, and blue trowsers. He sat on the same settle as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Close to the fire? - A. No, close to the window, about twenty paces from the fire. I believe he sat there all the time, but I was not in conversation with him all the time. A joint of meat was cooking at the fire. I was engaged, and did not notice what Deer was about. I did not see the prisoner near the fire; he was three or four feet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100077"/>further from the landlady than I was; he sat in the window, and I outside. He could not be near her while she basted the meat. I do not think that he dined there. The landlord was in and out, serving beer. I dare say he saw the prisoner. There are two servants who served beer. I am sure of that. I did not notice anybody talking to Mrs. Deer, I cannot positively swear whether he shifted his seat or not. He need not have passed me to go out. I did not observe him near Mrs. Deer while she was cooking. He lived in Holles-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. As you sat in the tap-room could you be seen from the bar. - A. I understand the prisoner is a tailor. Mrs. Deer's mother came to town the night before. I saw her at the bar. The prisoner did not speak to her in my hearing.</p>

This money was in the till. My master used to go into the country, and the other servant and I had the care of the till. On the 30th of July, about seven o'clock in the morning, I got up - the prisoner was always up before me. I asked my fellow-servant for the key of the shop, but he came down. I opened the door with the key, and then I opened the street-door, and in consequence of what he said, I slept in the shop the next night, and concealed myself behind some curtains all night; and in the morning, before the shop was opened, I saw the prisoner come with a strange key, and unlock the shop door - she then ran to the till, opened it, and put her hand in; I heard silver rattle. I had counted the money in the till overnight; it was 21 s. in shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns. She went away, into an adjoining room, and locked the shop door after her. I then saw her put the money in a piece of paper or rag; she then went away. I jumped down from where I was, unlocked the inner shop door, and opened the shop, and directly the other man came down, I told him, but never told her of it myself. He went off to my master's uncle, who lives at Vauxhall. She was taken up as soon as the young man returned from Vauxhall; and charged with this, in my presence, about half-past eleven o'clock, that night. I never mentioned what I knew, until I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stop her when you saw her commit this offence - A. I did not; I was always on good terms with her. I counted the money the moment my fellow shopman came down - there was only 15 s. 6 d. left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure it was not a man who took the money - A. Yes, positive. My fellow-shopman ordered me not to detain her. I did not go up and tell my master of it, because I was ordered not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever tell your master that you suspected the till was robbed - A. My master was often missing money. The shopman ordered me not to tell my master. He set off to tell my master's uncle, as we thought the uncle knew better how to act - we marked the money with a cross.</p>

Every letter on which the postage was paid, he should write on it paid, and the sum he received, and send it up in his paid bag, and he would be charged for it on the following morning; this is the regular course of business - He had been in the office, since March 1818. The receiving of letters is distributed into walks - his was Wardour-street walk (looking at a letter.) It would be his duty to send this letter up in his paid bag, if the postage was paid - it is directed</p>

            . I am a messenger of the Parochial office, and live in Poland-street. On the 8th of January I wrote a letter, and on the Saturday following the postman came to receive his weekly pay for letters. I delivered the letter to the prisoner - it was the one produced; I paid him 2 s. for the postage, and received some halfpence in change. I met him in Poland-street, some months after, and told him I had received no answer to my letter; he said, he could not be answerable for packets. I expected the letter to reach my son before he got to Calcutta, as he had just left the river. I am sure I paid him a shilling.</p>

            . I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers. On the 23d of May, in consequence of information I called on the prisoner, and was induced to search his drawer. I found this letter in it, together with others (looking at some) these are some of them. There were fifty-six in all, most of them were deliverable in the prisoner's district; six of them were letters on which he must have received the postage; fifty were letters in which the postage had been paid in the country, but were not delivered. Foreign letters are all post-paid in this country. There were six foreign letters, the postage of which he ought to have received and accounted to the office for; the one in question was among them. If he could not discover the persons to whom the fifty were directed, he ought to have returned them to the Returned Letter Office, after having kept them a month to make enquiry. Some of them are many months old.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it part of his duty to receive foreign letters - A. Yes, he is bellman; the letter has no post mark on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of July I met the prisoner in Fleet-market, just above Peterborough-court; I crossed over, watched him, and saw him go into the court: he stopped, came out again, and turned into Shoe-lane, and went about one hundred yards. I asked what he had got; he said, his coat, which he had on his arm. I found he had this under it. I took him back to the court, and found the prosecutor soon after, who claimed it.</p>

I was at Mr. Bond's house, on one Sunday, about five weeks ago, and saw the prisoner and a youth named Godfrey there. Mr. Bond was out; we broke a board of the cellar down, and got two bottles of wine out, drank it, and threw the bottles away; some wine was found at my master's; the prisoner's brother brought that to me - he afterward brought me a gun and gunlock. I took the lock back to him at Mr. Bond's house, as he said he wished to have the name taken out - he brought all the things which were found at my master's.</p>

She said she was unconscious of it, and pleaded intoxication; she was a little so, but knew what she was about.</p>

            . I am a constable, I went with Handley and the prosecutor, and found the hog, with an ass, in the prisoner's stable, in Duck-lane. The door was padlocked - I forced it open. We went to his lodging, and asked where his stable was; he hesitated, but his wife told us in his hearing. I told him to get up; he went with us to the yard - I went to the first stable, and took out the hasp - he said that was his stable. I found the hog in the next stable, which had his name chalked on the door. He said he knew nothing of anything in that stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you found the pig, he was not there - A. No; we took him there afterwards. He told the Magistrate it had strayed, and he put it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw this pig on the dunghill. I used to keep my two donkeys separate - I put one into my brother-in-law's stable, and this pig followed it in; being tired, I shut it in, and came out next day to find the owner.</p>

            . I am a constable; I apprehended Bray; Austin was brought to the office by his brother. I took Bray in Conway-court, close by Mary-le-bone Office; I told him it was for stealing things of Mrs. Maxwell; he made no answer. I found a pair of stockings on his feet, which Mrs. Maxwell claimed. I examined the premises; the persons had got down the grating into the area and into the wash-house, by breaking a square of glass, and sliding the window back; the poker was bent, and part of the pannel broken out of the door, so that he could get into the kitchen. Bray directed me next morning to Thompson's, where I found the rag. I found a table-cloth, two napkins, and a tea-spoon, at Austin's mother's.</p>
               <p>MRS. MAXWELL. The property is mine. The rags are a table-cloth which we had used the day before; it was too good to tear up.</p>

On the 7th of August, about noon, these boots lay on the shop-board; I was in the back parlour, and heard somebody come in; I looked, but could see nobody. In about five minutes, I heard somebody come in again, and saw Smith taking the boots and go out with them; I ran out, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - I overtook him in Hanover-square; he had not got them then. I am certain of his person, I charged him with it; he said, he was going to meet a gentleman at Charing-cross, and was going by our shop at the time I ran out. Hunter was brought to the office the same day with the boots.</p>

            . I am an artificial flower-maker, and live in Blenheim-street. I was at the first floor window, opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw a young man in a striped waistcoat, whom I believe to be Smith, come round the corner into Woodstock-street alone; he stood close by Skinner's door; he then came from the door and went down Blenheim-street, and spoke to Hunter. I am sure of him; he then went back, and I saw him go into Skinner's shop and come out without anything; he went down Blenheim-street, I did not see him speak to Hunter again; he returned and went into the shop again, and brought out a pair of boots; the shopman ran out, calling Stop thief! I saw him throw the boots under the shop window. I saw him again in half an hour, and will not positively swear to him; he had a striped waistcoat on when he was taken. I picked up the boots, and took them into the shop; then went into the square, and found him then in custody. I am sure Hunter is the man who Smith spoke to - I saw him at Marlborough-street, pointed him out, and he was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Foundling. On the 27th of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners together in Guildford-street. I watched them for half an hour, and then lost sight of Dyer, and in half an hour afterwards I lost sight of Long. I remained on the spot until about six o'clock, and saw them in company again; I still watched them, and stopped them on suspicion. Upon searching them, I found two books and a handkerchief on Long. The place where I stopped him was half a mile from the prosecutor's. A parcel of duplicates were found on Dyer, and also the handkerchiefs and books found on Long. Dyer said at first, the property belonged to him, and afterwards that it belonged to his brother. Long said Dyer gave him the books to carry for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Long deny giving Dyer the books - A. No; he said he lent them to him to read, and the handkerchief also.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at St. James's poor-house. On the 14th of June, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was at the Duke of Wellington, public-house, Princes-street, and had these things in a bundle; I was enquiring for a lodging; the prisoner came in; I knew her before. She said she would give me a lodging, and took the bundle from me, saying, she would carry it for me; we walked together a little way. I went to leave a basket at a house, and when I came out she was gone - I have found nothing. I met her seven weeks after, and charged her with it, she said she had none of my things, and used bad language - she went into a wine-vaults, at the corner of Crown-street, and by going out at another door, escaped me.</p>

I asked the prisoner if she had paid him; he said, No. I discharged him on the 24th of August, 1822. I saw Langhorn next week. He was apprehended in July last, and has never accounted to me for money received of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was very active in getting you customers - A. Yes; he had 8 s. a week. I advanced his wages (as he got customers) to 1 l. I never asked him to make up money which they did not pay. He gave me the money as being paid by the customers. There was a dispute between him and my brother, in consequence of which he left. I never offered to give up the prosecution for money. I do not think I ever said, if his friends paid me I would give it up. I told his father I would not hurt him if he would give security for the money he had received. He would not do that unless I received him into my service again, and stopped it out of his wages.</p>

I must have given him a shilling. The week after the prisoner left the prosecutrixes service, a bill was sent me amounting to 2 l. 9 s. I had paid it all but 4 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not you have given him a half-crown, a sixpence, and halfpence - A. I gave him no halfpence. I remember paying him.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of July, at a baker's shop in the Borough-road. I told him I took him for embezzling 30 l. from the prosecutrix. He confessed his guilt, and afterwards asked how much she charged him with. He then said it was between 20 and 30 l., for he kept a book, but it was not so much as 30 l.</p>

I became indebted to her in consequence of giving credit, and intended to pay her all. An account of it was made out. I had words with her brother, and left. She offered to take it by instalments.</p>

            . I am patrol of Drury-lane. I saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning, with another, in Great Queen-street - one of them had a bundle. As soon as they saw me, they turned into Queen-street, and from there into Great Wild-street. Before that, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100086"/>were coming toward me - I ran round to meet them; they set off as hard as they could; I followed them through several courts, sprung my rattle, and took the prisoner with the coat on his back - he said he found it; he pulled it off, and threw it down. As we went along to the watch-house, he offered me the coat if I would let him go. I made enquiry, and found Thompson, who claimed it.</p>

            . On the 11th of July, I was in Sun-street, and saw the prisoners go by me about twelve o'clock, towards Bishopsgate-street. I followed them in company for three quarters of a mile, they separated at Adams's shop; Stevens went in, and Knight waited at the corner, about twenty yards off, and when Stevens came out, I went in, and from what I heard I watched them - they went together to Morgan's milk shop. I saw Knight hand her something; he stood in a corner about forty yards off, while she went in, bought some eggs and got change - then they joined company, and went away together. I went into the shop and received a sixpence, which they marked before they delivered it. They then went to Bullock's shop, near Little Britain; Knight stood at the corner, while she went in and came out with a sheet of writing paper - I went in, Miss Bullock marked a sixpence and gave it to me. Reardon was with me, we took them into custody. I asked Knight what he had in his hand, he said nothing; I forced it open, and found a bad sixpence; I found ninepence in halfpence, and some potatoes in his hat, and some in his coat, and two or three good shillings about him. I found the eggs and paper in Stevens's hand, but no halfpence; she had no bonnet or shawl on. I produce the three sixpences.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Morgan, cow-keeper, to Fore-street. I saw the female prisoner on Friday, the 11th of July; she came for two eggs, which came to twopence. She said, she had only three halfpence, and I must change a sixpence, which I received from her; I took it up to my mistress, who gave me fourpence, which I gave her. I saw her deliver the same sixpence to Colton, it was marked.</p>

On the 11th of July, a woman came into the shop; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner; she asked for a sheet of black edged letter paper, which I gave her; she gave me a sixpence, I gave her fivepence change. Colton came in directly after, I gave him the sixpence; he marked it before I parted with it; this is it (looking at it.)</p>

On Monday, the 18th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was called up, and found the prisoner in custody in the passage, and two gold watch-keys gone from the window. The shutter was loose, the pin stolen, the glass broken, and part of the shutter cut away, so as to enable a person to put a wire in. The prisoner was the last boy in the shop on Saturday night; this was Monday.</p>

The prisoners lodged in our second floor, back room; they took it together, furnished, on Saturday, the 3d of August. On Sunday, Bowers went out with a dish; I asked what was in it - she said only a table cloth, and went out saying she was going to her aunt's to dinner. Wilson had left the day before; neither of them returned. I missed these things, which were let with the lodging.</p>

She shut the door in my face, and said she had none. I asked her repeatedly for it - she would not open the door. I said if she did not, I would fetch a constable. While I went, she left. I found the door open, and these things missing.</p>

On the 25th of August, I saw the prisoner pass the end of Montague-street into Wentworth-street, with a bundle under his right arm; I followed him, and when I came up with him, he was in the hands of an officer; I first saw him about two hundred yards from Whitechapel church. Almond said, he had dropped a bundle, and I found it about thirty yards from where it was taken.</p>

            , On the 25th of July, about ten o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Wentworth-street; he dropped the bundle when he saw me, and ran off; he fell, and I took him. The prosecutrix claimed it.</p>

I did not see him take the boots; my son said they were stolen. I saw the prisoner with something bulky in his apron; I went over to Ward's, and saw them crossing the road, and took hold of one of the others - the prisoner then ran up a little passage, and came out without the bulk - I went to him and asked what he had done with the shoes - I found them in the passage, behind the door, where he went up.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 13th of June, I saw Boards and Godfrey, between four and five o'clock; I was a long time with them, and went to Mr. Honeyburn's, in Coneyhatch-lane - Boards pulled a spar away from the shed and got in, and handed out these tools to us - we hid them in Mr. Robinson's hedge, about two fields off. I went there with the constable about a fortnight afterwards, I shewed them the place and they found the beetle.</p>

               <p>"Have you planted them?" He said, No; it was wet that night, and he could not. Jordan told him to plant them near the road, so as to get them handy.

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 10th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the top of King-street, Tower-hill, with a basket of skins. I asked where he bought them from. He said from Mr. Slee, of Bermondsey. I asked where he was going to take them. He said at Mr. Connel's, near Shadwell. I asked if he had a note, or bill. He said, No; that Mr. Connel was just gone on, and he supposed he had got it. I said I should go with him to Connell's. He went, and shewed me the house. I went in and asked Connell, a shoe-maker, if he knew the prisoner, or any thing about the skins. He said, No; but a woman came in, and asked what was the matter. I asked if she knew anything of it. She said, Yes. Connell said he knew nothing of them; and then she said so too. He looked at Connell, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know I was to bring them here." I went over to the prosecutor's, leaving him in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I kept the prisoner in custody. I asked him how long Connell had been at his master's to buy the skins. He said about two hours. He said Mr. Slee was to allow him overtime for carrying them. I told him it was wrong; and asked him who sent him with them. He said the clerk sent him with them, but he did not know his name. They were quite wet, as if just out of the pit.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Giles's. On the 29th of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Castle-street, opposite my own door - I immediately looked out, and saw the prisoner running with a handkerchief in his hand; he ran about thirty yards, then threw it down, and the little girl ran to pick it up. I saw the prisoner stopped, and only lost sight of him as he turned the corner - he was the only person running. I brought him back to where the girl had picked the handkerchief up. She said in his presence that she had it loose round her neck, with her hand on it, and he took it off - he said he picked it up.</p>

I missed wool in July, and put some on a hurdle on Wednesday morning, the 16th, between ten and eleven o'clock, and missed it on the 17th about six in the morning - there was a fleece among it with particular marks on it - that was gone; and in consequence of information I went to Chaplin's house; he shewed me some wool, which was part of what I had laid on the hurdle; the loft was locked up; and I found somebody had pushed the board-up to get to it.</p>

My mistress told her it was 6 d.; she went away, and we missed the duck off the board. I overtook her, and asked if she had got it - she said, No. I felt it between two cloths in her apron. I followed her, and she threw it at me and it went into a ditch. I picked it up, and followed her to Globe-row, where she was taken.</p>

I had one of them three weeks, and knew them well; they were carriers - I kept them in my garret - I missed them about six o'clock in the morning, of the 21st of July; they were safe the night before - they were loose in the garret. I found the tiles broken sufficient for a hand to be put in and undo the trap-door. I found one the same day at Baxter's, and the other next morning at Turner's, and knew them well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. I am told there is a practice of trapping pigeons in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; I do not keep a trap - they call me the cat-killer. My pidgeons could not get out - the prisoner is a tradesman's son in the neighbourhood - he does not keep pidgeons.</p>

He said it was allowed him by his master for the horses, and he was going to leave it there till he returned, as he generally fed there, and he brought the potatoes for the hostler, as he had done him several favours. That the sack was his own. I asked if his master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100097"/>had any waggon on the road.

On the 6th of August, I went to the prisoner's house with a search warrant - I found a towel in the back parlour, a phosphorous box, and a bunch of keys, and the other things on the first floor - there were no lodgers in the house. I waited till he came in, and told him he was suspected of stealing these things; he was much agitated, and wished to put away a pocket book which he had. He afterwards said, he was in great trouble, and sorry for what he had done.</p>

On the night of this fire, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was on duty in George-street with Riley, and the prisoner crossed the street, coming down Stacey-street, in a direction from the fire. I stopped him, and asked what he had under his coat. He said he had nothing there. I put my hand to his side, and found this pocket-book full of papers. He said it was his own, and contained a few letters from his friends. I asked what they were about. He said he did not choose to tell. I found nothing else upon him. The direction on the letters led me to the prosecutor.</p>

I took him to Marlborough-street.

            . I play the bagpipes. On the 28th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at <placeName id="t18230910-267-crimeloc1430">Kennedy's public-house, in St. James's-street</placeName>

I tied my bagpipes up in a bag, and put them on the table, and went into the yard for a minute or two, and on returning they were gone. I had left the prisoner in the room. She was also gone; I gave an alarm, and have never found them. She came into the house half an hour after; I asked her for them, she said she did not take them. I did not detain her - but she was apprehended afterwards.</p>

            . I was at the public-house, and saw the prosecutor there. There was a green parcel on the table; I did not know what it was; I saw the prisoner take it off the table and go out; but whether she took it out, I do not know; I mentioned it five or six days after. When I found Flannagan had lost his pipes, I told the landlady of it the same night; I was never taken up for it. I never saw her before.</p>

I made him unbutton his trowsers, and found he had a large pair of pantaloons under them, with a bag sown where the pockets should be, and there I found 14 ozs. of tea. The bag would not be felt in rubbing down. He had 16 s. 6 d. a week, and works from eight to two o'clock only. I have lost the bag.</p>

On the 2d of September, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners passed my window; Abbott had a box, and M'Nair was behind him, in his company.

On the 10th of September, my shopman came to inform me that a watch was stolen - I examined, and missed a customer's watch off my shop board. I gave information the afternoon after it was stolen. Hanisel was brought to my house, about two o'clock - I immediately went in pursuit of Levy; I met him in East Smithfield, collared him, and told him there was a valuable watch stolen from my shop, by Hanisel, his lodger, and he had received it from him, and given him 8 s. for it - he protested solemnly that he never saw it. He was brought before Hanisel, at my house, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! you wicked youth, for charging me with the robbery, you know I know nothing of it, I have received no watch from you at all, and did not know you had one." Hanisel answered,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Levy, you know you waited at the window, while I took the watch out, and you gave me 8 s. for it when I brought it out, and said it was an old watch, and worth no more;" he still denied all knowledge of it. The servant came in, and said she saw Levy at the window - he at last said,</p>
               <p>"I wish you would let me speak to Brant;" he went into the kitchen with him; then came out, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got the watch from the prisoner, but I gave him 30 s. for it;" 3 l. 10 s. is a very low value for it - I should sell it to a dealer for that. I went with Levy and Brant, and he gave me up the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEVY. Q. It was not me that gave you the watch - A. He sent a Jew to fetch it, and when he brought it, told him to give it to me.</p>

            . On the 11th of September, Harris sent for me, and asked if I knew anything of Hanisel - I went down to Blackwall, and then I came up again. I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100105"/>Hanisel in Levy's house, in Ratcliff-highway, and told him he was suspected of stealing Harris's watch; I took him with me - Harris said,</p>

               <p>"You may overhaul me if you like, I have not got it." I searched him. He then said he had sold the watch to Levy - I went and took Levy, who denied the charge; he was brought to the shop; Hanisel said,</p>
               <p>"I sold it to you for 8 s." Levy afterwards told me to go to a public-house, in Ratcliff-highway.</p>

I saw Levy looking in at the window at the time - I am sure of him. Hanisel wentout, and pointed to somebeads in the window - Levy met him at the window when he went out; Hanisel then came into the shop again. Levy then went away; I cannot say where he went to. Hanisel went out again in about half a minute, and the watch was missed. I saw both the prisoners at my master's next day, and told

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harris. About a quarter past four o'clock, Hanisel came in, and asked to look at some beads - I shewed him one row, which did not suit; he went out, and pointed to a particular row in the window, then came in, and I shewed them to him - he said he thought they would do, and he would go and fetch his woman; he did not ask about any watch. I saw nobody at the window. He went away, and in about a minute I missed the watch. I went out, but he was gone; he was brought to the shop next day, about two o'clock - I am certain of his person. Levy was charged with receiving it, and denied it at first; the girl said he was outside the window - he said it was false. Hanisel afterwards shewed me how he took it; he said he put his handkerchief over it, and took it up in it, and took it outside to Levy, who said at last, that he had bought it of him for 30 s.</p>

On the 6th of August, a cutler marked all the money in the tills on the head side, opposite to the face. About eleven o'clock at night, I gave 17 s. to a witness to put in the till, having myself first counted it; there were five half-crowns among it. The shutters were then shut, but the drawers not closed - no more customers came. It was his duty to empty the till at night - he did not know that I had done it. He came and separated the halfpence from the silver as usual - and in three or four minutes I came from outside the door with the witness, and immediately counted the silver, and found a half-crown missing. I accused him of taking it - he denied it. I found it in his pocket with other silver, and after some time he acknowledged taking it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you know what the till contained - A. I might have left 1 s. in it, among the copper. I found only four half-crowns left. I said if his friends came forward, I would let him go. I wanted to know how much he had taken, as he acknowledged he had been robbing me ever since he came. I bought his friends might persuade him to tell me.</p>

After soap is manufactured, it is put into the store-room; in consequence of suspicion, I employed two officers to watch: he occupied two rooms in my house. On the 30th of July, I ascertained the quantity of soap in the store-room. I reckoned 38 cakes to a cwt., and by that calculation, there were 2 l cwt.; I ordered him to deliver 6 1/4 cwt. to a customer; only a labourer, myself, and him had access to the soap. The labourers were under his controul. The soap was moist on the evening of the 29th - it was then all correct; he was to deliver out the 6 1/4 cwt. On the 30th, the officers took him into custody; on that day I went with them into his room; I found eight cakes of soap on the floor, between the bed and wall; it was moist, similar to the pile; I went to the store-room, and found eight cakes deficient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When had the pile been manufactured - A. I cannot exactly say; I think not a fortnight or three weeks - there might be two or three tons weight made. I sold Mr. Freeman 56 lbs. of each; the prisoner said it was the residue of a 1/4 of cwt. he had bought of Freeman; he bought soap of me occasionally; there was a closet in his room, where he might have hid it. I had Freeman apprehended.</p>

I remember offering a cwt. at 1 s. less, when I wanted money to make up a bill. I will not swear that I have not sold some to Cook, of Union-street. I never sold soap to a man named Cook.</p>

I said, I would be a pint, but we had no more; he carried the pot in and paid for it; he then said, we would walk on further, if I had no objection, and then have another pint; we went through the market, then walked away till we came into the <placeName id="t18230910-305-crimeloc1641">New Road</placeName>

A young man was there, who was afterwards with the prisoners. Fearby came in while we sat there. They seemed all strangers to each other. Fearby said he was a countryman, and had come to settle some business of money that had been owing for sixteen months - that he had applied to a gentleman, who he mentioned, who got 550 l. for him, and 550 l. for his brother - and that his brother was very infortunate in getting into a coach, he fell down and put his instep out. Wood said there was no such a word as infortunate, and wanted to lay a wager about it - they laid a pot of beer - Fearby paid for it, and then said we all three looked like poor men, and could not shew 10 l. a-piece. I said I had not 10 l. with me, but I expected some up from home by that day's post, and could produce it in a short time. Fearby then wanted to lay 3 l. to 1 l. that we did not each produce a 10 l. note by one o'clock. Wood and the young man pulled out their 10 l. each; and the young man walked with me up to Tottenham-court-road, where my parcel was coming, but the letter had not come. We left the prisoners at the public-house. Fearby then said he would give me till two o'clock - I said I would stand to the wager. The young man said he wanted to go into Tottenham-court-road to get change for some money, and would go with me; the prisoners said they would go too; we all four of us went; and they went into an inn while I went for my letter - it was not come - I asked my friend to lend me 20 l., which he did. We then went back to the inn, and shewed Fearby our 10 l. each, all three of us; then he said he would lay another 1 l. that we could not shew another 10 l. I then shewed him another 10 l.; he then gave into the hands of

             a 5 l. note, as he said they then wanted to go and see the balloon go off - and so did I. They got a coach, and we all went in it; the young man looked out of the coach, and said he knew of a convenient place where we could have refreshment. Fearby had said before that he would treat us with a bottle of wine, and change the 5 l. note; so we went to the inn. Wood and the young man asked if they might go up to a private room - the landlord said we might have the parlour - and we went into the parlour. Wood called for a pot of ale and a glass of shrub and water - and the young man said he would go and order some steaks, and while they were cooking we could have a game at cards. They asked me to play - I said No. Fearby and the young man played three or four games at all-fours; the young man had four chalks out of five. Fearby dealt the last deal, and begged to be excused to go out for a moment after he had dealt his cards, and wished us not to look at them. The young man took up his hand of cards, looked at them, and said it was such a good hand, he was sure to beat. Wood said</p>
               <p>"Let us lay him a wager about the game;" so when Fearby came in, the young man said he would lay him a wager - oh, he said, he would lay him any thing - that he would beat either 10 l. or 20 l. a-piece if he liked; then Fearby said he would lay 60 l. to our 20 l. each; he got up and put his money in a hat on another table - the others put down theirs, and wished me to put down mine - so I did, into the hat with the others; they then wanted me to play the hand for him, and said play how I would I was sure to win; I said I would not, three or four times - but they very much persuaded me, saying I could not lose - and so I played and lost - then Fearby said he had won the game, and got up and took the hat. Wood beckoned me out of the door - I went; and he said he should be back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, if I could step with him; and when I returned into the room they were all gone. I went to Hatton-garden, and they were taken up that evening.</p>

At the corner of North-street, he came behind us and gave Mr. Rigby a shove on the left shoulder, I did not see him snatch the watch - he ran down North-street; an alarm was given. Mr. Rigby ran after him - I took the child from him, and another person came behind and threw him down - I saw the prisoner in custody on the 22d - there was a gas light from the shop, and one from the corner - I believe him to be the man, and am sure that he is.</p>

On the 11th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came in and had three pennyworth of oysters. Sullivan came first, and said, wait until my sister comes; and then Donovan came in, and they eat the oysters between them, and left the shop together. They returned in a quarter of an hour, and when they were gone I missed a gown-piece of five yards and a quarter of printed cotton out of a band-box on the counter. I had not left the shop. They were behind me, and so was the cotton. They examined the gown whilst they were in the shop, and said they liked it very much. I pursued them directly. I had put it in the box again. Nobody but them were there till I missed it.</p>

I had drank three glasses of gin and part of a pot of beer, but knew what I was about, and drank with the prisoners in the shop. When they were taken, they acknowledged to taking it and pawning it. They said for God's sake be merciful to us - we will never do such a thing again - we did it out of a lark, and said they had torn the duplicate up.</p>

            . I live in Brewer's-court, Bedfordbury; the prisoner lodged in my house. On the 7th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, I received thirty-nine sovereigns fourteen shillings and eleven-pence, at the Bank - Mary Knaven was with me. After receiving my money it rained, and we went into the Mansion-house, public-house, and had a pot of ale; I was in her company about two hours and a half, and parted with her in Fleet-street. I had drank three glasses of liquor and part of a pot of ale; when I parted from her, she asked if my money was safe, I felt and found it so. I went home about three o'clock, and went to bed in one of my lodger's rooms, it was the prisoner's room. I cannot say whether my money was then safe, I continued in bed from three to five o'clock; I had carried my money loose in my trowsers pocket; the last time I felt, it was in Fleet-street. I met nobody in the way home, nor did I stay anywhere that I recollect. I awoke at five o'clock, and my money was gone; I saw the prisoner at eleven that night, and saw him again next day, and he shewed me eleven sovereigns in a pocket book; I asked how he came by them, he said he had them from a young woman who he kept company with, and who had taken them from a foreigner overnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERCAST. Q. Do not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100113"/>know that he was acquainted with a young woman - A. He knew a servant at Newton's hotel, St. Martin's-street, which is a house for the reception of foreigners; he said the woman had robbed the foreigner of it - I suspected that it was mine. I am sure it was safe when I left Knaven; I did not charge her with taking it. She was examined at Guildhall, on the 10th or 11th of July, for being in company with me; I could not then recollect when I had the money; it came to my memory next evening; she was two days in custody. I called at Knaven's house; I was not drunk when I went there - I carried her child home; she then came on to Fleet-street with me; I fell down on her stairs, as my foot slipped. I took the prisoner up three weeks after, he had not absconded, but lodged with me all the time. I never consulted a fortune-teller about it.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. You fell down at Knaven's house - A. Yes; my money was safe after that. I went to her house to ask about it, that occasioned words between me and her husband. I was taken before the Magistrate, and she was brought up by the Magistrate's desire.</p>

             - my husband is the prosecutor's first cousin; he is a bricklayer. I went to the Bank with him - he was sober. He received a great many sovereigns at the Bank, and put them into his breeches pocket; this was past twelve o'clock. He went to a public-house with me, and then went to my house; he drank some liquor, in Bow-lane; he had a pot of ale at a public-house, also three half quarterns of rum, and a quartern of gin - he was tipsy. I went as far as St. Paul's with him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got your money safe?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! Yes," said he, slipping his hand in his pocket, and I heard his money jingle. I parted with him at St. Paul's. I live in Great Trinity-lane - he went home with me before I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in custody - A. He came in the afternoon; the constable took me - I was discharged the same day. He told the Magistrate he rather thought I had got it; he had come to my house that night, and said he was sure I had his money, and told the Magistrate so.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner lodged with us. On the morning of the robbery he wanted to borrow 2 s. 6 d. of me, to go to a raffle at night; I did not lend it him, and he got me to send my girl to pawn a pair of breeches, for 2 s. 6 d.; she went and brought me the half-crown, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and he never came to me for it. My husband came home after three o'clock, and went up and slept in the prisoner's room, till five o'clock. He came into the house while my husband was up stairs; I do not know whether he went up, for I went out, leaving him there. A woman, who lived with the prisoner, as his wife (but not in our house) was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose she went into the prisoner's room whenever she came to the house - A. Yes; she and the prisoner had plenty of opportunities of going there - she was in the house between three and five o'clock, and the prisoner was there with her. He owed me 1 l. 15 s. 4 d. for rent, and paid me next morning, and said he got the money from a young woman who robbed a foreigner of it. He shewed me ten or eleven sovereigns in a pocket-book, and said he was to get 20 l. as a fortune with the young woman who he married; he married her two or three days after, and told me he was married by licence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see the prisoner at the house - A. About a quarter after three o'clock; I was sitting in my room, and told him my husband had come home. The woman was in my room at the time, both before and after the prisoner came in. The prisoner's room is on the second floor; I went out, leaving them together - I was not absent a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I live in George-yard, Whitechapel. On the 25th of June, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked me to walk with her; we went to a wine vaults, and had a quartern of rum - she wanted me to buy the duplicate of a blanket, but I refused - she said, if she had 1 s. 6 d. she would take it out of pawn. I went home for my money, and put a pound in my bosom, which I had to go to market with. It was two crowns, a half-crown, and silver. I lent her 18 d. and then called for another quartern of rum; I found my head heavy, and fell asleep. A young man awoke me, I found my money was gone; I caught her over the way at another wine vaults, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is my money, that you took out of my bosom;" she said, if I would go to her sister, she would make it all right. I caught hold of her hand, and a half-crown and 1 s. 6 d. fell from it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not tried here - A. Never; I was at Hick's-hall for an assault.</p>

            . I went into the wine vaults to get some beer, the prosecutrix was asleep. I saw the prisoner with her arm round the prosecutrix's neck, and her hand at her bosom; she pushed the corner of her handkerchief out; I suspected she was robbing her; she untied the corner of the handkerchief. I told the landlady of it, and she awoke the prosecutrix. The prisoner was crossing the road at the time the prosecutor went after her - I did not say anything to her.

               <p>"This won't do for me, I want my gin in a measure;" I put it into a measure, and gave it to him, and asked him for the money - he gave me 1 1/2 d.; I said I wanted 2 d.; he said he should give me no more; I insisted on having 2 d., and said I should turn him out if he did not pay me. He was going to sit down; I took and carried him to the outside door; he immediately made a short turn, and snatched at my watch; the ring broke, and he set off with the seal, and I followed and secured him about twenty yards off. He scuffled a good deal - the seal was found just by; he had thrown it into the road while I pursued him.</p>

I denied it - he then said, I had stolen half-a-crown. I said, I had not got one - he turned up the bed, and said he knew where the money was, and took a shilling, a sixpence and five penny pieces from under the bed; he said, it was part of his money. I knew him before: he ill used me, and I charged him with an assault.</p>

Between five and six o'clock I went down to open my bed-room door, to call my fellow-labourer. I opened the door, and met the prisoner coming out. She turned to go down stairs. I stopped her, and asked what brought her there. All this property was in the room. I said she should not go unless she said what brought her into my room. I found three boxes turned over, and property taken out. The things in question, which were safe overnight, were packed up, to be taken away. My fellow-labourer was fast asleep in the room. She said a woman in the street had sent her. Three caps of Connell's, who lodges with me, were found in her pocket.</p>
