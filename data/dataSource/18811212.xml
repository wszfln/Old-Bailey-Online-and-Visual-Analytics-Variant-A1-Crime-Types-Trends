Gilby's if I can"—I gave him into custody on 29th October.</p>

I am Mr. Jerlock's stepdaughter, and live with him—I remember the female prisoner coming there as housekeeper—the male prisoner used to come there every night for about a fortnight—the woman left on 26th October—on the morning before she went away she asked if my father had plenty of money; I said "I know nothing about father's money"—on that morning I saw them both in father's bedroom; the man was sitting on father's box, and had this part of the chain in his hand, and she was on the chair—she told me three times to go down<lb/>stairs; they said if I said anything to father about the man sleeping there they would kil me. I went down, and when I was coming up again I heard them run out—I did not look at the box—I stayed down<lb/>stairs till father came in—the lid of the box was not broken; they broke the lock.</p>

Drew, Wood, and Sons, law stationers, of Basinghall Street—about a fortnight afterwards I asked him for the money—he said he had not received it yet—I repeated the question about 20 different times—he said Mr. Wood had gone out of town, and would sign a cheque when he came back—his duty on receiving money was to enter it in the cash-book—I went to Drew and Son's about the end of October, and saw the manager, and had a conversation with him about these stamps—I afterwards told the prisoner that Mr. Smith had told me he had paid him the money months ago—he then said he had spent it, but he would work hard and pay it back—he also offered me a bill of sale on his furniture, not exceeding 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to cover my loss—pre<lb/>vious to 9th July I kept the books—the prisoner requested we should make up our accounts—I made out an account which showed a balance of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the prisoner said I ought to have more, and showed me a difference</p>

I live at 17, Paradise Street, Marylebone, and am a House-painter—between 9 and 10 o'clock on Saturday night, 15th Oct., I was standing at the corner of High Street and Paradise Street—I saw the prisoner and deceased James Alexander turn the corner of High Street into Paradise Street; they seemed to be wrangling—Murphy put up his hands in a fighting attitude—Alexander said "You don't mean that, do you?" and before he got the words out of his mouth Murphy struck him in the face with his fist, and he went right flat back on his head, a dead fall, in the middle of the road, and I saw blood flowing from the wound—the witness Robson came across the road and said "You ought to be given in charge for knocking the man down in that cowardly manner"—the prisoner said "If you ain't off I'll serve you the same"—two policemen then came up, and Alexander was taken away—the prisoner went away—I did not know him before—I had known Alexander 30 years; he lived in the neighbourhood—they had both been drinking a little, but not out of the way, they were capable of knowing what they were doing—they were not intoxicated.</p>

I am a marine store dealer in Paradise Street, Marylebone—on Saturday night, 15th October, about 10 minutes to 10, I saw the prisoner strike the deceased with his fist, and he fell in the road—I heard nothing said—I crossed over and said to the prisoner "You ought to be locked up;" he said "If you don't go away I will serve you the same"—the police then came up—the prisoner had had a little to drink, but was not drunk—there was plenty of light from the lamps and the shops—I knew them both before by sight.</p>

On Monday, 17th October, I was sent for to attend the deceased, he was suffering from injury to the brain—he died on Thursday morning—he had a mark over the left eye, such as might be inflicted by a blow from a man's fist—he had an injury at the back of the head, such as might be caused by being knocked down and his head coming in contact with the ground; the skin was broken—I afterwards assisted Dr. Spurgin in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was a fracture of the skull, which caused injury to the brain, and that caused death—there must have been considerable violence—I doubt very much if he would have been killed had he fallen on a macadamised road, but this road was paved with granite cubes—a fall on one of those would be likely to cause the injury.</p>

I am 14 years of age—I have been living with my father (the prisoner) and mother at 20, Lancing Street, St. Pancras—I work as a machine boy—my father is a machine minder, and has been employed for 26 years at Mr. Stacey's works—he worked there up to the time that his leg was bad, when he was away from work two or three weeks—he used to be in bed in the back kitchen; the front kitchen was our sitting-room—there is a door between the two—my mother and the two children, Albert and Arthur, slept with my father in the back kitchen—Albert was about three years of age, and Arthur a little under one—on Tuesday morning, 13th September, I was in the front kitchen with Arthur and my little brother Charles; he is about seven or eight—my father was in bed in the back room—Albert was there too—mother went out to fetch a doctor to see father—he was worse that morning—while she was out father called to me "Bill, bring the baby in to me—I took Arthur into his room—he told me to put him on the bed, and I put him on—I did not notice where Albert was at that time; he was not in the front kitchen—father told me to go out and shut the door—I did so, and went into the front kitchen—mother had been out about 20 minutes, when I took the baby in—father called out to me again "Bill, bring the hammer in to me"—I got it, and took it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he opened the door two or three inches, and took it from me—he could reach it from the bed—lie then shut the door again—a little time after<lb/>wards mother returned—she went into the back room, and called out "Father's leg has burst!"—I went into the room, and saw a quantity of blood on the bed and on the floor by the side of the bed—I saw the children on the bed—I did not notice what state they were in—I came out of the room; mother screamed out—I saw somebody come and take the baby away to a doctor—I afterwards saw Albert brought into the front room—tne baby was then brought back, and the police and the doctor came—I saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Monday night; father was eating his meals with it in the bedroom—I did not see it on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Father's leg had been bad a long while; several weeks—he had been attending to his work with his bad leg for some time—he had been in bed ever since the Friday before the Tuesday before that—he used sometimes to come early on account of his leg; there were sore places on it—in July five of us children had scarlet fever; we were very ill with it, and my little sister died of it; she was our only sister—father was very fond of her; he was very much grieved at her death—I did not notice any difference in him; he used to grieve about her—I used to see him in bed between the Friday and the Tuesday—I did not notice that he seemed worse on the Sunday—I did not talk to him much; he has spoken to me when I went in—I did not notice anything in the wav he spoke to me—on the Tuesday morning he was undressed; only his shirt on—Albert was in bed with him when I first went in, sitting up and having breakfast with him—the baby had been taken out of the room and dressed—father seemed quite friendly and affectionate to him—I did not notice any difference in his manner then—he was always very fond of us all—when</p>

               <p>we were ill he used to sit up with us at night and nurse us—mother said when she went out that she was going for a doctor, and he said "Be quick, come back"—I did not hear him say why she was to be quick, or how he felt—I never heard him say anything unkind about me or the other children.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 69). On Tuesday morning, 13th Sep<lb/>tember, about 10.20, I went to 20, Lancing Street—I was the first constable to arrive there—in the front kitchen I saw the body of the little boy Albert lying on the sofa dead—he had an injury to the neck—the baby was not there then; it had been taken to a doctor—he was brought back after<lb/>wards—I went at once into the backroom—I there saw the prisoner lying on his left side on the bed; the clothes were all of a heap at the foot of the bed—I felt his body; he seemed quite cold—I thought at first that he was dead—I turned him on his back, and then noticed a white pocket-handkerchief tied tightly round his throat; there were two knots, tying it tightly round, and then this knife placed across, and two other knots, so as to tie the knife in, and enable it to twist the handkerchief tight—the blade and also the handle had wet blood on it—I at once undid the handkerchief, and the prisoner then began to breathe freely—he did not speak a word—Dr. Davis came and attended to him, and he was after<lb/>wards taken to the station—in the meantime the little boy Arthur had been brought back to the front-room and put on the sofa—I saw this hammer, and that and other things were taken possession of by Sergeant Pontin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant Y</hi> 35). On 13th September I went to 20, Lancing Street; I found both the children lying on the sofa in the front kitchen; Albert was fully dressed, and Arthur partially; they were both stabbed in the throat—Dr. Davis came—I saw the prisoner in the back room; his clothing and legs were saturated with blood; he was unconscious—I took him to the station; he seemed to be in a daze, unconscious all the way—Dr. Andrews saw him at the station and ordered him to be taken to University College Hospital—I took possession of the hammer, knife, and other things—on 3rd December I took him into custody on this charge—I told him what he was charged with—before that he said, "I know what you have come for"—he burst into tears at the hospital, but made no further statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and surgeon, of Euston Square—on Tuesday morning, 13th September, between 10 and 11, a young man brought the boy Arthur to my house; I examined him, and found he had been stabbed in the neck; the larger vessels had been severed, and he must have died almost directly; the body was warm—it was such a stab as might have been inflicted by this knife—I had him carried back, and I went also—I saw the boy Albert lying on a sofa in the front room; he was quite dead, and warm; he had a similar stab in the neck, only more deep; it had penetrated the large vessels, and a large quantity of blood must have occurred at once and caused death—I went into the back room and saw the prisoner—the handkerchief had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188112120020"/>
               <p>just then been taken off his neck by the officer; I saw a little scratch on his neck; it was a skin wound, a scratch—he was unconscious, possibly from partial strangulation, and also from a blow on the head—there was extravasation and a large swelling on the right temple; it was such an injury as might have been done by giving himself a blow with this hammer; it was a very severe blow indeed—I administered stimulants, and when he had rallied a little I had him taken to the station, so that he might be taken to the hospital—I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the blow on the head was as heavy a one as he could have inflicted himself, nature would resist—I could not say whether the stab on the child's neck was a prolonged stab; there was only one mark, but it went apparently quite across the neck, through the large vessels—I did not examine his leg because they said it was of long standing; it was bound up; I did not disturb the bandages.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at Oakley Square, and am divisional surgeon to the police—on 13th September I saw the two children—I have heard Dr. Davis's evidence, and agree with him—I afterwards saw the prisoner at University College Hospital about mid<lb/>day; he was partly conscious, in a comatose state, almost insensible, resulting from two causes, from erysipelas probably, poisoning of the blood, and a very severe blow on the forehead, near the temple, on the right side—the erysipelas would undoubtedly affect the brain by poison<lb/>ing the blood, and cause delirium—while in that state the person would only be partly conscious, and not responsible for his actions, I think; not conscious of what he was doing, nor capable of arranging his affairs—I saw him twice at the hospital; I visited him some time after—Dr. Bond, the medical officer, was present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first day I visited him very shortly after the occur<lb/>rence, and I saw him again some weeks afterwards; he was then recovering—on the first occasion he would make no statement; he muttered—the comatose condition was not attributable solely to the blow on the head; his condition was more comatose than I should expect from that alone; two causes would combine—no doubt the erysipelas contributed to a very great extent—it would, no doubt, be caused by the passage of the poisoned blood through the brain—there might be intermissions—I was told afterwards at the hospital that he had delirium intermittently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at University College Hospital—on Tuesday, 13th September, the prisoner was brought there—when put to bed he remained quite still, his eyes being open and staring fixedly in front of him—his cheeks were a little flushed, his mouth partly open—I noticed the bruise on the temple—the limbs were rather cold—I attributed those appearances partly to the blow on the head and partly to the erysipelas—I examined both legs—there were three or four ulcers on the right leg, and the erysipelas was there—he was in a very bad state physically—I noticed a scratch on the neck, and marks of blood about his hands and clothes—I had him removed to the erysipelas ward—I found no trace of the strangulation—I spoke to him before he was removed to the erysipelas ward, but he was not suf<lb/>ficiently conscious to answer then—about 4 o'clock he did answer me, and I made this note at the time of what he said: "This morning my wife went out to fetch me some medicine from a dispensary; I remember this, and also that about 9 o'clock I was in bed with two of my children;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188112120021"/>
               <p>after this I remember nothing. At that time he answered rationally, but not as a healthy person would have done—he was stupid, and answered very slowly—about 9.30 next morning I asked him some more questions, and he said "Last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday I was shivering, and retched on the Sunday, but did not vomit, having no food in me, by reason of my bad appetite; I had shooting pains up along the inside of my right thigh since the Friday, and on Friday the feet became very red and blue. From Friday to yesterday (Tuesday) I had only a little gruel, some tea, one egg on the Sunday morning, and a bit of bread; no meat, fish, or broth. On Tuesday I sent my wife for a doctor at 9 o'clock, and then felt my head throbbing round and round." He was in the hospital in a dangerous condition till the 19th—the danger arose from the erysipelas, and from the effects of it; he had in<lb/>flammation of both lungs and abscesses in the right foot, the right leg, and the right thigh—he was not conscious when he first came in, and next day he was delirious—he was nearly constantly delirious until the 19th, but less so in the morning than the afternoon, and not as a rule—he refused food at first, the day after his admission—the delirious con<lb/>dition was the result of the erysipelas, which caused blood-poisoning—he was violent—he hurt one of the nurses a day or two after admission, and afterwards, I believe, he struck a policeman—in doing injury to himself or others he might be conscious at the time, but could not control him<lb/>self, and would not know the consequences of his action—he might know that he was taking the life of the child, but would not be able to control himself—I think in some cases a delirious person may know what he is doing—after he got better he was a quiet, well-behaved man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that the excitement was caused by the erysipelas—he was also very feverish, which would increase the delirium—I have no doubt that he knew that he struck the policeman, but I don't think he knew it was wrong—I believe his statement to be true that he remembered nothing of what had occurred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In all probability there was original weakness of brain power—mental suffering and anxiety would predispose the brain to delirium, added to the low condition of body from the ulcers in the leg.</p>

I am cashier to Mr. Whiteley, of Westbourne Grove—on 17th October, about 6 p.m., Dale presented this cheque, and pointed to the name of Foiling, a large customer of ours, on the back—I said "What is his address?" and he either wrote on it "Queen's Wood, Elt<lb/>ham," or else it was there before—I handed it to Mr. Rudd with certain instructions—it was passed on, and a communication made to the counting-house—it was then handed to Oram—I saw Dale for about three minutes—a few days afterwards my attention was called to the dishonour of the cheque, and I gave a part description of the man who presented it—on 17th November I went to Lawrence Fountney Hill and saw the prisoners come out of a house—I recognised Dale at once.</p>

I am assistant to John Nowel and Sons, cutlers, of 32, Hatton Garden—on or about 31st October Bode called and gave me a card with "Gurney, Sons, and Co." on it, and asked for patterns of table cutlery—they were shown to him, and he took the prices down in a pocket-book of Nos. 435, 448, and another number, and said that they were for abroad—three days afterwards he came and brought a pattern, and asked why our goods were so expensive, and said that he should want six sets of articles which he named—I afterwards received this letter confirming the order, and stating that they were to be packed in a tin-lined case, and nailed up in the ordinary way—we send goods abroad, and I saw that done—some of the samples are here, No. 448—I sent them by messenger to Suffolk Lane, and an invoice for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have never been paid.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I received instructions about 20th October—I did not know Bode then—I went to Matthews and Co., but found the place closed—I then kept observation near Lawrence Pountney Hill, and on 2nd November, about two o'clock, I saw Bode with Mr. Woodley at a public-house at the corner; I told him who I was, and said that a cheque from his book had been uttered at Mr. Whiteley's—he said that he knew nothing about it, his cheque-book was given up to his trustee in bankruptcy—he denied all knowledge of the cheque—I accompanied him to Mr. Verned's, his solicitor; we saw Mr. Bottomley, who said that he knew nothing about the cheque-book—Mr. Woodley was present, and said that he knew nothing about the cheque-book—I said to Bode, "Surely you can give me some idea about that cheque?"—he said that he could not, and I left him—I kept observation on the house, and on 16th November, at five o'clock, the two prisoners came out, each carrying a parcel; they got into an omnibus at the Mansion House, and I got outside—they got out at Oxford Street, and I followed them to Mr. Raper's—when they left I went in and spoke to Mr. Haper, and then went to Scotland Yard and saw Oram, who had been keeping observation with me—on the 18th I received a warrant for Dale's arrest for uttering this cheque, and on that day I went to Lawrence Pountney Hill, and saw the two prisoners together—Bode was writing a letter—I said to Bode, "I think you remember me?" he said "Yes"—I said to Dale, "I think your name is Dale?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "I hold a warrant for your arrest for uttering a cheque for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with intent to defraud Mr. Whiteley"—he made no reply—I said to Bode, "I shall likewise arrest you, and charge you with being concerned in uttering the cheque"—he said, "What have I to do with it? I know nothing about the affair but what I told you the other day, why did not you arrest me then?"—I said, "I thought you were a respectable man, but finding you in company with this man it is a different thing"—he said, "I merely came here to receive my letters; that gentleman receives my letters"—I asked for the key to lock the place up; Bode took it from his pocket and handed it to me—they were taken to Paddington Police<lb/>station, where this deposit note was found on Dale, and these knives were taken from Bode's pocket in my presence by Inspector Lansdowne, who is very ill—I went next day to Lawrence Pountney Hill, and under a ladder leading to the cellar I found another pocket-book, which I showed to Bode, who said that it was his—I found in it this other deposit note, marked "Bode, No. 1"—I said, "Here is your pocket-book—he said, "Oh, yes; don't show it; it is only betting transactions"—I took this other pocket-book and papers from Dale—the deposit notes were each in their respective pocket-books—Nowel's invoice for the knives was in Dale's pocket-book—my impression is that this is the letter Bode was writing. (<hi rend="italic">Signed "C. B.," inquiring about fifty boxes of cigars ordered on the 10th of Messrs.

On Sunday morning, 6th Octo<lb/>ber, about 12.30, I was in Great St. Andrew's Street, and saw Mr. Fitz<lb/>gerald struggling with the prisoner and three others—the prisoner seized him by his right arm, threw out his foot, and tried to trip him up—he shouted "Police!"—I gave chase, and caught one of them—the prisoner escaped, but I followed him some time—he is the man.</p>

               <p>China, I had some conversation with him about my son' going out to China, and it was ultimately arranged between me and the defendant that my son should go out to China to join the firm—my son went out about six months after that, as a clerk, with the understanding that he was to become a partner after a certain time, which he did—that was about July, 1878—the next occasion on which I saw the defendant was in December, 1879—he came to see me at Cargan, Dumfries; he informed me that disputes had arisen between himself and Mr. Mackintosh—I had heard that previously, and I then understood that the partner<lb/>ship was to end at the end of 1879, and that a new partnership would have to be entered into—some discussion then took place as to my son continuing in the firm with either Mr. Chalmers or Mr. Mackintosh, and ultimately I left it to my son to decide, intimating that I should like him to remain in partnership with Mr. Mackintosh, and my son did so decide—in December, 1879, when the defendant saw me he told me of informa<lb/>tion he had obtained about Mr. Mackintosh, that he had made a disreputable failure in Glasgow, and that he had tampered with documents, and that he had got corn into his possession which he had no right to, and that he had absconded, to get away from his creditors—upon that I at once made inquiries into the matter—I think Mr. Mackintosh was in Scotland at the time, and I asked him to call at Cargan, and I saw him—I made other inquiries in the matter—I spoke to Mr. Mackintosh when he came to Cargan, and he denied the accusation and said" I will send you a letter to convince you"—he sent me this letter in the handwriting of the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was convinced, after inquiry, that the imputations against Mr. Mackintosh were unfounded, that he was prepared to refute them whenever made, and that there were many things which redounded to Mr. Mackintosh's credit.</hi>) I did not tell Mr. Mackintosh the whole that I had heard from Mr. Chalmers, I merely mentioned that Mr. Chalmers had stated that he had made a disreputable failure, and that he had left the country in consequence—I did not mention that Mr. Chalmers had charged him with having tampered with documents and got the corn improperly into his own hands—I did not like to make an imputation of that kind without being more certain—after that my son entered into partnership with Mr. Mackintosh and Mr. Beauchamp, and they are now carrying on business in London and Shanghai—my son is now at Shanghai managing the business there—I had previously written a letter to the defendant at the beginning of 1880 with reference to my son—there was some matter with reference to Mr. Chalmers's dealings in China which I wanted cleared up—from that time I heard no more of the matter until October this year—on 23rd October I received by post this letter (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>) in Mr. Chalmers's handwriting, that enclosed this other letter (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>), I took that copy of it (<hi rend="italic">B</hi>), and returned it to Mr. Chalmers with this letter (<hi rend="italic">D</hi>).

I am a member of the firm of Matheson and Co., merchants, of Lombard Street—we are agents for the China house of Jardine, Matheson, and Co.—I have known the defendant for some time, and his father, Dr. Chalmers, for many years—I have not known Mr. Mackintosh at all—I think I heard that he was a gentleman who was connected with Mr. Chalmers, but I knew nothing about it—about 20th October this year the defendant called on me at my office in Lombard Street, and showed me a letter from his solicitor—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the letter (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>)—he had sent me a note in the forenoon requesting to see me upon an important matter upon which he wished my advice, and when he came in he explained generally the matter, that there was a disagreement with Mr. Mackintosh, and that in consequence of that he had been making inquiries as to the history of Mr. Mackintosh prior to their partnership, and that he had received this letter, which he</p>

               <p>was anxious I should see and advise him what to do with it—I don't think he said what the particular nature of the disagreement with Mr. Mackintosh was; some matter of account, I understood—I read the letter, and knowing the relation of Mr. Dudgeon to him I said it was his clear duty to send the letter to Mr. Dudgeon, sen., that he might know it—I don't think he said anything about any imputations on his own character, or what caused him to make these inquiries about Mr. Mack<lb/>intosh, beyond that he had heard things about him—I had not the remotest interest in the matter except as a friend of Mr. Dudgeon—the defendant had never consulted me before, or asked my advice in reference to his partnership with Mr. Mackintosh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have for very many years been intimately acquainted with Dr. Chalmers, and for the last fifty years with Mr. Dudgeon, on terms of friendship—Mr. Chalmers said this was a matter of grave importance to him, and that he desired to have my advice as one of his father's oldest friends.</p>

I am a merchant in the China trade, of Palmerston Buildings, in this city—I know the defendant—I knew Mr. Mackintosh before these proceedings—I knew that they had been in partnership—about 20th October the defendant called at my office and showed me a letter—to the best of my belief this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>)—I read it and returned it to him—I do not remember his saying anything of importance—lie gave no reason for showing me the letter—at the time I was reading it I believe my son, Stanley Hooten, came in, and I think he also saw the letter, but I am not sure—the defendant mentioned Mr. Matheson's name—he simply said he had shown the letter to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have had business relations with Chalmers; Mackintosh, and Co.—we made arrangements that the partner who came over here should share our private rooms, and write their letters there—Mr. Mackintosh did first, and Mr. Chalmers afterwards, when he came over—that began, I think, about '74, and lasted two or three years—I am a creditor of the firm of Chalmers, Mackintosh, and Co. (which has been dissolved), to the amount of more than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. atone time; at present it is much less—I have not been wholly paid—I don't know whether I was the only trade creditor—I refused to become a party to the deed of dissolution; I was asked to do so, I forget when, at the time they were dissolving, that would be about the beginning of 1880; I declined then to sign the deed of dissolution, because I wished to have the security of Mr. Chalmers as well us Mr. Mackintosh—I did not want to release Mr. Chalmers—it did not pass through my mind why Mr. Chalmers showed me this letter; it did not strike me as unnatural—I should think my debt now is about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last payment was received about two months ago—I did not communicate to Mr. Mackintosh that I had read this letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I now carry on business under the firm of Mackintosh, Dudgeon, and Co., at Shanghai, and in London as H. L. Beauchamp and Co.—we are still carrying on business in the China trade—I was a partner of the defendant's from 1st January, 1874, to 31st December, 1879—the deed of dissolution was dated in April, 1880, but it was to date from the end of the previous year—differences existed between us, and I and my partner, Mr. Dudgeon, jun., took proceedings against Mr. Chalmers to recover certain moneys which I claimed as being due to me, which proceedings are still pending—there was first an arbitration; that was repudiated by Mr. Chalmers—there was first a private agreement for arbitration, Mr. Chalmers objected to that; then it was made a Rule of Court, and his wife intervened—before I was in partnership with Mr. Chalmers I was myself in trade in China from April, 1867, to the end of 1873—I was first at Hong Kong in the employment of a bank, then a bill broker and commission agent, and carried on that business satisfactorily—my salary at the Hong Kong bank was about 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I was nominally private secretary to the chief manager, but I joined the bank on the understanding that at the end of the year they would open an agency in Calcutta or Bombay, where they had previously been represented by a Parsee firm, but during the year a great many failures took place in the China trade, and several banks failed, and they decided that they would not open an independent bank; I therefore left the bank—I think I entered their service in the beginning of March, 1866—I had arrived in China in January—my brother was secretary to the North China Insurance Company—I com<lb/>menced business in Glasgow in 1856, as a broker and agent—I was then 21 years of age—on my twenty-first birthday I was made a partner in the firm of James Steel and Son—three years after that I commenced business for myself, I think about 1861—while in business at Glasgow I had business transactions with a gentleman at Londonderry, John Munn, jun.—he consigned cargoes of oatmeal to me in my own name—the bills of lading were sent to me and the cargoes were lodged in the public store of Matthew Browning in my own name—that was done from time to time—the business was carried on in this way: Mr. Munn would write to me saying that he had made a shipment of a certain quantity of oatmeal by a certain steamer, and enclose either the ship's receipt or a bill of lading for it, and he would send me over a bill drawn for me to accept on account of the cargo, which bill I would accept and return to him at Londonderry; he would discount it, and it would come over to me for payment, through one of the Scotch banks, and I should have to meet it when it became due—I did not sell the cargo; I sold a small portion—I either got a bill from Mr. John Munn with his acceptance and discounted it with my own bankers and took up my acceptance to him, or I would pass a cash order on Mr. John Munn if I was specially instructed to do so, and get the money to take up the bill—the bills were generally sent to me accepted in blank and I filled up the body of the bill afterwards, put my name to it as the drawer, and got the money—that was as near as I can say the practice at that time—I think that went on for two years—I think altogether there were about 1,300 loads—I sold about 200—Mr. Munn wanted to get a better price for them or I should have sold more—the price went down and the quality of the goods was deteriorated, so they suffered in both ways—I</p>

               <p>was not always able to discount Mr. Munn's acceptances; one of them was returned and came back to me through the bank; then, as far as I remember I wrote to him for an explanation, and he asked me to pass a cash order on him for the amount, and I did so; that also came back unpaid, and I then got an advance from Messrs. Clark and Co. upon a portion of the meal to put me in funds for money that I was out of; and sometime after that, about the beginning of 1865 or the end of 1864, Mr. Munn being in Glasgow, I said to him that my bankers had spoken of the continued redrafts and renewals, and that my discount facilities were very limited, and that I should not be able to discount any more of his paper—Mr. Munn then said to me that his discount facilities were also very limited, and that his bankers had raised objections, and that he was afraid he would not be able to draw upon me any more—I said "The meal has been kept a long time, it has not risen in quality, and the market does not appear to be improving, what are we to do with it? Besides that, the bills in circulation against it are much more than the value of the goods"—he said "Well, you have the goods, and you had better get money on them and retire the drafts as far as that will go"—the bills then out were as far as I recollect of greater value than the value of the cargo—I then went to James Clark and Co.; that firm has ceased to exist; Mr. Browning is dead, and his stores are abolished; I told Mr. Clark that I had a quantity of oatmeal which we had held for some time, and I pledged the oatmeal with him, and raised money upon it from time to time—I always had an open account with Clark and Co.; we used to turn over a good many thousands a year—I ultimately stopped payment about the end of May, 1865—there was a bill of Mr. Munn's for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on 31st May; some time before it came due Mr. Munn sent me a blank bill stamp to fill up for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with his acceptance across the face of it; I asked my banker whether he would discount it; he said he would not; I then went to James Clark and Co., and told them I required a further advance upon the oatmeal, and they told me that the state of my general account was such that they could not advance me any more—I represented to Mr. Clark that this oatmeal was to be put to the special account—he said he had put it to the general account, and he could not afford to give me any more advances; that he did not know anybody but me in the matter—I then saw that I could not meet this bill on the 31st of the month; I con<lb/>sidered that Clark and Co. ought to have put these advances to the special account; I then stopped payment—I left Glasgow on 30th May; I had a friend there named G. W. Scott; he is dead; I first wrote a private letter to Mr. Munn telling him that I should not be able to take up the bill, and then I told Mr. Scott the position in which I was placed—he was a merchant and commission agent in the same business as myself; I consulted with him and left him to arrange with my creditors in my absence—he knew I was going; I communicated to him my position with regard to Mr. Munn—at this time my sister Kate was living at Bonn, in Germany; I heard that she was seriously ill—I had corn transactions with Mr. John Christie, of Londonderry—I never heard of Mr. McCall; there is a Mr. McCorkill; I had business transactions with him—I never had a relative of the name of McEwan; there is a tailor of that name—it is not true that corn was stored in those three names, and that I forged delivery and other orders to put the corn into</p>

               <p>never was there while I was there, neither of the Messrs. Munn—I saw no one connected with him, or coming from him—I received a letter from Mr. G. W. Scott—I have not got it; I have no letter belonging to that period of my life—nobody came over to me at Aix-la-Chapelle—I never saw either of the Messrs. Munn afterwards—I declined to meet them altogether—I refused to see them—I came back to London, I think, on 15th or 16th July—I have no uncle named McEwan, my only uncle is Dr. Stewart, of Edinburgh—I know a McEwan, a tailor; he is no relation of mine, I don't know where he lives; his shop is in Princes Street, Glasgow—he was no friend of mine; he made my clothes some<lb/>times—he had nothing whatever to do with the negotiations with regard to my settlement of Mr. Munn's claim—I never spoke to him about anything except my clothes—there was no person on my behalf who guaranteed the payment was eventually paid to Mr. Munn—I paid the premiums on the policy—I took out the policy—Mr. Duncan Macfarlane is a personal friend or mine, to whom I sent the remittance to take up the bills, the 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to settle; that was paid in 1868—as far as I re<lb/>member he had nothing to do with the arrangement that was made in the autumn of 1865, except that he was very intimate with me, and we were always talking together about our affairs—I have Chancery pro<lb/>ceedings pending against Mr. Chalmers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cash-book—when I came home from China our business was very small, and all the bookslkept was a cash jotting-book, and as business began to growl started a ledger; that ledger was first begun to post up Mr. Chalmers's cash as far as possible—for the last few months of the partnership the business books that were kept were a cash-book and ledger; that was all; those were the only books—until these proceedings I never heard of any charge being made against me that I had altered the accounts—I have seen the amended statement of defence in the Chancery proceedings delivered last April. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read an extract from this, which alleged that the witness had improperly altered the accounts by crediting himself with subsistence money to the extent of about</hi> 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I saw that, but my solicitor and I came to the conclusion that Mr. Chalmers in stating that I had fraudulently altered the books after the proceedings in Chancery had commenced meant that I had made some alterations on the face of the books; that was a question of fact which was settled in Chancery—the alteration was made with distinct arrangement with Mr. Chalmers himself: there was really no alteration—the cash-book shows the drawings for subsistence money—all the cash intermissions are entered there; all the moneys received and paid out—you will find my drawings for subsistence money entered in the ledger in a page devoted to that account—Mr. Chalmers went to Shanghai in 1876, and I came home and took charge of the business during 1877 and up to 1878 and 1879—during that time I was in the habit of drawing money from the business on my own personal account from time to time—I entered them at the end of the month in one sum in this cash-book—here it is on 31st January, 1877—you will find that my cash drawings during that month were only 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is "Charges account for business expenses as per arrangement with W. B. C. 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was entered at the same time—those two entries were not made on 31st January, 1877; they were made some time afterwards, because I kept the whole of the cash-book open until I had a little matter of dispute between Mr. Chalmers and myself settled—this was entered on</p>

               <p>my receiving a letter from Mr. Chalmers, of which I forget the date—I cannot now tell you when this was entered—I should fancy the appor<lb/>tioning of my private drawings and charges account was made in 1878—this entry of 31st December, 1876, was, I fancy, made before the middle of 1878; I think so—I won't say more, but I have a right to make the entries at any time I like in my accounts, and to post them exactly as I please, so long as they are posted correctly—there was a dispute pending between Mr. Chalmers and myself as to the amount which I was entitled to debit to "charges account," and of course the balance of my spendings went to the debit of my own personal account, and if you wish I will give you some explanation about this dispute—when I was in charge of the business at Shanghai Mr. Chalmers went to America and Canada on the part of the business—he was not allowed to draw anything except for business expanses; he had a special agreement—I do not know what his drawings were for 1874 and 1875; I sent him home money especially for his business expenses—you will find his drawings in that book—the special agreement is among the papers in the Court of Chancery; it was drawn up for him before he left Shanghai—he was then in debt, and I made it a special condition that while he was away he should only spend money at home in business expenses, and be no burden to the firm—I believe there are entries relating to every month during 1877 up to the middle of 1878 which were not made up till after the middle of 1878—the book was posted up then; you will find them in "charges account" at page 25—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month was posted after the middle of 1878, after receiving a letter from Mr. Chalmers agreeing that I should do so—I have had experience of book-keeping about 20 or 25 years—these items of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month do not purport to Do entered in the course of keeping the account from the beginning of 1877—the charges account was all posted up at one time; any one who understands book<lb/>keeping will understand it—I wished to have the charges account current date by date, and as soon as I came home from London, knowing that Mr. Chalmers had no office and no office expenses, or anything to pay, I found that he debited to cash for business expenses regularly 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week when he was living at home and had no money to spend on busi<lb/>ness; I at once wrote to him privately, asking for an explanation—I did not get one; I wrote again and again—at last I wrote officially in 1878 and insisted on an explanation, and then he wrote—you will find the letter—I forget the date of it—I kept an account of the expenses which went to make up the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month—we had it at the office; I don't know where it is; it may be in the office—it is petty cash, office expenses—it was never asked for till the present moment—we can show that the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month does not nearly cover our petty cash, and I was always out of pocket by it—there were entries of his business expenses—this letter of 28th February says "I had left all those papers at home"—that means in London—there was no one for me to ask for the papers—I got a bundle of papers from Mrs. Chalmers—I took what she gave me—I had no opportunity of asking her for the counterfoils of the cheque-book—you will find in my letter what I replied to Mr. Chalmers, it relates to the whole accounts—this is a copy of the abstract sent (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this of the account for 1874 to 1876 as it stands now—I entered telegrams and stationery separately—I have the vouchers in the office—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month was our expenses—we do not keep separate</p>

               <p>vouchers for our petty cash account in the office—I will send for them, but I do not know whether they have got them for so far back—there is a second letter there—he said that I was at liberty to charge 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and that was never objected to—that was in April, 1877—no answer was given to my letter—when Mr. Chalmers came home and asked to see the office books, the cash-book was produced to him—I do not know when he saw it, as he called at my solicitor's office to see the accounts—we always said that we had the cash-book and ledger—I only made an affidavit with regard to letters—I never heard that an order was made that I was to file an affidavit stating what books I kept, nor did I hear that I was to pay the costs—Mr. Chalmers had access to all the books.</p>

Hannay, the solicitors, and any information which I gave was my father's written instructions, which I showed to those gentlemen, and they took the necessary proceedings—the statements sent by my father were correct as far as I was aware—Mr. Graham was really the representative of my father—Mr. Graham was in business in Londonderry, and I operated under my father—I have lost sight of him for many years, and do not know, where to find him—I knew Mr. Christie in business, and I know that he</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated November</hi> 31, 1881, <hi rend="italic">and alleged that the statements said to be made by the writer of the letter C were exag<lb/>gerated, that what he had said was only derived from his recollection of information</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clockmaker, of 89, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square—on 18th August Wood, Loban, and another man called to inspect some clocks—I had previously received from my assistant, Fairer, a card, with the name "Oamille and Co." upon it—Wood said that Fairer had recommended him to me, that no doubt Fairer had named to me that he (Wood) required a clock for the show-room in Eegent Street—I said I would have some for him to select from next morning—I took two clocks to Regent Street next morning, and saw Wood and Loban—Wood said he wanted a clock to suit the furniture—the clocks were tried on the mantelpiece to see which would harmonise the best, and Loban chose a <hi rend="italic">Louis Quatorze</hi> one, price 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the other was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 18th Noble brought me a note, which I have since destroyed—it was signed by Wood, and requested me to send the clocks by bearer, but I declined—I took them next day, when it was decided to keep the Louis Quatorze clock—I saw Loban and Wood—Noble opened the door each time and showed me out—it was arranged that Loban was to pay for the clock with a bill at a month—a lady called Madame Camille also came to inspect the clock—this bill was written on my counter. (<hi rend="italic">Payable at the London and South Western Bank, Regent Street Branch, and marked "No account"</hi>) The clock has been returned since the matter has been under criminal investigation, I believe by Mrs. Wood—before the prosecution was instituted I went to see the clock two or three times—I saw Noble—on one occasion he told me the room was in disorder—Loban on one occasion said that he required a diamond ring or two—I did not supply them—Wood selected a watch and chain for the inspection of Madame Camille—I did not take them.</p>

Fulton did not fre<lb/>quently visit Regent Street—I saw him about three times there—I re<lb/>garded him as Loban's friend—I know you were not friendly with Alexander Fulton—you told me one Saturday afternoon not to take any messages from Fulton or Loban, as you would have nothing to do with them—you had no knowledge of the message I took to Morton—you were not present when the refrigerator was delivered—nothing between the clock and the refrigerator was delivered to my knowledge at Regent Street, nor was anything pledged—I have delivered parcels in the name of Camille to the 40 ladies whose addresses are in this book—they came in their carriages, and lived in Stanhope Gardens and other places around Bays<lb/>water—I have gone to Robinson's, Marshall's, and other large houses for patterns, and have paid cash—the file of bills you produce used to hang in a corner of the workroom—I took the clock out of pawn for Captain St. George—I did not see you on that occasion—I saw you hand him money—you told me the next day he would want me to go with him to fetch the clock back—Fairer said if I did not make a clean breast of it he would put me in the dock—I did not see goods come to Regent Street that were not wanted for furnishing the place—you received a picture from 326, Regent Street—you sent for Mr. Maxstead to fetch it back—he said he would see you—you told him you could not afford to speculate even on credit—Loban and A. Fulton borrowed money of you, also St. George—when you spoke of the things being removed you told me you were afraid of a seizure under a bill of sale.</p>

               <p>Street, Whitechapel—on 6th December, about 12.80 in the morning, I was going along Cable Street, just as I came from the Sailors' Home—as I was turning the corner of the street I saw the prisoner and four others—as I passed him he struck me on the side of the head—I turned round to ask why he did it, and I was struck a second time by another—I then pulled of my belt to defend myself, and the prisoner took hold of me and whistled; then came up another, who said "Give me a hand, old party"—he took hold of my hand and struck me, and 1 struck him with the belt—he said "You black b—, you have no right here"—three others then came up, knocked me down, and kicked me violently on the ground—I bled from the ear and a kick in the forehead—nearly all of them kicked me; the prisoner was the last man that did it—they tore both my trousers pockets down; I had nothing in them, but I had Borne money iu my breast pocket—I called out for assistance and the police came, and they all ran away except the prisoner; he was taken—I had given him no provocation—I was a little in liquor, but I had my senses.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of my son Santo Arrigoni, of 15, Bed Lion Street, Clerkenwell—on 28th December I made up five cases containing 300 looking-glasses, my son's property; the stands were packed separate from the glasses two and two, and the glasses half a dozen in each parcel; they were put in zinc-lined cases for shipment to Columbo—they were sent by Tripp's van, which was driven by Newman; next day I heard of their loss, and informed the police on 15th November this year—I went with the police to Hoxton Street, about 8 p.m., and saw ten toilette-glasses there, six of which were complete, and four incom<lb/>plete—these are they, and the police showed me 180 more glasses next day, without the pillars and stands—they were of different sizes—I have looked carefully through them, and find they are my son's property—some have drawers and some are without—I know nothing of the prisoner—these sort of glasses (<hi rend="italic">Selecting some</hi>) are only made to order, but these others are kept in stock.</p>

On 15th of last month I went with a search-warrant to 109, Hoxton Street, with Mr. Arragoni and Inspector Field and Sergeant Foster; the name of Garnham was over the door; the prisoner was at the door—I said, "Mr. Garnham?" he said, "Yes;" I said, "I am an inspector of police, this is also a brother inspector," pointing to inspector Field, "and this is Sergeant Foster; I hold a warrant to search your premises, as you are suspected of having a quantity of looking-glasses in your possession, which were stolen some mouths ago;" he said, "Oh, indeed!"—we went into the parlour; there were two large chimney glasses standing on the floor, and he said, "Are these what you want?" I said, "No, have you any others?" he said, "Yes, I have over 100 hangers-up down at Stratford;" I said, "That is the sort we want to see, where are they? at Stratford?"—he said, "I don't mean Stratford, I mean near Loughton"—I said, "Where are they at Loughton?" he said, "At Sydney House, I had a sale there"—I sent Sergeant Foster with the prisoner to search the house, and when he came down he said, "I expect some glasses here presently from Sydney House, as I had a sale there; I am having them brought home to-day; Mr. Blisset's van went away at 10.30 to fetch them this morning, and they ought to have arrived; "I then left, leaving Foster there"—I returned about 8 p.m., and saw a large van loaded with furniture drawn up in a street close to the house, and ultimately it was drawn up at the shop door—I saw it unloaded and a crate containing ten toilette glasses was carried into the shop—I went into the furniture shop and Mr. Arrigoni identified them—I said "This is the owner of the glasses, and they are stolen property, how do you account for them?"—he said "I bought them nine months ago, I think, at a sale"—I said "Have you any catalogue or invoice relating to them?"—he said "No, I cannot say where I bought them"—I said "I understood from you just now that you had a lot at Loughton, and they were coming up by a van to-day"—he then called in one of the men who came with the van and asked him if he had left any glasses behind at Loughton—he said "No, we brought them all up"—he said "Well, they must be stolen, then, I suppose, the same as my fowls; if you go there you will find I have lost a lot of poultry"—I said "Am I to understand these are all the glasses you have?"—he said "Yes, the others must be stolen"—he was then taken to the station and charged—while waiting to go before the Magistrate next morning he said "I cannot tell at all where I bought these glasses; I sent them down to be put in a sale in Sydney House, but did not sell them; I wish I could remember where I got them"—after he was remanded something came to my knowledge, and I went with Field to him in the gaoler's passage, and Field said "Me and Inspector Aberline are going to make a further search of your premises; we are told that you have some further premises at the back of your shop, and we are told you have some other property there"—he said "It is quite right, I have some more glasses there"—we went to the same place and asked the prisoner's wife for the key of the premises at the back—she spoke to a boy who got the key from behind the counter and gave it to me—I went through a passage into the back room and into a small yard about the size of that dock with a door leading through the hoarding to some place behind, which was a large</p>

I am one of the firm of John Stephens and Sons, of Shoreditch, and have been in the looking glass trade about 18 years—it is not unusual for looking-glass backs to be put on like these square ones without any other piece of wood—these tacks are ordinary military brads, which you can buy at any ironmonger's—there is nothing about this looking-glass which would enable any mortal being to recog<lb/>nise it as his—it is the commonest kind sold unless you have thin glass—the wood is flat on the glass—we do them any way, according to the time we have—if a maker has not time he abstains from putting the wood in—there is nothing unusual in putting paper between the board and the glass—I have been in the habit of doing it for 18 years—there is nothing about the polish of these glasses which would enable anybody to identify them—they are the same as most cheap goods are polished—they are worth about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen wholesale—I have made some gross of these arched top ones, and any number are to be found in other places—as to these swing glasses, there is nothing peculiar in these little pieces of wood glued in—unless we have plenty of time we do not put any tacks or brads in; we leave them till they are dry.</p>

I am a practical looking-glass maker, and have been 45 years in the trade—I have had men in my service 29 years—there is nothing to enable any one to identify these glasses, either the square, round, or long ones—I generally give out half a gross of these at a time to make, and six gross of the square ones—it is impossible to identify them by the polish or by the French brads—millions of them are used—I t is not unusual to glue these little pieces of wood in; I have glued hundreds of thousands in this way; when we have had a shipping order we do not put any tacks, to save expense—there is nothing peculiar in having this piece of paper fiat on the glass, it is done for quickness; I have been in the habit of doing it for 45 years, and my men around me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made some grosses of these with the arched top, and some not three months ago, but I never made any so small as these; but if I made two dozen with arched tops to order I could not swear to them afterwards—if out of 300 glasses I had 200 stolen, and saw 200 for shipment of different sizes and quality and description, I should have a difficulty in identifying them.</p>

               <p>years in our service, and gave us the whole of his services—on 15th November I said to him "Will you come and meet me this evening, and go through our accounts?" he did so, and made out a list of all the customers on whom he used to call, and pointed out to me the amounts he had received and not paid into the office and the amounts still owing by customers—there were over 160 accounts altogether, and it was 167<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he admitted—he ought to have paid those moneys to me the next or the second day after receiving them—among other amounts he admitted receiving 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Maidment, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Ham<lb/>mond, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the North Kent Brewery—he had no authority to retain those sums—these three invoices are his writing—it was not his duty to make them out; we keep an invoice clerk for the purpose.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have been in business three years—we took the place of a coal merchant, Mr. James Kirk, and he took it from Mr. Gibson—the prisoner had been in Mr. Winter's service for several years, and I went into partnership with Mr. Winter, who took the business of a Mr. Hodgson—Mr. Kirk went into partnership with Mr. Winter, and the prisoner was in his service when I joined it—we gave him 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then, and afterwards 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had not to go all round the country, collecting orders, only in Woolwich, Plumstead, Lee, and the neighbour<lb/>hood—we send out coals three miles round Woolwich, and sometimes four or five miles—when a man receives no wages we give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ton commission—the prisoner has brought in orders for 30 or 35 tons a week, but not 50 or 60; he may occasionally have done 40—our business has increased in the last few years, but not through Lovell—we have 12 horses now; there were, five in the business which I bought—the prisoner got a great many orders from publicans, but not through them—he was not a good salesman; we kept him on in our employ solely because he had a certain connection, if we had not he would very likely have taken the connection from us—there never have been any deficiencies—I never found his accounts wrong till Tuesday, 15th November—he was given in custody next day, Wednesday—I have not obtained money from his friends for other deficiencies—I don't know whether Mr. Winter has; I have not been told so—I never heard of anything which happened before I came into the firm—I heard nothing till after he was committed for trial about his paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to Mr. Hodgson—I never heard it from Winter at all, but I did from somebody else—I never heard of his paying back sums which he was deficient in—I did not know till Mr. Buchanan told me that he lent him 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put matters all right—I did not say to Mr. Smith and Mr. Edmonds that my partner, Mr. Winter, had called on Mr. Buchanan, and asked him for a cheque for the money—Mr. Winter called upon Mr. Buchanan to hear where Lovell was, as he was going to arrest him, but what passed I do not know—I knew that Mr. Winter was going there, but not what he was going to say—the accounts occupied us on 15th November from 6 o'clock to 9.30, and Lovell was given in custody next afternoon, after Mr. Winter came back from Mr. Buchanan's—I do not recollect that I saw Mr. Winter in the interval, and I am not certain whether he told me the result of the interview—the prisoner not only got the order for 20 or 30 tons of coal, but he also collected the money—we have no collector, but we pay 5 per cent, to a debt-collector to recover in Court—it was the prisoner's business to collect the money without commission—I</p>

I hope he will employ some of that 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go through his accounts and rectify them"—Mr. Gilles came down to the office to pay for some coals—I did not say when I went to Mr. Buchanan "You may as well pay this money, you can leave a little less money to your niece."</p>

I am a retired solicitor, and live at Ripon Road, Shooter's Hill—I am half-uncle to the prisoner's wife—on 16th November, about 10 a.m., Mr. Winter called on me and produced a long list, and said "Here is Lovell in it again"—I said "What is that, sir?"—he said "Why, he owes all these sums of money"—I said "How much is the amount?"—he said "I think it is 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; you can put it to rights if you give me a cheque, because you can give your niece so much less when you die; my partner hands this list to me and says if I don't bring back a cheque for the amount he shall give him in custody "—I said "That is the best plan for him"—we had considerable conversa<lb/>tion, and I said "If we collect 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it will that be of any use? "—he said "No, my partner is determined to give him in custody unless I bring back a cheque"—I said "Then I won't give it"—about six days after that, during the remand, both the partners called on me; Mr. Winter went out of the room for a moment, and while he was away Mr. Rhtz said "You can make it all right by leaving your niece so much; less"—I said "I shall do nothing of the kind; I shall have nothing to do with it"—Winter then came in and said "I will take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "It is no use; I won't give a farthing"—he said "No, and I won't take it if you do; I will have all the money"—it was said that the prisoner was to give a bond not to go over the same ground which he was in the habit of working for his masters, and I said "I shall persuade him to do that"—that proposal was not made by way of a joke; it was spoken very seriously indeed—I always gave the prisoner my orders—about three years ago Mr. Winter called on me in the same way; it turned out that Lovell was a defaulter for about 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Winter asked me to pay it, and I refused, but after some days I handed over 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the wife, and Lovell paid the remainder at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and his wife paid up to a fortnight age 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to Mr. Winter.</p>

"I have known of it for some time, in fact previous to last May, that Lovell was coming into a legacy of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I thought he would make up the defalcations with that amount, which, however, has not been done," but he was not asked that question by Mr. Edmunds, he volunteered it; the question Mr. Edmunds asked was "Did your brother traveller Martin know it?"—he said "Yes, and cautioned him, which caused Lovell to shed tears"—in conclusion he said that he was very sorry for Mr. Lovell, and had the money been paid that morning he would not have been arrested—next morning, 17th November, about 11 o'clock, I saw Mr. Edmonds, Mr. John James, and Mr. Winter coming from the station towards the wharf, and Mr. James asked Mr. Winter for a remand to see what could be done—Winter said "Why the devil did not Mr. Burns pay the money yesterday, and then it would be all settled?" or words to that effect.</p>

Bonner" on it—Pedder was in the cart—he was trying to deface some pots by dashing them together—I watched him—he got out of the cart and walked into Mr. Dignam's shop, taking the nine pots with him—he remained in the shop about five minutes with the pots—he went to another dealer's, a general shop, and remained there about five minutes—he did not have the pots when he came out of this shop—he then went round the corner and jumped up in the cart—I went and spoke to a constable—the cart was about 20 yards from me when it first attracted my notice—I was near enough to have a good view of his face—I am certain he is the man.</p>

My parents keep a sweet and tobacco shop, 97, Stewart Road—on 10th November the prisoner came in with a boy named Banks, asked for a pennyworth of tobacco, and gave me a bad half-crown—I took the tobacco back, and called my mother—the prisoner then said that it was not bad, but he would take it back to those who gave it to him—Banks gave me a penny for the tobabco, and they left—I followed them, and in the street I spoke to a constable—on the Wednesday week afterwards I picked the prisoner out at the station from five or sis others, and on the 18th I identified Banks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I know the man by sight that you bought the cheques of; he was called "Uncle," but I believe his proper name was Young—I had the cheques in my hand, but I gave them up at once—I did not offer money for them—I did not say I would buy them, but I had got no money—I did not buy three of the cheques—I live on a little property I have got—I do not spend my time in the Plough and Harrow—a man named Baker in the Plough and Harrow asked me if I was aware you had passed a cheque on the manager of the Horse and Groom, and I said "Certainly not; I should not think he would do such a thing," and I said "By-the-bye I saw him buy some cheques in here one morning"—I remember you had a fall out with the manager, who refused to serve you—he was annoyed because you asked him for credit—I never said in the Plough and Harrow that I would bring you to ruin, and make your wife come to me for a bit of bread on account of your falling out with the man in the Plough and Harrow, and because your wife would not have anything to say to me.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner—I read the warrant to him—he said he knew nothing at all about it; it was a mistake—at the station I searched him, and found a cheque similar to this one—he said he was surprised at the prosecutor taking the steps he had taken.</p>
