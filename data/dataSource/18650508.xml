I am a gardener, living at Spring-hill, Upper Clapton—on 6th April I was going to my work at five minutes to six in the morning—I had to pass by St. Thomas' Church and I saw three men come out at Mr. Kingsford's side door, he is the incumbent, his house is next to the church—the two prisoners are two of the men—I recognised Burnett as the first man who came out—I recognised him at Clerkenwell on the 10th, he was with about fourteen others and I picked him out, the other prisoner was also there—I picked him out, I knew him in a moment by the mole on the side of his face—he was standing alone, and I was told to go and look at him to see whether he was the person—they had no bundles with them, but they were bulky round the waist.</p>

The reason I am unable to call a witness is, that my sister was nurse to an invalid lady, and the very morning this happened she was sent away into the country with this lady, and I don't know where she has gone to.

I live at 7, Horford-street, Mile-end.—I am a foreman at the London Docks—I know Hoffman—on 10th April he was driving a van belonging to Messrs. Jones and Candler—he brought it to the docks for a, load of tea—another van of theirs came at the same time—the whole con<lb/>signment was 300 packages of tea—I delivered them myself—I checked every one of them—150 were delivered into his van and 150 into the other van—Hoffman helped to load the van—he was on the box part of the time, not the whole of the time—he had a man assisting him—the other man took in some of the tea—I have not seen that man since—the chests were all ad<lb/>dressed to Her Majesty's Customs, Belfast, F. G. and Co., (Foster, Green and Co.) there was a van of Pickford's there at the time—I gave Pickford's some goods as well—in consequence of some information I received, I fol<lb/>lowed Hoffman in about five minutes—I saw the van drawn up at a public-house, Hoffman was at the horses' heads—I saw a man with a chest of tea on his back in the act of bringing it round the side of the van and he put it in an empty cart which Gauron was in—I did not see it come from the van—I did not see the man until he made his appearance round the van, the van hid him from my view—he was coming off the pavement round the van and then put it in the cart—the cart was drawn up I should think about a yard from the van, at the tail of it—I directly went over and examined it I recognised it as one of the 150 which I had put in Hoffman's van—I asked Gauron how he came by it and he said a man put it into the cart and wished him to take it to a certain place—I asked him what place and he said, "Up there," pointing up a turning opposite Sparrow-corner—he did not know where it was to go to, but the man was coming to let him know—he like-wise said that the man had told him to cover it over with a sack which he had in the cart, but he would not do that because he thought there might he something wrong—he had time to cover it over before I went up—I did not go up while the man was speaking to him—the man put it in the van without saying a word—I did not make myself known to Hoffman—I told Gauron he had better bring it with me which he did very willingly—I went with him to Messrs. Jones and Candler—we arrived there before Hoffman—when Hoffman came Mr. Candler asked him how it was that one of the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Crown-court, Portpool-lane—on the night of 20th April, I was at the Coach and Horses in Eyre-street-hill—Mrs. Silman was there—Mr. Silman was outside—I saw the prisoner—she pushed open the front door, and rushed up to the bar, and made a blow at Mrs. Silman—I put up my hand to protect her, and got my finger cut—Mrs. Silman was behind the bar—she is the landlady—she was standing up with her elbow on the counter—I did not see that the prisoner had a knife until I was cut—it cut three of my fingers—the blow was aimed towards Mrs. Silman's neck—there was a cry that she had got a knife—Mr. Silman came in and seized hold of the prisoner—I did not see what took place then—I had not seen her before that night—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a common penknife.</p>

I am landlady at the Coach and Horses—on the night in question I was at the counter when the prisoner came in about five minutes past 10—she came with a double handful of mud and threw it at Franks—she intended it to go over Franks—it went over another gentleman instead—she then ran away—she came back in about three-quarters of an hour—I was then on the private side of the counter, leaning on my elbow—the prisoner rushed up to the counter with her hand closed—I did not see</p>

               <p>that she had got anything in it—Mrs. Metcalfe was standing by the side of me, and she sent the prisoner's hand on one side—the knife was within a few inches of my neck—Mrs. Metcalfe caught hold of her hand, and the prisoner drew the knife between her fingers, and nearly cut three of them off—I saw the blood on her hand—my husband came in to catch hold of the prisoner, and she turned round and cut his little finger—after striking at me she stabbed Mr. Franks in the shoulder—she went deliberately up to him, as he sat in the seat—when my husband caught hold of her, she fell on the ground, and he held her until a policeman came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am landlord of the Coach and Horses—I was there on the night of 26th April when the prisoner threw this mud at Franks—I ran outside to see whether I could see her to give her in charge, but could not—I saw her again at ten minutes before 11; I was standing outside looking at my lamps, and saw the prisoner rush into my house hastily—I followed her in, and I heard Mrs. Metcalfe cry out, "She has got a knife, she has stabbed me"—I went towards her, but before I could reach her she stabbed Franks in the shoulder—I caught hold of her left hand, and in attempting to catch hold of her other hand she jobbed me deliberately on the hand with the knife—I secured her other hand, and in the scuffle we both went down, and she said to me, "I will put the knife in your b----belly"—I held her down till the knife was taken from her—this is the knife, it cut my knuckle down to the end; it was a very bad deep wound—I believe the prisoner had been drinking during the day, but she was sufficiently sober to know anything and do anything—she was sober at the time she came to my house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 110). On the morning of 11th April I was on duty in Stoke Newington—between a quarter and half-past 12, I saw the prisoner and another man in a narrow lane at the back of St. Matthias Church—I hid and watched them, but had not an opportunity of seeing them—I came out again and saw them come down off a wall at the back of the church, and hide under the hedge—about five minutes afterwards they came down very silently, watching and listening, trying to find where I was hiding—I then walked out and met them, and asked them what they were doing at the back of the church—the other man had a pair of these carpet <hi rend="italic">mufflers</hi> in his hand—I said, "What are these," and he said, "That is what they are," giving me a push, "go about your business"—I laid hold of him, he had some heavy lumber about him, up his waist-coat—I then asked him where they lived, and he said, "At the back of Shoreditch Church"—I said, "You have no business at the back of this church then, I must take you to the station"—they said, "Come on then," and I made a grab at them—I was in the act of taking hold of them when I received a frightful blow on the top of the head from the prisoner—I looked round, it was a very bright night, and then saw that he had this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand—he struck at me again; I received altogether about three blows on the head, the last one knocked me down on my face, and he then struck me with something under the shoulder when I was down—I asked him not to murder me, because I had got nothing to protect myself—he said that he would, and swore something or other, after striking me again he ran off up the lane; I was nearly blinded with blood—I followed him up this lane—when he found I was after him, he turned into some fields—I followed him over some hedges till he came to a low wall, which he attempted to get over—I caught hold of him, and he struck at me with this jemmy again—I closed with him, caught hold of his hands, and after a desperate struggle succeeded in getting the jemmy out of his hands—he then made a rush at me, drove his head between my legs and tried to throw me on my back—I then hit him with the jemmy on the head, and he said that he would give in, I had basted him—I asked him to come to the station, but he swore he would not go a foot—all this time he kept calling out for "Bill," his companion—I was then in the act of taking out my rattle, and I threatened to blow his brains out if he stirred—he said he would not stir and I sprang my rattle—the fire-engine keeper and <hi rend="italic">N</hi> 144, came up—I have been confined to my room a month to day, and was in bed three weeks of that time—I still suffer very much in my head—this other jimmy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found where the first struggle took place.</p>

I live at Victoria Villas, Stoke Newington—on the morning of 11th April I was called to attend Conway—he had a very severe angular wound on the forehead, which might have been inflicted by one blow or two; it penetrated to the bone, through all the membranes and scalp, laying open the bone; he had another deep wound on the head, penetrating to the bone—he was covered with blood, and appeared in a very excited state—I have attended him ever since; he was in danger during the first two or three weeks, I consider—I found no external marks of violence on his shoulder—the wounds could have been inflicted by this jemmy; I measured them carefully, and found they adapted themselves to it; the nobbed end seems to be the end with which the wounds on the head were inflicted; his finger was also cut to the bone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 4, Heneage-street, Spitalfields—I know all the prisoner by sight—I do not know Green by name—I have known Pope three or four years by his calling at warehouses which I cart for in the City to collect bags and empty hogsheads—he used to call at Hazeldine's—in 1862, he told me that a party he was in the habit of buying hogsheads and packages of at King's-cross or Pentonville, had been in the habit of having suger from Brewer's Quay, and a party named Boreham had been in the habit of carting it for them, but had disappointed them two or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080030"/>
               <p>three times, and a party asked him if he knew any one who could cart some, and he thought of me—he asked me if I could do so—I said, "Yes,"and asked where the things were going to—he said "To Pentonville, what time will you have a cart ready to go?"—I said, "In about an hour or an hour and a half"—I asked for the delivery-order—he said that if I would have cart then, he would send a party to go with me to the wharf—I do not know whether he took the note with him, or whether it had been lodged previously—this was at about 9.30 in the morning—Maile, who was a perfect stranger to me, afterwards came—he said that he came from Pope about the cart to go to Brewers' Quay—nothing was said about a delivery-order—I went with the cart and Maile—I have been in the habit of fetching goods from these quays—it is usual to take a delivery-order from the owner of the sugar, and to get it marked in the office, and take it up to the foreman, and then a cart-note issues—we get a weight-note at the place where they are consigned to—we leave the order with the man who delivers the goods—I take the cart note to my employer—here is an entry in my book, "April 22d, 1862, thirty loaves from Brewers' Quay to Pentonville, three shillings cartage"—that was to a person named Child—Maile went down on the wharf and soon afterwards they shouted out, "Bowen, Bowen, what do you want?"—I said, "I believe there are some sugars"—they said, "It is under here"—I drew my cart under the loop-hole, and thirty loaves of sugar were lowered into it—I got this cart note (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is so long ago I cannot say who gave it to mo, but I know it is the note, because the name is on it—I know the faces of all the pri<lb/>soners, but I cannot recognise either of them as having seen him at the warehouse, as I cart for so many people—I had to take the note into Phillips' warehouse, and give it to him, and he gives it to the other foreman to deliver—the cart-notes are always delivered after the goods are delivered into the cart by the foreman—Moule went home after the sugar was in the cart—he told me to take them to York-road, eight doors round by King's-cross, leading up to Battle-bridge, and Pope told me so also—I had a little bit of a note to take them to Mr. Child, at a confectioner's shop—I carted the thirty loaves of sugar there, delivered them to Mr. Child, and received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cartage from him—I put this note on my file, and afterwards found it there—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Brewers' Quay, Mr. Child, received 30 <hi rend="italic">los.</hi> sugar, <hi rend="italic">ex.</hi> Diana, 4c. 3q. 20 lbs. cart Bowen.—Joseph Barber &amp; Co.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Carew Hunt, and Thomas Turn<lb/>bull, the prosecutors—they trade under the name of Joseph Barber and Co., as wharfingers, at Brewers'-quay, and among other things store refined sugars—Phillips was in their employ up to about November last as warehouse-foreman—his duties were the general supervision of the warehouse—it was called Phillips' warehouse—Green was under foreman, assistant foreman, and was employed in the same warehouse—Pope and Maile are not con<lb/>nected with our place—if a merchant requires 50 loaves of sugar, he sends a delivery-order for them the form of which varies—if anybody applies for blank orders we supply them; if not, they write on blank paper—it is first taken by the carman, or the person applying for the delivery of the goods to the counting-house at Brewer's-quay—I know the routine, but the head clerk can give it to you as well or better than I can—the clerk signs or initials the delivery-order—he already has an entry of it—he has 1000 loaves of sugar on one side, and on the other he shows how it is dis<lb/>posed of—he takes that from the delivery—order after the goods are delivered—no entry is taken of it till it passes to the carman—it is given up in ex<lb/>change for the goods by the foreman—supposing the delivery to have taken place at Phillips' warehouse, the order would be returned to the counting-house by the foreman next morning, and written off—the order is copied by the foreman into this book at the time of the delivery of the sugar into the warehouse—the book is kept in the warehouse—Green's writing appears in the books at that time, as keeping them under Phillips' superintendence—I have here the original book, into which the order was copied, and sent into the counting-house with the delivery-orders—the order would then be marked off—we credit the prosecutors, and debit the customers—when the order is marked in the counting-house, the foreman takes it to the person who deli<lb/>vered the goods, and a cart-note would be given—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the counterfoils—the foreman would give the delivery-order to another foreman, or to anybody who was disengaged—Green appears to have written most of the counterfoils; he was the delivery foreman—in the ordinary course the counterfoil would show what was the substance of the cart-note—it would be very irregular to give a cart-note without entering the particulars on the counterfoil—this which has been produced by Bowen, bears Green's signature, and I believe the whole of it is his—I can find no record in the delivery-book of any order of 22d April, 1862, to Child or Pope, of 30 loaves of sugar, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Diana, to Bowen's cart, but this is the cart-note; it is in Green's writing, on one of our forms—this is not the first occasion I have looked for it—you will see at the end of this book that some counterfoils are blank, though the cart-notes are gone—we do not number them—I have looked in the place where the delivery-orders of that date are kept, but cannot find one applicable to this transaction—I have looked at 9th September, 1862, and the same answer applies—there is no trace of the transaction, nor of 4 barrels on 2d October—a very considerable quantity, 24 tons, of loaves of sugar has been missed from the warehouse.</p>

               <p>in Phillips' warehouse—there was that quantity, on an average, all the year round, with the exception of last year—it is all foreign sugar—Phillips was perhaps fifteen or twenty years foreman; he has been in the employment thirty years, I think—he was discharged about last October—he was re<lb/>manded ten times—he was tried here in February on part of the charges, and acquitted—he was afterwards arrested at his home on a new charge, not on this charge—he was not supposed to keep the books; he sometimes gave cart-notes—he had a general superintendence—he knew what orders went into the establishment—he was supposed to take all delivery-orders, and see them executed—he would give them to the delivery foreman, or the other foreman, Green.</p>

F." is James Foley's writing; he is a sort of assistant man—"W. F. C." is another assistant on a press; his name is Cave—other people besides Phillips, Green, and Holman wrote counterfoils of cart-notes—this book has the appearance of having bad some counterfoils torn out on 22d April, 1862, and the back is broken or torn—the counterfoil of this cart-note might be torn out on 22d April—the counterfoils both before and after this are dated 22d April—the number of leaves in the books is very irregular—Green had charge of the sugar-floor under Phillips; he was justified in obeying Phillips if he had the delivery-order, and if he saw the goods laden himself—not without, and if he saw the goods delivered he would naturally do it without being told—he has been in the service, I think, seven or eight years—I have been there twelve or thirteen years—there are fifteen or twenty clerks in the counting-house, but it is divided into departments—one clerk principally takes the sugar-books; he is assisted sometimes, if we are pressed—I attended the whole of the re<lb/>mands at the Mansion-house—Pope was first given in custody, and was put into the witness-box—the men were acquitted, but not on the whole of the charges, and then Pope was given in custody again.</p>

               <p>your learned friend suggested that it was the privilege of the workmen to take them, but that is matter of opinion—it was Phillips' duty as superin<lb/>endent to see that no loaves went out without a delivery-order, and if he found it was being done to stop it, and call the attention of his principals to the fact—Phillips and Green have been there some time; they bore high characters, and my employers had great confidence in them.</p>

I am a starch-manufacturer, of Ludgate-hill—the prisoner was my traveller to obtain orders on commission—I knew him as George Phillips—I had some watchmaker's and jeweller's stock in my hands, and on 15th or 16th August, the prisoner said that Mr. Oliff, of the Star and Garter hotel, Copenhagen-street, was in want of a barometer, such as I had to sell—I permitted him to take one to show Mr. Oliff—he said next day that the barometer requited adjusting, which would cost one shilling, and Mr. Oliff would then take it and pay for it—the price was twenty-five shillings—I have never received the barometer or the money—a day or two previous to 19th August, the prisoner said that Mr. Watson, of the Cranbourne Hotel, St. Martin's-lane, wanted to purchase a gold watch, such as I had to sell, to present to his daughter, who was going to be married, and was content to pay the price I fixed upon, ten guineas, if it suited him—I took the precaution of seeing that there was such a person before parting with it, and went and saw Mr. Watson's name over the door, so on 19th August I entrusted the prisoner with the watch to take to Mr. Watson—he was to return it or the money the same evening—I should not have parted with it if he had not told me that—I never saw it again, and never saw the prisoner till 22d April, when I gave him in custody.</p>

There is a difference of two miles between Copenhagen-street and Caledonian-road. The fact is, Mr. Crawley wanted a writ served, and I served it, which occupied me two days and a night, and I have never been paid. He also employed me to get rid of some shares, and for that I have never been paid. He told me he had several watches, chains, and rings to dispose of, and asked me to find him a purchaser.

A gentleman in Mr. Watson's bar wanted a watch and chain like one which Mrs. Walker had, which I had sold her. I took the watch to him and showed it to him, and when I returned to Mr. Crawley's the place was closed; and wishing to make myself smart, I put it on, got drunk, and was robbed of it, and of a purse containing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got locked up in Clerkenwell station-house. I was so bad in the night, that I was obliged to be taken to the hospital through delirium tremens, and was discharged by the Magistrate next morning.

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of Thurloe-place, Brompton—I was called on to inspect the body of this child at the Mount-street workhouse on 21st April—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 25th—I was quite unable to form an opinion of the cause of death—the appearances were consistent with death by suffocation or drowning, what was the actual cause I cannot say—it was quite bloodless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>there was no blood to be congested, the lungs were as white as paper—I ex<lb/>amined the brain—in ordinary cases of drowning the vessels of the brain are full of blood—the stomach in this case was perfectly empty—I should not expect to find water there, it is not the rule—I did not find any one of those symptoms which are generally to be observed in a case of drowning—there was no external injury of any kind.</p>

I am a cowkeeper, of Green-bank, St. George's—I was in the cart with the prisoner—I had sold the horse to him, that he was driving, on the Wednesday, as this happened on the Friday—we started that day from King-street, St. George's—we went at a very gentle pace till we came in the Mile-end-road—a little before we came to the railway the mare seemed a little bit startled, and the prisoner twisted the reins round his hand, and put his feet against the front of the board to hold her in—we were not racing with any other persons—there were two other carts coming down the road, and they startled the mare—I did not hear the prisoner say, "Come on," to any one in the other carts—I saw the child about five or six yards before it was knocked down—at that time the prisoner was holding in the mare as hard as he could—as soon as he saw the child he called to it—the child seemed to run across much as usual, and in the middle it made a bit of a stop—no sooner did the hone knock the child down than the prisoner pulled</p>

               <p>up, within two yards of it—he had been trying to pull her in for some dis<lb/>tance; she is very hard in the mouth—this is the first time he had driven the mare, and he has never driven her since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you remember passing over the Globe-bridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was holding the mare hard in then—she never galloped—she first began to go fast when the other carts came up—she had been accustomed to the road, but not much—I had driven her—I have had her five years; from two years old—I did not take her out much—I had another one, which my <hi rend="italic">Misses</hi> liked to drive behind best, and I very rarely used this one; sometimes she did not go out of the stable for months—I have three horses; one heavy one and two light ones—the mare did not quicken her pace after passing over the Globe-bridge—she was going about ten miles an hour, not more—she went faster when she got by the railway-railway-bridge bridge, because the two carts startled her more—he did not pull up near the—I swear that he did not slacken her pace; he could not, she would not stop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 11 King's Bench-walk, Temple—about four weeks before 11th April, I met the prisoner—he came up to me in St. Martin's-lane, and said, "I hope you are quite well, Mr. Parsons"—I replied, "You have the advantage of me, I have not the pleasure of knowing</p>

               <p>you"—he said, "I have met you several times some years back,"and he named several parties whose names I knew—he said, "I can get you plenty of business, where are your offices?"—I gave him my card, saying that I had recently taken offices, and I could not see him in them for a day or two, as they were unfurnished—he said, "I can get you plenty of furni<lb/>ture, I am an agent for Messrs. Atkinson, and get furniture for parties from their warehouse"—I told him what furniture I required, and on Monday, 10th April, I saw it at my office—it consisted of a table, an easy chair, three mahogany chairs, a what-not, a wash-stand, a rug and a carpet—I missed those things on Saturday the 15th.</p>

               <p>I obtained the process of the Court—the prisoner then petitioned for pro<lb/>tection—I believe he was acting under the advice of a great many different solicitors or clerks—I don't know under whose advice he was acting when these affidavits were filed—I knew nothing of him until these proceedings were taken—I am not aware that he was acting under the advice and direction of Leek—I know the person you allude to—I know that Leek was taken to the police-court when criminal proceedings were originally instituted—he came to my office in the first instance—I placed the matter in the hands of Messrs. Humphreys and Morgan—the prisoner has never given us any account of his assets—we have had no information of any kind—the assets I have in hand as solicitor for the assignee is a sum of 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., handed over by Mr. Prevost, the auctioneer—at the prisoner's request, a sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in the hands of Cutten and Davis, seized about a week ago—the debts proved amount to about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since the bankruptcy—I do not know that all the other debts nave been satisfied—I only know from the information of Mr. Solomon, the prisoner's solicitor, that they have been either satisfied or compounded for.</p>

               <p>they both said that I had better leave my place as soon as I could—the pri<lb/>soner came to my place next day and asked me how much I wanted for the job, I said that I did not know, he said "The banker, Mr. Spielman, was to take 500 for the job, but 1 suppose if you have half that it will be enough," said, "Oh, yes"—the same day the Count came to me at New Bond-street, and asked me if I could lend him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I could not but I gave him 10., the prisoner was not present—next day I saw the Count at St. James's hotel, and he asked me to leave my place and go to him next day at St. James's hotel and I did so—the prisoner was there with him—the Count said, "I am not ready yet, but I will try and prepare all my papers for you to go to Russia"—next day he asked me for more money and I think I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the prisoner's presence, who said, "It is quite right, you are very lucky that my master trusts you for 12,000, he is a regular gentleman and he will pay you everything," he told me that three or four times—after that the Count asked me for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said I cannot give it to you—the prisoner swore at me, and said, "How is it that you do not be<lb/>lieve my master when he shows you the document which is right enough"—I lent him altogether about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked the prisoner for it three or four times and he said, "It is quite safe enough, do not you trouble yourself at all."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I introduced to you by a M.

Foking, not as Count de Medoc—I went to a Casino with Foking and drank champagne there, he asked me to treat him—I did not give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the landlady, nor did I see the receipt—you asked me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to send to your wife in France and I lent it to you on the security of a ticket of your watch which M.

I let apartments at 22, Brompton-square—about the end of January the prisoner came there with a person calling himself Foking, they stayed about twelve weeks—the prisoner told me that Foking rode with the Emperor in Russia, and that his wife was Countess Demidoff in her own right—they were recommended to me by a respectable tradesman and came as master and servant, but they did not appear so at all, they lived together, ate together, went out together, and came home together, and if they were out all night they were out together, and they lived very disre<lb/>putable lives—the prisoner said that his master was very rich and had plenty of money, and Mr. Spielman was his banker in England—I was not paid my rent or anything else.</p>

Foking and his children, and governess and lady's-maid, he owed me a thousand francs for a year's service and gave me this bill instead, he sent away his family and came to London with me. He made the acquaintance of M. Dennison, a chemist, who advanced him money, M. Dennison said that he knew a Russian valet who had about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own who would, no doubt, advance some money to another Russian. My master said that if he was a respectable man he would send him to Russia with some documents to deposit at the bankers there. M. Dennison took me to Rosenoff, who afterwards saw Foking, they spoke Russian together, but there was no mention of Demidof—I have three wit<lb/>nesses to prove that Rosenoff has said that Dennison was the cause of his lending the money to the Count. I was only paid 18 francs altogether, and had to pawn ray clothes to send money to my children; Foking has gone away leaving me entirely destitute—he owes me 1,600 francs.</p>

I live at 14, Lamb's-gardens and was a carman's driver—about 1863 I was carman to Mr. John Coles a carman, of 22, John-street, Crutched-friars—I was about two years in his service—I don't re<lb/>member exactly when I left—it was part of my duty to deliver goods, I have occasionally delivered sugars at Ivermee's; he keeps a grocer's shop in the Caledonian-road, Islington—they were loaves of sugar, I brought them from Brewere'-quay—I saw Phillips there when I went, and told him I wanted some loaves for Mr. Ivermee, he said, "We will attend on you directly"—he sent me upstairs and I gave the order into a little window, at least I went up to a little window where they give the orders in, I had no order, I received a cart-note with the loaves, they always send the cart-note down with the loaves, from Brewers'-quay I went to Mr. Cole's office and he wrote me out one of our cart-notes to take with me to Mr. Ivermee's, it was a similar one to this—I can't read it myself, I can't remember the quantity</p>

               <p>I took, it was a good lot, somewhere about 20 cwt. I think—the cart-note was a little square piece of paper and I think it had some printed letters upon it—Ivermee signed the one my master gave me, and gave it me back—I then took it back to my master's, we have to give them all in at night—I can't say that I saw Green when I went to Brewers'-quay.</p>

DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you succeed Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Phillips was in the warehouse when I went into the service, twelve or thir<lb/>teen years ago—he has been about thirty years in the service, and about twenty a foreman—he did not leave till last October or November—there are five floors above the ground-floor in his warehouse—in 1863 and 1864 there were two warehouses with sugar stored in them, with five floors each—the sugars are generally in the first or second floors—on a press they are put on the other floors—in usual cases they deliver from one loophole—the first floor in Thames-street is the usual one, but in busy times they would be delivered from anywhere—the delivery-order would be given by the fore<lb/>man to the delivery-foreman—first it would be given by the carman to the foreman; it would be taken by the carman into the warehouse and given to the foreman, as a rule—a foreman might then deliver the goods himself, but as a rule he would give the order to the delivery-foreman of that floor; if lie was not there he would give it to a sort of assistant-foreman—Green was the delivery-foreman of the sugar floor at Phillips' warehouse—Phillips has been away a fortnight sometimes—I think the firm gave him a trifle last summer, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not think, as a rule, they would do it—there is a book kept by me, in which men sign when they arrive at the warehouse—I have not got it here—I do not think Phillips went away last year till the fall, when he was away a fortnight—he went on the sick-list as soon as he was discharged by our firm—I am secretary to the society—I cannot recol<lb/>lect if he went on the sick-list in May, I have so many members; the club books will tell—they are distinct from the business—he might have been on the list in May—I do not remember his being sent away to make up some cheese-accounts; there was some little bother about the cheese—in 1864 we had 4,324 tons of sugar in Phillips' warehouse; that was the whole quantity that went in—a quarter per cent is not allowed for waste—if the waste is nut more than 5 lbs. in the ton, the merchants do not charge for it—sometimes the losses are not one-eighth or one-sixteenth per cent.; if 5 lbs. per ton was the waste very often it would excite remark; the merchants would soon complain—the sugar is all loose in paper—it is carried from the ship to the warehouse by hand, and pitched up from hand to hand on to the floors—chips come off sometimes—sometimes a man will drop a loaf, and it will break—when we found the great loss we had sustained we took stock—it is not customary in cases like ours, where goods are in transit, to take stock—we take stock of foreign sugar every five years; that is for revenue purposes—Phillips was dismissed—he was taken into custody, and remanded ten times before the Lord Mayor—he was in Newgate all the time; he was tried here in February and acquitted—he was allowed to go out on his own recognizances in April—he was tried here again this Sessions, and again acquitted—this is the third trial—I have been a witness upon each occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What position do you occupy in this establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am out-door collecting clerk, and I have various other duties—Mr. Joseph Carew Hunt is the manager—lie is here—one of the delivery-order clerks is here—a man named Holman in Phillips' warehouse was the assistant foreman—his wages were 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Green had about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, and he got something for overtime—several men signed the delivery-orders—May and June, 1864, was a very busy time—the duty was altered, and the men in the sugar-houses were very much pressed with work—I have a general knowledge of the establishment—I don't know that the delivery-orders are lodged sometimes a day or two before—when a carman produces a delivery-order, it is marked in the counting-house, and given back to him—he then takes it into the warehouse and asks for the goods, or he may tell the foreman, "I lodge this order with you, and I will come for it to-morrow," perhaps, and that carman must present himself for those goods, and his cart must be identified with the delivery-order before the foreman would deliver the goods—the delivery-order might be delivered on 27th or 28th May, and the goods not go out till 30th; but that is exceptional.</p>

SEYMOUR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you keep a record of the number of those books that are out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We don't know the number of these cart-notes—these are the only ones we can find—we do not keep any record to check the number of books that go out and have them accounted for after<lb/>wards—it is not generally customary for a carman to sign the counterfoil; sometimes it is done—if there is any dispute, the wrong spelling of a name, or any little hitch, the carman will give a receipt on the back of the delivery-order—carmen don't sign for goods—I never saw a cart-note signed by a carman—I never heard of the counterfoil being signed by a carman, or his signing in a book—I can't say whether the carman is mistaken in that; there may have been some reason for his signing it—Phillips did not keep the books.</p>

               <p>in the book of Ivermee or Coles—Phillips was there on 7th June, and 12th July, 1862—there is no entry in the returns made by Phillips on either of those days, of either of these transactions, to Ivermee—in the aggregate the delivery orders would correspond with the entries in the delivery order-book—I believe this "Coles" to be Green's writing—the person delivering would copy the delivery-orders into the delivery-order-book—the book would be open at the warehouse, accessible to Phillips—he was head fore<lb/>man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did other persons make out these cart-notes besides Green? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes—they were made out by him in July, I 1862—I would not say that be made out all the cart-notes then, the majority of them—"J. F." is Foley, I suppose—if the goods were going by rail, the cart-notes would be made out to the carriers, to Chaplins, not to Coles—his was home trade—we assume they go to the caariers whose names appear, that is all we have—if two loaves were taken from one parcel, and three from another, they would not be missed—it would be impossible to miss them.</p>

               <p>delivery orders were brought to the warehouse, and proper entries made in the books—they ought to deliver 100 loaves of sugar in a quarter of an hour—of course it would depend a good deal upon how the sugar laid, how near it was to the loophole—it would be carried to the scale, weighed, and then handed down to the van.</p>

I am warehouse superintendent at Brewers'-quay—these five invoices are, to the best of my belief, in Green's writing except the receipts—in Phillips' absence it would be the deputy-foreman's duty to attend to the delivery of sugar; it is not my duty—the most floors occupied with sugar were three, but only two, to the best of my belief, before last year—they would examine the delivery-order book to see that the order and the book agreed, but if there was no delivery-order we should not know that any sugar had been taken away—its absence made everything else futile.</p>

I lent him a short time ago, to give a gentleman change for a florin"—he went over the bridge, and I went round my beat—at about a quarter to 2 I met him again in William-street, about 128 yards from the up and 320 from the down platform, walking towards his own home, away from the station—he had a portmanteau in his hand; I said, "Halloa, Dinan, what have you got there?"—he said, "I found this outside the railway-station, and am going to take it home till the morning"—I said, "You had better not do that, you had better come back to the station"—he hesitated for a moment or so, and then accompanied me back, and when within eighteen yards of the station door, on the down side, he put the portmanteau down and said, "That is where I found it, we will leave it there, and go and see the porter"—I said, "I will take charge of it now"—he said, "For Christ's sake, Radley, be a man, act square to me, let me take it home, and I will act square to you"—I took it up and said, "Dinan I will not, I will do my duty"—he pushed the door open, and walked in—there was no one in the station; he called out "Simper" but no, one answered—I called out, "Porter"—we then crossed over the bridge on the up side to the front office, calling out "Porter" several times; no one answered, and I said, "Come on, we will go down to the signal-box, and see if anyone is there;" we found Simper there; I said to him, "Do you know anything of this, "alluding to the portmanteau I had in my hand; he said, "Yes, it is all right, it belongs to a party at Shooter's Hill, and has to be delivered in the morning:" Dinan said, "Well, I found it outside the station:" I said, "Now, stop Dinan, tell the truth:" Simper said, "It is all right, I will show you where I left it about ten minutes or a quarter of an I hour before;" we then went to the bridge on the up side of the line where there was a large box standing, covered with white canvass with a red edging, just outside the cloak-room door, and Simper said, "That is were I left it, on the top of that box"—I said, "Well, I wish to see the station-master"—Simper said, "You will not see him to-night"—I said,—I shall see him before I leave here"—he said, "No, be d----d if you do;" I asked him where the station-master's room was, that I might call him, but he did not tell me; I said, "I shall not give up the property till I do see him"—Simper then seized the portmanteau and drove me into the ticket-office; we struggled four or five minutes; he got it out of my hand, and said, "You d—d scamp you are drunk, what business have you here"—they both then seized me, and I was bundled out at the front-door into the street—they closed the door and locked it, leaving me outside—I went to the police-station, and Serjeant Featherstone came back and called the station-master up, then we went down on the platform, and the station-master asked Simper about the portmanteau—Simper began telling him about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had borrowed of Dinan—the station-master asked him whether he knew Dinan, and what he did there at that time of night—he said that he did not know much of Dinan, and came then to meet a friend by the midnight train—the station-master went with me to Dinan's house, 4, Whit worth-place; we knocked at the door, Dinan put his head out at the bedroom window, and</p>

               <p>the station-master said, "About this portmanteau, what do you know of it"—he said, "All I know is I met the constable coming out of the station with it, and as there was no one there but me, he turned round, put it on me, and said that I stole it"—I took him to the station; I received the port<lb/>manteau from the station-master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dinan. Q.</hi> When I met you at the station did not I say, "Radley what have you got there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say "I have been knocking at that door some time, and cannot get any answer from porter or anybody else"—after I brought you back with the portmanteau and you had put it down and I had taken possession of it, you said "Simper must be there."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you meet Dinan with the port<lb/>manteau? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty minutes or a quarter to 2—I do not recollect that Simper asked to look at the address—the address is still on it—he appeared to know the portmanteau; he did not say, "It was left in my charge"—he said that it had been left there till the morning, and that it would be delivered in the morning—I kept it my hand; he asked me to deliver it up, but I said that I should not till I had seen the station-master—I do not recollect that he asked me more than once to let him have it—the sergeant pointed out where the station-master lived; Simper did not say "He lives there"—I was not much ruffled at being put out of the station; it was Simper who tried to take the portmanteau from me; Dinan stood close by—Simper seemed ruffled at my not giving it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Wool<lb/>wich—on 6th May I went by train, at 11 o'clock, from London Bridge to Woolwich—I had a large box covered with red edging, and this small portmanteau (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), belonging to my sister, who was with me—when we arrived at Woolwich a porter carried it for me, I having ordered a cab to be there, but the cab was not there, and the porter could not get me one, so I left the luggage at the station with him—I think it was Simper, bat cannot swear to him—next morning Simper came to my house with the box—he asked to see me, and said that the portmanteau had been stolen from the station the night before, by a thief, but that it was at the station-house and he could not get it till Monday afternoon, and he was afraid of getting into a scrape, as he bad left the luggage outside the cloak-room, instead of putting it inside.</p>

I am a porter at Woolwich Arsenal Station; on the night in question on the arrival of the 10. 50 train from Charing-Cross it was my duty to attend to the luggage-van; I took out a portmanteau and box covered with canvass; took them to the front office, where the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> said that he had ordered a cab, but there was no cab there, and I could not get one, so I left the portmauteau with the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi>, outside, and the prisoner Simper—I heard some communication between them that Simper should deliver the luggage in the morning—we brought it in through the office, and I assisted Simper to place it outside the cloak-room; that is inside the station on the bridge that leads from the down platform to the booking-office—it was not my business to put it into the cloak-room; Simper had the key of the cloak-room—I believe I last saw the portmanteau and box there about 1:2 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Simper charge of the key that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I won't say—the station door on the down side has a spring-look, which opens inside—there is a wall which runs at the side of the door on the down side, but nobody could get in at any of the windows by that; it if about 2 feet 6 or 3 feet high from the platform; anybody could get over it, but from the cab-stand it is much higher—a person could not get over within the company's premises, he could only get into the cab-yard outside the station—there is a wall on the other side of the cab-yard about four or five feet high—if anybody put his shoulder to the door with force it might be forced open, unless it was double bolted.</p>

I am station-master at Woolwich Arsenal—I let Dinan and Featherstone into my house that morning, and then went to the signal-box with two constables, and saw Simper there, that was about 3 o'clock—I asked him if he knew the man who the constable brought to the station just now, he said that he did not know much of him, his name was Dinan—I asked him what his business was at that time of the morning—he said that he had borrowed 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him to give a passenger change, who had come by the train, and had come to pay it, and that the portmanteau belonged to a gentleman at Shooter' a-hill, who had left it with a box to be delivered in the morning—I went with Featherstone to Dinan's house, knocked at the door, and when Dinan put his head out at the window, I said, "What about that portmanteau"—he said that he was going to the station for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he had lent Simper, and just before he got to the station he met the constable with the portmanteau, coming from the station—I said, "This is a very strange story ": he said, "Had I better come down?": I said, "Yes, you had," and we walked together to the police-station—I had left the station soon after 10 o'clock, I have an inspector there—Simper was night watchman, he comes on duty at 8 o'clock, and from 8 till the last passenger-train comes in, he is office-porter—the last tram arrives at 1 o'clock, it is then his duty to lock up the station, and then go down to the signal-box and take care of the switches.</p>

               <p>offered the prisoner a glass of beer—Bailey jumped up and said, "I helped pay for that and he shall not have any"—I said, "What is the reason?"—he said, "There is a reason, he shall not drink any of it"—the prisoner said, "Perhaps when this is out the landlord and I can have a pot together"—Bailey said, "I do not say muck about that"—when the beer was out, the prisoner and I sent for another pot, and while drinking it they kept falling out about the beer—the prisoner struck at Bailey and Bailey struck at him again, and caught him on the jaw and fell down in front of the bar, saying, "Oh, my jaw is broken, is there no one that will help me"—I said, "I will not have such a disturbance in my house"—Davis sat in a chair against the window and never interfered at all—the prisoner got up and took the poker to strike Bailey across the head—my wife caught hold of it and said, "I will have none of this work"—I took the poker from his hand and put it down—the prisoner and Bailey shook hands after that and drank to<lb/>gather, and said that they were very sorry for what had happened—Bailey went and sat against Davis who was asleep, and while there the prisoner stood out in the room and was talking a little to his wife, and went out and came back again and stood behind Davis, and I saw his hands come down two or three times sharp, and I saw the blood pour straight out of Davis's head—the three blows came across Bailey's head—I jumped up and said, "Good God, what is the matter?"—I saw Newman <hi rend="italic">map</hi> the poker out of the prisoner's hand—Bailey got up and was going to strike me, thinking I had done it, as I stood behind him—the prisoner was then just going out at the door—Bailey ran to the door and called him—they had a fight at the door—I shoved them both out of doors, they came in again and were fight<lb/>ing in the passage—my wife and I got between them and I got the prisoner into the room—he was drunk and could not walk without staggering—Bailey had had too much beer, but was not so much drunk as the prisoner, Davis was much the same, but he had not been in my house, he interfered with nobody—my wife washed and dressed Davis's head—a doctor was sent for; the prisoner remained in his room all night; he was backwards and forwards for a week afterwards—Davis went to work two days afterwards—he was taken to the hospital on the Sunday week after this happened, and died on the Wednesday following—the prisoner came up and saw him before he left, and said, "Poor fellow, I am sorry to Bee him like this, I am sorry it happened, I will go to my ganger and draw a few shillings and give him to help him, "but he never came back any more—while the quarrelling was going on, the prisoner's wife began at Bailey about hitting her husband on the jaw and not letting him have the beer—Bailey said, "What has that to do with you, you Irish w—?"—that was said loud enough for the pri-soner to hear—it must have been twenty or twenty-four minutes after that that the blow was struck.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 175). On Thursday evening, April 20th, I received information of this robbery from the last witness; he mentioned the prisoner's name, and I took him on Friday evening, about 9 o'clock, in High-street, Borough—I told him he was charged with picking a female's pocket, near Mr. Gainsford's shop—he said, "I know nothing about it"—as I took him Copeland came up and identified him.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see, Copeland on the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a few minutes before I took the prisoner; he gave information on the Thurs<lb/>day, but I did not see the prisoner until the Friday evening—he said on the Friday evening that the prisoner had just gone up the Borough, and I went after him and took him—I do not remember that he said anything else; I think Cummings said more to him than I did.</p>
