I went into the house to ask for a letter for the hospital; I told him, I hoped he would excuse the liberty I took of coming into the house; he d-d me, and said I came to steal something; I said, I had not, but for a letter which I had had before; he took me up for stealing his boots, which I had not seen; I have failed in the four quarters of the world with Lord Howe, Lord St. Vincent, and Lord Duncan, and never was charged with any offence before.</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday night, the 16th of November, I apprehended the prisoner coming up Drury-lane, with a bed on his shoulder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030004"/>and a blanket and bolster; I asked him where he was going with that bed; he told me he had brought them from his lodgings; I asked him how he came to bring them away at that time of night; he said, because he could not pay his lodgings; I suspected that the bed was stolen; I sprung my rattle, and he slung the bed off his shoulder, and ran down one of the courts in Drury-lane; by some accident he tripped himself up, and I came a top of him; Lynch and another watchman came up, and assisted me, and we took the bed, blankets, and bolster, to the watch-house; the next morning Mrs. Gayner claimed the property at the watch-house. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gayner. This is the bed, blanket, and bolster, that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Which room were these things in? - A. On the ground-floor; he lodged up one pair of stairs; the house is let to lodgers; the door was locked, here is the key that I had in my pocket, and here is the key it was opened with, which I found in the lock; it was let to a lodger that was to have come on the Monday following; the next morning I found the room-door half open.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the value of these things? - A.Thirty-five shillings for the bed, half-a-crown for the bolster, and half-a-crown a piece for the blankets; I saw the door locked at eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This bed had been let to some person that was to come into the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered the key? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That person who was to come, was to have the use of the bed, and the other furniture? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has two houses, I believe; they were originally two houses, but are now formed into one? - A. No; it was always one house.</p>
               <p>Q.There is an open passage common to all the inhabitants of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Does your husband live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; the magistrates desired me to go and see the situation of the house, to see whether it was a burglary or not; I found a common door to the house; Mr. and Mrs. Gayner lived in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is not that a common door communicating to the lodgings, and is there not a separate door communicating to that part which is occupied by the landlord? - A. Yes; there are two doors to one house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Though there are two doors, it is all one house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home, and a man offered me one shilling to carry this bed for him; that was at the corner of Queen-street; and as soon as I had got it upon my back, the watchman stopped me and the man run away.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH AUSTIN sworn. - I am uncle to the prisoner; I never knew that the prisoner lodged in Mrs. Gayner's house; I understand he has been there with bad women, the house is full of them; I never heard any thing against his character before, he is a shoe-maker.</p>

               <p>Q.Who was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there, besides yourself? - A. My wife and the grand boy.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No, he is under age, he is about eleven years of age; I did not think it necessary to bring him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In what state did I appear when I went into your shop? - A. He appeared to me in the same state that he does now, tipsey.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It cannot be supposed that he is now in that state, just coming from the prison? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he appear to be sober? - A. I thought he was tipsey, but after that, I had no reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what he had in his hand before he went out of the shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly said before the Magistrate, that you saw the grater in his hand? - A. I saw that he had something in his hand, but I had not missed any thing.(James Hall, the marshalman, produced the grater, which was deposed to by Mr. Aughtie.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you any partner in your business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man lived with you? - A. I think he came the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a very good character with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not mean to say, that this sugar is not to be had at every grocer's shop in London? - A. It is a very difficult matter to get it exactly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You can make a great number of samples out of one hogshead? - A. Yes; but this was a particular kind of sugar, it is Surinam sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a great many hogsheads of the same sort? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A vast quantity of course would come from the same country as well as that which you had? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The bags, I presume, you cannot swear to? - A. No, they have no marks upon them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for by Mr. Cobb to watch the prisoner; I followed him down Ivy-lane, and almost at the bottom, I stopped him; I asked him if he was not a smuggler; he said, no, he was not; then I told him he had something in his pocket that was not his own; then I went to the Crown public-house, in Cannon-alley, St. Paul's Church-yard; he went to the necessary, and took this paper of sugar out of his pocket, and threw it down; I got it up again with a scraper; then I searched his right-hand pocket, and took this paper of sugar out; after that, we took him back to Mr. Cobb's, and he gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What business had you to take him to the public-house? - A. He would go in there.</p>
               <p>JAMES WOODMAN sworn. - I am an officer; I was with Plush, I know no more than he has said.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cobb.) Q. Is that Surinam sugar? - A. It is, it exactly matched with the sugar that he had been beating over.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had bought the sugar? - A. He did not at first, he did afterwards; he at first said, he had never taken any before, and it was only a little for his own use.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

I am a porter; I know the prisoner very well: Last Monday was a week, I met him in Watling-street, very near the Old-change, and a man that I never saw before, came up to him with some sugar in his apron, and asked him to buy it of him, and he asked me, I told him, I did not know what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - A. Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those parcels? - A. They were both in the same coloured bag at that time; this one I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Plush.) Q. Is that parcel in the same coloured paper that it was when you took it from the prisoner? - A. No; the paper underneath is the same colour as the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it? - A. Last Monday week.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour of the day? - A.Somewhere about nine or ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. That is the only reason? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will venture to swear positively to it? - A. I think I can swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you do not know the contents? - A. I knew it was sugar.</p>

               <p>Q.Longer than that, sure? - A. Not personally, I knew him by fight before.</p>

               <p>Q.Intimate with him about a twelvemonth? - A. I had not been particularly acquainted with him, only having a pint of beer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he work with? - A. Mr. Cobb, in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. So a strange man came up, and asked if you would buy any sugar? - A. Yes; he said it was good sugar he would warrant, and he supposed about four pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not opened? - A. I do not know that it was; I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how can you venture to swear that it was sugar? - A. It was sugar.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.You must not tell us any thing that he said after that? - A. I saw the property at the pawnbroker's afterwards.</p>
               <p>CALEB WATSON sworn. - I am servant to a pawnbroker in Watling-street; here is a shawl that I took in of the prisoner on the 18th of November, and a yard and a half of silk, (produces them); he told me he had bought the silk to make him a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the prisoner'sperson? - A. Yes. Mr. Sampson. The shawl I cannot attempt to swear to; it is an article that no man can swear to; the piece of silk would be in that situation, but unfortunately for the prisoner, it is cut away, and the piece that is at home corresponds exactly with this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss a shawl? - A. It would have been impossible for me to have missed twenty dozen if they had been gone; it is of the same resemblance and make with other goods that I have in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, if gentlemen of respectability to speak in my behalf, could be of service to me, I could have had them to-morrow, but to day they are not here; every person with whom I have had dealings would give me the most irreproachable character; and if other pieces of silk were cut away, they might tally with Mr. Sampson's, as well as this; my friends are three hundred miles from town, and are, I am proud to say, of the, first respectability in their neighbourhood; I served my time regularly in the county of Cornwall, and had a liberal education. <rs id="t18001203-10-verdict55" type="verdictDescription">

            , my neighbour, brought him back; he had got about twenty or thirty yards; he turned out to be lame; I came back to my own house to see what I had lost, and then he was brought back; there was no other man, besides themselves, in the lane; they were running, and the more I cried stop thief, the faster they ran; the lane runs down to the water-side from the King's-road, and is rather a lonesome lane; I missed a flowered gown and petticoat of my own, two white gowns of one of my daughters, one black silk cloak of my daughter's, one white bonnet of my own, a linen gown, and a black silk cloak of my youngest daughter's, which laid at the top of the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A.About three pounds five shillings altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your daughters of age? - A. Yes; one is eighteen, and the other is turned twenty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Have you always said that I was the man that run out of your house? - A. Yes, always.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN HALE sworn. - I am a carpenter at Chelsea; I live next door to Mrs. Turner: On Friday, the 30th of October -</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Friday? - A. Yes; Friday evening I heard a cry of stop thief; I ran after the prisoner and another man; I overtook him in Robinson's-lane, he was a little lame, neither walking nor running, but a sort of a shuffle; I asked the prisoner if he had seen any men pass him; he said, what odds is that to you; I said, it was odds to me, for there was something lost; he said, you find it then; I passed him, and ran across to the King's-road; I looked right and left, to see if I could see any body running, but there was nobody; I then got into the hedge, to wait till the prisoner came up, and when he came to the corner, he looked right and left; when he saw the coast clear, as he thought, he then set off running towards London; I overtook him in about ten yards, and said to him, my friend, you must not go any further this road without you tell me where you have been, and where you are going; he said he was come from Mr. Scott's, and I desired him to go with me to Mr. Scott's, it was but just by; and then he said, no, it was not that Mr. Scott, but Mr. Scott at Fulham, that he had been to; I asked him if he had seen Mr. Scott; he said, no; I asked him if he had seen Mrs. Scott; he said, no; I asked him if he had seen any of the children; he said, no, he had seen only one James, a carter; I enquired, but there was no such man lived there; then he turned back with me, and said, he had worked for Mr. Scott, and earned five shillings a day at digging the ground; afterwards, he said he was a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q.What is Mr. Scott? - A. A gardener; I asked him who he worked for as a carpenter; he said, he worked for Mr. Long at Chelsea, and had worked for him five months; I asked him Mr. Long's foreman's name, and he could not tell me; I had worked for Mr. Long myself for five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing whether he had worked for Mr. Long? - A. I know that he had not.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure it was Friday? - A.

               <p>Prisoner. He asked me if I was the prisoner; I said, yes; he said the sailor was taken; and I said, I was very glad of it, if they had got the right man that took the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I am sure he is the same man; he was taken in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and I saw him again; I met him about the middle of the lane, where there are no house; the things have never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the guinea? - A. I had it in my till; after I had changed the gold she began to look at the silver, she first said three shillings were bad; in fact, she said the whole was bad; I felt myself very much irritated, and I insisted upon the change back, and looking at it, threw down the guinea that I had received of her, and she put it in her pocket; she made a great deal of hesitation, and refused to return the change; she then said, if I would give the change that I had given her upon my word, she would take it; I told her I certainly would, that it was good; she then took the change and went out of the shop with the guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from where you lived? - A. About half a mile; I never saw them in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them? - A. Yes, the men directed their discourse to me; one of the men held my arms behind me, the other shoved me up against the wall, and the woman put her arm round my neck, and took my watch from me; I took both the men the same evening, but they were acquitted at Worship-street, and while I was giving charge of them, the prisoner came in, as she said, to look for her husband; one of the men came to the watch-house after I had taken the other, and I then gave charge of him; then, after that, the woman came in, and said, she had been looking after her husband, that there were some of the lamps out, he is a lamp-lighter; the man that she called her husband, was the man that held me up against the side of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.It is a very extraordinary thing, that the two men should be acquitted at Worship-street; did you give the same account then, that you have now given? - A. Yes, just the same.</p>
               <p>LUKE CARLISLE sworn. - I am an officer of St. Luke's, Middlesex: On the 16th of November, about half past eleven o'clock, the prosecutor brought a man of the name of Owen Chantrill, to the watch-house, charging him with assisting this woman in stealing his watch.</p>
               <p>Court. (To English.) Q.Did not your foot slip as you were going out of the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come down? - A. Yes, upon one knee.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was that they came out, and served you as you have stated? - A. No, I got up again before I was pinned against the wall.</p>
               <p>Carlisle. A man of the name of Deering, that this woman lived with, followed Chantril, as a spectator, and afterwards the prisoner came in; I asked her what she had done with the watch, she declared positively, she knew nothing of it; Jane Druit said, that was the woman that took the watch, but she has absconded; I repeatedly asked him, if he was sure it was she who had taken his watch, and he said he was; she said, she wished she might never see her four children that she had got at home, if she knew any thing of it; I kept her till three o'clock in the morning; she then enquired of me, whether, if she could bring the watch forward, she should be hurt; I told her, I could say nothing to that; she said, would I go with her, if she took me to the place where she put the watch, or would I send the patrol with her, and the watch should be forth coming; I sent a watchman and a patrol with her, they were gone about twenty minutes; when they came back, the patrol produced this watch, saying, that the prisoner went up stairs, knocked at the door, and said, Suke, give me that watch, and the woman gave it her; the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>English. I know this to be my watch.(Jane Druitt was called, but not appearing, her recognizance was ordered to be esreated.)</p>

               <p>Q. When did you find an owner for them? - A. On Wednesday, the 27th of October, I went to No. 6r, Red-lion-passage, which I saw written on the back of one of the pictures; and in consequence of what passed there, I went to Mrs. Sharpley's; she described the pictures, and I shewed them to her; she attended at the office on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went there in consequence of some information respecting some pistols? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I had lately taken a public-house, and I understand, from all the enquiry that I can make, that my wife has been imposed upon by some person who has called at our house with these things, and produced, as I understand, a very high miniature, being a striking resemblance of a boy of mine, about four years old; she was imposed upon to receive them, and she lent a guinea upon the whole of them; I learned that my wife was imposed upon, from observing that the locket was not gold; she had been told it was; Brown has said, that my wife told him, her brother was a miniature-painter, and had delivered them; I did not here her say so; I was in another room with Cook. My Lord and Gentlemen, I rest myself, under these circumstances, satisfied that you will do me justice. <rs id="t18001203-24-verdict128" type="verdictDescription">

I perceived that the bricklayer's work had been removed, which gave me a suspicion that the thieves were coming again; here are two witnesses in Court that sat up that night. About a quarter before five in the morning, I was called down, and saw the prisoner in the tap-room in their custody; I questioned him about the property I had lost, but he said he did not know any thing of it; I asked him how he came there, but he did not give any account of himself.</p>

I saw the bricks in the hole; and about half past four, I heard them, as I thought, coming into the cellar; I listened attentively till I was convinced there was somebody in the cellar; I then advanced with a cutlass, and there I perceived the prisoner about two yards within the cellar; I thought I heard two voices in the cellar as I advanced; with that, I made a stroke with my cutlass, but missed my stroke; Parsley then came with a light, and the prisoner was then making his escape, and had got partly through the hole, and with great difficulty Parsley and I got him back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you struggle? - A. No, I was too helpless to struggle, I was rather in liquor, I sung out watch, three or four times; when the watchman came, I told him I was robbed, and shewed him which way they went; the next day I went to every pawnbroker's shop in London, to the best of my knowledge, for them to stop the watch; one of the runners came to me at the Ship and Star, and told me my watch was found; it had my name round the dial plate instead of figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that laid hold of you? - A. No, only that they were dressed in sailor's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner one of them? - A. I cannot safely say that; the prisoner was stopped with the watch.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Cookson: On Monday the 21st of November, the prisoner took an opportunity of going into the cellar under the warehouse, and plundering a hogshead; as I knew he had no business there, for I had not put him on to work, when he came out of the cellar, I asked him what business he had there; he had worked there two days before; he told me he was put on, but he could not tell by whom; I told him to put out the property that he had got about him; he said, he would not; he abused me very much, and said, neither I nor anybody else should take it from him; I sent for Mr. Cookson, and he gave charge of him to the constable; I saw a stocking taken from him, containing a quantity of sugar; it was under his waistcoat, next to his shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. Are Messrs. Cookson and Company responsible for the sugars in their warehouses? - A. They are for all losses; the sugar appears to be of the same quality with that in the cellar; there appeared to be about the quantity missing that he had in the stocking; the head had felf in by pirching the hogshead; it was there for the cooper to repair.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Newman-street; On the 15th of August, between two and three in the morning, I saw two men standing, one in the window-fill of Mr. Bank's house, and the other on the iron rails; I heard a crash, and I heard something fall, which was the window-blind; I then heard another crash, which was the windowshutter being forced from the hinges; I saw the prisoner at the bar give it one wrench with a kind of an instrument, but I cannot exactly say what; I then called out, and asked them what they were doing there; upon which, the man upon the rails jumped down, and said to the other, as he jumped down, d-n my eyes, we are seen; upon which he went up Newman-street; the prisoner was then standing upon the window-fill, with his arm inside the window-shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner? - A. I am positive of it; he met me more than half way as I was crossing over the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after he had left the window? - A. Yes; as he came up to me, he said, d-n your eyes you b-r, what do you want here; I asked him what he was doing there, and he directly turned round to get from me; I made a catch at the skirt of his coat, but missed it; he then ran away; I followed him, crying stop thief; the watchman sprung his rattle; I pursued him into Chapel-street; I saw him throw something away, which I heard chink upon some brick-bats; it appeared to me to be some kind of iron or steel; I kept following, but there were two watchmen before me; he was, directly afterwards, taken in Hollen-street, and brought back to Mr. Banks's house; when we got to the door of the house, one of the watchmen slackened his hand a little from his collar, and the prisoner twisted his head under the other watchman's arm, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; are you quite sure that that is the man you saw with his arm inside the shutter? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it, that he was apprehended? - A. It might be as much as ten minutes, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no sort of doubt of his being the person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITHERS sworn. - I am a watchman: I was calling the hour of two o'clock on the 15th of August; I heard a cry of stop thief; I ran directly for assistance, and just as I got to the end of the pavement, the prisoner got to the corner of the street; he ran across Oxford-road, into Chapel-street; the St. Ann's watchman followed him into Hollen-street; when I came up, a nightman and the watchman had got hold of him, and the nightman said to me, watchman, take hold of him, and we both of us led him up to Mr. Banks's house; the nightman is not here; then he snatched himself away from us, ran down Newman-street, across Oxford-road, into Dean-street, and turned into Soho-square; he was stopped there again, and brought to Marybone watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the man; are you perfectly sure he is the man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the man, so as to know him again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN SOLOMONS sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Ann's, Soho: I saw the prisoner in custody in Soho-square; I enquired what was the matter; and I was told to go into Chapel-street, and look upon the rubbish, that he had thrown something away; I went there, and found this iron crow upon the rubbish by Mr. Preston's brewhouse, (produces it); it was quite new then; but Mr. Banks said he should not prosecute him, and I made a poker of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Franks). Whereabouts was it you saw the prisoner throw something away? - A. At the corner of Chapel-street, by the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAWTHORN sworn. - Between two and three o'clock on the 15th of August, I heard the alarm of stop thief in Newman-street; I ran across Oxford-road, and saw the prisoner making his way down Newman-street; I up with my stick, and struck him; he got past me into Chapel-street; I perceived that he have something away upon some rubbish that laid there; he was stopped in Hollen-street, and taken back to Mr. Banks's, and there he slipped from under our arms, and got away; he was pursued and taken again, and carried to Marybone watch-house; and through the neglect of the Magistrate, he was committed for a misdemeanor only, and was out upon bail.</p>
               <p>HENRY BATES sworn. - Q. Look at that crow? - A. I received this crow at Marybone watch-house from Solomons; I went down to the prosecutor's house, and found the window broke; I fitted the crow to it, and it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that the window must have been broke open by that, or such like crow? - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>HENRY LOVELL sworn. - On the 18th of November, I know the prisoner at the bar stood indicted for a burglary; Jackson and I, and Kennedy, apprehended him in a public-house in Hog-lane; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was first of all committed for a misdemeanor, and was out upon bail from August till November; I had been at work till half past one o'clock, and was going home to my lodgings; I expected my trial was put off till the next Sessions, and I have no friends here.</p>

            : I delivered the flax into the craft that was sent by Mr. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the delivery take up? - A. I began on Tuesday the 4th of November; on Wednesday the 5th, another parcel; and Friday the 7th, another.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The parcels that you put in were never unladen? - A. No; they were in the same bulk that we received them at Petersburgh; there were four hundred and fifty-six bobbins, that is, flax done up at both ends; part of them contained nine heads, and part twelve; after I had delivered them all into the craft, the lightermen, Arthur and Williams, took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Minerva at that time? - A. In Cherry-garden tier, on the Surry-side of the water; the craft lay close along-side.</p>
               <p>Q. All the flax then was safely delivered into the craft? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that it is Mr. Atkins's property? - A. Yes.</p>

            ). Q. Did you see the flax on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flax afterwards at Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it the same appearance with the flax you had lost? - A. One bottom of flax is like another; but there was just the quantity that we had lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Lost from where? - A. Either from the lighter or the shore.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARTHUR, jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. My father is a lighterman; he was employed by Mr. Atkins: I went down in the craft, in November last, for the bobbins of flax for Mr. Atkins, from the Minerva; she was lying off Wapping Old Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any bobbins at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any flax put into the craft? - A. Yes, by the people belonging to the Minerva; I was not in the craft at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any in the craft? - A. Yes, apparently a large quantity; I was to have delivered them at Davis's wharf, upon Mr. Atkins's account; I went to Davis's wharf, and then I went and fetched the watchman of Davis's wharf, Crawley; I saw the barge fastened, and I left it in the care of Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Davis's wharf? - A. Just below Battle-bridge, on the other side of the water; after I had seen the barge fast, I went home, that was on the 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How many days were you receiving the flax from the Minerva? - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself receive any orders from Mr. Atkins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by when any orders were given by Mr. Atkins? - A. No; I saw a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Excepting from the letter, you did not know on whose account you went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many bobbins of flax you received? - A. The account that was given to me, was four hundred and fifty-six, I did not count them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know of any deficiency, when you delivered them at Davis's wharf? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.When was this? - A. I think on a Monday, in November; I went down the next day, Tuesday, and saw part of the flax then in the craft, it remained on board the craft all night along side the ship; on the Wednesday I went, and it was not all in; my orders were, not to take it till it was all in the craft; it was not all delivered to one craft; what was delivered, I went to Davis's wharf with; I fastened the craft to a ring belonging to the wharf; I waited about a quarter of an hour while the Custom-house officer went on shore to deliver the charge, then I went away and left the craft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever see Atkins about this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether you were sent by Atkins or not, you only know from Arthur? - A. Yes, I had a letter from Mr. Arthur.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several hundred heads of flax on board the craft? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, what quantity of flax was to be delivered? - A. Five hundred bobbins; when I heard it was landed, I went to Daivs's wharf to see it, that was, I suppose, about a week after; I had given the order to Arthur.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a fair price or not? - A.

             sworn. - I am butler to Dr. Robert Willis; On the 4th of November last about a quarter after twelve, or thereabouts, I was in my master's bed-room, fronting the street, nearly opposite to Lord Le Despencer's, and I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of a two-pair of stairs window upon a new piece of building that was building up; there was a door way cut through the wall that communicated into the attics of the dwelling-house; I saw the prisoner trying to conceal something under his great coat, on the left side; he then crossed the new building, and got upon the scaffolding, and, on my going down stairs, the servant-maid of Dr. Willis called to me, and said, she believed there was a man robbing Lord Le Despencer's house; I then went to the landing-place of the first stair-case, and I saw the prisoner upon the scaffold, putting the sheets into a mason's lime-basket; when he had so done, he picked up bricks and rubbish, and put over the sheets; I went down stairs to the street door, and called to him; he stood up very unconcerned; I said, you rascal, if you don't come down, I will fetch you down, I will throw you down and break your neck; the prisoner then left the basket, and threw himself astride the ladder, and slid down; when he came at the bottom, I laid hold of him by the collar, and told him he had been a thief, that he had done something wrong; he said, he had not, and begged I would let him go; he broke away from me, and ran across Hanover-square, but I took him in Oxford-road, and brought him back to the place where I first saw him; in the interval of time Lord Le Despencer's servants had been informed of it, and I saw the basket in the manner I have described; we then took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of day did you see this? - A. A quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the time the other workmen were at work? - A. No, they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know enough of the prisoner, to say he was the man? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was there any mark upon it? - A. Yes; it was No. 8; the selling price was eight shillings, which was put upon it, that I might know what to sell it for when my mistress was out of the way; I swore to the property, and that was all I did.</p>
               <p>SARAH SMITH sworn. - Upon the 21st of November, on a Friday, between eleven and twelve at noon, I heard the alarm of stop thief up the court I lived in, and they said they would search my house; I opened my door to come down stairs to see what was the matter, and the prisoner was upon the stairs; he seemed to be very much frightened, indeed, and he offered me a shilling to let him come into my room; I went out to him, and said, I suppose you are the man that the alarm of stop thief is about, and he said, he was; I went down stairs to tell them where the man was, and the headborough took him down stairs; that is all I have got to say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How was the window broke? - A. There was a small hole which I had broken myself, and mended it with a small piece of strong paper; and secured it by wafers four days before; that paper was pushed on one side, and the hole made bigger; the shoes I never heard of till the officers brought them to me, and asked me whether they were my shoes; I told him I had no doubt of it in the least, by the two letters of the man's name I bought the shoes of; I was not present when the shoes were taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Therefore you don't know whether they were taken out that instant? - A. I know that the shoes were there ten minutes before I missed them.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY JAQUES sworn. - I am a baker, I live in Essex-street, Whitechapel; John States and William Sinclair came to me on Thursday, the 6th of November; they had a pair of shoes, and they asked me whether I would buy them; I don't know which it was that offered them me; they asked me three shillings and sixpence, and I gave them three shillings and sixpence because they fitted me; I threw the money upon the table, but who took it up I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you do with the shoes? - A. I wore them till the prisoners were taken; and Mr. Haynes, the officer, hearing I had a pair of shoes, he applied to me, and I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAYNES sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell High-street: On Thursday last; the 4th of December, I received these shoes from Mr. Jaques, (produces them); I asked him how he came by them; he told me he had bought them of the accomplice, States, and the prisoner at the bar, and that he had given three shillings and sixpence for them; I asked him when he bought them, and he said, on the 6th of November, about eight o'clock at night; I went to the shoe-maker with the shoes, and he said, he had lost such a pair of shoes marked J. K.</p>
               <p>Brooks. I have no doubt but these are the same shoes, there is J. K. upon them; it is the man's mark I bought them of.</p>
               <p>- WOODROOFE sworn - I am a hairdresser, I live at No. 25, Shadwell High street, next door to Mr. Brook's: On the 6th of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I went to my own shop door, and looking towards Mr. Brooks's shop, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and this man. States, at the window; I could see the face of States, but not the face of Sinclair; I passed by them, and I thought I saw a piece of paper move; then I crossed the way; suspecting they meant to rob the shop, I stood opposite, and I thought I saw the prisoner Sinclair's arm move, and drawing a pair of shoes out of the window, and giving them to States, who then moved away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Sinclair? - A. They both walked away from the window, I then went to Mr. Brooks's, and asked him if he had lost any thing; he told me, a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw States there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you believe the other boy was there likewise? - A. I believe he was, but I did not see his face clearly.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Jaques.) Are you sure that States was one of the boys that sold you the shoes? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - I am an officer, I apprehended States in the morning of the 16th of November; and, about four o'clock on the same day, Jaques came and informed me that Sinclair was at his house with a watch, which he did not think Sinclair came honestly by.</p>
               <p>JOHN STATES sworn. - I work with my father at the water-side; I have known Sinclair about a twelvemonth: On the 6th of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I and Sinclair were going down High-street, Shadwell, and we saw this shoe shop, and seeing nobody in it, William Sinclair shoved his hand through the window, and took out a pair of shoes, and he gave them to me; I walked away, and put them into my pocket; we were coming back to get some more, and we saw a gentleman standing on the other side of the way, with a light coloured coat on; we thought this gentleman was looking at us, and we made the best of our way off; we went into Catherine-wheelalley, and sold them to

I don't say he was not; at this instant I saw the husband, who said, the man had not taken it away, that he had got the seed, and he would go up stairs and fetch the seed directly; upon this we went up stairs with the prisoner, through two or three small rooms; the prisoner unlocked the door, and, looking round to the left, he took down the bag of seed, and two others.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the bag of seed, did you believe it to be your's? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Gentlemen of the Jury why you knew it to be your's? - A. Because of the mark I had made.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make a mark upon it? - A. In the morning, at the door, before the cart went away from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before the cart had set off, loaded with mats, while at the door you had marked the sack? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go away with the cart, with the sack in it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same sack which you afterwards found in the closet? - A. It was the same, I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door in the closet open or not? - A. It was locked, the prisoner unlocked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw there were two other bags, did they contain seed? - A. Yes, both of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys; Q. Did you happen to observe, when you were in the house, that the prisoner kept birds? - A. Yes, I think I saw a bird at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.You know it was the bag that you marked in the cart at your door, but you never saw that bag in your premises? - A. Most likely I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen it upon your premises? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. The wife stated, that the person who brought the seed had taken it away? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. But the prisoner corrected her, and said, he would thew you where it was? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And took you immediately to the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you did this you went very properly to the office, to get a search-warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner at home, and ready to give you an account of the transaction? - A. He was at home, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the quantity? - A. About half a bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe how many birds the man kept? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether ever this servant of your's had brought you a dog, and made you a present of it, for the purpose of protecting the house? - A. He did bring a puppy dog.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it to you? - A. He left it in the stable; a puppy dog is not much protection to a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was desired by your father, or any body else, to get a dog? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030028"/>A. I don't know that he was nor I don't know that he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the man saying, that Partridge had given him this seed in return for his giving him this dog" A. The prisoner said, that Partridge had given him this quantity of seed for having made him a present of this dog.</p>
               <p>Q. In London, dogs sell for something pretty considerable; whereabouts was the value of this dog? - A. I am no judge of the value.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Bridge-ward; I went with Mr. Wrench to the house of the prisoner; I produce these three bags; I have had them in my custody ever since; I found them up one pair of stairs in a closet in a back room, locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the prisoner said? - A. He said he had given the carman the puppy, and he promised to give him some seed in return; he did not deny the seed being there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the wife said about it? - A. Yes; she said the carman had taken the bag away with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The wife having given a false account of the transaction, he corrected her? - A. Yes; he wanted to go up stairs by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went up with him? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, in public-houses, they are obliged to keep their doors all locked? - A. I have nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>HENRY LOVET sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to Marlborough-street: I went to the prisoner's house; I don't recollect the seed being in a closet, it hung by the corner of the bed, upon a nail.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not concealed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wrench). Be so good as to look at that bag; is that the bag you marked? - A. Yes, it is marked W; I put that mark upon it, before it went from my house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Beverley). Q. What was the conversation when you went in? - A. Only asking how the dog did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the story of the dog was not an afterthought, because they suspected you? - A. No; they were talking about the dog when we went in</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The dog was in the cart, and the prisoner at the bar went and fetched it out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was this a great full-grown dog? - A. I don't know; it was not above six months old.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was then used for the purpose of watching the property in the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have only this to say, that I did give him the dog, and he did promise me some seeds in return.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him a very good character. <rs id="t18001203-40-verdict216" type="verdictDescription">

            , merchant, No. 4, Crescent, blackfriars-bridge: On Sunday morning, the 2d of November, about half past six o'clock in the morning, as I was opening the shutters, I saw the prisoner endeavouring to get over the area; I ran into the back yard, called the groom, and we went round to the front door and took him; we found nothing upon him; when we got round, he was not quite out of the area; there was a bundle lying in the area, I let it lie there till the constable had charge of the prisoner; the bundle contained fifteen pounds of beef, and two quartern loaves; I missed them from the larder in the area; the cook was taking the bone out of the beef the night before, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cook here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it put in the larder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the loaves were there overnight? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say that any loaves were missing? - A. No; the bundle was tied up in an apron, such as glaziers generally wear.</p>
               <p>ISAAC WRIGHT sworn. - I am groom to Mr. Griffulke; I was called by the last witness; I went round with him and took the prisoner as he was getting out of the area; I said to him, you shall not get away this time, so easy as you did before, and we secured him; he was taken before the Alderman and committed; there was a bundle lying in the area, with some beef and bread in it; I had seen the beef in the larder the night before, I did not take any notice of the bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done to the larder? - A. Yes, the padlock was broke off; I saw the cook lock it up the night before, and the beef in it; there was another lock to it, besides the padlock, which must have been picked, because we found it locked.</p>
               <p>SARAH GRAY sworn. - I am a nurse in the family of Mr. Griffulke: I saw the beef and bread in the larder about half past eleven on Saturday night; the bone was taken out; it was made on purpose for bouillie beef; there were six loaves in the safe; two were taken away; the next morning I heard a noise, I looked out at window, and saw my two fellow-servants; they had hold of the prisoner; I came down stairs, and saw the padlock broke off, and the other lock was locked; I saw the bundle in the area, and a long string to it, which went up to the top of the area; when the constable came, I saw a key taken from the prisoner, which unlocked the safe, and locked it again; he was taken into custody immediately. (The constable produced the padlock and two keys, which he had taken from the prisoner, one of which opened the larder).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Sunday morning, the 2d of November, I was coming along Bridge-street, and these two gentlemen came out, and laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18001203-42-verdict225" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. The other two bags you know nothing of? - A.

               <p>Q. If he had bought seed, you would not, perhaps, have refused him the use of the bag, to convey it from one place to another? - A. Probably not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they make that bargain with you, that you were to be paid on delivery? - A. They bargained for four watches the first time, they were for the four sailors, and he undertook to pay for them on delivery, at his house, the Ship, at Wapping, that is about two miles from my house; they went away about half past four o'clock; he came again with one of the sailors, who called himself the carpenter of the ship; he then bargained for another watch, which made five, that, was to be sent with the rest to his house; he told me to bring that home at the same time; he went away, saying; he should be there as soon as me, and left the carpenter of the ship at my house; I packed them up, and took them with me, the carpenter went with me, and conducted me to the house; I went into the tap-room with the carpenter, and saw the prisoner who called himself the landlord; he took me into a private room, he brought two candles and a piece of paper, he desired me to take down every man's name, which I accordingly did; he then looked at the watches, and each man took one; he said; you would wish to have your money; I said, I should; he said, I will give it you by and by; he went down stairs, and came up again, and said his wife was not in the way, she would be in recently he said, he had nothing but a one hundred pound note, and he would step down and get change; he went down stairs with all the watches, I staid about half an hour, he did not come; I went down stairs and saw a woman that I took to be the landlady; she said, the landlord would be in by and by. I went up stairs again; I was then under no alarm of being robbed of my property; I waited about half an hour longer, and made enquiry again, but I never saw him again till the Monday following, when he was taken up; the prisoner turned out not to be the landlord; there was no landlord to the house; the officer has got one of the watches, which he found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This man told you he lived at this public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not appear as the deputy landlord? - A. Yes, or I would not have trusted him with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, as well as from what he told you, that he acted as deputy landlord? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He came with four sailors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought them to buy these watches? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you gave every sailor a watch, the prisoner had not possession of all the watches? - A. I cannot say whether every man took his watch, or whether I laid them down on the board, he was to pay for them; I delivered one of the watches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030032"/>to the prisoner, and he changed with one of the sailors.</p>
               <p>Q. The other four watches you gave into the possession of the sailors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner offered you a one hundred pound note? - A. He said he had no small change, but he would get change for a one hundred pound note, but I never saw any note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was committed by the Magistrate for conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to indict him for a selony? - A. The Magistrate did that business.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office; I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday the 16th of November, in the evening, at the public-house, in Old Gravel-lane, I knew him before; I did not search him at the time I apprehended him; I secured him after a great deal of trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he the landlord of the Ship public-house? - A. Not to my knowledge: the landlord of that house is a man of the name of Baynton, who is in the King's-bench now; I searched him at the office, and found this watch in his fob; he told me that was one of the watches that he had from Mr. Rogers. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Rogers. This is one of the watches that these men had, I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Perry.) Q. Do not you know, that in the absence of Baynton, the prisoner officiated as landlord? - A. No, I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know Baynton to have been an acquaintance of the prisoner's? - A. Yes, it has been the alarm of the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time Baynton was arrested, he authorized me to do every thing in this house for him, and for a dozen or twenty days, I did business in the house, and was answerable for every thing, and these sailors asked me to go with them to buy some watches, and they were to give me a one hundred pound note, and I told this gentleman I would be answerable for the watches; when he came in, I was drawing off a bottle of gin in the cellar, and when I came up they had all got their watches; I never saw them before, they were strangers to me, and when I was taken up, I was endeavouring to find them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe these articles to be your property? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service on that day? - A. Yes he was, and had been at work in the morning; when I come back, I found him in the manufactory up stairs, in the powder-room, and gave charge of him to Mr. Harper; I told him, I gave him in charge because of the soap that I had found in his apartment; in his way to Worship-street, he said, the soap that I found in his apartments was given him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went with Mr. Jones to search the prisoner's apartments, last Friday, (produces the property;) I found it upon a shelf in the cupboard; I then went to the manufactory, and took charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROLLS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Recollect, that you are sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth- you were the apprentice of Mr. Jones, were you not? - A. Yes, the prisoner worked for Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his having taken any soap, hair powder, or starch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now in the care of a person from the house of correction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been taken into Newgate to see either this prisoner, or any other prisoner, against whom you are intended to give evidence, since you have been in custody? - A. No, I have not seen either of them, or spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones). Q. Look at that soap? - A. This yellow soap is of my manufacture; I can only speak of it by the quality; one boiling of soap differs very much from another; I have made but four boilings since last March, and if I was to see any of either of the boilings, I could pick them out separately; this cake of violet-soap was manufactured in my house, and never was sold, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will you swear it was never sold? - A. I cannot say, we sell so many things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you never sell any of that soap to the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; here is a wash-ball which is unfinished, and is of my manufacture, that never was sold, I can swear it was made in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Monday was a week, Thomas Rolls brought eight cakes of soap, and wanted me to take it away, and I said I would not have it, for I did not know what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Rolls). Q. You hear what the prisoner says? - A. It is all false; I brought out four cakes that he and his brother asked me for, and his brother took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the wash-ball; did you take that and deliver either to the prisoner or his brother? - A. No, I did not; I took these two cakes of yellow soap from the cutting-room, and delivered them to his brother; the prisoner was in the cutting-room at the time I took them out; he told me his brother was over in the vat-room; he saw me take it out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you not to take them out? - A. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desired Rolls not to take the soap out; he said his mistress had been terrifying him, and said he was as bad as the man; he said his master was better, and had offered him a guinea, if he could defect any of the men.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rolls). Is that true? - A. No, it is all false. <rs id="t18001203-48-verdict261" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Rigden: On the evening of the 5th of November, about six o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, and brought home a waistcoat that her father had made; I gave her another for her father to make; she tied it in a handkerchief; while I was entering it in the book, and was going out of the door, I stepped into the cutting-room adjoining the shop, to speak to the foreman; in coming back, I saw the child at the end of the shop, where she had no business; she then went out at the door, and I perceived, as she stooped to open the door, that she had something under her cloak; I sent for my master, and he ordered me to fetch her back, which I did; I told her we had something else to make, and brought her back with me; I gave her another waistcoat, which she tied up in her bundle; Mr. Regden then went round the counter, and lifted up her cloak, and took from under her arm a blue cloth jacket; he then took her to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that? - A. About nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you give nine shillings for it? - A. Yes; more than that. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Was the foreman in a situation to see what passed in the shop? - A. No, he could not; there was nobody in the shop but me and her, till after I fetched her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you took it from her? - A. She did not speak for a few minutes, and then began to beg for mercy; she said it was the first time, and she would do so no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he attempt to go away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body there besides yourself? - A. No; I untied the bundle, and found my husband's hat and my bonnet tied up in a handkerchief, that was not mine; I told him he had taken them out of the box; he said he had not; the bonnet was in the box, wrapped up in a handkerchief, and the hat was hanging in the room; he had taken the bonnet out of my handkerchief, and wrapped it up in his own; I know the bonnet to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get him secured? - A. He ran down stairs, and got away; as I was by myself, I was afraid to do any thing to him: on the Saturday after, my little boy saw him go into the Black-horse rendezvous, and by that means he was apprehended on the Sunday; I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowleys. Q. I believe you are a person employed by Messrs. Perry in their dock-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar at this time in your service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he to serve? - A. According to his indentures, he was out of his time last May, but having a few words, he left me, and in consequence of which, he was serving his lost time; he was employed in the dock-yard of Messrs. Perry; on the 31st of October last, we had docked a ship in the afternoon; I am a corker, I ordered him, with the rest of the servants, to be down by six o'clock, for the purpose of shutting the gates upon the ship in the dock; on going from my own house to the yard, I sat down at the yard gate, and between six and seven in the evening, I saw a person come out with a great coat, trailing upon the ground, and I told the watchman to stop him; the watchman told me it was my own servant; on the watchman saying that, I called him by name, three times, he did not answer me; he attempted to run. I immediately ran after him, and took him with the copper wrapped in the inside of the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of copper was it? - A. Sheet copper, such as is used for sheething the ships; I brought it back to the watch-house, at the yard gate; I charged him with the coat being another person's, in the yard, he positively denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say about the copper? - A. He told me he had taken it from the Albion's dock, an East-India ship. (The copper produced.)</p>
               <p>Witness. That is the sheet I took from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you such a ship as the Albion under repair, at your docks? - A. Yes; I delivered out thirty-one sheets, one of them was missing, and another was obliged to be put in it's place.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that copper, and tell me whether it is that kind of copper used in sheathing ships? - A. Yes; it is what we call eight and twenty ounce; a thinner sort is sixteen ounce; that is five foot by twenty, and this is four foot two.</p>

               <p>THOMAS REED sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Mangle, ship-chandler, Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry any paint on the 20th of November? - A. Yes; eighty-one kegs of ground colours, four casks of dry lamb-black, and six bundles of spunged slaves, each of those kegs weighed twenty eight pounds; I branded them all with the Company's mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put into the cart? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drove the cart away? - A. Thomas Benwell, the master of the cart.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BENWELL sworn - I am a carman, I had goods put into my cart for the purpose of taking them to Summers's-quay, on the 20th of November; I drove the cart myself; there were eighty-one kegs of paint, four casks of lamb-black, and six bundles of spunged staves.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did they appear to belong to? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030040"/>They were marked with the East-India Company's mark.</p>
               <p>- STEVENSON sworn. - I am a rummager belonging to the East-India Company; I recollect the last witness coming with a cart to Summer's-quay, with some kegs of paint, they were unloaded in my presence; I saw the kegs upon the quay, and it was my duty to take care of them, and see there was nothing plundered; they were to be carried on board the Carnatic; I missed a keg of paint, and a person upon the quay said, the persons that took it are gone into the Queen's-head, the corner of Darkhouse-lane; I went in at one door, and they out of the other, and on searching the tap-room, I found the keg I had lost; I got assistance and took them to prison.</p>
               <p> MOSES DAVIS sworn. - I was employed in the East-India Company's warehouse, to mark the chests of tea, on the 20th of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at Summer's-quay? - A.Fothergill was at work with us that day; he was employed to help the carman to unload, Harding came up to him, and spoke to him, what he said, I cannot tell; Fothergill got out of the cart, and stood along-side of the kegs; Harding took one of the kegs and rolled it up in his apron, and took it way to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Fothergill at the time? - A. He was standing along-side the kegs with his face towards us, and his back to the kegs, he was standing before the other prisoner; I told him of it, but he did not take any notice of what I said; I was sent to call Mr. Lovell the foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that time, what became of Fothergill? - A. Fothergill had got into the cart again to his labour; I saw them say something to one another, and then Harding run away, and a man standing along-side, pursued him and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If I understand you right, Fothergill was in the cart assisting the carman to unload, and Harding came up? - A. Yes; and Fothergill stood with his back to the kegs, and his face to us; it struck me he did it for a screen, that we might not see, and I saw the other man take up the keg, roll it up in his apron, and run away with it into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harding. I really never was near the place.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am sure he was the man, I have seen him upon the quay before.</p>

I got on the cart to put the oats back, and I discovered there were only nine sacks of oats; he said he knew there was not; that he had let a person have one upon the road, but he would give me another the next time; I told him, I thought that was very wrong; he said, he would be sure to bring another; that he had let his master's customer have a sack; in consequence of that, I did not tell my master;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030041"/>upon the 29th of the same month, he brought me some more oats down to Woodford-hall - five quarters more; I stood at the stable-door, and he said, coachman, I have not got the sack of oats now; I asked him why; he said, he had not brought it, and hoped I would not tell his master, as he had not done any such thing before, and that he was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 4th of August, to the 29th, you never saw any thing more of the prisoner? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowys. Q. When did you inform his master of this deficiency of one sack of oats? - A. I think it was in September, when I went to claim  it.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was not charged at all till November by his own master, therefore it could not be in September? - A. I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can recollect this, that the man had the misfortune to get drunk, and had lost it, and would make it good the next time? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you give your information to Mr. Roberts, who had sent your corn? - A. I gave the information to Mr. Roberts the first time I came to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit this case is not made out at all.</p>
               <p>Court. There are three places in which the crime may have been committed, either in the city of London, the county of Middlesex, or the county of Essex; in which place the crime has been committed, there certainly is no evidence; if you take the whole of this man's evidence together, it precludes pretty nearly the city of London; for, he says, the prisoner told him he let a friend have the oats upon the road, and therefore he leaves it completely open; if the offence was committed in Essex, we are trying a fact of which we have no jurisdiction. <rs id="t18001203-63-verdict343" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>In consequence of that suspicion, what did you do? - A. The prisoner, upon the Tuesday evening, was in the act of shutting up the shop; and as we were determined, in consequence of lo sing several articles, to watch him, he did not come in so readily as I could wish, and I went out and brought him in with me, and I asked him what he had got in his pockets; I put my hand upon the outside of his pocket, and I felt something like a bread and butter plate; I then pushed him forwards towards the desk, and he took out of his pocket a China bread and butter plate, and a black milk-pot; I then asked him where he got them; he told me, in the warehouse, and that they were our property; I neither threatened him, or made any promises; we then sent for a constable, and went and searched his lodgings, and we found the other articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those such articles as you dealt in? - A. Yes, they were; I believe them all to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular marks about the plate you took out of his pocket? - A. It was a very remarkable one; we had had it in the house man years; it was a very old-fashioned pattern.</p>

I found the iron was gone, and James Hale and I followed him to Grub-street; when he had got into St. Paul's Church-yard, I saw him take the iron from his side, and put it upon his shoulder, and carried it along Cheapside, and when he got into Wood-street, he took it from his shoulder, and carried it in his hand; I saw him go into a house in Grub- street; he staid in the house about a minute; it appeared to be an old iron shop; the instant he came out of the shop, James Hale and I went into the shop, I demanded the iron that the man had just sold with a hairy cap on; he asked me what iron it was, and told me there had been no person there selling iron lately; I told him there had, for I had watched him in, and watched him from the shop that he had taken it from; I desired him to go after the man; he told me, he would not, I might go after him myself; I told him I would have the iron before I went out of the shop; he then went round the counter, and gave me up one piece of iron; he asked me if I could swear to it; I told him I could; I went round the counter, and there I saw the rest that had been taken from my master's shop; I told him it was my master's property; I asked him what he had given for it; he said, never mind that, you are welcome to it; I desired him to weigh it, which he did, it weighed thirty-eight pounds; I told him if he would call upon

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Mr. Healey; Pritchard and the prisoner had been down stairs to draw some beer, and I watched them, and saw them take money out of the till, they listed up the counter, and took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was it? - A. I do not think it was any thing but copper; sometimes the prisoner has been by herself, and sometimes the boy has been by himself; I had seen the prisoner taking tobacco out of the casks, and putting it into her pocket, loose, and sometimes putting it into her apron loose, and carrying paper bags from behind the counter, rolling them up, and putting them in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her take the tobacco? - A. She has had it several times; she took some the night before the boy and she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what she did with the tobacco? - A. She took it up into the nursery, it was shag-tobacco, and she parcelled it up; the next morning she took it down in the kitchen, and called the boy up, and she took the box; he refused to take it, because, he said, the shopman will know the box; she then said, she would take the box to the top of Old Bedlam, and he should take the tobacco; they both went down stairs together, and when she came back, she said, she had taken the box to the top of Old-Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. As to the tobacco, when she took it, it was leaf tobacco, without any covering? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew it was a very bad thing to steal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you told your master of it the next day? - A. No, I did not; my master went to York, and was there three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell of it before you were taken up? - A. No, I intended all along to tell my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were taken up, you told this story about the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Healey. I know this to be my box; the tobacco I can speak to, I had such tobacco in my shop; the direction upon this parcel of tobacco I know to be the boy's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was in the power of the boy to have taken that tobacco, without any other person being concerned with him? - A.Certainly it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you saw the prisoner, he told you how he came by them, did not he? - A. He said something.</p>
               <p>Q. He always persevered in the same story? - A. I never heard him deviate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he had bargained for them on the road, of a person, who said he was going to London, and if he would conduct the pigs to Paddington, he would settle with him? - A. Yes he did, and that he had given him two guineas in part, and agreed to give him two guineas and a half a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what place the man had given him the pigs? - A. About half a mile back; he told us, this man, whom he had bargained with, was to meet him at the Red-lion, at Paddington, but that he was stopped, and prevented from going any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever deviate from that story? - A. No; I asked him two or three times over, and he always told me the same story.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you go to the Red-lion at Paddington? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Don't you know that the prisoner deals in greens, poultry, and pigs? - A. I have heard of it since. I never saw him deal.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you said to the prisoner, it was impossible for him to have done it himself? - A. I am sure he himself never could throw the gates off the hinges, I wanted to know who they were that assisted him; I cannot think any one man could do it, and get eight such pigs out, dark as it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you his address? - A. He mentioned it, I think, to be in Red-lion-passage; he said, he kept a green-stall and sold pigs, and collected them about the country; I never have asked about it, but I have been told of it since, that he had lived there as much as ten or eleven years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He asked you the way to the Edgware-road? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, when you found the pigs in his possession, you told him you were very sorry for him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you told him you were sorry for him, he said, he was ready to go with you anywhere? - A. Yes, he did; he told me they were not his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any enquiry about the prisoner since? - A. I have made some enquiry of the gentleman who live near him, and find he has lived in the place he described, for ten or eleven years; I never heard a disrespectful word against the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Watkins; I saw the pigs about eight o'clock on Friday night, and missed them about six o'clock in the morning; I told my master, and he sent me to enquire after them; I went and found the pigs about eight o'clock, in the Harrow-road, the prisoner was driving them; Mr. Peel took him, and I drove the pigs to his house; I sed them about two months, and there was one very remarkable, that had got no tail; they were large, fat, spotted pigs, and one was a white spotted pig, with his tail cut off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the country last Wednesday was three weeks, to Guildford, Farnham, and round that part; there was a fair on the Thursday, so I staid there all night; I stopped along with my friend at Blackwater, till it was late in the evening, I cannot say what time it was, as I had been drinking freely; he wanted me to stop all Friday night, but I returned home from Blackwater upon a very small horse, and before I had rode eight miles, I was obliged to get down and walk, which I did, to Egham; I then fed him; and when I came on again, I met a person on horseback, and asked him what road he was going; he said, he was going near to the Magpres, on Hounslow-heath; I told him if he would not go too fast, I should be glad to accompany him; I came along with him till within two miles of the Uxbridge road, when I got off again, and led my poney; a person in a market cart overtook me, and I got into conversation with him, and as we were going along, we overtook a man with these pigs on the foot-road; I says, farmer; firs I, what have you got there; he replied, I have got a few hogs; I asked him where he was going with them; he said, I am going towards town; I asked him if they were for sale, and where he brought them from; he said, from Uxbridge; I asked him whether he was going to take them to any body particular, and he said, no; I told him if he would bring them to my house, as I dealt a little in the pig way, I would buy them, and I gave him my address; he told me he could not bring them into town, for that he was going to lodge them at the Red Lion, at Paddington; I asked him the price of them; he said, three guineas and a half a-piece; I said, I could buy good pigs for about two guineas; in the dark they appeared small; the person who was along with me held my horse, and I felt them; I told the man I would meet him at the Red Lion, at Paddington, and try if I could buy them; he said, he would as lief fell them to me there, as to meet me at the Red Lion; I agreed with him that two guineas and a half a-piece, by what I could see of them, was a very fair price; I gave him two guineas earnest, and kept helping to drive the pigs till within a mile of Bayswater, when he said he wanted to step into town, and if you will continue driving the pigs to the Red Lion, I will meet you there; I continued driving them till I came to the corner of the Black Lion, when I said, does this take me to the Edgware-road, and some person said, yes, that is the Edgware-road; I drove the pigs on as gently as foot could fall, till I was just got up to Paddington, when Mr. Peele came up to me, and said, I want you; I answered, I will go back with you, or you may go along with me; he said, no, you must come back with me; says I, I am going to lodge these pigs at the Red-lion, at Paddington, and if you will go with me you may see the man I had them of; but he said no, and we walked together to the Blacklion, at Bayswater; and when the owner of the pigs came, I gave him my address, and told him in what manner I came by them; that is all I have to say.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called fourteen witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Peel.) Q. Did I understand you right, that the prisoner told you he was hired to drive them by a person? - A. Yes, my Lord, he said he was hired to drive them.</p>

About half past eight at night, I went to Mr. Mills's, the sign of the China ship, with my son; I saw Mr. Mills, and he said, you have got a very quarrelsome man, I think, coming to work with you, meaning Mecking, the deceased; I placed myself in the opposite side of the room, with my son, in the box; there was Mr. Dawes, Meeking, Mr. James Tyne, and Edward Jackson, all shop-mates; at this time, Meeking was challenging

            , and challenged him; then Mr. Mills, the publican, came, and said, if you don't be quiet, I will turn you out of doors; I persuaded Meeking, all I could, to be quiet; he went out of the box about five minutes after that, and what arose between the prisoner and him, I cannot say, but they went out of doors; I set with my back towards the door; in about ten minutes after, a man came into the house, and said, there were two shopmates fighting; I went out, and they were in the dark, both in the mud; there was nobody by to pick either up; I went and assisted Dawes, who was uppermost; being a little intoxicated, I and Dawes fell down together; a person says, pipe-maker, you are not capable of picking the man up, let me do it; I staid by near a quarter of an hour, and I saw them have several heavy falls; the deceased was stronger than the prisoner; I heard it said that the deceased would not fight any more, and Dawes went into the house; I followed him, and about three minutes after that, the deceased was brought in, and I heard the words said, they thought he was no more; immediately Dawes said, for God's sake send for a surgeon; he was sent for, and came in about five minutes; he endeavoured to bleed him, but no blood would come; I have known the prisoner these twenty four years; and from a boy to a man, I have never seen him wranglesome, fighting, or quarrelling, but always a civil young man; the deceased, whenever he had a drop of liquor, was always quarrelsome and fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say he squared at you? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HEBRON sworn. - I am surgeon, and attended the deceased at Mr. Mills's house; I considered him to be dead; upon examining him, I found seven bruises on the chest, but one in particular on the back part of the head; a concussion from the blow on the back part of the head, I think was the cause of his death; I opened his chest, and examined it to see if he was hurt inwardly by the bruises, but he was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I declare I never in my life had the least malice or intention to injure the man, but always would have done any thing to serve him, as, I believe, he would me; the accident has hurt me so much, that I have been very unhappy, and can say no more.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL WOODLEY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Brown: On Monday morning, about ten o'clock, of the 17th of November, I saw the prisoner coming out of our warehouse, with a parcel of rice in a piece of hammock, and I saw him conceal it in a parcel of hemp, which was in Mr. Elliott's warehouse; it was necessary to pass through Elliott's warehouse to get to Brown's; I asked him what he had got there, he said, I have got nothing; I turned the hemp over, and found the rice, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030051"/>same as he had; I took it away in his presence, and asked him how he could be guilty of such an action; he said, what; why, says I, stealing the rice; I then went over to the warehouse opposite; I was walking underneath in the warehouse, and heard the rice rattle on the floor, and upon going up I discovered the prisoner; I then went and informed Mr. Brown; I examined the casks, and found a cask had been broke open; it was the same sort, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Was there any body in the warehouse at the time you supposed the rice to be stealing? A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q.Does not Mr. Ellioft deal in rice? - A. I have known him have a very small quantity of East India rice, but this was Carolina rice.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prisoner taken into custody? - A. On Friday the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you not to take him into custody on the spot, when you detected him? - A. I was not going to take the law in my own hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not continue in his place, and not abscond? - A. Yes; I did not see him the next day, but the day after I did, and Wednesday and Thursday, and took him up on Friday.</p>

             sworn. - I live in this house, to superintend the repairs, it is a very large house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nobody's dwelling-house, then, at the time the lead was lost? - A. No; the house was repairing, for the purpose of being let out or sold.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in it? - A. Six or seven months.</p>

               <p>Q. Whole furniture was in the house? - A. My furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any grates in the house? - A. Yes, in almost all the rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the house at the time the lead was stolen? - A. Yes; my wife waked me, and I heard a noise in the house; I went down without my shoes, and a sword in my hand; I called to a Mr. Garrart to come to the front part of the house; I heard three, if not more, in the house; Mr. Garrart had by that time got to the west end of the house; the prisoner, Smith, was then coming out of a window in the front of the house, the breakfast parlour window, which is about nine feet high from the ground; I holloaed to him, and told him I would blow his brains out if he stirred an inch further; then he tried to run away; Garrart was at the other end of the house behind him, I ran the other way and met him; he gave himself up, and said; there were more people in the house, that he had gone into sleep; we took him to the toll-house, where the weigh-bridge 1s, in custody, but we were so long getting him there, that when we got back the others were gone; we found the lead in a bag, and also a billhook and a saw; upon examining the house in the morning, we went to the top of the house, and saw this lead gutter taken up, it was fixed behind the chimney on the roof, the nail-holes agree exactly.(The lead and the bill-book produced.)</p>
               <p>- GARRATT sworn. - I was called up by Mr. Emery; as soon as I came down, I saw the prisoner about half way out of the house; I went to the west end of the house, and Mr. Amery to the north end, been in to sleep, and there were people in the house, he did not know who they were, he had done no harm; we took him to the toll-house, I saw the lead sitted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not give myself up? - A. Yes, he gave himself up; he said, he had heard some voices in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Amery.) Q.What way could he conveniently get into the house? - A. He told me he got in the way he came out; there were no sash frames in, but the shutters were nailed, and had been force; the fill of the window was much above my reach; he said, the shutters were not fastened, and he got in very easily; he said, he went to sleep in the place where the caprenters work, under the grindstone, that was the laundry, over the coach-house and stables, where we had had about three hundred weight of lead taken away the day before; I said, you know that place well, no stranger could find it out, or expect a room there; he had to go up one stairs, and down another; I found the plaisterer's ladder against the well-hole of the stair-case and out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q.Must it have been done by more than one of them? - A. I am convinced there were more than one; the moment I gave the alarm, the prisoner came down from the two-pair of stairs where I found the lead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the place to sleep, I did not do any harm to nobody, I am a labouring man, and was never in any trouble in my life before; I work at farmering work.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Amery.) Q. Is it not the house where they are getting gravel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. I know the house perfectly well; I have rode past night and morning, and thought it was very easy for any person to get in either by pushing a board or not pushing a board.</p>

               <p>ANN NEVE sworn. - I am the wife of Stephen Neve, I keep a hosier's shop: Last Wednesday, the prisoner, and another boy came in to ask for gloves and stocking; I told them, I had not any that would suit them, but I shewed them some; they would not do; the prisoner said, he would call again in a day or two; as they went out, I missed a pair of stocking; I went to the door, and called out to stop this boy, and this young man brought the prisoner back, and the stockings.</p>

               <p>MURRELL sworn. - I saw the prisoner and another boy come out of Mrs. Neve's shop, and I stopped them; I ran after them, and just before I came up to the prisoner, I picked up a pair of stockings in the dirt; I don't know who dropped them, the other boy took another way; I found the stockings the way that the prisoner took, and I delivered them to Mrs. Neve.(The stockings produced, and deposed to by Mrs. Neve.)</p>

            , and George Whitfield; we had some rice and sugars on the wharf at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q.What description of sugars had you there? - A.Havannah sugars packed in chests.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sugar all of one colour? - A. No; some was white, and some brown; they were both packed in chests of the same description; some people call the brown yellow.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 17th of September, was any thing missed from your wharf? - A Yes; the whole contents of the two chests of the Havannah sugar; there might be some pounds left; in consequence of that, I got a search-warrant, to search a house that I had often heard of as a noted receiving house.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that? - A. Grant's he had two houses; I had a search-warrant for each.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were these two houses situated? - A. In Little Hermitage-street; the outlet of Dundee-wharf is into wapping High-street; opposite that there is a narrow covered passage, leading into Hermitge-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the regular course to Little Hermitage-street? - A. No; we searched both the houses of Grant; Mr. Woodwell, the officer, with two assistants, a Mr. Hatchman, and Mr. Cooper, the King's locker; we searched e very part of the house above and below, and we were, I believe, almost coming away; the shop appeared to have been nearly clean swept, except just behind the door where the broom had escaped; I observed a few grains of sand, as I thought; I put my finger down, and perceived it to he sugar; I think I then said, it is not far off; I then discovered a hogshead of sugar, but that was of a very different sort from from what we had lost; I put my hand into it, and found some paper, we-tore the paper, and found under it, white sugar, it could no be more than a yard, or a yard and a half, from where I saw the sand, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q.What sugar was that? - A.As near as I could discover, the same as that which we had lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it or not Havannah Sugar? - A. I cannot swear to that, it is what we call Havannah sugar; it is that kind of article that no one can swear to in my opinion; the cask was then bored, and we found another sort of sugar under the white, resembling the other sort of sugar that was lost.</p>
               <p>Q.About what quantity was there of it? - A. I did not weigh it, nor was I present when it was weighed.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to that sugar, had there been any dealing for it? - A. Yes, I have paid for it since; one of them was of my own importaion, the other I had in charge for a friend, since which, I have paid for them both, twenty-five pounds and a few pence; my friend's name was Willaim Lee, and his partner, Charles Banks.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose sugar was it before you sold it? - A. I had sold mine; it had gone though several hands, and Mr. Lee's had done the same, as I understand, and as I had received the money, I was obliged to pay it back.</p>
               <p>Q.How much had you paid for each? - A.Thirteen pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence for the other; I think those were the sums.</p>

               <p>Q. And what the yellow? - A.About six-pence half-penny, or near to seven-pence; if I had sold ten thousand pounds worth, I should not have sold it for a less price; I beg leave to correct myself, I said one of them was my own importation, I rather think it was not, for I had bought some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the sugar was worth that without the duty? - A. The short price without the duty.</p>

               <p>Mr. Watson. Q.Though it is impossible for any body to swear to the identity of sugar, two sorts of sugar, white and yellow were found in this hogshead? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they correspond with that which was remaining in the warehouse? - A. Yes, as well as I was able to judge.</p>

               <p>Q.The sheds were not locked? - A. Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to trace the sugar from the wharf to any other place? - A. Yes, I traced it up a passage that goes from facing of our wharf to Great Hermitage-street; there was sugar scattered all the way along to the end of Great Hermitage-street; I traced it quite to the corner of Little Hermitage-street, but did not trace it any further.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the end of that trace to the house of Grant? - A.Within five or six doors.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you with your master and the officer when the house was searched? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing near the chests, from which the sugar had been missed? - A. Yes, a crow which had been left in the warehouse, in the first story, and I found a bag just within the door, on the righthand side, near the street; that bag was, the night before, at the further end of the warehouse, full of sweepings of rice; I looked at the inside of it, and found sugar in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there sugar enough left for you to observe the colour of it? - A. Yes, it was whited brown, such as had been taken from the chests.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it like the finest or the coarleft of the two? - A.Like the coarleft, or the yellow, as they call it; there was a hole in the bottom of the bag, that had Straw or hay in it to stop the hole.</p>
               <p>Q.After your master had searched Grant's house, did you go there? - A. I did, I took the weight myself, it was seven hundred weight and ten pounds nett before, and we found it weigh twenty-four or twenty-six pounds less afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know what it weighed before? - A. By dedecting the tare.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you ascertain the weight before? - A. By the King's number.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the quantity at Grants' such as if it had been restored, would have filled, or nearly filled these two chests? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you compare those two sorts of sugar that you brought from Grant's, with the two chests that were left? - A. Yes, and they were as much alike as possible; I have not the least doubt but they were the same.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HEATH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a King's-officer, a revenue-officer; I had the sugar under the King's lock, at the Dundee-wharf; On the 16th of September last, I left the wharf about six o'clock, at the usual hour of locking up; I locked up in company with Woodley; I saw the wharf again the next morning about six o'clock; the evening before, there was a quantity of sugars ready for shipping, on the wharf, which is covered over, the same as a warehouse; the next morning, I observed two chests, with their heads nealy beat in, they appeared to have been beat in with some instrument, a hammer, or some such thing; there was a very small quantity left in them.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you endeavour to trace any sugar? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know the weight of these two boxes the night before? - A. No, I do not take the weights, I only attend the shipping of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Woodley.) Q.Had a person of the name of John Green been at your wharf the day before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Brown.) Have you seen Green since the 19th of September? - A. I think the 18th was the last time I saw him; I had some suspicions, and I mentioned this robbery to him, and he ran away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am headborough of the parish of St. Paul's Shadwell; on the 17th of September, I went with Mr. Brown, with a search warrent, to search Grant's premises; in searching the premises, as we were coming out almost, in consequence of a suspicion of something that laid behind the door, I observed a hogshead with something white on the outside, it was nearly full of sugar, very brown; I put my hand down and found a paper; I removed the sugar on one side, and found the other sugar covered all over with paper, and under that was the sugar that Mr. Brown said, he believed was it; I think Grant said, what is that? I said, it is what we have been looking for; how did you come by it? he said, he knew nothing about, it was in the house before he came; Grant's wife wanted us to bore the hogshead at the bottom, to try the sample that way, but we bored it in the middle, and found it to be sugar of the quality that Mr. Brown had described; the top was white, and about the middle yellow sugar; we bored the bottom of the hogshead, and found that ot be a different sort of sugar, much coarser; I headed the hogshead up, put it in a cart, and took it to the office; it has been in the care of the locker ever since; the sugar is in the yard, here are the samples in Court. (Produces the samples of all the diffferent sorts that they found.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You went to two different houses of Grant's? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The other is an oil-shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not you know that the oil-shop was his own? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know that he married the widow at that grover's shop, about three weeks before? - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who has the samples of that which remained in the chests?</p>
               <p>Woodley. I have. (Produces them)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brown.) The Havannah sugars are pretty much of these two qualities, the yellow and the white? - A. There are as many desecriptions as can be.</p>
               <p>Q.These samples would, correspond with a great deal of the same fleet in which you made your importaion? - A.Certainly.</p>

On the 16th of September, I saw Green again, about seven o'clock in the evening; he came in, and told me, you will have the sugar this evening; Mr. Grant was in the parlour, and I went and told him what Green had said; he then went away; Mr. Grant then said, I think, to Mrs. Grant, he hoped it was safe; she said, she dare say it was.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. That is impossible; what male-servent was turned away; it could not be you, because you never had any disagreement with him of any consequence; but what male-servent did he turn away in disgrace, for getting to bed to the maid? - A.Not any body that I know of.</p>

I asked you just now, if any fault was found by Price and his wife with you for any greater offence than not sweeping the shop, or not getting up early enough, or staying of your errands, and you said, no; were you not reprimanded yourself, and the servant sent away, that you might not have any further connexion with her? - A.She was sent away.</p>
               <p>Q.And you severely reprimanded? - A. I was spoke to about it.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before this story of the sugar, was this reprimand? - A I suppose about three or four months, or four or five months, before Mrs. Price was married.</p>
               <p>Q. Now having had time to recollect yourself, earlier in Mr. Price's life-time, was there no higher fault than staying of an errand, or not sweeping the shop; was there any female child in the family? - A.There were four children.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any female child? - A.One boy and three girls.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, in Mr. Price's lifetime, were you not severely reprimanded, and made the subject of great displeasure and great disagreement between you; were you not supposed to have been guilty of some misconduct towards one of these children; was not such a crime imputed to you? - A. Yes; but that was the greatest falsiry as could be.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a child of Mr. Price's, with whom this was supposed to have taken place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A child living in his family as one of his insants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what age might that child be? - A.Three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. Now answer me before God and this Court, and that Jury, upon your oath did they not severely reprimand you? - A. No, it was only the servant maid told him of it, and he did not believe it, because he did not think I should be guilty of such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there after that? - A.Six or seven months, I suppose.</p>
               <p> Q.And how came he, at last, to turn you away? - A. I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your own accord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is that young woman, that you have been speaking of, now? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you quite forgot the circumstance that you had ever received any reprimand, or had any disagreement, about going to bed to this maid servant? - A. You asked me if any body was turned away.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not be turned away, because you were an apprentice, you know? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Where have you been since you left Mrs. Grant's; you have been at Mr. Browns, have not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been examined upon this subject? - A.Twice.</p>
               <p>Q.Twice at the office? - A. Yes.</p>

                  </persName>
             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am by trade a smith: I live in Church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you at any time after the death of Price, enter into partnership with his widow? - A. Yes; an apprentice of the name of John Bartlett managed her business, before I came into partnership.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you continue in partnership? - A. Ten weeks, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity at that time of observing his conduct, and forming an opinion of his character? - A. Yes; when I first entered the partnership, I found this lad had the sole management of the business, which he had had, I understood, from the time of his commencing apprentice, till that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When did you enter into partnership? - A. It was in the month of November, 1799; when I came to the place, and he found I was to be his master, he positively declared to me, he was an apprentice to Mrs. Price, and such he would remain, for he never would have a master to rule over him in those premises; I told him he must be an apprentice, that I came there to be his master; but he said, he would not be mastered by me, that he would see me out of that business by some means or other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q.Are you positive that, besides these expressions, he used the other, that he would never have any master over him in those premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been asked here to day, upon his oath, whether he could tell how the partnership between you and his mistress came to be dissolved, and what was the cause of briging about that dissolution; he has told my Lord, and the Jury, that it was, because the business was not sufficient to support two families? - A. That has been an observation that he has often made; and he would, in a whispering way, tell me, when I have come home, that Mrs. Price had taken money out of the till, which was not accounted for, and which, I believe, not to be true.</p>
               <p>Q.From all you have known of him, from the opportunities you have had of seeing his conduct, I ask you, whether you think he is a person, where a man's life is at stake, who may safely be believed upon his oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were a juryman, would you think yourself safe in finding a verdict upon his evidence? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you think him more addicted to falsehood than to truth? - A. In many respects; I cannot say in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030060"/>Q.Do you believe you could have continued in the partnership, while he was in the house? - A. We could not agree together; for there was mischief laid between us by this boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of your dissolution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And must he have known it? - A. He must have known it, because, I believe, he planned it he would be master of the premises himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Let us know a little about you: What are you by trade? - A. A smith; my father was a smith, and I was afterwards a servant to a grocer.</p>
               <p>Q.Now you have returned to your business, as a smith, again? - A. I came from the country between sixteen and seventeen, and served my uncle fifteen months, who is a grocer, another time seven months, and another time five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return to your old business of a smith, after that? - A. Yes, in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there? - A.Two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you sell in that shop? - A.Patten rings; that is my business principally, as a smith, and tools for patten makers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in old iron? - A. No; no old iron at all.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were in partnership with Mrs. Price, did you live in the house with her? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Entirely? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a back yard to that house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if you ever received any sugar through that back yard? - A. I believe I have in small quantities, but not of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of dealers were those who came through the back yard? - A.There has been men come with small quantities of sugar for sale.</p>
               <p>Q.Men that are known by the name of lumpers? - A. I do not recollect any such people; to say what they were, I do not positively know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sugar mechants? - A. I cannot say what they were; I believe they might be seafaring men or sailors; they might bring about a dozen or fifteen pounds; being upon my oath, I am bound to tell the truth; during the ten weeks I was there, it might happen twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bills of parcels with those goods, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Does that back way lead from the river? - A.It leads into the street, not far from Hermitage-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not fifty yards from the stairs? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you purchase rice? - A. I recollect purchasing some at Gravesend, and Hall's, in Mark-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you none brought to you to purchase? - A. I do not recollect that there was any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. It has been more than insinuated, that you have kept an old iron shop, and been a notorious receiver of stolen goods; I ask you, upon your oath, is that true? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS HALL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am a stock-jobber: I lodged in the house of Mrs. Price last March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this boy, Bartlett? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been asked here, upon his oath, whether his mistress ever reprimanded him, or found fault with him? - A. She had a just reason; I wanted him to be turned away about his business, but she did not know where to get another person to carry on the business.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the offence? - A.Getting to bed to the servant girl, who had not been a fortnight in the house; I believe, not a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What age was the girl? - A.About 16 or 17.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether, if you were called upon to find a verdict, as Juryman, which was to depend upon his oath, should you think it safe to trust him? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Then I need hardly ask you, in a case which affects a man's life, you would believe him? - A. No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.Did you ever know him examined before in a Court of Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What is your reason for saying, you would not believe him? - A. I think him a very bad boy for getting to bed to the girl in that way.</p>

             and William Haydon: I took stock on the 9th of October; there was not then any deficiency; we had a porter of the name of William Brady; he was discharged on Saturday previous to the 24th of October; there was no stock taken between the 9th and 24th; there was then deficient one chest of congou tea, and one chest of fouchong tea. On Monday, the 27th of October, I saw a chest of tea at the Mansion-house, the property of Messrs. Basire and Haydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that it was in your warehouse on the 9th of October? - A. No, I cannot, but there was no deficiency upon that day, (the chest produced); here is a mark of my making with a marking-brush, "13," on the 26th or 27th of March last, that signifies the 13th break.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether any of that break was sold by your master? - A. Not one single chest; we have made all the enquiries we could after Brady, but have not been able to find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr Alley. Q.I suppose you know what the stock is, from what the surveyor tells you? - A. I always take stock with the surveyor.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, when the surveyor came, you did not know the exact number of chests then in the warehouse? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Your master has sold a great number of chests since the month of March last? - A. Yes, but not of that break.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not by comparing the entries on time with abother, that you find there is any tea missing? - A. I could not ascertain that any tea was missing till I took the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is by comparison with the book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Then I trust your Lordship will strike this evidence out, as not being the best that the nature of the case affords.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Would such a rope as that facilitate the escape of a person out of prison? - A Certainly it would.</p>
               <p>Gross-examined by Mr. Alley. As to this prison, I do not know the situation of it, these things did not find their way into the prison, but into the lobby? - A. No, they never went inside the prison at all; she was stopped in the lobby.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that saw, and tell me what use that may be put to? - A. I think this saw sufficient to cut any bar that we had asunder, in a very short time; this rope would be sufficient to let any one down from any part of our prison to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things brought to the jail with your consent and permission? - A. No; the next day she came before the Lord Mayor, and said her name was

               <p>This prisoner was tried in September Sessions on an indictment, charging him, in the first Count, with uttering and publishing as true, certain, false, forged and counterfeited acquittances for many, (fating them), with intent to defraud our Lord the King, the said

             well knowing the same to be false, forged, and counterseit. The second Count charged the prisoner with uttering one of the said acquittances with the same intention; and the third, with forging the same, with the like intention.</p>

               <p>The prisoner's Counsel applied to the Court, that the Counsel for the prosecution should state on which Count of the indictment he would proceed, and that he might be restricted from going upon any other, that the prisoner might not be put to answer several distinct offences; but the Court refused the application, as the indictment charged the uttering of all the receipts. The trial accordingly proceeded, and it was proved by very clear and satisfactory evidence, that the prisoner had uttered all the receipts at one and the same time, by delivering them to the solicitor for the Navy Board, as vouchers, to verify the accounts of one Collinridge, who was then deceased, which the prisoner had undertaken to settle. Upon this objection, I think the learned Judge acted rightly in resufing the application - of that opinion are the other Judges; in truth, the evidence justified what the learned Judge supposed would necessarily follow.</p>
               <p>It was also objected on the part of the prisoner, that forging, or uttering, knowing to be forged, the receipts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030064"/>in question, was not under the circumstances of this case, an offence within the true meaning of 2 Geo II. chap. 25. sect. 
               <persName id="o18001203-1-person602">I. </persName>
            inasmuch as the acquittances for money purported to be receipts given to Mr. Collinridge, by workmen employed under him for the Navy Board, for work done, and materials found about that business; and it was urged that the Navy Board had not any concern with the workmen employed under them It is material, in considering this objection, to read the words of the statute, 2 
               <persName id="o18001203-1-person603">Geo. II</persName>
            . chap. 25. sect. I."If any person shall falsely make, forge, or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made, forged, or counterfeited, or willingly act or assist in the false making, forging, or counterfeiting any deed, will, testament, bond, writing, obligatory bill of exchange, or promissory note for payment of money, endorsement, or assignment of any bill of exchange or promissory note for payment of money, or any acquittance or receipt, either for money or goods, with intention to defraud any person whatsoever; or shall utter or publish, as true, any false, forged, or counterfeited deed, will, testament, bond, writing, obligatory bill of exchange, promissory note for payment of money, acquittance or receipt, either for money or goods, with intention to defraud any person, knowing the same to be false, forged, or counterfeited, then every such person being thereof lawfully convicted, according to the due course of law, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and suffer death, as a felon, without Benefit of Clergy." A subsequent statute, 31 
               <persName id="o18001203-1-person604">Geo. II</persName>
            . chap. 22. sect. 17, extends the punishment to the same offences, with intention to defraud any Corporation. The facts, in the case, prove the forgery of receipts, supposed to be given for money for work done for the Commissioners of the Navy Board, that is, for the King, by persons employed by one Collinridge, and for which these would have been vouchers, and would have entitled him to an acquittance from the Navy Board, because the money had not been paid by Mr. Collinridge, and was not, therefore, due from the King to his representatives. These, then, are forged acquittances, published to defraud the King, and the facts prove, and the Jury have found the prisoner guilty of uttering them, knowing them to be forged; the Judges are, therefore, of opinion, that the indictment states, and the facts prove the case as charged, founded upon that statute.</p>
