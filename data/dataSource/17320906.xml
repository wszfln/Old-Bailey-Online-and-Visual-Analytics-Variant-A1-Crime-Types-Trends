I had left in a Bag 119 l. 19 s. and a bad Guinea in my Desk, besides a Snuff-Box, a Silver Watch, 2 Pair of Pistols, and 3 Gold Rings, and in my Parlour a Silver-hilted Sword.

            . One of Mr. Joshua's Advertisements being left at my Shop in Burst-wood, as soon as I had read it, I recollected that I had seen such a Man as was therein described, and another with him, pass by my Shop the same Morning. I took 2 of my Journeymen, and followed them to Brilerecay, which is 5 Miles. We heard such Men had been there, but could not meet with them, though I searched all the Alehouses in the Town; we pursued them to Chelmsford, and at the Cock and Coach there we found them early next Morning. I read over the Advertisement to them, and bid James hold up his Head (for they both held their Heads down) that I might see if he answer'd the Description; then I told him that I believed he was the Person, he said that he was the Man that was Guilty of the Fact, and wished that he had never done it. We found upwards of 110 l. and a Brace of Pistols upon him, and another Brace of Pistols upon his Brother David, and this broken Silver-hilted Sword was taken out of a Bundle which David had in his Custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner J. B. When you first came in was the Bundle in any Body's Hands, or was it lying on the Table, you or not?</p>
               <p>Swain. It was in David's Lap, or under his Arm as he sat, and the Sword was taken out when we were before the Justice.</p>

            . My Master, Mr. Swain, took me with him to pursue the Prisoners. Hearing at Billericay that they were gone forward, we took Horses at Midnight, and followed them to Chelmsford, where we found 'em next Morning. When they saw us, they hung down their Heads; says my Master to James, Hold up your Head, that I may see if you answer the Description in the Advertisement, I am afraid that you are the Men; yes, answer'd James, I am be indeed, and I wish I was not. I saw about 110 l. taken from James, and a Watch and a Snuff-box and 3 Gold Rings. When Mr. Jeffries came down, he asked James why he took the Pistols? And James said, We were resolutely bent to lose our Lives rather than to be taken.</p>
               <p>J. B. No, I said the Pistols and Sword were taken not with a Design to hurt any Body, but only to strike Terror.</p>

Mr. Swain, a Periwig maker of Burntwood, came to me with an Advertisement, and told me, that he had heard the Prisoners were at the Cock and Coach. I took Assistance, and went in first ; I looked in at the Door a Minute, and saw they were buying 2 Whips of a Sadler, and they said they had hired two Horse for Colchester. I told James I was come to take him up for robbing his Master, a Hair Merchant, on Snow-Hill. The Neighbours said, Take care, he has put Pistols. I demanded the Pistols, and he let me take them quietly, and seemed to be very much surprized; says I, if you are not the Person you need not be afraid, for you can come to no harm; I wish I was not, says he, but to show you that I am, I have all the Effects, and will produce them. Then he pulled out a handful of Gold, and some other things, the particulars of which I wrote down for my own Security ; there were eight Pieces of Foreign Gold of 3 l. 12 s. each, I piece of 5 Moidores, 2 pieces of 36 s. each, 1 double Guinea, 12 Moidores, and 45 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jeffries. One of those Guineas was not good.</p>
               <p>J. Smith. 1 Spanish Pistole, 5 Broad Pieces of 23. each, half a Broad Piece of 11 s. 6 d. 2 Quarter Moidores, 3 Bank-Notes, 1 for 100 l. 1 for 50 l. and 1 for 40 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jeffries. I did not put those Notes in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. 1 Silver Watch, 1 Silver Snuff-Box with a spotted Shell, 3 Mourning Gold Rings, 1 pair of Pistols; and all these Things he said were the Property of his Master Jeffries. My Assistant took another Pair of Pistols from David.</p>
               <p>Court. Who had the Bundle ?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. I can't say, it was either in David's Lap, or lay by him.</p>
               <p>D. B. Did not you order me to take the Bundle and carry it before the Justice?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. I don't remember that I did.</p>

            'Tis easy, my Lord, for a Man who knows his own Innocence to find Words to defend himself; but how difficult a Task is this for one who, like me, is loaded with Guilt? One who is sensible of having committed a Crime of so high a Nature against two kind and generous Masters. Yet I hope there are some Circumstances of Alleviation to be found. I will appeal to my Master himself, if I have not, during the time I have been in his Service, behaved myself with Honesty and Integrity in all Thing, except in this one unhappy Instance. 'Tis not possible to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060004"/> declare with what a Compulsion on my own Mind I committed this Fact, and what Strugglings I felt in my Soul before I was overcome and yielded to the Temptation. My Master having told me, that he had provided himself with another Book-keeper, I applied to the Honourable

            , by whose Means I was recommended as a Book-keeper to Mr. Woodny, a Scotch Factor. Mr. Woodny requir'd 200 l. Security; my Master Jeffries said he would give me a Character, but would not be bound for any Man; and I having no Friend in London that I could be so free with, as to desire him to be bound for me, I lost Mr. Woodny's Place, and had no Prospect of any other Service. Then it was that the base Thought of wronging my Master enter'd my Soul. Poverty and Want appear'd frightful to my Imagination, and raised a Multitude of false Reasonings and Suggestions, which at length prevailed over me; Words cannot express the Terrors that attended my Guilt. How often was I upon the point of returning to my Master, but the Dread of Shame still prevented me, and hurried me on to my Ruin! When the Persons who took us entered the Room, we made no Resistance, but peaceably surrendered our selves to Justice, and I readily delivered up every thing that I had wrongfully taken. As for my Brother I hope he will not suffer for my Crime, which he was ignorant of.</p>
               <p>D. B. I call'd on my Brother the Day before we went away together, and he desired me to take a Walk with him in the Country next Morning, and I accordingly met him about 5 o'Clock, for I was out of Place, and my Time was at my own Disposal. He gave me a pair of Pistols, and a Bundle to carry for him; but he did not tell me how he came by them, nor did I know any thing of the Fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the Sword put up in that Bundle so as not to be seen? Swain. Yes; it was a Bundle of soul Linen; there were 5 or 6 Shirts in it, and the Sword-blade was broke off pretty short. The Jury <rs id="t17320906-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

On Sunday-Noon I locked my Pocket-Book with the Notes, in my Bureau, which stands in my Chambers at No. 15. in Clifford's Inn, and went to Dine with the Dean of Durham at Chelsea, as I usually do on Sundays, when he's there. I returned from thence with Mr. Gray, the Dean's Brother, about 8 in the Evening, and when I came Home I found my Laundress waiting for me in the Gardens. She told me that when she came to my Chambers, she found the Door open, and the Drawers of my Bureau lying on the Floor; that she acquainted her Sister with it, who advised her to leave every thing as it was, and lock the Door, and that she did so accordingly. In this Condition I found my Room; my Drawers were tumbled, and my Pocket-book with all the Notes gone. I advertis'd 'em, with a Reward for whoever brought 'em to Mr.

I told her I had lost a Pocket-Case with Notes in it. She said, she had found such a one. Graham said, he saw a Constable in the Street, whom she called Broadon P, and charged him with her. Says she, don't walk with me in Publick, but let me go and I'll fetch 'em. I was not willing to trust her, and so we followed her close to her Lodgings. There she told us, they were upon the Bed's Tester, and we found 'em accordingly. She said, she found 'em on a Bench in Gray's-Inn-Walks, on Wednesday the 8th of August.</p>

Lord, bless me, says she, I wonder who could do it; but at last, upon examining her closely, she confess'd that she had taken it, and given it to a young Fellow, who persuaded her to it. She said he pulled out a Knife and swore he would kill her, if she did not get my Money for him; and that when she had given it to him, he said, Ye Bitch, this will serve me but a Fortnight.

This is always the Trade, says my Father, when I am cut of the Way; you can never let the Children alone. She said she would do so again if she had a mind to it. My Father told her, then she should not stay in his House any longer. But she would, she said, and gave my Father a great many ill Words; and so my Father took her by the Arm to lead her out. She was very full of Liquor, and stagger'd much; her Foot hitch'd against the Door, and she fell with her Stomach against the Chair, and then with her Temple against the Grate.</p>

The Deceas'd went in, and then said his Wife, It's hard that we can't stand at our own Door to take a mouthful of Air, but we must be choaked with your Dust. Damn you, you Bitch, said they, go in and send your Buck cut, and we'll thrash him. With that the Deceas'd came out, and kick'd their Screen down; and they set it up again nearer his Door than before, and begun to screen their Rubbish, which made such a Dust that I ran up to shut my Window, and in the mean time the Blow was given; so that I did not see how it happen'd. When I came down the Deceas'd was very bloody, and his Wife came out with a Candle in her Hand, and went to a Neighbour's House, and coming out again presently, she said, You Villain, you told me it was past 11, and it is but half an Hour past 9, for I have been to my Neighbour's Clock to see.

            . I am a Namesake, but no Relation to the Deceas'd. I came home about 11 at Night; Aye, says my Wife, you stay out till a fine time of Night; here your Neighbour has been murder'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sadler, Surgeon. Coming home on July 7. about 10 at Night, I found the Deceas'd in my Surgery. He had a Wound in the upper-part of his Head to the Scull, but without any bad Symptoms of Vomiting, &amp;c. In 6 or 7 Weeks the Wound was near healed ; and then he omitted coming to be drest for 2 or 3 Days. I enquir'd the Reason of it, and was told, that he was a little Melancholy, which I did not like; but his Friend said, he believ'd it only proceeded from his being frighted at hearing me talk of an Exsoliatim, which he thought was something terrible to be done to him. I assured his Friend that it was only a slight Operation, and shew'd him the Nature of it, and that it might come off with a Plaister; but still the Deceas'd was afraid to come. In a few Days I went to him, and found he was better, and therefore only advis'd him to keep on the Plaister. On the 8th of August Word was sent me that he had had a it; I thought a bad Symptom, and advis'd that a Physician might be sent for. I propos'd a Trefining, that is, opening the Scull, but his Friends were all against it. However, I sent for another Surgeon, but he could not come, and the Deceas'd dy'd about 4 next Morning. I open'd his Scull, and found the Membranes of the Brain inflamed. I made an Incision in the Brain, and discharg'd a quantity of faetid corrupted Matter, which is generally occasion'd by a Shock or Blow of something heavy  and which I thought was the Cause of his Melancholy.</p>
               <p>Court. If he had come regularly to have been drest, do you think that his Death might not probably have been prevented?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sadler. I doubt it; I think all the Chance we had for saving his Life would have been to have open'd his Scull sooner.</p>
               <p>Dr. Smithson. On the 8th of August, I heard the Deceas'd had had a sort of a Fit; I found him stupid, dull, and almost senseless. Trefining (or as the old Term is, Trepaning) was propos'd, but his Mother said, She had rather he should die quietly than go thro' that barbarous Operation. As this would not be suffer'd, I fear'd he was past Relief, except a brisk Purge had a good Effect. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060013"/> try'd it; it work'd till 11 at Night, and then ceas'd. He had Convulsions at One in the Morning, and lay rubbing the left side of his Forehead ; says I, there lies his Hurt, and you'll find it under the Membranes of the Brain. Another Surgeon was sent for, but he could not come till 7 in the Morning, and the Deceas'd dy'd at 4. A Piece of his Scull being taken off, we found an Inflamation on the Membranes of the Brain. The Surgeon thrust his Instrument in, opposite to the Wound, and there issued a great deal of yellow corrupted Matter, which was the Consequence of the Blow, and the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Deceas'd came out and struck Darby 2 or 3 times.</p>

             my God! O my Dear! Then the other three fell upon me, and the little one beat me on the Head with the Pistol, and they all got about me, and pull'd me on the Ground. They took off my Shoe-buckles, took away my Hat, my Watch, my Pocket Looking-glass, my Handkerchief, 6 s. 6 d. and 2 French Pieces of Silver, one of 24 Sols, and one of 12 Sols, and then were going away; but just as I was getting up, one of them came back and took one of my Knee Buckles, thinking it had been Silver, and then gave me 2 or 3 Knocks on the Face, and so left me, and I went home. After this, one Kirk, a Bailiff, came to my House, and ask'd me if I had not been robb'd at such a time? I said, Yes. And did not you lose a Watch? said he; I told him, Yes. He shewed me a Watch, and ask'd me if that was mine? And I said, Yes; and then he told me, that he fetch'd it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I ask'd the Prosecutor if he knew the Marks of his Watch? And he describ'd it to me, and said the Maker's Name was Lugg, and he shew'd me a Piece of String that match'd with the String of the Watch. Sutton told me of the robbing this Man in Marybon-fields, and by Sutton's Information I found this Watch at the Rose in Stanhope-street, where it was pawn'd for 38 s. which I paid, and took it out.</p>

Patrick presented the Pistol, and then knock'd him down with it; and then we all fell upon him, and while he was down, tore off his Knee-Buckle with part of his Garter.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prosecutor swears, not that he left the Knee-Buckle when he was down, and you were all about him, but that you were going away, and then one turn'd back, and took it from him as he was rising.</p>

               <p>Will Booth. We all met at one Buck's, a Gin-shop in St. Giles's, where we use to drink; and from thence we went towards the Bason in Marybon-fields, where we met this French Gentleman. Patrick held a Pistol to his Head, they struggled, and Patrick knock'd him down with the Pistol. I took his Watch, and a Copper Pocket-Piece, and Glass; Sutton took his Handkerchief, Hat, and 3 s. 6 d. and Meeds took his Shoe-buckles, and one Knee-Buckle, and tore the Garter off with it. Then we went over the Fields, and hid the Hat by a Bank; so to the Two Brewers in Holborn, where we had 2 Pots of Beer, and then went to the King's-Arms in Laurence-Lane, where we all lay in one Bed for 1 s. Next Morning Sutton went to the Three Cocks, near Hicks's-Hall, and pawn'd the Hat for 2 s. 6 d. the Buckles in Chick-Lane for 3 s. 6 d. and the Watch by Clare-Market for 38 s. and I sold the Pocket-Piece for 10 d. in Holborn. Then we went to an Alehouse over the Water, kept by Meeds's Mother's Acquaintance; there we eat Bread and Butter and Cucumbers, and drank Bottled-Ale, and shared the Money: We threw away the Handkerchief, and threw the Knee-Buckle over St. George's Church, and the Pocket-Glass over a House in Holborn.</p>

            . I called to the Chair-men, but they lost 'em.</p>
               <p>Booth. Sutton and I with the Prisoners, went round Grosvenor-Square, and seeing no body but the Prosecutor, Patrick and Meeds went and got before her, by the End of Little George-street, and stopt her. Says she, What do you want? And, says Patrick, What, are you saucy ? And with that he cut her over the Head with his Pistol. So that the Blood ran down. She cry'd out and Meeds cut her Pocket off. There was 3 Guineas, an old Handkerchief, and a Pair of Gloves in it. I found no more Money, but Meeds, I believe, had finger'd her Pocket first, and then bid me take it. As we were going away, Viner White turned back and pull'd off her Apron. When we came to a Lamp in Piccadilly, we took out the Things. I had the 3 Guineas. We threw the Gloves over the Rails of a Gentleman's House; and then we went to a Gin shop in Drury-lane, over-against Short's Gardens ( where we knew the People usually got up by 2 in the Morning.) There we pawn'd the Handkerchief for Half a Pint of Gin, and staid till 8 or 9 a Clock; and from thence we went to the Goat in Newport-Market, and got some Steaks for Breakfast.</p>
               <p>Viner White. Booth has ow'd me a spite ever since I beat him in the Skettle-Ground.</p>
               <p>Sutton. We robb'd the Prosecutor in Grosvenor-street by the Corner of Little George-street. Patrick struck her on the Head with a Pistol, and knock'd her down. Meeds cut her Pocket, in which was 3 Guineas, a Handkerchief, and a Pair of Gloves. Then we went over White-Conduit Field, and so to a Gin-shop in Drury-lane, where we pawned the Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there nothing else taken from her?</p>
               <p>Sutton. No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prosecutrix swears, and so does Booth too, that one of you turned back, and pull'd off her Apron.</p>
               <p>Sutton. I believe there was an Apron, now I think on't.</p>

Deliver your Money, Doctor! I answer'd and said, Gentlemen, I am in your Power, do with me as you please. Then 3 of them rifled me of a Guinea, and 3 Half-Guineas. I had my Snuff-box in my Hand, and thinking to save it, I flung it into the Ditch. They observed it, and asked me what it was that I had flung into the Ditch? I told them, Nothing; but they would not take my Word, for one of them stopping down, found the Snuff-box. They felt about my Waistcoat Pocket, and asked me what I had got there? And I said, Only some Drugs for poor People; and so they went away. It was so dark I can't be sure that the Prisoners are any of those that robbed me,</p>
               <p>W. Booth. I and the 4 Prisoners were at Buck's Gin-shop in St. Giles's all Day, and at Night we concluded to go a robbing. We went up Tottenham-Court Road, and near the Halfway-house, betwixt Hampstead, and Kentish-Town, we met this Parson (the Prosecutor.) Patrick had one Pistol, and I another. Patrick went up to the Parson, and bid him stand; and then searching one of his Pockets, took out 3 s. and some Halfpence, and two Farthings ; and Meeds searching the other, found 3 Half Guineas. I saw the Parson throw something down, and asking him what it was that he threw away, he said, he threw away nothing. Yes, but you have, says I; and stooping down, I found it was a Silver Snuff box. I took it up and gave it to Vaughan, and he afterwards gave it to his Creature, who is now in Newgate, and she sold it for 6 s. and brought us the Money. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060017"/> an old-fashion'd Box, all wroughted at Top. While the others were examining the Parson's Pockets, Vaughan and White stood threatning to shoot him thro' the Head if he did not stand still; but I'll say that for the Gentleman, he was very easy. Smith. Not so easy as you think for.</p>
               <p>White. Was I there?</p>
               <p>Booth. Yes.</p>
               <p>Patrick. Who held the Pistol to the Parson?</p>
               <p>Booth. You did.</p>
               <p>Patrick. Of what Size were they that robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were all Boys of a small Size.</p>
               <p>White. I had known Booth but a Fortnight, by playing at Skettles with him, and happening to meet with him and some others, as he was going Home, I bore him Company, and by the Way we met this Gentleman the Parson; but as soon as I perceiv'd they intended to rob him, I ran away.

               <p>Harnet. I lodge in London Alley in Moorfield's. I had Occasion to go to one Citon's, who keeps the Harp and Crown near Iron-gate. When I came from thence it wanted 10 Minutes of 10 a Clock at Night. I lost my Way as I was going Home, for I was a Stranger in Town, it being but 10 Weeks since I came from Ire-land. Somewhere or other I met the Prisoner, and asked him which was the Way to Bishopsgate-street. He said, that the Way I was going was one Way, but not the right Way. I told him I would give any Body a Penny or Two-pence to shew me. He offer'd to go with me himself, and I consented. Then he carried me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060018"/> up one Street, and down another, till I had gone, I believe, thrice as far as it was to my Lodging. Sir, says I, you must certainly be wrong; you have either surrounded me, or lost your Way yourself. No, says he, you was a great deal out of your Way when I met you, but now I shall soon set you right. So in a little time more he brought me into Upper-Moorfields ; then I told him that I know whereabouts I was, and therefore would give him no farther Trouble; and with that I offer'd him a Penny. He said, that would not do, for he had come a great Way with me. Then says I, you shall have 2 d. He said he would have more; but I told him he should have no more, and I would not be impos'd on. I had no sooner spoke but he whistled, and up came another Fellow, who clapt a Pistol to my Breast, and swore, if I stirr'd or spoke, I was a dead Man. Then they turn'd both my Pockets inside out, and took from me 5 s. 9 d. Says the Prisoner, I believe your Buckles are Silver ; as indeed they were, but I told him they were not. However, he took one out and look'd at it, and swore it was good Silver. No, indeed, says I, they are but white Metal, they cost me no more than a Groat, and if you take 'em away, I have not a Groat more in the World to buy another Pair. Before he could take the other Buckle out of my Shoe, we heard some People talking, upon which, he and his Companion run away. Court. Was there any Light that you could see the Prisoner's Face by?</p>
               <p>Harnet. Yes; I took Notice of him by the Lights at Peoples Doors as we came along; he had a black Complexion, and bushy Hair, and his Hat was flap'd ; and after he had robb'd me, I recollected that I had seen him twice or thrice playing at Cudgels at the Ring in Moorfields ; and next Day I saw him there again, and so I took a Constable and apprehended him.</p>

He had receiv'd a Letter from his Wife at Cork, desiring him to go to Mr. Caton's, by Tower-hill, and that was the Occasion of his going thither.</p>

            . As I was going over Middle-Moorfields, near the Tentor-Ground, the Prosecutor was asking 2 Men what a Clock it was? I told him past 10. Says he, I have been robb'd just by the Wooden House (for so he call'd the Booth.) I walk'd with him towards his Lodging, and there he took me by the Arm and Ing'd me in, and said he lodg'd there. Then he call'd for a Quartern of Gin, and ask'd me my Name? I did not know what he meant by it; I was almost afraid that he intended to charge me with the Robbery, tho' as it happen'd he did not; but he pull'd some Silver out of his Fob to pay for the Liquor. I wonder'd how that Money escap'd the Hands of the Man who robb'd him.</p>

While we were there, as I was sitting at the Prisoner's left Hand, and the Constable at his right, the Prosecutor desir'd us to search him; I searched the left Coat-Pocket next me, and found nothing; but the Constable searching the right, pull'd out some Goosberries, and a Silver Buckle.</p>

            . I live at Marybon Half way-House. About a Fortnight ago the Prosecutor had been at work for me, and then he went farther. He came back about 8 at Night; I was then standing at my Door. He told me he had been robb'd of 2 s. 2 d. Half-penny, and very much abused, and so indeed he was, for he could hardly go, and he describ'd the Men to me.</p>
               <p>James Townsend. On Thursday the 17th of August, about 10 at Night, I had Word brought me, that a Constable was wanted to take a Street-Robber. It being my Watch-Night I took a Watchman with me, and went to the Bullhead Alehouse by Smithfield, and there I found the Prisoner Sharp and the Prosecutor. The Prosecutor told me, that he had been robb'd, that Sharp knock'd him down; that he recovered himself, and thought he should have made his Part good with them, but they knock'd him down again, and that some of them (but he knew not which) took 2 s. 2 d. Halfpenny from him. I desir'd Sharp to confess if he was guilty, but he said he was innocent, and that he was Servant to Capt. Thorold, and could give an Account of himself. Next Day, being Friday, he was committed to Newgate. The Prosecutor got a Warrant for the other two; one he said was a Piper, and the other (whose Name he said was Henly) was a Dancer at Tottenham-Court-Fair. I went to the Fair, and waited for them; Mills was taken that Night, and Henly on the Sunday Morning following. When the 3 Prisoners were examined, they contradicted one another a little about their Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>I examin'd into the Prosecutor's Character; he said he serv'd his Time with Mr. Hopkins a Cooper in Thame-street, who had been dead 20 Years; but I met with Mrs. Hopkin's Son, who said, he knew the Prosecutor, and had employ'd him. I enquir'd of several other Coopers in and about Thames-street, who said, he was a very honest Fellow, and a good Workman, but that he lov'd a Pot.</p>
               <p>- Evans. I live in Neals-Yard in St. Giles's, near the Prosecutor. On Thursday Morning he came to me, and shew'd me that his Hand was lame; he said, that he had been robb'd over Night in Marybon-fields ; that the last Place he was at in Marybon was Mrs. Taylor's House, where he had earned 1 s. I told him of a House of ill Fame in Marybon; we went thither to look for the Prisoners, but not finding them, we went from thence to Tottenham-Court-Fair, where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060022"/> found them all 3. We follow'd them (and 2 Oysterwomen with them) to Holborn-bridge, and there they parted, and Mills and Henly, with the 2 Women went up Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Sharp. When the Prosecutor took me up at the Bull-head in Smithfield, he said, he believ'd I was the Man, but could not swear it. Upon which I told him, I'd make him pay for false Imprisonment. Nay then, says he, right or wrong I'd swear it.</p>

            . I was drinking at the Bull Head, when the Prosecutor brought Sharp in with him, and said, Won't you sit down? What do you want with me? says Sharp, Why, says the Prosecutor, (looking hard at him) I believe you are one of the young Men that robb'd me. What do you mean you Villian you? says Sharp. But, says the Prosecutor, I can swear it was you, or the Devil in your Cloaths. Can you, says Sharp, why then if you don't, I'll charge a Constable with you for charging me with a Robbery. Sharp sent for a Constable, the Prosecutor said, If you are not the Mare, you may go about your Business. The Prosecutor was going out, Sharp stopt him, and said, he would make him pay for scandalizing him. Nay then, says the Prosecutor, Since you are saucy, I'll swear it by God, right or wrong.</p>

               <p>Court. A Gold Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold. Yes; there were two Seals hanging to it, one was a Cornelian, with my Coat of Arms, and the other a Chrystal with Cicero's Head.

However, they went away between 12 and 1, and charged me to take care of the Parrot, and to desire Jacky, when he came, to stay there for them.</p>
               <p>Next Morning Mr. Bays came from High-gate, to enquire after the Prisoner, and Stannet, and Jacky, and told me that Jacky had robb'd him of 40 or 50 l. Jacky came about 9 o'Clock. Mr. Bays seiz'd him, and he confess'd that he had stolen the Goods, and that they were all in the Trunk. Soon after a Waterman brought this Letter* for Jacky. 'Tis directed for John Carbury, but he goes by the Name of Conan. The Waterman said, that the Person he had it from was in his Boat. I look'd out of Window, and saw the Prisoner in the Boat; upon which the Constable went down and took him. When the Prisoner came up, he said to Mr. Bays, Billy, if Jacky has done this foolish Thing, and you can have your Goods again, I hope you will give him no farther Trouble. We ask'd the Prisoner, whose Things they were in the Box and Trunk? And he said, they belong'd to the Gentlewoman [Stannet .]</p>

               <p> Jack, I beg you will take all the Things, and come where you was Yesterday as soon as you can; you will see me as you come along on the Right-hand of the River, as soon as you are through Bridge. J. R.</p>

               <p>Harrison. Both the Prisoner, and the Gentlewoman desir'd me to help 'em to take those Things out of the Coach; I took the Deal-Box, and the Parrot Cage, and the Coachman brought the Trunk. In the Trunk or Box, I know not which, we found, among other Things, 2 Seals, and 2 Rings, one of them a Diamond Ring. Madam said before the Justice, that the Seals were old Family Seals of little Worth, and that the Rings were her own. As those Seals were own'd by no Body else, they were deliver'd to the Care of

            . The Prisoner and Stannet took Lodgings near my Mother's House, and he brought the Trunk with him, my Mother keeps the Red-Lion at Highgate. One Conan, whom they call Master Jacky, came to see him, and brought such a Horse with him as Mr. Arnold has describ'd. They recommended Conan to my Mother for a Lodger, Conan lay at my Mother's o' Saturday Night, and robb'd her of the value of 50 l. and went off; on Sunday Morning the Prisoner brought a Hackney Coach from London, and he order'd the Coachman to take in the Trunk, the Box, and the Parrot, and then Madam Stannet went into the Coach, the Coachman drove back again towards London; but the Prisoner said he would walk over the Fields, and meet 'em out of Town. Finding that my Mother had been robb'd, I went to London, and enquir'd among<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060028"/> the Hackney Coachmen, for one that had taken up a Gentlewoman and a Parrot at Highgate. The Circumstance of the Parrot being pretty remarkable, I found out the Coachman, and he told me, that he drove them to the Fox at Hungerford-Market ; and there Master Jacky, and Madam, and the Prisoner were taken and committed to the Gatehouse; but Master Jacky made his escape out of Goal.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pedly. You had a whitish Coat, a light Bob-wig, and a scallop'd lac'd Hat. I am satisfy'd that you are the Man, not only by your Face, but your Voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant. I was at the Fox at Hungerford-Market, when the Prisoner and Jacky were taken. And this Seal was found in the Prisoner's Box. I heard him own that it was his Box.

            . I saw the Prisoner hold the Pistol to Mr. Pedly, and I cry'd out to him not to shoot; but he swore, and threaten'd he would, if Mr. Pedley did not immediately deliver. I saw the Prisoner afterwards in the Press-Yard, and presently knew him to be the same Man.</p>
               <p>Third Indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pedley. As soon as the Prisoner had robb'd me, he went to Mrs. Wingfield, who was in the Chaise with me. He held a Pistol in his Right-hand, and extended his Left, in order to take her Purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In order, did you see me take it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pedley. Yes; it was a Green Purse, and I saw some Gold in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You saw; you do but think so, must a Man lose his Life upon your Thoughts? How should you know what was in it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pedley. We called at a House, on Edgworth Road, and when I went to pay, they could not change my Money, upon which Mrs. Wingfield said, she had got small Money, and so she open'd her Purse, and I saw several pieces of Gold in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swear very plain; have you any thing else to say?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. When the Prisoner had robb'd Mr. Pedley, he came to me, and in very rough Language demanded my Purse and Rings. I had no Rings, but gave him my Purse. There were in it a Moidore, a half 3 and 20 Broad-piece, a Quarter of 5 and 20 Piece, some Silver, and several Notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you swear that you was in the Chaise with Mr. Pedley?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. A bright Bay, with a black Main and Tail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Well, I must not be suffer'd to stay till I can have my Witnesses, and therefore I am incapable of defending my self any longer; 'tis very hard. But are you sure, Madam, that I am the Man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. Yes, very sure; I knew you again, the first time I saw you in the Press-Yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, Madam, what have these Whores-Birds given you to swear all this? Are you Mr. Pedley's Wife?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. No; but I am a near Relation.</p>

I look'd for my tall Friend to assist me, but he join'd with the other Rogues; one of the two clapp'd a Pistol to my Breast, and demanded my Money; they robb'd me of 6 s. 6 d. my Cane, and my Coat, and then bid me go forward towards Mother Red-Caps. I believe the Prisoner Bumpus is the tall Man who came for me. He's like him, but I will not be positive.</p>

            . On the 4th of May last, the 2 Prisoners and I met at Mr. Blackwell's, the Cakeman, in Purple-Lane, by Hatton-Garden, and we agreed to go and rob upon Enfield Road. We went to Stoke-Newington, and sent Bumpus to Mr. Haycocks, the Apothecary's, to tell him that the Man at Mother Red-Caps was taken with an Apoplectick Fit, and wanted him presentl. Bumpus came and told us (for we wanted hard by) that the Man would not come except he staid to come with her. We bid him go back and wait, which he did, and brought the Prosecutor with him; Shelton demanded the Prosecutor's Coat and Money. I afterwards heard that Shelton was taken up at Maidstone, and so to ease my Conscience, and for fear of being hang'd, if he should swear against me, I made my self a voluntary Evidence, as soon as I had an opportunity of taking Bumpus, which was on the 29th of July last. I met him accidentally in Newgate-Street, and asking him to go and drink with me; I took him to the Sun Coffee-House, under Sir William Billers's Office. I left him there, and finding Mr. Taylor the Constable, at Sir William's Door, I surrender'd my self, and went with him before Sir William, and gave my Information, and then we went and took Bumpus in the Coffee-House.</p>

               <p>Shelton. I am sorry to hear that Gentleman gave me such a Character, I did not expect it from him above all Men, for he knows nothing of me, but by common Fame.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been at Brocksburn; call'd upon Brigadier Franks, at Enfield, and then came to the King's-Head Inn, and call'd for a Pint of Beer; but recollecting that I had some Business at Dr. Wilson's, I went thither, and it being late I did not return to the Inn as I intended, but rode directly for London. The Place where they say they were robb'd is between Forty-Hill and Maiden's-Bridge, about 2 Miles and a Half from Enfield. The Road there is so narrow, that a Horse can't pass a Coach, and therefore is a very improper Place to commit a Robbery in. My Horse was Chesnut, not black, and had a small Blaze down his Face, but was not bald-fac'd. It's very unlikely that any of these Witnesses should see the Colour and Marks of my Horse so plainly in the dark, as to be able to know them.</p>

            , who spoke English, ask'd me, how far I was bound? I told him to Dover. He said, they were going the same Road, and should be very glad of my Company. I reply'd, I had a little Business to dispatch in the Town, and then I would wait upon them. I went out to see for a Constable, but could find none. I acquainted the Man of the House with the Affair, and desir'd his Assistance; but he was afraid to venture. By this time the Prisoners were ready to mount; but I resolving that they should not escape, seiz'd on De Vic, just as he had put one Foot in the Stirrup, and oblig'd him to go in again. I search'd them, and found this Box upon Cray, and examining him about it, says he, De Vic has broke open Mr. Elton's Trunk, and stole several of his Goods, and has given me some of them. Among other Things that be took out, there was a Diamond Ring, that was sold to Mr. Dautry (I think he call'd him) in the Strand. De Vic told me, that he, had left his own Cloaths and Sword, and Mr. Elton's Horse Furniture, with a Taylor in the Strand; who, he said, knew that the Furniture was stolen. Cray then took me aside, and said, My dear, I am an Officer in the French Service, and if you'll go over with me I'll procure a Commission for you After this De Vic call'd for a Pen and Ink, and wrote this French Bill, which Cray took up, and gave me. He said it was a Bill of Exchange, drawn on De Vic's Uncle (who was Ambassador in Holland) for a 1000 Livres, and if I would go thither, I might have the Money directly. I kept it, and seem'd to believe 'em, till I could get more Assistance to bring them home.</p>

            . On Monday the 10th of July, about 8 at Night, the Prisoners and a Servant came to my House with a Trunk, and asked if I had any Lodgings to Let? I told them, yes, and so they went up Stairs directly. When Mr. Elton was gone to Tun-bridge, they desir'd to be lodg'd in his Room. I told them I expected first to be paid what they ow'd me; they said, I should have it on Monday. So I let them go in, and on Monday I ask'd them again for the Money, and they desir'd me to stay, but till Mr. Cray went out to fetch it. Then Mr. Cray went out, and when he came in again they paid me. Mr. Elton had left his Trunk in his Dressing-Room; and soon after they had paid me, their Man came, and asked me, if I had got the Key of that Trunk, for, says he, My Masters are packing up some rich lac'd Cloaths, and I know they have none such of their own. So I went and searched the Prisoners Trunk, while they stood by, and there I found these two Suits of lac'd Cloaths that are Mr. Elton's. Lord, bless me, says I, you have ruin'd me; and with that they thrust several Things into their own Trunk, and went away directly, and I was so surpriz'd, and ready to sink with the fright, that I had not power to stop them. They went in a Hackney Coach. P. Cray. Did I not give you the Key of my Trunk as soon as you ask'd for it? Mrs. Gibbons. Yes. P. Cray. And when you open'd the Trunk, and I saw the Cloaths, I said, the Marquis has put up these Cloaths, and they belong to Mr. Elton. Mrs. Gibbons. You said the Marquis had taken care of Mr. Elton's Cloaths, and I said, Yes, finely, in your own Trunk.</p>

            . I was Servant to the Prisoners occasionally. As I came into the Room, Mr. Cray was packing up some Cloaths in the Trunk that belong'd to both the Prisoners; I did not then see what Cloaths they were, because they were in the Trunk, and he was pressing them down to make the Trunk lock, when I came in; but before he had quite done, he was call'd out, and Mr. Maccarty and I were left in the Room. I wonder, says Mr. Maccarty, that Mrs. Gibbons should be so pressing upon these Gentlemen for a little Money, when they must be Persons of Worth by their having such rich Cloaths in their Trunk. I knew they had no such Cloaths of their own, and therefore I acquainted Mrs. Gibbons with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maccarty. I knew Mr. Cray at Paris. he came to me on Monday Morning, and told me he was injur'd. I gave him advice as a Surgeon; after which he told me, that the Marquis was in trouble, and wanted to dispose of a Diamond Ring. We went in the Marquis's Chariot to Mr. Darker's, a Jeweller in the Strand; there we were offer'd 34 l. for the Ring, tho' we were told, it would have been worth 60 l. if it had been of a clearer Water. We came back to the Marquis, and Cray told him that he could get but 34l. Then I must take it, says the Marquis, tho' that Ring, and another little one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060035"/> cost me 2000 Livres (which is about 100 l. Sterling) I know the Bailiffs are waiting for me, and that 34 l. may clear me of my present trouble, and serve me till I have Remittances.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is this Ring? Mr. Burrow. I bought it of Mr. Darker. Court. Produce it. Burrow. I forgot to bring it.</p>
               <p>Justice De Veil. I seal'd it up, and gave him strict Orders to bring it to Court; but I suppose they are afraid the right Owner should have it again, for it was 5 or 6 Hours before I could bring 'em to produce it.</p>
               <p>Court to Burrow. Fetch it immediately, or I'll commit you. Burrow. I will, my Lord. [Whispers a Friend.]</p>
               <p>A Witness. Here's the Ring, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Who gave it you? Witness. Mr. Burrow, for fear he should lose it. Court. How long have you had it? Witness. About an Hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrow. This is the Ring I bought of Mr. Darker for 40 l. and he has my Note for the Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maccarty. This is the Ring that Mr. Cray sold to Mr. Darker's Man for 34 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elton. This is the Ring 1 lost out of my Trunk. I bought it about 4 Years ago of Mr. Sharack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharack. I sold this Ring to Mr. Elton for 60 Guineas.</p>
               <p>De Vic. Mr. Maccarty brought me word, that he could get but 32 Guineas for the Ring, and I consented to sell it for that; but I never said that it cost 2000 Livres.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alexander. At Mr. Elton's Desire I went to Paris to enquire of Mr. Cray's Character. I met with his Aunt, Madam Estril, and some of his Acquaintance, who seem'd very much surpriz'd to hear of his Misfortune. They told me, that he had been Page to the Queen of Spain ; in general, I heard no ill of him. The Jury found them both <rs id="t17320906-38-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">

            . On Monday July 24. about 7 in the Evening, the Prisoner came to my House, and asked where the French Gentlemen (De Vic and Cray) were. I told him they robb'd Mr. Elton's Trunk, and had been go ne 2 or 3 Hours. Then. Madam, says he, I believe I know where to find them, and I don't doubt but I can take them. And if you should take them, say I, for God's Sake send me word. He went away, and I saw no more of him that Night. I met him a few Days after in Bond-street; and, says he, Mr. Elton has been no Loser by the Frenchmen; for I can prove that he has rather got 2 or three Guineas.</p>

No, I said I had got 2 Suits of laced Cloaths again, but I fear'd the Jewels were gone. Prisoner. I said, how came you to let the Men go, and you said, because you had got all the Things again.

               <p>Sherrard. I arrested Cray at the Prisoner's Suit for 17 l. 16 s. at a Coffehouse facing the Bagnio. Says Cray in broken English. Vel mine dear Shile, vare is dis Master Taylore? I vill pay him presaant. I call'd the Prisoner in, he spoke with Cray, and then said to me, let's go to another Place, and I shall get Satisfaction. We took Coach and drove to the King's Arms Tavern in New Bond Street; there we met with a Gentleman in Black; the Prisoner and that Gentleman went out together (leaving me with Cray) and came in again with a Porter, who brought a Trunk. The Prisoner then desir'd me to step out with him, which I did. He gave me a Guinea and a half for my Trouble, and told me that he had made it up, that he had got the Suit of Cloaths back which he had made for Cray, and 2 Guineas, besides a Silver-hilted Sword (which I had taken from Cray for fear of Mischief) and an old Velvet Furniture embroidered with Gold, which (he said) was not of much Value. So I left them between 9 and 10 at Night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Duchire.

            . I lived with Mr. Elton; and the Day we came from the Wells, he sent me to tell the Prisoner, that he would speak with him. I asked the Prisoner if he had heard of De Vic and Cray. He said he believed he knew where they were, and would help to take them up; for he was 15 l. out of Pocket by a Suit of Cloaths he had sold to one of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say I would tell your Master where the things were?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. No, you said you thought you could tell him where the Men were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elton. On Thursday Morning about 8, I came home from the Wells. Mrs. Gibbons having acquainted me with the Robbery, told me that the Prisoner came in 2 or 3 Hours after, and she inform'd him of it; and he swore, God damn them, he'd have them, and that she believ'd he knew where they were. I sent my Man to the Prisoner's House in the Strand. In the mean time Mr. Watson the Serjeant came in, and said he had got a Letter from De Vic, who with Cray was then at Gravesend. While we were talking, the Prisoner came in trembling, and said, Are you the Gentleman that has been robb'd? Dogs! Rogues! Villains! Damn them! And pray, Sir, what have you lost? I told him several things, and among them a Velvet embroidered Housing; says he, I believe I can help you to the Housing. I was just upon taking Coach for Gravesend, and as I was going out, I said I had lost some Cambrick Handkerchiefs. When I came to Gravesend, I put up at the Swan, and enquired after De Vic and Cray. The Landlord told me that they had been committed to the Care of the Constable; but as no Body came to accuse them, they were left at their Liberty to walk about the Town. I happen'd to see them just as they were coming down Stairs. Cray gave me the Key of his Trunk, and said, Your Housing is at Mr. Maine's and your Ring at Mr. Darker's. I brought them up in the Yatcht; and as soon as I came home, my Maid told me, that the Prisoner sent home my Housings in about an Hour after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060037"/> I was gone. I was advised to carry De Vic and Cray before a Magistrate directly; but they being fatigued with their Journey, were laid down upon my Bed; and I said, Let the poor Devils sleep, for they have had but little rest this Week. And they slept 5 Hours.</p>
               <p>When I went before Justice De Veil, I sent for the Prisoner to bring the Box with the Handkerchiefs, but he would not come till the Justice threatened to send a Warrant for him; but when he did come he brought the Cambrick Handkerchiefs with him, and said, How do you know these to be yours? I know them by the Marks, says I, and I don't know but you may have been an Accessary in helping the Men off, and at a proper Opportunity I shall take Notice of you. God damn you, says he, what do you mean by that? I have not yet got sufficient Evidence, says I, but when I have I shall answer you in another place. Aye, God damn you, says he, and I shall make an Example of you for scandalizing me. I told him I was not to be frighted by his Menaces, and so we parted. Prisoner. Did you not thank me for returning your Housings? Elton. Yes; but I did not then know what Sherrard could swear.</p>

One Day since last Sessions, when my Brother went to get Bail, the Prosecutor and Lawyer Grimes call'd on me, and Lawyer Grimes said, If you would save your Brother's Life, you must come down to me. Come down, says I. for what? Why, says he, pointing to the Prosecutor, Here's a Man that will swear a Robbery against him. Well, says I, what is your demand? Why, says the Lawyer, you must pay me a Debt (I think it was about 3 l.) that your Brother owes me, and give me something for a pair of Gloves, and 2 Guineas to this Man, the Prosecutor. Says I to the Prosecutor, Do you know my Brother? Yes, says he, I have known him a long Time; and why did you not prosecute him before? says I. Why, says he, because I was out of Town (tho' now he pretends, that it was because my Brother was an Evidence) but says he, if you'll satisfy Lawyer Grimes, and give me 2 Guineas, I'll make it up. And but last Week, Lawyer Grimes got a Guinea of me, at the Vine Tavern to give the Prosecutor; and last Night I was drinking with the Prosecutor at the Ship, and he own'd, that he had that Guinea of the Lawyer; and then he went out and left me the Reckoning to pay.

They chose one; we agreed upon the Price, and White gave me a Guinea to change. There not being Silver enough in the Till, I went to the Counting house, and pull'd out a Drawer, in which were 3 Bags of Money, and White followed me. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060040"/> out some Silver, and laid it on the Table; but before I had told out 15 s. I mist one of the Bags. I call'd to the 'Prentice in the Shop, and said, was not here three Bags? He answer'd, Yes. Upon which White in a Harry cry'd, Give me Change give me my Change Candy, who stood at the Door, calld out White, and said, Come along, what do you stay for ? And presently White, before I could stop him, hurried to Candy, and they both run out of the Shop together, without taking either the Cheese, or the Change, or the Guinea. I pursued them, and in the middle of Martin's Lane I stopp'd Candy. He struck me 2 or 3 times, and swore, if I did not let him go, he would knock m e down, but I brought him back to the Shop.</p>

By this Description we found the Prisoner in less than half an Hour, at a Brandy-shop hard by. We took up 3 or 4 0other suspicious Fellows, but the Boy immediately fix'd upon the Prisoner.</p>

            . On the 13th of July, about 2 in the Afternoon, as I was going along on one Side of Queen-street, the Prisoner was walking on the other. He cross'd the Way towards me, and said, C me hither my Lad; Carry this Letter over the Way, and I'll give you a Penny. I bid him give me the Money first. No, says he, I'll wait here for you, and you shall have it as soon as ever you come back. So I carried it; and as soon as I came from the Door I look'd for him, but he was gone from the Place where I left him. Mr. Fairchild call'd me back, and ask'd me from whom I had the Letter ? I describ'd the Prisoner to him, and they found him in less than half an Hour, and brought him to me at Mr. Fairchild's House, and I knew him again as soon as ever I saw him. This is the same Letter that he gave to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fairchild. And it is the same Letter that the Boy brought. I have mark'd it.</p>

            , Constable. Mr. Fairchild told me, that he had receiv'd another threat ening Letter, and had stopt the Boy that brought it. The Boy described the Prisoner to wear his own Hair, a brown Coat, and a speckled Handkerchief. We found the Prisoner sitting between 2 Women at the Brandy-show; he had a white Wig on then. I took up 3 or 4 other loose Fellows, and carried 'em to the Boy; he said, none of those was the Man; but as soon as I shew'd him the Prisoner, he cry'd, This is he, this is the right. Are not you a cheating Rogue? You promised me a Penny for carrying the Letter, but you run away, and never paid me: You had your own dark Hair on then, tho' now you have got a Wig. I took off the Prisoner's Wig, and found that he had a shock dark Head of Hair. After the Prisoner was committed to Newgate, the Brandyman, whose House he had frequented, sent me Word, that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me. I went to him in the Prison, and he said, I own I gave the Boy the Letter, but I had it from one

I did not like my Chaps, for I was afraid (by their bidding me drive from one Place to another) that they wanted an Opportunity of jumping out of the Coach, and bilking me of my Fair. I watch'd them, and at the Magpy Door I stopp'd and open'd the Coach, the Prisoner pretended to be drunk and asleep; we got him up, he staggar'd against a Post, and stood with one Hand in his Pocket, and the other at his Codpiece, as if he was going to piss. I demanded my Money; they said; they wanted something from their Aunts, who lived down farther, but did not care that she should see them; and if I would go and fetch it, they would shew me the Door, and if I did not go they could not pay me. I left my Coach, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060044"/> went with them to the lower End of Farthing I there they run into a little Ground-Room, in which I saw nothing but a Counter, a Case Knife, and 2 Women. One of the Women said to the Prisoner, Dear Billy, I am glad to see you ; but he up with the Case Knife, and holding it to her, felt a damning her, and asked if she had no Money? She told him, No; but if he would go to such an Ale-house, she would make him drink. So they went through several bye Alleys, and he sell a singing a Song of, The Miller and the High-way-Man, till we came to the end of King-street in old Gravel-Lane, and there he knock'd an Oyster-Woman down, and run into an Ale-house among some Whores, and swore he would dance a Horn-pipe; but he and the other Man soon came out again, and went along Green-Bank and Brew-house-Lane. I followed him at 2 or 3 Yards Distance. The Prisoner came back to me, and said, Damn my Eyes, what do you follow me for? I told him I was the Coachman, and only followed him for my Money; and if he would pay me, I should soon leave him. Damn your Eyes, says he, what Money have you about you? I told him 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. Damn my Eyes then, says he, deliver. So I pulled it out of my Pocket, and he took it out of my Hand, and then he damn'd his Eyes again, and took me a knock, and bid me go that way. So away I run to the bottom of old Gravel-Lane, there I met 2 Sailors, and told them I had been robb'd, but they would not follow him. Then I went to the Oyster-Woman that he had knock'd down, and asked her, if she knew who it was that gave her a knock, and she said, Yes, very well, it was Will. Flemming. I went back to my Coach at the Magpy Door, and the Landlord told me that he knew the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he threaten you before he took your Money?</p>
               <p>Oulton. He damn'd his Eyes, and said, he would knock my Brains out, if I did not deliver; but he did not strike me till after he had my Money. The little Man that was with him, said, Don't serve him so Will. don't rob him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Jo. Williams the Thief-Catcher took me up, and he afterwards brought the Prosecutor to see me in the new Goal, and said to him (pointing to me) That's the Man.</p>
               <p>Oulton. No Soul shew'd him to me, I pick'd him out my self from among a great many Prisoners in the Yard, tho' he had changed his Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It's a likely story indeed, that I should go to rob a Hackney Coachman of 3 s. the very Day that I came out of Newgate! why did he not bring the Oyster-Woman to prove that I was there.</p>

He had not been there above a Month or 6 Weeks, before he began to kiss me, and call me his dear Billy, and to meddle with my Privy Parts, and gave me Money not to speak of it. One Night he made an Attempt upon me, but I got out of Bed, and left the Tail of my Shirt in his Hand. My Mother mended the Shirt, but I did not tell her how it came to be torn. He continued to solicit me; he gave me more Money, and told me that he'd make me Heir to a small Estate that would come to him after his Mother's death, and cut his Brother off with a Shilling. At last, in about 3 Month's Time, he over-persuaded me to let him bugger me. And after that, he did it frequently while I continued at Mr. Nutt's, which was till August last.</p>

               <p>Curtis. I was an ignorant Country Lad, and did not know the Greatness of the Crime; and then he allow'd me 3 s. a Week constantly, besides Presents that he made me at other Times. He gave me last Easter these Cloaths that I have on now, they were made out of one of his Suits, and he paid Halfa Guinea for altering them.

               <p>Curtis. No: He always gave it me without asking. He lately gave me 2 s. at a Coffee-house, and 1 s. in Bridewell. The last Time he gave me money, was last Sunday was Sev'n-night.</p>

               <p>Court. And so you forswore yourself?</p>
               <p>Curtis. Yes. Court. Why?</p>
               <p>Curtis. Because he gave me money, and cry'd and begg'd me not to discover him; and promised if I did not, he would stand by me as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Court. And you really perjured yourself to save him. Curtis. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. After such a Confession, I don't see how the Jury can credit any thing you say. But how happen'd it that you impeach'd the Prisoner at last?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I could not be easy in my Conscience till I had done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe you had another Reason. Did not you fear that I should be an Evidence against your Character in the Trial of Catton and Bishop at Hicks's Hall for such Practices.</p>
               <p>Curtis. Yes, you did as much as threaten it, and I was obliged to do what I did in my own Defence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atkins. I keep Gray's-Inn Coffee house. Curtis having ran away, was brought to my House as soon as he was found. The Prisoner came to Breakfast with him every Day, and they talked privately together. I examin'd the Boy, and he told me the Prisoner had been the ruin of him, by allowing him Pocket-money, and promising to cut his Brother off with a Shilling. He said, that the Prisoner had given him Cloaths too, and had order'd the Barber to make him a Wig, and that they were to go over Sea together. Before the Prisoner came, the Boy had no Money, but I saw him have a Shilling after the Prisoner was gone. The Boy did not tell me any thing of the Crime, but I guess' at it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On what Day was the Boy brought to your House?</p>
               <p>Atkins. On Thursday, and you came next Day with several more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And what did I bring him?</p>
               <p>Atkins. You brought some Linen from his Cousin, Mr. Nevill, and some Books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Books?</p>
               <p>Atkins. The Whole Duty of Man, which I thought it would have been well if you had practised. Then there was Wake's Exposition of the Church Catechism, and Stanhope's

               <p>Mr. Nicolls. Last Winter was a Twelve-month I lodged at Mr. Nutt's, and one Night in March, as I was writing, Curtis came in, and said the Prisoner was come Home drunk, and was such a nasty Toad when he was drunk, that he would lye no more with him, and therefore desired that he might lye with me while my Bedfellow was Abroad. The Prisoner and the Boy sometimes quarrel'd. The Prisoner would say to him, You neglect your Work, and I am forced to do it for you; but if you don't mind it better, I'll tell your Master. And the Boy would answer, So you may, you're a nasty Toad. I have seen the Prisoner in variety of Company, drunk and sober, but never in any Company suspected of such Things, nor did I ever suspect him myself; but I know the Boy was an idle Boy.</p>

Once indeed, about 2 Years ago, the Boy told me that the Prisoner would have done it, but did not; but I never believed the Boy, because I knew he was a liar. I've seen the Prisoner box his Ears 2 or 3 times, for neglecting his Master's Business, and have often heard him give the Boy good Advice, which the Boy did not like; for he has said to me, that one Reason why he did not care to lye with the Prisoner, because he was always preaching Presbyterian Sermons to him.

The Boy complain'd to me about three Quarters of a Year ago, that the Prisoner was a Molly and a Sodomite, and that he had committed Sodomy with him, and been the ruin of him; I lay on the same Floor about 2 Years ago, and never heard any such Thing; when he told me this Story, I did not advise him to do anything, because, I did not believe him, and I did not believe him, because, I knew him to be a great Liar; and besides, he was a very idle Boy, and used to hide himself in Holes about the House, to keep out of the way of his Work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath. The Prisoner is a Relation of mine, he had a good Education, and as virtuous a Character as any Man I know, and I cannot believe he would be guilty of such Things; he served his time with Mr. Standfast, a Bookseller, in Westminster-Hall.</p>

Belt took him up and endeavoured to put him in again, but the hung-an-Arse, upon which Belt gave him a Knock or two over the Back, with his Hand, (for I can't say that he had any Weapon) and I believe to get him into the Pillory, but the other two Prisoners and a Chimney Sweeper laid hold of Waller, and stripped him as naked as he was born, except his Feet, for they pulled his Stockings over his Shoes and so left them; then they beat him with Collyflower-stalks, and threw him down upon the Pillory-board. The Chimney-Sweeper put something into his Mouth, and Griffith ramm'd it down his Throat with a Collyflower-stalk. Dalton and Griffith jumpt and stampt upon his naked Body and Head, and kick'd him and beat him with Artichoke and Collyflower-Stalks, as he lay on the Pillory-Board. They continued beating, kicking, and stamping upon him in this manner, for above 1/4 of an Hour, and then the Mob threw down the Pillory, and all that were upon it. Waller then lay naked on the Ground. Dalton got upon him, and stamping on his Privy Parts, he gave a dismal Groan, and I believe it was his last; for after that I never heard him groan nor speak, nor saw him stir.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see any body else stamp upon the deceased?</p>
               <p>Richardson. After he gave that dismal Groan the mob said he was dead, and they push one another over him; but I did not see any Body stamp upon him besides Dalton and Griffith.</p>
               <p>Council. And don't you think they might have avoided it if they would?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Yes, they might; but they did it designedly, for while they were stamping upon him, Griffith said to Dalton, Well played Partner, Dalton. And Dalton said, Aye, Damn him, I'll never leave him while he has a bit of Life in him, for hanging my Brother. After the Deceased had been used thus near an Hour, and every Body thought he was dead; he was taken up, and the Prisoner Belt assisted to carry him to St. Giles's Round-house, and then a Coach was brought and he put in, and carried back to Newgate, where his Mother waited to see him. Dalton and Griffith followed the Coach. As Waller was dead, those who belonged to Newgate refused for some time to take him in again, upon which his Mother went into the Coach to him. As soon as Dalton, and Griffith saw her go in, they cryed out here's the old Bitch his Mother, Damn her, let's kill her too. So they went to the Coach-door, huzzaing and swearing that they had stood true to the Stuff. Damn him, says Dalton, we have sent his Soul half way to Hell, and now we'll have his Body to sell to the Surgeons for Money to pay the Devil for his thorow Passage. Then they try'd to pull him out of the Coach, but were prevented.</p>
               <p>Court. Did this Witness give the same Account before the Coroner?</p>
               <p>Coroner. The Jury not being satisfy'd as to the Identity of the Persons who committed the Fact, (for Dalton was not present at the Examination, and there might be more then one of that Name) and the Fact being then charged as done by Persons unknown, I was not so curious in examining the Witnesses, and therefore no Indictment could be grounded on my Inquisition; but I believe the major Part of what this Evidence swears now was sworn by him before me.</p>

               <p>Richardson. I did not so much mind your Cloaths, but I took particular Notice of what you said, because you spoke about your Brother.</p>
               <p>Griffith. Do you know what Cloaths I had?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Yes, you had an old blue Coat tore down behind; and Waller before he was stripp'd, had a great Coat and two Waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Griffith. Was Waller alive when he was brought back to St. Andrews Holbourn ?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I can't say, for I thought he was dead before.</p>
               <p>Dalton. I would ask the Coroner if Waller had any Bruise upon his Privy Parts?</p>
               <p>Mr. King, the Coroner. I viewed the deceased the next Day, and I never saw such a Spectacle. I can't pretend to distinguish particularly in what Part he was bruised most, for he was bruised all over: I could scarce perceive any Part of his Body free.

            . As I came out of Mr. Britland's, where I had been drinking, I saw Belt put Waller into the Pillory, but the Colly-flowers flew so thick about, that Belt was forced to get off soon after he had put Waller in. Then I got upon a Post before an Oyl-shop, but one getting up upon a Lamp-post just before, hindred my seeing what post farther; and so I got down from thence, and got upon some Palisades, and then I saw Belt putting Waller into the Pillory again, and 2 Men beating Waller with Colliflower-stalks, but I don't know who they were, nor did I hear any thing they said, for I was a pretty Way off. Soon after, the Pillory was thrown down.</p>
               <p>Rich. Fuller. I stood in a Cart, in the middle of the Street, a pretty Way off. Belt put Waller's Head in the Pillory, but it did not say long there; for Dalton putting his Hand in the Waisthand of Waller's Breeches, tore them down, and pull'd his Head out of the Pillory: for there was such a Mob that Belt could not make the Pillory fast upon his Neck. I saw Griffith and Dalton go by me a little before. Dalton had a Blue-gray Coat, and Griffith such a Waistcoat as he has now; for I saw no Coat, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Cartwright Richardson. He had a blue Coae tore down behind.</p>
               <p>Fuller. When Waller's Head was out, he hung by one Arm for a Minute or two, and then fell on the Pillory Board. They went to put him in again, but he was obstinate, and fell down again. Then they beat him with Artichoak Stalks all over.</p>
               <p>Court, They! Who?</p>
               <p>Fuller. I can't say that I saw the Prisoners beat him, for there was a great Mob then, and I was a pretty Way off.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I stood close to the Pillory.</p>
               <p>Fuller. On the Thursday before (the Tuesday that) Waller stood in the Pillory, as the Carman (who was to carry the Pillory) was coming by Newgate, Griffith asked him where were his Orders for carrying the Pillory? and told him, that he had carried almost a Sack full of Artichoaks and Colliflower-stalks in readiness; and swore that he would do Waller's Business, and he should never live to stand at Hick's Hall. And a Day or two before this I met Dalton in Smithfield, and he said he wou'd be revenged on Waller, because Waller had hanged his Brother. I knew Dalton by seeing him often about Smithfield, and being always at Pillories; but I don't keep him Company, for I'm very honest. And afterwards when I and Mr. Britland a Sollicitor (who was Waller's Uncle) took Dalton in Smithfield, and thrust him into an Alehouse, he said, If Waller's Mother had stood in the Pillory, he would have served her the same.</p>

Why, says he, as the Women were going out, I saw the Chain hang out of one of their Bosoms, and so I brought her in again, and asked if you had lost any thing? And you said, No; but when I went again next Day, he told me, that seeing the Watch hanging loose about me, he took it away to take care of it.</p>

One of the Women was making her escape, I brought her back and waked him, and said, Are you sensible? and he answer'd, Yes. Then see if you have lost nothing, says I, 3 or 4 times over; he fell in a Passion, Damn you, says he, what's that to you, they have got nothing but what I gave them freely; so the Women went away, and I perceiving he held his Watch dangling upon his Finger, I was afraid he would-spoil it, and desir'd him to let me take care of it for him, and so he gave it me; I desir'd him to go to Bed, but he said, he would sleep there, and so he did, he lay and slept, and piss'd about the Floor with his Cloaths all unbutton'd; I sat up for him, and he call'd me about 2, and I gave him the Watch without any Words.</p>
