                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, carrying on business at the Crown, at Cricklewood, near Hendon—before that, in 1869, I lived in the Brixton Road; I was then a traveller for wine houses—shortly before that I had been in business as a wine merchant—I failed in 1869, and after that I travelled for Messrs. Toft and others—after I got into difficulties I applied to a person named Page, of Bayswater Road, for some money—he had a loan office there—I borrowed 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him; I gave him a bill of sale for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I continued to pay him interest on that for some time, at the rate of about 300 per cent., I should think; it was so much for every twenty-one days—first of all it was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I think it came up to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of that being so high I ulti<lb/>mately went to Bolton, and applied to him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay off Page's bill of sale—I told him the interest I was paying—I could have raised the rest from my friends; he agreed to that—I then gave him this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is dated 19th July, 1870, and professes to be for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it recites 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then due, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then paid—I did not owe Bolton anything at all at that time—before my bankruptcy I had had transactions with Bolton—at the time of my bankruptcy he held property belonging to me to the value of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was scheduled—it was a cart and phaeton, a bracelet and diamond ring—he had those actually in his possession—I owed him about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the goods were worth 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time I applied to him for the money to pay off Page's bill of sale he said nothing about any previous money owing—nothing had been borrowed since my bankruptcy—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did not pass—I did not then, or at any time after my bankruptcy, receive a single farthing from him—this promissory note for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given at the same time as the bill of sale—that is made out to Cooper—it was for the same transaction—I did not get any money from Cooper—Bolton told me Cooper was to advance the money—I never got a farthing from any of them—my goods were taken possession of under Page's bill of sale—my house was stripped; I did not see the goods afterwards—I was taken into custody for removing a horse and cart as being included in the bill of sale—Page was not present at the Police Court at first when I was charged; he came afterwards, and gave evidence—I saw Bolton at the Sessions, he was in the Court, and could hear what took place—I was tried and acquitted—Bolton heard that—I did not read this bill of sale—Bolton said it was to be for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard nothing more about it for six or eight months—during that time I got through my difficulties, and took the Crown, at Cricklewood—I had got it well furnished, and was carrying on a good business there—about the middle of May last, Bolton came down there, and asked me to pay his bill of sale—he did not produce it—I asked him for it, and told him I did not owe him a shilling—he said if I did not pay him he would strip the house, and expose me to my brewers, and every tradesman, and go to the brewery, and state that I had stolen a horse and trap, and was given into custody for it—I was very busy at the time, and expected my brewers every minute, and so, through intimidation, I foolishly gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a fortnight—he then left—my wife was very unwell at that time—he came down again about a month afterwards, on Whit Monday, with Cooper—Cooper had a place, at 8, Morton Street, Pimlico, the same place as Bolton—Bolton had a plate with</p>

I saw Tanner about eighteen months before these proceedings, at a public-house in Westminster, kept by Mr. Phillips—he was introduced to me there by Bolton, as Sergeant Tanner—I did not laugh and say "What, Sergeant Tanner that brought Muller over?" I swear that; nothing of the sort; nor did Bolton say "Yes, if you like"—we had nothing to drink together on that occasion—I was on business—I pulled up at the house for a glass of bitter beer, that was my business—the next time I saw Tanner was when he brought the order from Bolton—I have not been talking this matter over since I was before the Magistrate; I have never mentioned it—I parted with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Bolton upon intimidation, I wished to get rid of him—I did not want the trouble and annoyance of giving him into custody—that was in April or May, I think—when Tanner came to me with the order, I told him there was no answer—that is about two or three months ago.</p>

Levy, the salesman to Mr. Solomons, came and said "I can do with four dozen or six dozen of these stockings"—the prisoners came about half an hour afterwards—I told them what I had done, and Lynn went out and brought the stockings in a cart—I think there were twenty-eight dozen—the parcels were in a bag—I paid Lynn 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday, and a balance of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was left—they bought some goods of me, and I paid the balance and settled the account—I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—this arrangement was made with both prisoners—the stockings are in the same paper as I received them in—I gave the same price for the twenty-eight dozen, 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in H.M. Customs, and live at 52, St. George's Road, Peckham—on the afternoon of Saturday, 1st April, I was on the vatting floor of the London and Continental Wharf, at Wapping, which is in the possession of Messrs. Goulay, wine merchants—I was standing, talking to Mr. Geddes—I saw the prisoner come in—I recognized him as having been in the employment of Messrs. Goulay—Geddes was the first to speak, addressing the prisoner and a man named Taylor, who accompanied him, and who had also been discharged from the wharf—he said "I have nothing to do with your discharge"—the prisoner said "Yes, you have"—Geddes said "No, I have not; Mr. Goulay did it"—the prisoner then said "Mr. Goulay wants you"—Geddes said "Very well; when he sends for me, I will go"—the prisoner said "He does send for you; he wants you"—Geddes said "If he sends a special messenger for me, I will go"—the prisoner again said "He does want you"—Geddes said "I have nothing to do with your discharge, and I shan't go, unless a special messenger comes for me"—the prisoner then advanced towards Geddes, and said "I could" or "I would <hi rend="italic">scragg</hi> you"—he then placed his hands in this position, one at the back of Geddes' head, and one in front—I can't say that he actually seized him back and front, but his hands were put in such a position that I thought he intended carrying out what he said—the prisoner's back was towards me, and I could not say whether he touched or seized him—they immediately struggled together; it was a mutual testing for priority—I mean they were like two men struggling for the mastery—Geddes fell on his back—he was standing employed at the mouth of the vats, at the time, at what is called the man-hole—he was standing close to it all the time, not 3ft. from it—when he fell, he did not fall into the man-hole; he could not fall into it—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a small sketch of the place</hi>) this is a correct sketch of the vatting floor—it is a level floor, and there are four vats, each having a distinct man-hole—there are troughs, where several casks may be rolled and emptied at the same time, and the troughs empty themselves into the man-hole—when being used for the purpose of starting the wine into them, pieces of the floor are taken up—they were not removed at this time—Geddes was standing about a yard from this man-hole—he could not fall into it; impossible—I did not measure the orifice of the man-hole—I saw him fall down the man-hole, by the troughs, immediately over the man-hole—his head was pointing to the man-hole, his legs were a little raised up into the air—if the man-hole had been sufficiently large, he would have slipped down—his head was not in the man-hole, but in the shoot, or trough—the boards were taken off; it was all open—the operation was going on, and the troughs were exposed—when he fell, his head was at the man-hole, but in the trough—I could not say whether his head touched anything—the trough inclines to the man-hole—he fell across the trough; part of his body was resting on the edge of the floor, and his head was over the trough—Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140028"/>
               <p>Bowen was close by at the time—I did not see him make a snatch at Geddcs—I don't know how he got on his feet—he did get on his feet, and challenged the prisoner to fight, or to "Come on"—he did not use the word "fight"—they met, and had another tussle, and the deceased was down again—he got up again, and said "Come out into the open," meaning more in the middle of the floor—the prisoner obeyed the challenge, and they met again, and had another struggle, and Geddes went down a third time—he got up, and again said to the prisoner, "Come on"—the prisoner said "Mind, I have not struck you yet; but I will"—Geddes said "Hit away; come on"—then I heard a slap—from the sound, I inferred that it was an open hand slap; I could not see any blow—I saw the action of the body, but I could not say that I actually saw the prisoner's hand against the face—I saw him lift his hand, and then I heard the blow—they closed, and struggled together, and Geddes again went down—I then left the floor, to get the constable of the wharf to come and stop it—Geddes was an elderly man; I should think near sixty; but he gave his age as fifty-four—he was short and stout—there was about 1450 gallons of wine in the vat at the time—the place is called a man-hole, from the fact of a man going down there to clean the vat out, but he must be a man of slight stature to do so; it is only a slight man who could go down it—I could not go down it—the deceased was stouter than me, bigger across the shoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased could not have gone down the man-hole—he was standing facing the trough; the trough was between him and me, and the prisoner was on the same side as I was—the deceased fell over the trough, leading to the hole, on his back—before the prisoner said "Mind, I have not hit you yet, but I shall," he had been challenged by the de<lb/>ceased three separate times—the blow he struck the deceased was decidedly with the open hand—I saw the deceased afterwards, and there was no appearance of any blow on his face—I saw Geddes with this instrument called a flogger, in his hand—I did not see him use it, but I heard him say afterwards that he had struck the prisoner with it in the face, or beard, and he wished it had been a sound one—I saw blood on the prisoner's cheek afterwards—when the prisoner asked the deceased to go and see Mr. Goulay, he answered positively "I shan't go"—he did not speak in a civil way—when he said to the prisoner "Come on," I don't know that he made any movement; he could not have moved far, or else he would have crossed the trough, which he did not—he appeared to be very angry; he meant doing all the mischief he possibly could, no doubt—he seemed in a great temper—I did not hear the prisoner say "I did not come here to fight, I came here to get work"—I had known the deceased six or seven years—he was not exactly a quiet inoffensive man—I had not known the prisoner at all, I had only seen him occasionally on the wharf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the prisoner came in, Geddes was superintending the operations, putting the wine in the vat, and the mixing of the finings—he was vault-keeper, and was superintending the work, and the men—the prisoner was several minutes asking him to go and see Mr. Goulay before I saw him seize Geddes, or use that action; Geddes was then at the man-hole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of James Wilson Geddes was read as follows:</hi>—"I live at 13, Agnes Street, Limehouse. I was vault-keeper at the London and Continental Wharf, Wapping. On 1st April, at 3.45, I was on the vat floor. The prisoner and a man named Taylor, who had been discharged a few days before, came and asked me to see Mr. Goulay about their being discharged. I said 'You know, James, Goulay would not send his messenger if he wanted me.' He said 'What am I to do.' I said 'It is no use my going up, I reasoned with him before you left; if you can get a job, I will myself give you a character as an honest industrious man; I can't do more.' I then walked away to wards the man-hole, and stood close by Maynard, when I was seized back and front by the throat, by the prisoner. He took me quite off my legs, and I found myself down the man-hole, at least my head and shoulders and one arm were. I cried for help, a witness took me up, and pulled me out. I was maddened, and said 'Let me get at him.' The fall I had hurt me. I fell over an iron bar, and then struck my right side. The man Taylor, I think, stood between us. I stepped past him, and he again got me by the throat. I saw a flogger on the floor, and picked it up, and said I would hit him. I could not do so, however, I fell exhausted. After this I went down stairs, and walked up Commercial Street, and saw McCombie. He said 'Have you had enough?' I said 'Quite enough, <hi rend="italic">Jem.</hi>' I had nothing to do with his discharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I fell over the iron bar into the man-hole. It was the fall over that that broke my ribs. The bar is the edging of the man-hole. He told me the governor wanted to see me. I told him I would not go till a special messenger came. I did not tell him to go off the premises. I did not first take up the flogger; when I had the flogger, he rushed at me, and his head got cut, but I did not strike him. I believe to some extent he meant to push me over the man-hole. He was in a great rage. I respected him; it was Mr. Goulay who had all to do with dis<lb/>charging him. Men do go down the man-hole to clean the vat."</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 30th June, I was at Mr. Wilderapen's, Railway Inn, at Feltham—I went there about 11.30, and left about 12.30—I saw Merrick, and a man named Ham, drinking there—they asked me to drink, and I drank with them—I left about 12.15, with my wife, to go home—I stopped a minute or two outside—I heard a bother between the prisoner and a man named Bushnell—I turned round to go back—before I got to them he knocked Bushnell down—I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to knock an old man down like that, and old enough to be your father"—he said "You can take it up, if you like"—I said "I don't wish to"—he turned round, and knocked me down—I got up, and we had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">scrummage</hi>—we both fell—we got up, and he said "I will have no more of this," and he drew back 3 or 4 yards away from me—my wife halloaed out "He has got a knife"—he came towards me; I tried to get away, and Ham knocked me down on my right side—the prisoner ran in, and stabbed me on the left his directly I fell—I halloaed out "I am stabbed!"—I put my hand down to my thigh, and there was blood running down—Bushnell and my wife helped me up—she was close by, the whole time—the prisoner stood a little way off after he stabbed me—I am sure he is the man that struck me.</p>

I live at 19, Half Moon Crescent, Barnsbury—on the night of 3rd August, I closed my premises about 11.58—I left them all safe, and went to bed—when I came down next morning the land<lb/>ing window was broken open—I had closed and fastened it myself the even<lb/>ing before—I missed four coats, and a tin can containing about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., several other articles, and some instruments belonging to my brother-in-law—I went to the station directly, and on the 4th I saw three of the coats which I had lost.</p>

I am the wife of George Keep, and live at 4, Charlotte Terrace, Barnsbury, where the prisoners live—about 1.30, on the morning of 4th August, he came home, and went down in the kitchen, where they commenced quarrelling for a few minutes—a little while after that I saw a man come and throw something at the window—the male prisoner went to the street door and answered him—the street door was open five or ten minutes—it banged to again, and he went down stairs—I saw two men come to the house after that, and throw some coats down the area—that was about 2.45—they were coats like these—the male prisoner took them in—I saw no more of them afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Argyll and Bute Militia—I have a public appointment—my salary is now about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I live with my parents at Blackheath—I am twenty-six years of age—I first saw the prisoner in January, 1870, in the Brompton Road; I met her by chance—I got into conversation with her, and went to her house, Ivy Lodge, North End, Fulham; she lived there—I went there that evening, about an hour and a half or two hours after I met her—an intimacy com<lb/>menced at that time; the same day that I first met her—I visited her, there, once or twice, up to September of that year—in December I took a house at St. Anne's Villas, Royal Crescent, Notting Hill—she removed her furniture there, and we lived there together—between September and De<lb/>cember my visits had become more frequent—I lived there with her for about five weeks—I discovered that she frequently indulged in stimulants—during that five weeks I left her once; I think more than once, but I am positive I left her once—before I left her I saw her with a table-knife in her hand one night; that was in January—it was after I had gone to bed—I had dropped off to sleep, and Mrs. Sadler was down stairs—when I awoke I found her at the side of the bed, on her knees, with the knife in her hand, looking at me—I got out of bed, and took it from her, and threw it under the bed—she then came to bed, and during the night I woke up and found she was outside, on her knees, groping under the bed, but the bed was only about half a foot from the ground, and she could not get more than her arm underneath, and when she found that I was noticing</p>

               <p>her she got into bed again—nothing was said about it that night, but next day she said she only did it to frighten me—in April, 1871, she removed from St. Anne's Villas to Harwood Road, Moor Park—I left her, and went into lodgings, at Chelsea, at the beginning of February, with Mr. Esse, a friend, of mine—I still continued to visit the prisoner at intervals, and she some<lb/>times came to my lodgings—she frequently made use of threats to me; she said that I should never leave her, except by force, and she threatened to go down to Blackheath, and expose all about me to my parents—there was no other threats whilst I was lodging at Chelsea—she was once taken to the Westminster Police Court for creating a disturbance at the lodgings, bat I was not present—in the Harwood Road she said she would kill me; that was about a week before this occurrence—I was alone with her; it was at her house—I told her that I was going to leave her, and* she frequently said during the day "You shall never leave me, I will kill you sooner"—she continually repeated that, at various times, whenever I mentioned that I should leave her—I told her that very often, and I asked her to talk quietly over it, and see if we could not leave quietly, and she constantly said I should never leave quietly, it must be force that would take me away, that I should never leave her; she said "You shall never leave me, except by force"—this occurred on more than one day, two or three days running, whenever I broached the subject—on one of those occasions I saw the same dagger that I was afterwards stabbed with, lying on the bed—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she went out of the room, one night, and brought it in; that was about four or five days before I was stabbed—she did not say anything then, she thought I was asleep—I was in bed; she was in bed, too—she got out of bed, went into another room, and brought that dagger back with her; she laid it on the bed, and then went to her wardrobe—I jumped out of bed, and took hold of it, and threw it on the top of the wardrobe, and asked her what she was doing—she made no answer, but got into bed again; and next day I took it from the wardrobe, with three others of the same sort that were in the back room, and threw them on the top of a cup-board, out of reach, unless you got on to a chair to take them—next day I asked her what she meant by it, and told her that I was never born to be killed by her—she made no reply—previous to the 24th of July I think she had nearly made up her mind to let me go—I had been discussing it with her frequently—on Monday, 24th July, I did not know of her inten<lb/>tion to go to Blackheath to my parents—I had not seen her since Friday, the 21st—on the 24th I was at the Charing Cross Station, about to go to Blackheath, about 9.45 at night—just as I was going on to the platform, to the train, I caught sight of the prisoner—I turned away; she came running after me—I asked what she was doing there—she said she had just come up from Blackheath—I asked what she had been down there for—she said she had been looking after me—I then went to go through the barrier, to go to the train, and she caught hold of me, and said that I must go back with her to Harwood Road—I refused to do so, and said that I would not leave the stations—she made me miss one train; it went off while we were talking—she then wanted me, as I had missed the train, to go back with her—I still refused, and she said she would not leave me unless I did go back with her—I persuaded her to go quietly by herself, and I put her into a cab, and promised that I would go the next night to Harwood Road—she then went away, and I went to Blackheath—next evening (Tuesday) I did go to her place, about 5.45—she was in bed when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140042"/>
               <p>I arrived there—I told her that I was very angry with her for having gone down to Blackheath, as whatever our own disagreements might be, she had no business to go down to my parents' house, and I said I was very angry indeed, and I thought it was a great shame of her—I then went up stairs and began packing some things up—Mrs. Sadler then got up and put on a dress and a shawl—I went into the dressing-room to get some things out of a drawer, and she brought up some handker-chiefs and things from down stairs—I went up stairs again and left her in the bed-room—she called out to me "Fred, have you anything to say to me before your brother comes?"—I had told her that my brother was coming in half an hour—I said "Yes, I will come down stairs"—her bedroom was the front room, first floor—I was upon the second floor—I went down to her bedroom, the windows were open, and she went and shut the windows and door after I had gone into the room—I said "There is no occasion to do that, because the people outside can't hear what we have got to say"—I then went and sat down on the side of the bed, and asked her to come and sit by my side—she came and sat down on my right side—I then asked her if she was perfectly satisfied with the reason I had given her for leaving—she said yes, she was—I took her left hand, and said "When we part, let us part friends"—she made no reply at the time, and I felt a sudden blow on my left side—I jumped up and took from her this dagger, it was bent with the force of the blow, I concluded—I then went to the window and threw it open, and sat down on a chair at the side—I then felt something warm running down my leg, and I found that I was bleeding—I took a towel and stopped the bleeding as well as I could; a knock then came to the door, and Mrs. Sadler went down stairs to see what it was—as soon as I felt the blood trickling I said "You have hurt me"—I think I said "You have killed me"—when she caught sight of the blood, she said "What have I done?"—I don't recollect that she said anything else in particular; I was very much confused and agitated with the blow—when she went down stairs, I went down into the drawing-room, so that I could be near the door, and I called out to her not to let the little girl go, to send her for a doctor; I had seen the little girl coming across the road; however, she went away, and Mrs. Sadler came up into the drawing-room—I was then sitting in a chair, with my leg resting on another chair—I was afraid to move—I asked her again to send for a doctor; she did not for some time, and I asked her if she would let me stop there and bleed to death; at last she went to the door, and called a man who was passing, and I told her to tell the man to go for Dr. Rees, I think the name is, who lived opposite the Fulham police-station, and if he was not at home to fetch the first doctor he could; the man went away, and came back again and said Dr. Rees was not at home, but he had gone for another doctor, Mr. Lee, and he would be there in a short time—whilst he was gone for the doctor the prisoner was in and out of the room; she had not put on any more clothes; I told her to go up stairs and dress herself, she would not like to be caught as Mrs. Davey was—(I had seen it stated that Mrs. Davey only had part of her clothing on)—the blood was still flowing, and I had two towels then—she would not go up and dress herself—she came up to me about five minutes afterwards, and snatched away the first towel that I had, which was marked with blood, and took it away somewhere, I don't know where; soon afterwards the doctor came; at first she did not want to let him in—she opened the street door, but would not let him come in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140043"/>
               <p>until I called out "Doctor, come in"—when the doctor came in, I asked her to leave the room—she did not—and I then opened my dress, and showed the doctor the wound, and pointed to Mrs. Sadler—she said "Yes, I have done it"—the doctor looked at the wound, and said he would not inlerfera with it, as he could not tell in what direction the cut lay—I asked him if he would wait for a short time until my brother came, as I did not like being left alone—Mrs. Sadler asked the doctor if he thought it was serious—he asked her to get some cold water and a handkerchief, or some linen—at first she refused—she said she was not going to carry things up for me, but after some time she went up stairs and brought up some water and a handkerchief—she then told the doctor, as he seemed to have done all he could he had better go—I asked him to stop till my brother came—he waited some time, I should fancy quite an hour, and as my brother did not come, he said he would go out and see if he was wanted at his own house, and come back again, and I gave him a card to give to a friend of Mrs. Sadler's, to ask her to come there—the doctor then went away, leaving the street door open, so that he might be able to come in again—I remained in the drawing-room on the same seat, I had not moved—Mrs. Sadler remained in the room—she kept saying to herself "I will kill you! I will kill you!" but beyond that she said nothing—after some time my brother came, the doctor returned just before him; the wind had shut the door, and when I heard the knock I went to open it; Mrs. Sadler tried to prevent my open<lb/>ing it—I opened the catch, and told whoever was outside to push the door and come in, and the doctor came hi, and soon afterwards my brother came in, and after about an hour's time I was removed—my brother remained in another room with Mrs. Sadler while I went out at the door; she refused to let me go, she said I should not leave the house—the doctor got a cab, and while she was in another room, he put me into the cab, and drove off with me; I then went back again to the house—I was more than half an hour in the cab, waiting at the corner of the street until they came—the reason I gave the prisoner for leaving her was, that my mother wished me to break off the connexion with her, as she had found it out, and that I had promised to do so—only a few seconds elapsed between my saying "Let us part friends" and my receiving the blow—I had not seen the weapon in her hand before I received the blow; it came upon me quite unawares—it was a very violent blow—I lost a good quantity of blood; I should fancy about a pint—I have here the trowsers, drawers, and shirt that I was wearing; the cut went through them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was while the doctor was away that she said "I will kill you! I will kill you!"—I don't think I stated that before the Magis<lb/>trate, or that she wanted to prevent the doctor getting into the house, or about the threats she made use of on former occasions: I was not asked—I am sure it was the first day that I met the prisoner that I went to her house; the game night, about two hours afterwards—she did not tell me at that time that her name was Mrs. Sadler—we went together to her house—we walked part of the way and then went and had some wine, and then bad a cab to North End—she told me to direct where to drive to—she did not tell me that I could not come in then, because she was afraid that her husband was at home—it was about 7.30 or 8 o'clock in the evening that I first met her, and it was about 9.15 or 9.30 that I went into the house—at that time I was living at Chelsea, with my parents—it was in the Brompton Road that I met her, about two miles and a half from her house—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140044"/>
               <p>not a Hansom cab that we drove in, but a four-wheeler—we went to a public-house; I don't know the name of it, and remained there about five or six minutes—we drove up to North End, and then she asked me to go in and look at her house—I at first refused, but afterwards I went in, she showing me the way—I was in the house about five or ten minutes and then left; I did not go back again that night—I did not say that I had connexion with her at that time—I have not answered upon that point at all—I did not have connexion with her that night in her house—I did somewhere, before going with her into her house—I was with her for an hour and a half or two hours until I went to the house—we did not go to any other house than the public-house—it was three or four weeks afterwards before I visited Ivy Lodge again—I went by previous appointment with her; it was in the evening that I went—I did not sleep there that night—she had not written to me previously to that visit, she made the appointment to meet me at another time—I met her occasionally—she did not tell me it would not be safe to go to the house, for fear her husband should happen to be at home—she told me she was a kept woman—I did not know at the time that her name was Sadler, afterwards I did—I don't think I stated before the Magis<lb/>trate that she told me she was a kept woman; the question was not entered into there—I took the house at St. Anne's Villas, and paid the rent of it—at that time my salary was about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the same office—it was the prisoner's furniture that was removed to that house—I frequently con<lb/>tributed money towards the household expenses, not for her personal main<lb/>tenance—I had a banking account—I gave her a cheque once for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was for her to pay her landlord at Ivy Lodge, which she repaid me at once—that was simply lent, but otherwise I did not give her any cheques, I drew the money myself—I took out a policy of insurance on the furniture in my name, because the house was taken in my name, and I handed her the policy—I know now that she is a married woman; I did not know it for some time after I first met her—I knew it before I took the house at Notting Hill, about a month after I first met her, about February—when she moved from Ivy Lodge she asked me to go with her; I at first refused, but afterwards I said I would—she once lent me two rings, one I had for about three months, and the other about a week; I returned them both to her—I raised money upon them—we had several quarrels; they were not always lovers' quarrels, they were frequent quarrels; they were mainly quarrels arising from her use of stimulants—she professed very great devotion and affection towards me—I have heard her say that she would kill herself rather than be separated from me—I don't think I had been talking about leaving her on the occasion when I found her with the table knife; I had frequently said that I would leave her, and she frequently said "You shall never leave me except by force"—I once struck her a blow accidentally, I can explain that; it was not the result of a quarrel—the blow was near the eye, and she had a black eye; I don't know for how long—it happened during a struggle; she got up about 12 o'clock at night and was very violent, and wanted to get out of the bedroom, I locked the door and said she should not go out; she said if I did not let her out she would jump out of the window; I then let her out of the room, and she said she would go out—this was about 3 o'clock in the morning—she went out, and after a time came back, rushed up stairs and threw things at me, and begen hitting me with a boot; I restrained myself for some time, and at last struggled with her to put her into bed, and in the struggle this accidental</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140045"/>
               <p>blow in the eye came—I did not hit her directly on the eye; she was fight<lb/>ing and struggling, and she is perhaps nearly as strong as I am—she was at that time under the care of Dr. Bannister, for excessive stimulants I believe—in cross-examination before the Magistrate I said I had blacked her eye—I don't think I called it an accident; but I did not go into details, I was simply asked the question and answered it—after one of our quarrels I took up a sword; I did not threaten to do anything with it—she was out<lb/>side the room, and I made a cut at the door—it was not with any intention to get the door open, simply that she should hear it; I put it away again instantly—we had had a quarrel, and she was rushing at me, and I went into the next room and struck the door with the sword—I thought it would frighten her if she heard it—I wished her to know that I had a sword in my hand—I did not on another occasion stand over her with a sword in my hand, I held an empty leather scabbard without a sword in it; that was in the night time, or rather in the early morning, while we were in bed—I don't know the exact object of it, except it was to frighten her into quietness—these swords and things were part of a lot that were hanging up on the wall, they were not mine; this took place in Harwood Road—the prisoner was, and I believe is, subject to fits, I don't know of what kind—I fancy of an epileptic tendency, but the doctor was not attending her for that at the time—she was frequently in an excited state from stimulants, wine, spirits, and beer; stimulants generally—on one occasion I charged her with an improper intimacy with a friend of mine—I could not prove anything—the Magistrate asked me whether I was perfectly satisfied that there was no foundation for it, and I said I concluded as I could not prove anything I must be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the prisoner herself who told me that she was a married woman—I did not know it in any other way, and I did not believe her at first—I have seen her husband since, in the street; she pointed him out to me—I believe he was living with her at the place she first took me to; I found it out afterwards—I never saw him there—she told me at first he was the man that kept her—the first time I saw her she told me she was kept by a man, and afterwards she pointed him out to me as the man that did keep her; she never told me that he was her husband, but the afterwards told me she was married; and he was her husband—she said she had left him three or four times—she told me that before we went to St. Anne's Villas—I never spoke to the person she said was her husband—I believe he had left her and gone abroad, when we moved to St. Anne's Villas; she told me they had had a quarrel, and he had gone away—she first of all asked me to remove with her—I refused, but after a time I con<lb/>sented, because I thought it would get her away from bad companions that she had contracted there; I consented after she had told me that her husband had gone abroad and left her—I insured the furniture simply because the house was taken in my name—I gave her the policy, and when she moved to Harwood Road she gave it me back, as it was of no use, it was insured in the other house—it was when she was living at Netting Hill that Dr. Bannister attended her—I thought he was attending her for the excessive use of stimulants—I could distinguish when she was labouring under the influence of stimulants, and when she was in an epileptic fit; there was a great deal of difference in the two—in one she was insensible to a great extent, in the other she was anything but that—when this struggle took place she was, in my opinion, suffering from the excessive use of stimulants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 27, Moor Park Road, Fulham—on the evening of 25th July I was called to No. 8, Harwood Road—on going to the house there was some difficulty in getting admission, bnt I did get admission—Mrs. Sadler came to the door—I don't think she knew me before—she said "You are the doctor?"—I said "Yes," and then she hesitated, and opened the door, and looked through—Captain Sills called out to me "Come in, doctor," and I had to push the door to get in—the prisoner either followed me, or went with me into the drawing-room, where I found Mr. Sills—he asked me to request Mrs. Sadler to leave the room—I did so once or twice, but she said no, she would remain—he then un<lb/>covered the towel from the lower part of his abdomen, and exposed this wound—she said "I have done it; yes, it was me; I have done it"—she repeated it several times—after I had looked at it she several times very anxiously inquired if it was dangerous, and got very excited as I told her I could not give a decisive answer then—I asked her to get some water,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140047"/>
               <p>and some linen, or a handkerchief, which after some time she did, but she required a deal of persuasion to get her to do so—the wound was still bleeding slightly; it was on the lower part of the abdomen, on the left side near the groin, and in such a position that the point might have entered the abdominal cavity if it had been directed another way; I am inclined to think it was directed towards the bone, from the mesial line outwardly, towards the left side, but I could not speak with certainty about that; I did not probe it—I saw one towel—he had been losing blood in some quantity, in fact he was suffering rather from it at the time, and from the shock together—he was rather low—he was under my care until the Thursday—I saw him at the Harwood Road on the Tuesday night, and at the hotel to which we took him on the Wednesday and Thursday, and then being satisfied that no important or serious part was injured, I sanctioned his removal to his home—I did not see him afterwards—the prisoner was very much excited when I first saw her, I think partly from stimulants and partly from mental emotion—I had not known her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Her appearance was consistent with that of a person who was overwhelmed with alarm at what had occurred; afterwards she had two or three hysterical attacks while T was there—they were not real epileptic attacks, they were more like hysterical attacks, such as would affect a woman overwhelmed by her feelings, and by agitation at what had occurred—her refusal to leave the room did not appear to be from anxiety as to Mr. Sills' condition, but more from temper; "No, I shan't go, it is my house;" something like that—I was there altogether two and a half or three hours—I was there an hour the first time, and then left and came back again—it was during the last quarter of an hour that she was in the excitable and hysterical state—when I was examining the wound she kept repeating "Doctor, is it serious, is it serious?"</p>

I am the brother of Captain Sills, and live with my parents at Blackheath—I first saw the prisoner on Monday, 24th July, at Blackheath, she came to the house—she said she wished to see my brother, and asked if he had come home—I told her he had not come home yet, and I suggested, as I was going out, I would walk with her down the road—I told her that my brother had a great wish to leave her, and that he had frequently expressed his desire, and she had always placed impediments in the way; I hoped she was now convinced that it really was his wish to leave her, and I trusted that she would allow him to leave her quietly without any <hi rend="italic">exposé</hi>—she made a long rambling statement, about the unhappy way in which she lived; she said she was a very violent temper, but she always felt sorry the next day for what she had done—I told her I was surprised, as they lived on such terms, that she should wish him to continue to live with her—after some considerable conversation, all tending to the same point, she said "Well, he shall leave me quietly; of course I used to love him very much, but that has gone by now"—I said "There is no doubt ne will see you before he leaves you, and I hope you will let him leave you quietly," and we said she would—she then left by the train; I saw her into the train—next evening I had an appointment with my brother to go to her house;</p>

               <p>she had previously given me her address—I went there between 8 and 8.30—when I knocked at the door I heard someone say "He shall not come in;" eventually, after a very short interval, the door was opened, and I went into the drawing-room, and saw my brother sitting on a chair, holding a bandage to a wound which he had in his abdomen, and he said "She has stabbed me, she has done it at last"—she said "Yes, I have, and I will do it again, he shall not leave me, he shall not live if he does"—she made that statement repeatedly, that she would do it again if he attempted to leave her, that he should not leave the house, he should stay there—she said once, but did not repeat it, "I will do it again if it is in ten years' time, he shall not leave me, I will kill him"—she was in another room, the dining-room, with me, when my brother was actually removed from the house, and she said "Oh, what have I done?"—I said "Sit down quietly and I will tell you, you have probably killed my brother," she said "I don't care, I will do it again if he attempts to leave me"—she asked me to forgive her for what she had done—we had more conversation, but it was all a repetition of what I have said—we stayed in there a few minutes, when she suddenly jumped up and said "Oh, I daresay now he has left the drawing-room"—she rushed into the drawing-room, and found that my brother had been taken away—I wanted to leave at once, but she fastened the door, placed her back against it, and said I should not leave without her; she kept me there for more than half an hour—she went for her clothes, dressed herself, and eventually we left together—she insisted upon following me, to find out where he was; I did not know where he was—next morning I gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that she went to the police-station to give herself up, and remained there two hours, but there was nobody to charge her—she followed me to the police-station, and I wanted to give her in charge, first of all, for molesting me, but I did not—she was in a state of excitement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On the morning of 26th July, about 11 o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house—I asked if her name was Mary Sadler—she said "Yes"—I said "I am a police officer, and I shall take you into custody for stabbing Captain Frederick Sills, last night"—she said "That is just what I expected"—I told her to be careful what she said, as, it might be given in evidence against her before the Magistrate—she said "I did stab him, and I will stab him again."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She did not then wring her hands, and call him "My poor boy"—that was at the Police Court—hearing her say "My poor boy," I asked her if she had a son—she said she meant poor Fred—she was in a atate of very great excitement at the time I took her into custody—I can't say anything about her being at the Police Court two hours the previous evening, waiting for somebody to give her into custody; I was not there—I heard that she was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On July 26th I went with Chinnery to take the prisoner into custody—I went to a bedroom, where I understood the prosecutor had been stabbed, and while searching it, the prisoner came into the room, followed by Chinnery—I was looking uoder the bed; she said "You are looking for the dagger;" she turned to a female who was in the room, and said "You know where it is, you have moved it, show him where it is;" the woman, who was a servant, I believe, went down stairs with me, opened a dresser drawer, and gave me this dagger—I then went up stairs, with the dagger in my hand, into the bedroom—the prisoner said "Yes, that is what I did it with, and I will do it again."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a friend of Captain Sills—I have seen the prisoner on several occasions when Captain Sills has been in my company, at his lodging in the Royal Avenue, Chelsea, in the City, when he has been on duty with his regiment, and at his office at Chelsea—I remember on one occasion being at Harwood Road, at the end of March, or beginning of April, before he had been to Scotland—Captain Sills was very anxious to leave the house; she brought down a serpentine dagger and said "I will make you I stop"—I don't recollect anything further that passed except that the dagger was put into a corner of the room, and Captain Sills took it away—I have heard the prisoner say that he should come back and live with her, nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 87, Clarendon Road, Kensington—I was called to the deceased on Sunday, about 1 o'clock, and found him in a comatose state, quite insensible—he remained so till his death, but I did not stop with him—I saw that he could not possibly live long—next day, the 7th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found scarcely any external injury, except a cut on the lip, a little graze on the top of the nose, and a bruise on the right side of the head, the rest of the body was free from in<lb/>jury—on opening the skull, I found a large quantity of blood pressing on the brain, which had been extravasated there, in consequence of an exten<lb/>sive fracture of the skull, caused by the injury on the right side—the other organs were healthy, with the exception of congestion of the lungs—the fracture of the skull was the cause of death; that might have been caused by a heavy fall on a kerb stone—if a man were to fall down without other force being used, it would not be at all likely to cause a fracture of the skull.</p>

I do not know the prisoner—I never saw him but once—I live nearly opposite where the deceased met his death—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning in question, I saw a woman named Kelly there—the deceased was very drunk; he went up to Mrs. Kelly, as if he was about to strike her, but fell back, and struck his head on the steps of the house—there are four or five high steps up—nothing was done to him while he wason the ground—I was across the road, from one side of the street to the other, sitting on my steps—Elizabeth Watson was talking to me—she kept in front of me, with her back to the prisoner and the deceased—I saw a man in the road, who is supposed to be the prisoner, but I don't know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a young man pass, and they said it was the prisoner; his name was mentioned—the back of the deceased's head struck the steps as he fell—I did not see a young man knock him down—I was sitting on my steps, and I never got up—the young man did not come close to my steps; I only saw him in the road—the deceased was lying in the street five or ten minutes; a quantity of people gathered round him, and they took him in doors—I did not hear the young man say that he owed the deceased a grudge.</p>

I was apprehended, and the chief thing that took me out was to see my brother-in-law, who works in Gracechurch Street. I waited some time in Gracechurch Street for him, where I saw two police<lb/>men, and made myself known to them; one was Breeze, of the sixth division, and the other was named Dicks, who had been discharged from the first division, a few days before. Not seeing my brother-in-law, I took a walk over London Bridge, and in crossing the road from Deane's, I saw the telegraph boy running, and Sergeant Brett, whom I knew perfectly well, close behind him. Thinking he was running after the boy, I stopped him; the boy immediately said "Here it is, they would not give it to me at first," and he placed a bag in my hand. Sergeant Brett immediately arrested me, and said he should charge me with sending the boy with a forged cheque. I said "What nonsense, I am a police officer my<lb/>self." He told me his name, and what he was, and said I had better come to Bow Lane with him, where I was charged."</p>

               <p>were found at Latimer Road—on searching Green at Kingston, I found this stamp to stamp the envelopes, in his waistcoat pocket—he refused to give any name on the Saturday—I took him before Sir Robert Garden on the Monday, at Guildhall, where he gave his name Edward Green, he was remanded three or four times to the 6th or 7th July—on 7th July, about 8.20 in the morning, I went to Latimer Road, Netting Hill, and found Newth in bed, on a mattress on the floor—there is no number to the house—it is a milk-shop, called Latimer House Dairy—I recognized some furniture there which I had seen at 4, Highfield Road, but it was bundled up in the rooms as if it had been recently moved in—I saw an elderly woman and two children there, who I had seen at Highfield Road, and Newth's wife was in bed with him—I found about a dozen empty hampers, three of which (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) have been identified—this banker's pass-book was in a drawer or desk, in the bedroom where Newth was sleeping—I walked into the room, and said "Come Newth, get up, you are well aware that I must take you"—he said "Oh, for God Almighty's sake, don't, Mr. Davis, if you do I am a ruined man"—I said "That is nonsense, get up"—he got out of bed and said "I will pray to you"—he went down en his knees on the bare boards, put up his hands and again implored me not to take him—he ultimately dressed himself, and I took him down stairs—while pretending to look for his hat in the kitchen, he bolted away, and slammed the door to—I chased him through the passage—he got out over the wall into the street, where I had a constable outside, and after a very short run, he overtook him, and brought him back to me—I got a cab and took him to Fleet Street Police Station—on the way there, he said "Now, let me beg of you not to be hard with me, for the sake of my wife and children"—I said "I have a duty to perform, and I must do it"—he said "Well, you need not bring out many cases against me; you know you can make it easier if you like"—I took him before a Magistrate the same day—a padlock was found at Dorset House, that was among the things I lost—I showed it to Mr. Leech before it was lost—I also found some boxes of butter there—what was there and what came afterwards, weighed about 500lbs., but a great deal was returned, as I sent notices to all the Railway Stations—I found this ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at Dorset House, but no other papers; "E. Green" is on the door—there was a little desk there, nothing else—the office is very small—Mr. Boulger lets the house out in three different offices, and I found this envelope at Latimer Road, addressed to Mr. Boulger, Dorset House, Fleet Street; also this envelope, post mark, 5th July, addressed "Mr. Patterson, 9, St. George's Terrace, Moor Park, Fulham, and another addressed "Immediate. Mr. Green. Take this to the man at the rag shop, and give it to him directly"—the shortest of these two papers I found behind the mantelpiece, in the sitting-room at Latimer Road—I took several papers out of several coat pockets, and on examining them at the station, found this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Bottondey objected to this being read, as it was without a signature, and was not shown to come from Newth's pocket or possession, and the reading was postponed</hi>). I did not speak to him about that letter—while I was there with Newth in custody, a letter was brought addressed to Jones, Latimer House Dairy, Not ting Hill; I took it from a constable, who handed it to me from the postman—I said "Is this for you?—he said "No"—I said "We will open it"—I found this in it, which I read in his presence, and I think he could hear me—he said that he knew nothing</p>

               <p>about it—Boulger's wife had introduced a man, as Green's clerk, when I went to Dorset House on 20th June—this man went out as soon as he came in, and I never saw him afterwards, till I saw him in the kitchen at Latimer House—I passed him, and went up to arrest Newth, and when I came down he was gone, and had left his hat and coat; I understood that his name was Williams—I went again to Latimer House Dairy, but found no person to correspond with C. Jones—I went every day for two or three days, and left a constable there, till about a week after, when the wife took the goods away—no person named Jones ever came to the place.</p>

I am inspector at Walworth Station—that is not in Kingston district—the first time I saw Green was on 17th June—not a quarter of what I said was taken down before Sir Robert Carden—I read it over myself, and complained about it to the second clerk, Mr. Davey, I think; I said that the evidence was a mere skeleton, not taken as it ought to have been, and he said "I am aware of it"—I have seen two of the women since, they are Newth's wife and daughter, I believe—one of them was taken in custody—the charge at Kingston was, being concerned with others in obtaining goods by fraud—the prosecutors were Mr. Simmonds, Miss Jones, and several others, not the same persons who prosecute to-day—I had no warrant when I went to the house; I only went there to appre<lb/>hend a woman for felony, and she has been sentenced to eighteen months' im<lb/>prisonment—I did not know Green was there at all—I had been there half an hour before I got into the room—the window was open about an inch from the bottom, and the blind was down as far as it would come, apparently—I could not see in till I lifted the window and the blind—I should say he could easily have fastened the window if he had tried—I did not say "What are you hiding there for?—I found a black bag in the kitchen; it has no relation to Green, farther than that he was in the house at the time—he was not charged with stealing it, only with having it unlawfully in his possession—most of these letters were found in Green's room; not quite all because I received two or three by post since, which might have got among them—I omitted to say that there were a considerable number torn up, on the floor—I have mixed the documents, but I can easily select them—I found these bill-heads on the table where Green was standing; I took them away, and I have had them ever since—I did not mark them; I simply tied them up in a paper, and brought them here—I did not tell Green I held a warrant; I had not applied for one; I had not seen him—the four women were not in the same room where the black bag was found—I went thereafter a woman, and to find stolen property—my motive forentering that room was to find property—Mrs. Fair is a lady at Kingston, to whom the bag belongs—there is nothing in it—she pointed Green out, and so did Mr. Simmonds—a boy named Collier saw Green at Kingston—I applied for a week's remand—Collier afterwards said he had made a mistake as to the man who stole the bag—I was in Court all the time at Guildhall—I heard Boulger say that Newth was not the man who took his office, that there was another Mr. Green, and that Green was introduced to him as Green's clerk—I had about twenty-five letters in the bag; I separated them to keep the cases separate—I reported the loss to the Magistrate, to his clerk, and to my superiors, and in three minutes after losing it, to the railway authorities and telegraphed for it—the name on the door at Dorset House, "E. Greene," was painted out three or four days afterwards—there was a final "e"—" Dorset House" was on the lamp—it was before the committal that I lost the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOTTOMLEY</hi>. I arrested Newth on 7th July—the name that was up was scarcely legible, having been up a long time—it is a very dirty old place, a sham milk-shop, I should say—the landlord is Mr. Riley—he is not here—he told me that a person took it in the name of Jones—the pass-book I found in the desk was of the Margaret Street Deposit Bank—I had seen that pass-book before at Highfield Road, in the same desk—there were two at Highfield Road; the other, to the best of my belief, was of the Birkbeck Deposit Bank—I did not take possession of them, and when I went there again they were gone—it was the same desk—there were different articles in it, one of which was a box of capsules—I also noticed a very peculiar oval looking-glass, and chairs, and a table, and two desks, which I had seen at Highfield Road—I am certain there was no fur<lb/>niture at Highfield Road, at the time I apprehended Newth—after I took Green I put a man in charge, only for one day, while I went to Kingston, and when I went home again the furniture was gone—some of the butter from Dorset House has been sold, and some has been sent to the parties who sent it—I left a constable in possession, but Jones did not come—Scott was examined at the Police Court—he is not here—I sent for him yesterday, and he declined to come—I have not subpoenaed him—the Magis<lb/>trate said that his evidence was not important, and he was not bound over—he declined to come without a fee of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had no guinea to give him—either of the prisoners was Green when the occasion suited—Boulger said at the Police Court "The man who took my house was a bigger man than that"—he did not say that he had grey hair—he did not describe his whiskers—I wrote to the six prosecutors, and told them—I found 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Green's pocket—it is in my pocket now, with the exception of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he spent at Kingston for refreshment, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. here.</p>

"I must have money to pay Counsel." "The poor <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> looks very ill; he thought I was going to give evidence against him when I was put in the box, but I only said what the solicitor told me to say; I said he was introduced to me as head clerk to Green, which will account for his having your letter."

Sir. In answer to your inquiries respecting Mr. Greene, I found him all I could desire as a tenant"—I had another reference to Mr. Patterson, of Walham Green, Maria Road, I think, of seven or eight years—I do not believe this envelope (<hi rend="italic">addressed to Mr. Patterson</hi>) is my writing—I do not remember writing to him—I went to see him, but this is not the address to which I went—I never went to St. George's Road—I saw him at a shop in Walham Green—I believe it was Mr. Moon's, Park Road, but I will not be positive—I only saw Mr. Patterson that once—I was shown a padlock at the Police Court—I had seen that in Green's Office, Dorset House, on a white hamper—my solicitor made this written agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the person who took the place, in the name of Robert.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In the course of last April, I was watching the premises of a man named Roosslar, of 75, Oxford Street, Step<lb/>ney, who I afterwards had in custody—on 14th April, I saw a van with three horses drive up to his premises, it had on it the name of "S. P." (and some other letters), "Mumford, Greenwich"—the van was loaded with sacks, apparently of flour—the prisoner was driving it, and there was another man sitting on the tail of the van, with his legs hanging over behind—the van pulled up at the side door, in Russell Street, leading to the bakery—the man behind got down, untied a rope, took one sack off from behind, and took it into the side door—the prisoner took another one and followed him—the other man returned through the same door—the prisoner came through into the shop, and Mrs. Roosslar behind the counter, gave him some money over the counter—he then came out, got on the van, and drove away—the other man walked in a different direction to where the van was going—afterwards, about the 14th or 15th May, I searched Roosslar's premises, in company with another officer, and found three sacks, the pro<lb/>perty of Messrs. Mumford—we did not take possession of them—we were then searching for Messrs. Hadley's sacks—on 27th May, I saw the prisoner in the street, at Greenwich, and again on 3rd June—he was not given into custody till some time in July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe it was on 19th July that he was given into custody—he was admitted to bail on the second examination, and has sur<lb/>rendered this morning—I had been watching Roosslar's premises from 4th March, in Messrs. Hadley's case; it was a baker's shop—I watched it up to 15th May, alternately, not every day, according to circumstances, two or three times a week, perhaps every day for a week, and then not for two or three days, up to the date that Roosslar was taken into custody—I am sure about the 14th April being the date I am speaking of, I made a note of the date at the time—I did not book the time, I believe it was some time after dinner; 1 o'clock, or something after; it might be 2 o'clock, I am not certain of the time—I have not heard that the prisoner has got persons to prove where he was in the middle of the day—I am not aware that Mrs. Roosslar is here—I saw her constantly up to the time of her husband being taken into custody, and I saw her here on her husband's trial, on 7th June—since then I have seen her once, I have been to inquire for her—I was not the officer engaged in the case—I did not go on to Roosslar's premises on 14th April, when I saw this—I never went there till 15th May—I and Legg were there on Saturday the 13th; up to that time I had never been on the premised—during the time I was watching, the business of a baker was being carried on there—sacks were delivered, not every day, perhaps once a week, or once a fortnight; some might have been delivered when I was not there—the side door is not the proper door for taking things into the bakery; there is a loft door where they take in a load of flour when it comes—a sack would be taken in at the side door, or the shop-door—the side door is the direct way to the bakery—I saw the prisoner once between 14th April and 27th May, but I did not speak to</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I was in the employment of the Admiralty, in 1868, and had been so forty-four years—I left in 1869—my pension is 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—in 1868 I was store-keeper of the dockyard, and cashier of the dockyard and the victualling-yard—the prisoner was chief clerk to the general department—it was his duty to receive money paid into the cashier's office—it was his duty to enter it in the rough cash-book first, and at the end of the month all sums were transferred to the fair cash-book—the money received would be put in the chest; that was not paid into the bank at the end of the month, we should keep our balance and check the amount in the chest by the fair cash-book—if any sum was not entered in the fair cash-book it would not have been taken into account—I received monthly from Mr. Ede's department an account of the sales of mill offal during the month—that statement was the only check I had on the amount received from the contractor, and it was on printed forms—that would be sent to the cashier's office, and in the course of business the prisoner would have access to them—in the absence of those vouchers, I should have nothing to guide me in the amounts received for them—I have gone through the rough cash-book and the fair cash-book repeatedly—there is no entry in the rough or the fair cash-book of 325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Gripper, in August, 1868, or of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 1st September, or of 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 30th September—there is no record of those sums—the prisoner never paid me any of those sums—I never got any statement from the superintendent's office of that amount of mill offal being sold to</p>

               <p>Gripper—if I had received it, it would have indicated to me that Gripper had to pay those sums, and I should have made enquiry—the prisoner was in a position to have got access to those statements and to remove them—there was no means by which it could come to my knowledge that this money was going to be paid into the cashier's office by Gripper—these sums have never been paid to the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These vouchers would be sent into my office—they were the only means by which I should know the amount to be paid—the defendant had access to them, and could have received them—I had the same access to them, I could have received them—two clerks and two writers, with prisoner, were employed in the office—Mr. Pinhorne was one clerk, and Mr. Jeffrey the other, who I believe is here—it was not part of the writer's duty to receive money—that duty was performed by me in Mr. Pinhorne's absence, and I made the entries in the rough cash-book—I cannot call to mind ever forgetting to do so—it is not a fact that in Janu<lb/>ary, February, and March, 1868, I received a sum of 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and that I made an entry of it in my own writing in June following—I said when I was before the Magistrate, that there was a doubt about it—entries of money received from Gripper in February and March, should appear in this rough cash-book, and I have looked through it in reference to this matter, and the entry is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it there found that these sums are entered as being re<lb/>ceived in June, 1868? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an entry, but it is not in my writing—I said before the Magistrate that it looked like mine, but that I had a doubt—I say to-day that it is not my writing—I will swear it is not mine and I can give you my reasons—I have had the book, but I do not think I have looked at it since, for I do not care about it, but I have had the vouchers—notwithstanding I have not examined it, I say that it is not mine, and I have my reasons for saying so—entries in the rough and fair cash-books were not postponed from week to week and from month to month, with my knowledge—the entry of sums of money received has not, with my knowledge at the time, been postponed for weeks, and in some instances for months—I know the case to which you refer—the monthly cash account indicates when the money was actually received—my duty was to send in to the Admiralty, a monthly cash account, signed by myself, and containing a statement as to the actual dates on which the moneys were received—the books were not sent, but a monthly statement sheet—all the accounts are sent in a sheet which goes up to the Admiralty and is kept in the Accountant General's-office. (<hi rend="italic">The sheets were here produced</hi>). It was my duty to send in monthly, this sheet, containing the particulars—here is no entry in February or March, 1868, of 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd received from Gripper, nor do I see it in the June account—I should put my name to a receivable order for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd when it accompanied a voucher—my receivable order for this 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accompanies the sheet sent to the Admiralty—it did not sometimes occur that I received the money and handed it over to Mr. Pinhorne, and desired him to make the entry—if I received it I should make the entry—it is his duty to obey my orders—in the prisoners absence, from sickness or leave, Mr. Jeffrey would receive amounts—the receipts handed to Mr. Gripper might be signed by Mr. Pinhorne "pro cashier"—I did not sign receipts when Mr. Pinhorne was present, but I was always at my duty when he was absent—if Mr. Jeffrey received money in September, 1868, that does not prove that I was absent—there would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140089"/>
               <p>a receipt by Mr. Jeffrey in his own writing, and it would be his duty to put the money in what we call the public money chest to which there were two keys, and the prisoner had one, but only during office hours—he received it in the ordinary course of business every morning, and returned it to me in the evening—he had no other key—I had another duplicate key which I kept at my house—I do not remember a single occasion when the prisoner and I were absent at the same time—if he was absent in 1868, I should be there—I should entrust the key to Mr. Jeffrey—we both sat in the same office—we had a counter across, and we left the key in the door while we were at our posts—a rough coin-book was kept in that chest—I suppose that has been transferred, with all the books, to my successor—it was the prisoner's duty to make entries in it (<hi rend="italic">The, book was here produced</hi>). Up to a certain point this book is all in the prisoner's writing—we used to take the weekly balance for the Admi<lb/>ralty not very accurately, but sufficiently accurate to enable us to say what we should require for salaries and other expenses—there would be an entry of the contents of the chest, so as to tally with, the fair cash-book—I call this the rough coin-book—it would afford no test of the amount of money if it had not been put into the chest—all that it ought to contain, is an entry of the money in the chest.</p>

Brietzcke, Esq"—at the time I was examined, I learned that Pinhorne had been up to the Admiralty—I cannot say that I heard he had been before you—I had not heard at the time I was examined, that Pin<lb/>horne had stated that I had taken money from the Admiralty chest—it was not spoken of at all—it was after I was examined, that I heard he had made that statement about me—the prisoner had every opportunity of changing notes and coin for notes and coin in the chest—it was the easiest thing in the world to put in one note and take out another equivalent—a portion of my income is put by, to pay my creditors, but I have not mortgaged my pension—I am married, and have four sons and three daughters—the money I bor<lb/>rowed from the Sovereign Insurance Company is paid off—I had had all that money—it was the Sovereign where my friend borrowed part—it is all paid off, I believe—I put it in the hands of my solicitor, and the other sums are in his hands, in the course of liquidation—I never took any portion of the Government money for the purpose of paying my debts—I have had no ap<lb/>plication about the balance to the General London Bank—that is one of the sums my solicitor has to deal with—I made good the sum of 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which underwent investigation before Admiral Wilmot; I believe the prisoner re<lb/>ceived the money for that cheque—it bore my endorsement, and therefore I made it good—my firm belief is, that it was sent to the bank to be cashed—I did not hear the prisoner say who received the money for it—I was the first person who drew the attention of the Admiralty to it—Pinhorne's first expression was, that he must look up his friends, and the next day he said that he would find 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would find the remainder; that, of course, I declined to do, and said that if it did not turn out to be a clerical error I should report it officially, and I did so—Pin<lb/>horne had nothing to do with receiving money after that inquiry—at that time I had not heard the least about the embezzlement of these three sums—I never took any money out of the chest without putting in a cheque or memorandum, and I always called Pinhorne's attention to the fact—I may not always have done it <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi>, but it was in black and white, in the chest—there is no entry in the rough cash-book, in March, of "Gripper, 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," but it appears on 1st June; I do not believe that to be in my writing, but in the prisoner's—the 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is three items made up into one, 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here are Pinhorne's receipts for them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which show that he received a portion in February, another portion on 7th March, and another portion in April—they ought to have been entered in the rough cash-book at the</p>

               <p>time he received them, but they are not—they appear as received in June—the largest sum which I took from the cash cheat and put in my cheque for, was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside, and I always paid the sum at the end of the month, when I got my pay—I received my salary minus what I owed—it was in my own power to do that—I admit that it was an irregularity—the rough coin-book contains an account of the number of notes, sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and different kinds of coin, and the margin of it applies to all the leaves—that shows how much cash there was in the bank on any particular day, not what ought to be there, but what actually was there—Jeffrey would sometimes have Pinhorne's receipts to give for money which would come to the cash-box—I could have access to these vouchers, and could have received them, but I never received any of them—I put perfect confidence in the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk in Mr. Brietzcke's office at the same time as Pinhorne—I did not receive any of the money com-prized in these three receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> During the whole time I have known the defendant he has borne a good character, and was most punctual and regular in the performance of his duties—there was only myself, Mr. Pinhorne, and Mr. Brietzcke, to perform all the duties, with the exception of the writers—I do not remember any occasion when I forgot to make an entry in the rough cash-book at the time the money was received, and did not make it till subsequently—I made entries in the rough cash-book myself—I do not remember any occasion, when Mr. Pinhorne was in the office, that I merely received the money and handed it over to him—I have no recollection of receiving money and keeping it till Mr. Pinhorne came in, and handing it to him—it was not my duty, but Mr. Pinhorne's, to make entries in the fair cash-book—these receipts of 2nd June and 3rd July, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my writing—having received that money it would not be my duty to make this entry—we never made entries of this kind of thing; it is money received from Mr. Gripper, the contractor—these receipts were given by me to Gripper for mill offal—it was Pinhorne's duty, most decidedly, to make the entry on my handing it to him—when I received money I entered it, except these running accounts—I find no entry at all of these amounts in the rough cash-book, but in the fair cash-book the 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered on September 8th, and the 107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 4th August, both of tfaem in the prisoner's writing—the reason they were not entered was that they were all running accounts—Gripper's accounts were all running accounts—the non-entry of them till September quarter would be because they were running accounts for that quarter, and there would be no voucher from the victualling yard, but the money was actually received—when the money was paid to me and I gave the receipt, I put it in a bag with a tally, and put it in a bowl on a shelf in the chest—that was the ordinary practice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140094"/>
               <p>when I received the money—the chest is built into the wall; you cannot get into it, it is not a room—when the money was placed there it was considered in Mr. Brietzcke's custody, decidedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We do not enter these things in the rough cash-book at all, because we only enter the things which are brought to account during the month—I was always ordered to do as I, did—I should not enter any of these sums—I put a tally on it, with a record of the name and amount, and that would be for the prisoner to bring to account, and both these sums are brought to account in his writing—there is no difference between these sums and the sums in the indictment; they were all running accounts too—there were no vouchers, or else I should have brought them to account—this "Gripper, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,"is in my writing; Mr. Pinhorne received that and gave it to me with the voucher, on my taking the duty from him.</p>

I understand you that at the end of each month you made out a list of all quantities supplied to the contractors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the statements I supplied are in the office books, but those of Gripper, and of another contractor, were paid only monthly, the statement was made out at the end of the month and I initialed it, that authorized him to receive the money from the contractor, he applied for payment and the contractor paid him, and the money was entered—before the money was paid by the con<lb/>tractor there must have been a statement sent to me and forwarded to the contractor, or I don't see how he could get it, these are 2nd June, and 3rd July, very near the time; I sent them in at the end of the month, and this is at the beginning—there is no reason for treating these sums differently to others, I should imagine that they were from monthly documents, they received them from time to time—that is not an account furnished by me, the contractor takes them away, and at the close of the month we get the total quantity—the contractor generally sent his clerk down to the office to compare his memorandum with the office books to see if there had been any disagreement between the Government and the con-tractor; this is bis document, not mine, and he is prepared to pay the same as soon as he is called upon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer G</hi>). From information I received, I went to the house of the prisoner Clark, at 4, Church Road, Greenwich, on 6th July—it is a private house—the name of Jeremiah Clark, carpenter and cabinet-maker, is over the door—I saw a female there—she went and fetched a key, and opened the prisoner's workshop, and there I saw ten sacks of biscuits—the prisoner came there about 12 o'clock—I asked him if his name was Clark, and he said it was—I told him I was a police officer, and I asked him if he had purchased any biscuits—he said he had, of a man named Tucker, living in Bermondsey, but he did not know where—I asked whether he had got any invoice or receipt—he said he had not, he was going to give 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—he said he had not paid for them, and he had been out that morning to see the value of them—I told him I should take him for being concerned with another man in obtaining goods by</p>

               <p>forged orders, and he was taken by Detective Short, who was with me, to the station—I found four cases just outside the back door, and they have been identified by Cox and Fenton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The premises were locked up, but the female produced the key at once—Clark called on the 7th of this month, and saw Inspector Dunton at the station—I was not there—he left a paper with an address, and asked that the policeman might go and see if be could find Mr. Tucker—I went to Lewisham, but could find no Mr. Tucker—I told the prisoner I believed Tucker was in custody, and he said "Is he?"—I said "Is there any man except one in this transaction?" and he said "No"—he was re<lb/>manded for a week, and was out on his own recognizance afterwards—he was twice out on bail—I don't know that he is a general dealer as well as a carpenter and cabinet-maker.</p>
