                  </hi>. I live at 2, Wiltshire Road, Brixton, and am a bookbinderâ€”I entered the service of Messrs. Shaw and Sons, of Fetter Lane, on 27th Octoberâ€”at that time I knew there were certain disputes going on between Messrs. Shaw and Sons and their employÃ©sâ€”there were a lot of men walking up and down, as pickets, to see if anyone came to take work there, and try to persuade them to go to the Society's rooms, and to pay their fare backâ€”I have seen the prisoner there as one of the pickets many times between 27th October and 16th November; he was there nearly every day; I have heard him say, "Come out, and be men"â€”that was said by him as well as the other picketsâ€”they followed us as we went along the streets, walking by the side of us, calling us <hi rend="italic">rats</hi>, and all that, bâ€”â€”old rats, and "You want your dâ€”d bâ€”â€”old heads knocked off"â€”I was desirous of obtaining lodgings near my work, and on 16th November I spoke to Mr. Gordon, the manager, about itâ€”I went out about half-past twelveâ€”when I got outside I saw the prisoner just alongside the front doorâ€”I went out at the front door and turned up Fetter Lane; the prisoner followed, meâ€”he said, "What do you mean by coming and taking work out of other people's hands?"â€”that was the first thing he said to meâ€”then he called me a bâ€”â€”old ratâ€”I said I did not want to have anything to say to himâ€”I went on, he still following meâ€”he kept abusing me with filthy language, saying, "You bâ€”â€”old rat, you ought to have your dâ€”bâ€”old head knocked off"â€”he followed me from one hundred and fifty to two hundred yardsâ€”I asked him what he was following me about forâ€”he said he would follow me as long as he had a mind, and where he had a mindâ€”finding he was following me in this way, I went back to Shaw and Sonsâ€”I came down Fetter Lane; before doing so I went down West Harding Street, thinking he would not follow me thereâ€”finding he did not give over following me, I turned to go back to Shaw's, and when I turned the prisoner struck me on the side of the face with his handâ€”I said, "If you strike me again you will have to pay for it"â€”he struck me a second time in the same wayâ€”I then went back in the direction of Shaw'sâ€”I saw Police Constable 434 outside, and I said to him in the prisoner's hearing, "I give this man in charge, he has been striking me"â€”the policeman said, "Would Mr. Shaw be willing that he should be given in charge?"â€”I went on and happened to come across Mr. Shaw Bond, and I made a communication to him, and he came out and spoke to the prisoner; I did not hear what he saidâ€”it was in Fetter Lane that this assault took place. (<hi rend="italic">A plan was produced, and the witness marked upon it the place where the assault took place as just in West Harding Street</hi>)â€”the new men came by train of a morning, for the first part of the time, and were escorted to work by the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If was unusual for one of the new men to go out in the middle of the dayâ€”I asked permission in the morningâ€”I did not see a member of the firm or a clerk watching at the door when I went outâ€”I heard there was a clerk looking out at the doorâ€”I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189201110005"/>
               <p>thirteen men in this department went out after notice, and thirteen new men were taken on; there was some dispute about working overtimeâ€”the new men were not members of the unionâ€”the prisoner did not ask me to join the union on the 16th; he had asked me along with the restâ€”after coming out at the front door I went on towards Holborn; I did not stopâ€”West Harding Street is not the first turning from Shaw's; there is a little turning firstâ€”the second time the prisoner struck me was in the face, and on the lip; both blows were on the side of the faceâ€”when I spoke to the policeman I believe he said, "Can you show me any mark?"or something of the sortâ€”he did not say, "You have got no mark,"or "I can't see any mark"â€”he said he had not seen the blow struckâ€”I did not mention to the policeman about my lip being cutâ€”I went to the Mansion House with Mr. Gordon, the manager; he wrote out the information for me; it was written out at Shaw's, one of the clerks wrote it outâ€”I don't think Mr. Shaw Bond was present, or either of the partnersâ€”when I told the policeman that the prisoner had struck me, the prisoner said, "I never struck the man at all"â€”when one of the firm said, "What business have you to interfere with my men, why did you strike him?" I did not hear the prisoner reply, "I did not strike him"â€”I think nothing was said in the information about my lip being cutâ€”I told the Lord Mayor that the two blows cut my lip just inside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first found out that my lip was cut when I got into the shop, I showed it to my shopmatesâ€”it could not be seen from the outside; it was just as if it was done by being knocked against the teeth and breaking the skin.</p>

I am a clerk to Shaw and Sonsâ€”on 16th November, about half-past twelve, I was inside the premisesâ€”I saw Carver go out and walk up Fetter Lane towards Holbornâ€”I saw the prisoner following himâ€”I went out and looked up the road after themâ€”I did not follow themâ€”I crossed over to the opposite side, and saw them as far as the corner of West Harding Streetâ€”the prisoner was walking behind Carver and talking to him, not quietly, rather excitedlyâ€”at the corner of West Harding Street a cart intervened; after the cart had passed I saw them turning down West Harding Streetâ€”I then went into the shopâ€”I afterwards saw Carver come back, I did not see anything about his lip then, I did afterwards; in the afternoon he showed it to me; I noticed that it was cut; I did not see anyone but the prisoner following Carverâ€”I saw Tickner at the Police-courtâ€”I saw him on the 16th outside Shaw's, walking up and down as a picketâ€”he did not follow them up Fetter Lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was mere idle curiosity that took me to the door to look after Carverâ€”the clerks can go out when they pleaseâ€”I did not know that Carver was going outâ€”the new men were brought and taken back by omnibus morning and eveningâ€”it was an unusual thing for one of the new men to go out in the dayâ€”the other men outside did not follow the prisoner and Carver, they remained about the doorâ€”I noticed Tickner that day particularlyâ€”there were three men, including the prisonerâ€”I had no motive for watching themâ€”Tickner could not see the prisoner and Carver going up the street; he was on Shaw's side of the wayâ€”the cart was in Fetter Laneâ€”anyone on Shaw's side would not have a better opportunity of seeing the cart than I had, he would not</p>

One of them handed something to Hutchinson, and he handed it to the prisoner Hastie I never saw the constable Brown until this occasion.

Hutchinson passed the something to Hastie, and they went away I am certain as to the men Hutchinson and Hastie, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi>"â€”the policeman Brown was then called and sworn; he said, "I apprehended the prisoners Noll and Liddiard at the time of the robbery. I saw then the prisoner Hutchinson pass something to Hastie, who put it in his pocket, and I heard it jingle. Hutchinson went away through Lever Street, and Hastie went towards Old Street. I apprehended Hutchinson at 11.30 on Saturday night; prosecutor was with me, and said, 'That is the man who assisted to rob me. 'I told Hutchinson the charge; he said, 'I don't know Liddiard and Noll, I am innocent. 'I apprehended the prisoner Hastie this morning. I told him the charge; he said, 'Believe me, I don't know anything about it; I was in the club, I saw prosecutor and others there, and I left before they did; the prosecutor was drunk, and was paying for half-pints of gin; he had on him Â£10 in gold, two watches and chains, three rings, and Â£2 10s. in silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to C. and C. J. Potter, paper stainers and manufacturersâ€”we employ nearly 2,000 workmenâ€”the basement of our London premises is part store-room and part officesâ€”Flint has been our salesman twenty-seven or twenty-eight yearsâ€”his wages were 27s. a weekâ€”I have seen Brown thereâ€”we have three salesmen on the ground floor and one on the basement, each of whom is provided with a book similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is Flint's book; it is a manifold book in triplicate, two copies being made by the usual carbon paperâ€”the salesman hands the book to the cashier, and the cash boy takes the extension of the items, and takes the cash, and takes one of the triplicates out and puts it on a file, and tears out the second and gives it to the customer, receipted, or. to the salesman for the customer, and the third remains in the bookâ€”in consequence of information I had set a watch prior to December 7thâ€”on December 9th Brown came to the warehouse about 12.15 and went down alone into the basement where Flint was"â€”he then came from the basement with Flint, who had a parcel in his hand wrapped in white paperâ€”he went to the front counter, wrapped it in Drown paper, and tied it with stringâ€”I saw him make out the triplicate note in a book which he handed into the office to the cash boyâ€”Gerald Daniels was the clerk at the cash deskâ€”Flint gave the parcel to Brown, who left the warehouseâ€”Detective Saunders, whom I had employed, was outsideâ€”I went out to the Bed lion in Cannon Street, and saw Brown; the roll of paper was leaning in a corner close to himâ€”I said, "I think you have just got back the parcel of goods from the firm; can I see it?" I had been to the cash desk and ascertained that it was eight pieces of lining at 4d., 2s. 8d.; he did not answer me, and was very much agitatedâ€”I tore the end of the wrapper out, and there were four pieces of sanitary paper in it, six pieces of bedroom paper, and one piece of border, value 9s. 4d.â€”they were all papers which we manufactureâ€”there was no lining paper there at allâ€”I have seen some scraps of paper produced from a house at Deptford; they were all made by usâ€”I said, "Where is the white lining paper you bought?"â€”he said, "These are a few pieces that are not lining paper; I have two or three pieces besides"â€”the detective was outside in plain clothesâ€”I went back to the warehouse and called Flint, who followed me into the office, Brown followed him, and the detective lastâ€”Flint spoke first; he said, "They were given in exchange for some goods I had to return"â€”Brown repeated that and added, "One a piece of border"â€”one of the partners was there, and they were chargedâ€”Flint said to the partner, "I hope</p>

               <p>you will look over this affair, it will be a great disgrace to me with your family; the amount is not much, and I will repay it"â€”I said to Brown, "You were in here on Monday"â€”he said, "I was not"â€”I showed Flint the cash paperâ€”this entry is in Flint's writing; "December 7, Mr. Brown, four oil, eight oaks, three lining, at 4d., 1s.; six, numbered 438, at 1s. 6d. Received with thanks, pro C. C. W., E. W."â€”those are the initials of the witness Whiteâ€”Flint said, "This is not the Brown; it is another Brown"â€”I saw this counterfoil of the very document found on Brownâ€”at that time Brown had not been searched, and Flint did not know that the invoice would be found on himâ€”they were given in charge and taken to the stationâ€”a detective was sent down to where Brown workedâ€”Neville showed me pieces of some of our 1892 patternsâ€”there is no record in our books of 1891 of any cash sale to Brown of papers of this descriptionâ€”Brown bought the cheapest goods we had.</p>

I have been five years at the London branch of the businessâ€”before I was engaged at the mills I was travellingâ€”I have not ascertained that Flint has been in the service of the firm since he was thirteen years of age; we generally send our books to the paper-mill to be destroyed every ten yearsâ€”there has been a change in the management and in the partnershipâ€”customers sometimes desire to change their papers, but we do not always do it; if we do it an entry is made in the rough-credit book, which is open to all the salesmen on the ground floor and basementâ€”we should give you a credit note for the difference, and if you did not like to take it we should give you the moneyâ€”I am not supposed to know that they make mistakesâ€”if I suspected a man I should be more strict; the difficulty would be less with an old hand, he would know his duty so much betterâ€”Flint practically had <hi rend="italic">carte blanche;</hi> there was no restriction in the warehouse to his getting goods of every sort and descriptionâ€”I have seen Brown there frequently as a customer during the five years I have been thereâ€”he might not say to a customer, "You may have this and bring it back to-morrow,"because we have spoken to him about it very oftenâ€”we never allow a man to have goods for others which he has not brought backâ€”I have not looked through Flint's book to see whether the entries are put against the lining, but instructions were given to himâ€”all papers bear numbers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been satisfied with the prisoner's conduct in every wayâ€”I never bad reason to complain of him; I found him a capital servantâ€”these vouchers were prepared in the office ready for the sums to be obtainedâ€”rarely an inquest has been changed at the last momentâ€”as to No. 40, the inquest would have taken place at the Vestry Hall, which is in the parish of Bow, had it not been held at the Board School, and the prisoner would naturally fill in "Vestry Hall, Bow"â€”he would put in the voucher beforehand the expenses which one expects to be incurred, such as 5s. for the Jury, 5s. for removal of body, and 7s. for the hire of the roomâ€”there is nothing irregular in thatâ€”the place of inquest was changed to oblige the peopleâ€”the number of my inquests vary, but they average about twenty a weekâ€”some days I might have ten or twelve, or even moreâ€”there is plenty of time for the vouchersâ€”I do not agree that the vouchers are frequently completed very hurriedly, they may be in Mr. Hodgkinson's casesâ€”I give the same answer when the inquests are ten in a dayâ€”we then have always to rush from one inquest to anotherâ€”I sign the vouchers in batches; not after every separate inquestâ€”one batch may include five, six, seven, or eight inquestsâ€”the officer would get the signatures of the witnesses as we were going alongâ€”the prisoner would have to continue paying expensesâ€”he could ask for a cheque on account, and occasionally I gave him oneâ€”I have seen other alterations in the registerâ€”I find some hereâ€”there are instances of alteration where the voucher has been accurateâ€”they may have arisen in consequence of witnesses having left the Court without signing, and their signatures have had to be obtainedâ€”that has not arisen from hurryâ€”in cases where a post-mortem is held, as a, matter of course Hammond was understood to give the order; but where there was any doubt, Hammond consulted me, and I crave the orderâ€”he gave the order in a number of oasesâ€”if he had given the order he might insert the amount in the voucher before the inquest; or if he intended, because it was known whether a post-mortem would be heldâ€”in most cases he would have authority to insert one guinea for the doctor's attendance, not alwaysâ€”the vouchers would all be in Hammond's 'possession at the end of the dayâ€”they would be filed in the officeâ€”at the end of the month I would sign a statutory declaration verifying the amountsâ€”I should have the vouchers by me when I signed the declarationâ€”there was nothing to prevent my examining them and detecting a mistakeâ€”Mr. Hodgkinson's vouchers were in Hammond's chargeâ€”when I signed the declaration they would be includedâ€”an improvement would be to write the totals in words, but I had implicit trust in the prisonerâ€”Mr. Hodgkinson had an opportunity of examining. the vouchers, and sometimes the statutory declaration would not be made at his office, but another near at handâ€”I would not sign for Mr. Hodgkinson unless I knew he had an opportunity of checking the vouchersâ€”</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, but have retired and live at Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bushâ€”prior to June, 1891, I became acquainted with the prisoner, and he visited at my houseâ€”on June 1, in consequence of a communication I received, I called at his place in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and when I got into his private room he had a letter in his handâ€”he said, "Here is a letter from a gentleman who wishes to join me at the Munich Theatre at the German Exhibition; it will be a good thing, like the Italian Exhibition; I should like you to take it up instead of him"â€”he said he had given Professor Herman Â£600 for his share in the profits of the theatre, and he was to get half the profits; that he had put in Â£300 and wanted another Â£300â€”he read a great part of this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to me, and said if it was good enough for him to put in Â£300, it was good enough for meâ€”I wanted to take it to my solicitor, but he said, "Leave it to me, I will look after your interests, as I am looking after my own; will you take it up or shall my friend?"(he had a friend who offered him Â£50 more)â€”I said, "I will take it up with you" he said, "I owe you some money, and I shall then be able to pay you off when we work the theatre; the Â£300 will be repaid before any profit by Herman and myself"â€”I said I would find the Â£300, and left, and received this agreement by post next morningâ€”his clerk, Mr. Holmes, called on me, and I tendered him this cheque for Â£100. (<hi rend="italic">Dated June</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1891); it is endorsed by the prisonerâ€”I afterwards handed him these two cheques for Â£100 eachâ€”they are endorsed by the prisoner, and were paid by my bankersâ€”I parted with them because I believed his statement that he had advanced Â£300.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have lent him money, and he owed me money at the time of this transactionâ€”I had lent him Â£15 in the May before this June, and he owed me more than thatâ€”I have retired from my professionâ€”I have never been to the Italian Exhibition; I have to the Germanâ€”I heard that the theatre of the Italian Exhibition had cleared Â£4,000â€”I have been in Manchester and Ealingâ€”I have lent money on mortgageâ€”I have assisted one or two, but I am not a money-lenderâ€”when the prisoner borrowed Â£25 in July I found out that he had not put this Â£300 in the theatre, and found that I had been swindledâ€”I went to my solicitor, and he advised me to prosecute the prisoner, and he was written toâ€”if he had paid me I don't mink I should have prosecuted himâ€”this is not the first time I have prosecuted a man to whom I have lent money; a man robbed me of Â£500, and I put it into Mr. Besley's handsâ€”the solicitors in that case were not the same as my solicitors nowâ€”he was sent for trial here, but he was not triedâ€”Mr. Avory asked me</p>

               <p>if he was acquitted, and I said "Yes"â€”my solicitor sent me a cheque for Â£500; I did not ask him where it came from, I did not want to knowâ€”I do not know who signed the cheque, I had not the cheque at all, my solicitor backed it and gave me the differenceâ€”that was not muchâ€”these proceedings were not taken against the gentleman purely with the view of forcing his friends to payâ€”he bought my house for Â£500, and I thought he had got it very cheapâ€”I did not take his money; my solicitor took it-that is not the reason why I waited from July to November in this caseâ€”I said to Mr. Avory, at the Police-court, "Not getting my money from the defendant, I put the matter into my solicitor's hands; I was induced to advance the money because of the success he said it would be"â€”I had other reasons, which I was prepared to giveâ€”Mr. Avory said, "Is that your only reason?" and I said, "I cannot think of anything else,"because I had answered the other questions previouslyâ€”I would not have put Â£300 in if he had not put money inâ€”I did not ask him where he got the Â£300 from; I was told by two parties that he had just received Â£500; one of them was his brotherâ€”I did not ask for the money he owed me; he said I should have that after the Exhibitionâ€”Mr. Herman went with me to the Police-court to get the warrantâ€”the prisoner was written to several times, and asked what he meant by such conduct, and he promised to payâ€”my solicitor has his answer.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Complaining that he was not there when the called with her mother the day before</hi>)â€”I received this reply.

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of 11, Copthall Courtâ€”I know Cloeteâ€”on 30th June, 1890, he borrowed of me, in the name of the Development and Investment Company, Limited, Â£600â€”as security he deposited this transfer of 200 shares in the Simmer and Jack Gold Mining Companyâ€”No. 3,716, that is executed by Cloeteâ€”the numbers in the body of the transfer are on the shares; they are not very distinctâ€”referring to my book I find the numbers are 27,476 to 525, 54,508 to 12, 71,800 to 4, 59,158 and 9, 18,551 to 5, 13,984 to 14,008, 71,795 to 9, 59,160 to 2, and 15,367 to 466â€”twenty sharesâ€”they are the numbers as they originally stood crossed out on the transfer in red and black, and there is a reference "see back"â€”on the back is another set of numbersâ€”this is my cheque for Â£600, drawn on my bankers, and made payable to the Development Investment Company or bearer, and that is the cheque that represented those. 200 sharesâ€”that loan was repaid, Â£400 on 16th, Â£100 on 18th, and Â£104 17s. 6d. on 22nd Julyâ€”the extra Â£4 17s. 6d. is made up by the stamp, Â£1 15s., and interest at 10 per cent, Â£3 2s. 6d.â€”I thereupon retransferred to Cloete or the Development Company 200 shares in the Simmer Company on 80th Julyâ€”unlike bonds to bearer, you can retransfer any sharesâ€”this transfer is numbered 3,715 in the right-hand corner, and is in Cloete's nameâ€”these shares are numbered 49,387 to 411, 49,362 to 71, 7,819 to 23, 7,729 to 7,808, 4,871 to 40, 52,563 to 77, 62,888 to 62, 5,580 to 89, and 12,031 to 40â€”the numbers on the back of Cloete's transfer to me are the same as the shares I transferred to Cloeteâ€”so that the original shares which Cloete transferred to me have substituted in their place the shares which I transferred back to himâ€”when I was asked to lend money I did not do it myself, but through Besley, a dealer in the market, and directly the shares were put in my name by Cloete I transferred to Besley, and simply passed the transaction through, interest and everythingâ€”that transfer is 3,717â€”in this book I first find a transfer from myself to Cloete, 8,716; then one from Cloete to me; 3,717 is from myself to Besley, the same shares which I got from Cloeteâ€”the numbers are altered in the transfer from myself to Besleyâ€”it appears as if I transferred to Besley the actual shares I actually transferred back to Closte.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I commenced my investigation of the books early in 1891â€”two transfers bear Cloete's signature; one to Bailey, the other to Macphersonâ€”also one to Godefroiâ€”the transfers are filled up with other writings, not Cloete'sâ€”the alterations are not made in Cloete's writingâ€”Cook, a clerk of the Simmer Company, abscondedâ€”I heard thatâ€”I know nothing of Jaffrayâ€”I have been told he has gone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189201110055"/>
               <p>â€”I heard Macpherson make a statement at the Police-courtâ€”the certificate is lodged at the company's office, and examined with the registerâ€”a borrower would sign a transfer of the shares held as securityâ€”all the details would be filled in by clerks, not by Cloeteâ€”Cloete's office was a large oneâ€”the business of a number of companies was conducted by the Development Company thereâ€”Cloete was the managing director of the Development Companyâ€”about three clerks were employed on the Simmer Company's businessâ€”Macpherson's name does not come into the books as operating clerk on the Stock Exchangeâ€”Bailey has not demanded the 330 sharesâ€”the certificate was lodged for verificationâ€”Bailey's loan was paid offâ€”nobody claims the 330 shares.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Readâ€”Signed</hi> H. <hi rend="italic">Macpherson:"</hi> Holloway Prison, 7th November, 1891.â€”I wish, in the interests of justice, to repeat the statement I caused to be conveyed to the Simmer and Jack Company last June, namely, that the only persons responsible for putting in circulation the duplicate shares of the company, to the extent of 630 shares, all I know of, are R. A. Jaffray, W. B. Cook, and myself. These shares were sold through Messrs. Lane Brothers, 17, Tokenhouse Yard, to whom the business was introduced by Jaffray. The proceeds, rather over Â£2,000, were equally divided between the three of us. The transfers for these shares were put on the books by Cook, in place of a like number of genuine shares which had been sold by me on Mr. Cloete's behalf, the transfers of which were kept back and destroyed. All this was done without Mr. Cloete's knowledge. All the stock and share business of the office was managed by me, Mr. Cloete placing in me the most implicit confidence, seldom ever looking to the accounts. I abused that confidence in the manner above stated. I have also to state that Poster, whose name has been mentioned, had no hand in the conspiracy."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. ALLIOTT</hi>. I have been attending Arthur Bailey for influenzaâ€”have sent him to St. Leonards; he is not fit to come here and giv evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition was read of Arthur Cecil Bailey, on October</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1891:" I am a member of the firm of Wood, Neame, and Co, stockbrokers, of 1, Drapers' Gardens, City. The defendant Cloete and the Simmer and Jack Gold Mining Company had offices in the same building. To the best of my belief the offices were the same. I have had business with the defendant Cloete as to both the sale and purchase of shares. I knew the prisoner Macpherson as Cloete's clerk. I never had dealings with Macpherson as principal. I saw Macpherson from time to time with respect to the business I was doing for Cloete. I have sold shares in this gold mining company on instructions from Mr. Cloete without certificates. In ordinary course, if it was not intended to carry over, a transfer would be lodged at the company's office for verification. The particulars for the filling up of the transfer would be obtained from Mr. Cloete. "<hi rend="italic">Also, on 10th November</hi>, 1891: "On the 27th May, 1890, I sold to Mr. Wenkheim 100 shares of the Simmer and Jack Mining Company by direction of Mr. Cloete. I had had previous transactions with Mr. Cloete, of which I kept a record in my books; at the time of that sale he was indebted to me in a balance of Â£25 18s. 1d. I produce a press copy of the statement of account sent to the accused about the 28th May. I cannot say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189201110056"/>
               <p>by whom it would be posted. The usual course would be to post these letters. I produce a cheque for Â£401 11s. 5d., dated May 31st, 1890, payable to S. Cloete, Esq., or bearer; that cheque was given to Macpherson. It was copied by usâ€”the National Bank account payee. The amount of that cheque was for the balance due to Cloete after deducting the amount of Â£25 18s. 1d. owing by him. The course of business is for the broker to whom I sell to give the name of the transferee. I received from Mr. Wenkheim the names of the transferee and the brokers. I received certain names and certain parcels of shares from Mr. Wenkheim. The general rule with Mr. Cloete's shares was to prepare the transfers, as far as we could. They were then handed to Mr. Macpherson, to complete, in accordance with written instructions signed by Macpherson (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). I have no doubt it was followed in this case; I know of nothing to the contrary According to the usual custom we should then receive them back from Macpherson completed. I received payment for these 100 shares from six different brokers, viz., Krailsheimer, 15 shares; Borthwick, Wark and Co., 20; Greatorex, 20; Lowenstein, 30; Koblyn and King, 5; and Godefroi 10. Against those payments I handed over the transfers; they were all from Macpherson to the different brokers, except the last 10 to Godefroi, which were from Cloete to Macpherson. I find from an entry in my books that the numbers of the 15 to Krailsheimer were 785,016 to 30, of the 20 to Borthwick, Wark and Co., 46,258 to 46,262, and 15,882 to 196; of the 20 to Greatorex, 76,971 to 5, 78,501 to 5 and 78,506 to 15; of the 30 to Lowenstein, 62,513 to 32 and 60,143 to 152; of the 5 to Hoblyn and King, 46,253 to 7; and of the 10 to Godefroi, 78,531 to 40. On the payment of the cheques the transfers would be handed over to the buying broker. On the 27th June, 1890,1 made a loan to Cloete of Â£1,000. I am quite sure I saw Mr. Cloete himself. It was on the security of 330 Simmer and Jack share. He paid Â£500 off on August 15th; there was a further loan on September 5th of Â£250. I think Mr. Cloete saw me nearly always with reference to this loan. In the usual course a fortnightly statement would be rendered. I believe it was Macpherson who delivered the transfers of the 330 shares upon which we made the advance. Lawrence Cloete was the name of the transferor, I was the transferee. I caused it to be lodged at the office of the Simmer and Jack Company. I received a receipt, and in due course the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked O. I afterwards had a communication from the accountants, and saw Mr. Fisher, and made an examination of the books. I spoke to Mr. Cloete about what I had ascertained; I said I had had a communication from the accountants, Deloite, Dever and Co., and the certificate did not appear to be regular; I should think this was about March last. Mr. Cloete expressed surprise at anything being irregular with the certificate; and ultimately, on the 16th April, 1891, the loan was paid off. We then handed him back the certificate. I produce cheque for Â£1,000 dated June 27th, 1890, payable to L. Cloete Esq.; it bears his endorsement, I believe. I had no business with Macpherson as a customer. I acted with him as Mr. coete's clerk. When I handed back the certificate to Mr. Cloete I handed him a retransfer for the shares, not a blank transfer; a transfer from me to him. There was no conversation. "<hi rend="italic">Also</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th, November</hi>, 1891;".</p>

               <p>of Cloete. I am now one of the partners of Wood, Neame and Co.; I became a partner about March, 1889. I am not mistaken in saying that Mr. Cloete saw me with reference to the Â£1,000 loan; I was always there, and Mr. Cloete used to call and ask for Mr. Neame, who was seldom there, and I saw him. Mr. Macpherson generally saw me with reference to matters of detail, such as particulars of transfers of shares. I knew Mr. Cloete had interviews with Mr. Neame as to the Â£1,000 loan; I don't know if Mr. Cloete was a buyer of shares at that time; our firm never bought or sold shares of any kind with the Development Company. It was I who made the loan of the Â£1,000 on behalf of the firm. I can't say if I have had cheques for the Development Company; we should take any cheques that he paid in. It would be quite an ordinary circumstance for the certificate not to be given to me when selling shares. The instructions for the transfers would be given by a clerk as being matters of detail.</p>

I live at 40, St. James's Road, Brixtonâ€”I was a clerk to the Development Company at 1, Drapers' Gardensâ€”Cloete was managing directorâ€”he was connected with other companies, which had offices there and at No. 18â€”I was there till Christmas, 1890â€”Cook was a clerk especially engaged on the Simmer Company's businessâ€”he was assisted by Foster, Gower, and Eldridgeâ€”they were paid by the Development Company, some weekly and some monthlyâ€”in 1889 Gower's duties were transferred to another clerkâ€”I was London secretary to the Simmer Companyâ€”up to then I was employed by the Development Companyâ€”certificates would be brought to me for examination and signatureâ€”Cloete instructed me to have the certificates examined by clerks, as he said my time was too valuable to be wasted in examining certificatesâ€”from then they were examined by two clerksâ€”I signed them without personally examining them, believing them to be correctâ€”Macpherson was the Stock Exchange clerk of Mr. Cloeteâ€”he had nothing to do with the Simmer Companyâ€”he sat, when in the office, with his back to the back of Cook and Fosterâ€”Cook and Foster went away about August or September, 1890â€”they disappeared suddenlyâ€”I heard from Macpherson they had gone to America from Eustonâ€”I saw Macpherson constantly in the officeâ€”Cloete also mentioned thatâ€”I told Macpherson I heard they had gone to Australiaâ€”Macpherson at my request wrote to the landlord of the hotel where they stayedâ€”I knew from Macpherson they were staying at an hotel at Liverpoolâ€”he gave me the reply to my letter and the name of the vessel, and said they were gone to New Yorkâ€”I gave that letter to Mr. Gilchristâ€”the certificates for the 200 shares bear my signatureâ€”100 of these were purchased in March and April, 1889, and they were placed in my name as secretary of the Neva Syndicateâ€”they remained in my possession till they were handed over to Dr. Neva in February or April, 1891â€”I had not the slightest knowledge those shares were being dealt with by Cloete or Macpherson so as to place them in the hands of other people.</p>

Gregg, of 11, Copthall Courtâ€”Cloete's signature is witnessed by J. J. Ridley, a solicitorâ€”the others are witnessedâ€”the transfer clerk would retain the transfer, and paste it in a book, with which Cloete had nothing to do.</p>

I have twenty companies in my office, and my confidential clerk frequently lays papers before me for my signature; I have never signed a certificate for these shares"â€”shares were mentioned in the warrant, which is not hereâ€”it was for fifteen shares in Simmer and Jack Gold Mining Companyâ€”on 27th October I was at the trial of Cloete before the Magistrateâ€”a communication was made to me; I went to the corridor of the Court and saw Macphersonâ€”I said, "Is your name Hugh Macpherson?"â€”he said, "Yes"â€”I said, "Have you come here to surrender yourself to me to-day?"â€”he said, "Yes"â€”I read the warrant to him and said, "Are you the person mentioned in that warrant?"â€”he said, "Yes"â€”he was conveyed to the station, the charge was entered, and I returned to the Guildhallâ€”there I was asked by the solicitor for Cloete, when I was giving evidence, "Is it not a fact that Macpherson has stated that he would take all the blame upon himself?"or words to that effectâ€”I answered, "No; not to me"â€”I was not in Court when Macpherson's statement was madeâ€”I saw Macpherson go from the dock to the cells, the same place as Cloete had goneâ€”on 11th November Macpherson handed me the statement which has been read.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Plack, Chandler and Co., hide and tallow brokers, 17, St. Mary Axe, Cityâ€”up to 30th March, 1890, I had another partner, who then went outâ€”the defendant had been confidential clerk and book-keeper for about twelve yearsâ€”his duties were to keep the books, to pay wages, to receive from the wharf at Stony Lane moneys due from charges there, to pay them in to the head office, or the Imperial Bank where we bank, and enter the items into the booksâ€”after March, 1890, my attention was directed to the freight and to the charges accountâ€”in</p>

               <p>consequence of looking into the matter I spoke to the defendant about itâ€”I first made an examination of the books at Stony Lane in June, 1890â€”Mr. Child is our warehouse keeper thereâ€”books were kept there showing charges received by Child on account of the firmâ€”the prisoner initialled Child's book for the charges paid over to himâ€”the prisoner kept, in the petty cash-book, the payment of wagesâ€”he was authorised to draw the sum necessary for wages at St. Mary Axe and Stony Laneâ€”in June I made an extract from Child's bookâ€”I took out amounts to the total of Â£256 5s. 4d. initialled by the prisoner as received by himâ€”I then examined the cash-book and found a deficiency of Â£114 oddâ€”in consequence of that result I had the amounts for the two previous quarters taken out, and found a deficiency on both those quartersâ€”I called in the assistance of Mr. Moore, an accountantâ€”I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he was suspended about the 23rd Juneâ€”he said he knew he had allowed his books to run into arrears, and that his conduct had been abominable in allowing things to get into such a state, but he could not give any information with regard to the deficiencyâ€”we told him to make up the books, which he failed to doâ€”after his suspension correspondence took place, and an appointment was made for him to come to the office of Messrs. Carpenter, my private solicitor; he came with his solicitor, Mr. Wireâ€”I asked him to explain the deficiency of Â£114 11s. 5d., the figures of which were given him beforehand in writing, to give him time to make the explanationâ€”he said there were slips (which were handed to me) which would show the money had been paid in wages; I said, "If these charges have been used to pay wages, how do you account for the fact of your having drawn from petty cash Â£750 and the total amount paid out for wages r"â€”he had debited petty cash from day to day; he said the wages had been paid out of these chargesâ€”the whole of the wages he had charged against petty cashâ€”he would still have a balance in handâ€”his solicitor said, "Stop; don't go into petty cash; you came here to go into charges"â€”that was the end of the interviewâ€”the following day I received a letter from his solicitor threatening an action for slanderâ€”I was still examining the booksâ€”about 25th September I saw Messrs. Wontnerâ€”the result of the information from the books and that interview was that I charged the prisoner at the Guildhall with falsificationâ€”that charge came before one of the Aldermen on 7th October, 1890â€”the prisoner was represented, and an application was made for a postponement pending the civil proceedingsâ€”then another action was commenced against me for wagesâ€”those actions were consolidated, and came on in the High Court in November lastâ€”then the falsification charge came on before the Alderman, and that., accounts for the lapse of time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief clerk. to the Official Receiver; I have since been appointed Assistant Official Receiverâ€”I investigated the books of the English Bank of the River Plate, by order of the Court, in August, 1891, founded on a petition of 17th July, 1891â€”that bank was established in London in 1881, incorporated as a company, and registered at Somerset House in that yearâ€”the head office was at 15, St. Swithin's Laneâ€”the filing of the petition was in July, 1891â€”it had three branches, at Monte Video, Rosario, and Buenos Ayres, and two agencies at two different placesâ€”among the books of the bank which I examined I examined the ledgers for 1884 to 1891 inclusiveâ€”I also examined the journals over the same yearsâ€”I had before me in detail the account at Glyn's and a rough cash-book, also two other books in use at the bank from 1884 to 1891, one called office cash-book and the other called "Private account, A. E. Smithers, "from September, 1890â€”this book was obtained from Mr. Smithers by Mr. Stewart, the Official Receiverâ€”I think there were three or four applications to Mr. Smithers for itâ€”in the journal all the sums advanced to Mr. Smithers out of the office are omittedâ€”I compared the contents of the office cash-book with the contents of the ledgerâ€”all the sums in the office cash-book advanced to Mr. Smithers are absent from the ledgerâ€”I find that on 9th August, 1884, the office cash was deficient to the extent of Â£6,799 4s. 6d.; on 81st August, 1884, it was deficient Â£323 8s. 6d.; by 30th September, 1884, that deficiency had been made good by payments inâ€”the financial year of the bank terminated on 30th September each year; at that time the</p>

               <p>deficiency of office cash was Â£1,187 6s. 3d.â€”by 30th September that again had been balanced by paymentsâ€”on 31st August, 1886, the office cash was short Â£4,361 8s. 2d., as shown by the books that were balanced by payment on 30th September the same year; on 30th June, 1887, there was a deficiency of Â£5,611 18s. 3d.; by 31st August that was reduced to Â£397 7s. 3d., and by 30th September the deficiency was balanced by paymentâ€”on 31st August, 1888, the office cash was deficient Â£2,415 2s. 8d.; that was balanced by paymentâ€”on 22nd August, 1889, the office cash was short by Â£9,207 4s. 4d.; that deficiency was wiped off by payment on 30th September, 1889; on 26th July, 1890, the office cash was deficient Â£7,697 15s. 2d.â€”in the ledger there is an account headed, "General suspense account, "under that same date in the ledger there is an entry "To general suspense account, Â£7,697 15s. 2d."â€”the entry is "Amount to be received from J. C. Dalcaine, Buenos Ayres, on account Mr. A. E. Smithers, as per Mr. Smithers' instructions" this amount is debited to the general suspense account on that day, and credited to the office cash by this entry in the journalâ€”on 10th September I find a bill for Â£4,000 credited to the general suspense account, and going in reduction of the Â£7,697; the entry gives the journal folio 669â€”at page 669 it is charged to "Bills receivable account"; and when the credit is given on suspense the entry was as above, and the entry above is in the journal, "Draft on Baring Brothers and Co., Â£4,000"; that is under "Bills receivable account,"10th Septemberâ€”"The branches' floating entries account"is a separate account in the same ledgerâ€”on September 30th there is an entry of the transfer from the suspense account, balance of amount to be received from J. C. Dalcaine, on account of Smithers, Â£3,679 15s. 2d.â€”it is debited to the branches' floating entries accountâ€”it has gone to the credit of the suspense accountâ€”the branches' floating entries account purports to relate to sums correctly described by the name of the account; sums coming forward to be paid to the floating branches"account, the three places in Americaâ€”no purely London transaction had any business in that accountâ€”from my examination of the books that sum has never been paidâ€”on 10th October, 1890, it appears Â£200 was drawn out to office cash, and upon the same day that sum appears first to the credit of Smithers' private account at the London and Westminster Bank, drawn out from Glyn, Mills and Co., and the same day a similar sum was paid away by cheque to Mr. Jacksâ€”on 10th October, 1890, a sum of Â£1,000 was drawn out by cheque to office cash, and upon that same date Â£1,000 appears to the credit of Smithers' account, and was paid away on the same day to Mr. Hodgkinsonâ€”on 27th November I find this cheque to office cash for Â£2,500, signed by Smithers as one of the signatories; on that day it appears to the credit of Smithers' private account in the first instance, and on the same day a cheque for the same amount is drawn out of the London and Westminster Bank to selfâ€”this is the counterfoil.

               <p>the prisoner's initialsâ€”I have examined the counterfoil of cheque 7215,. on 1st November, 1890, for Â£1,000; among the particulars on that counterfoil I find the name of McColl with Â£200 against itâ€”the gross amount of cheque 7221, on 3rd November, 1890, is Â£1,000; on the counterfoil is Dominiquez Â£186 and Â£369, making Â£555, and Walton Â£287â€”the gross amount of cheque 7274, on 15th November, is Â£1,000; on the counterfoil is Famini Â£100, Walton Â£170, Ridd Â£100, Randall Â£100, and Wrenbergâ€”the 27th November's counterfoil purports to show Â£200 as against the name of Randall, and not Â£100 as appears on the counterfoil of 15th November, and a sum of Â£300 against Walton as distinct from the Â£287 on 3rd November"; except in those instances the same sums are entered against the same names as appear on the counterfoils of 1st, 3rd, and 15th Novemberâ€”on 12th December, 1890, Â£400 was drawn to office cash from Glyn Mills, and on the same day a similar sum was paid into the prisoner's account at the London and Westminster Bank; next day that sum was paid to one Ripleyâ€”on 2nd February, 1891, a cheque for Â£350 was drawn to office cash; that does not seem to have been put into the bank in any lump sum, or any sum like that about that dateâ€”this book is marked "A. E. Smithers, Esq., private, No. 2"â€”on 28th April I find Â£200 drawn from Glyn Mills to office cashâ€”it was paid into the prisoner's private account at the London and Westminster Bank on that day, and drawn out on the same dayâ€”I have traced all the sums I have mentioned in private account-book No. 2â€”on 2nd May a cheque for 350 was drawn for office cash from Glyn Mills; there is an entry in "Private account No. 2"of that sumâ€”I do not see that that went into the bankâ€”these are two cheques of 9th May for Â£931 13s. 5d., and 11th May for Â£122 12s. 1d., making together Â£ 1,054 5s. 6d.â€”on the counterfoils of those cheques it is stated they are to meet some branches' sight drafts; that of 9th May is initialed W. R. and A. E. S.; and that of 11th May is initialed W. R. and M., I think; of the 9th May cheque W. Rogers and A. E. Smithers are the signatories, and have initialed the counterfoilâ€”in private account-book No. 2, in the prisoner's banking account, I find under 9th May Â£950 appearing to the credit of the accountâ€”the prisoner's credit balance stood the day before at Â£40 2s. 7d.â€”on 27th November, 1890, his credit balance was Â£362 14s. 10d.â€”these cheques are drawn on Glyn Mills, were cashed at Glyn Mills, and the notes with which they were cashed were paid into the prisoner's account at the London and Westminster Bankâ€”on 13th June, 1891, Â£200 was drawn to office cash, and appears in private account-book No. 2, and the same day it was paid into the prisoner's private account at the London and Westminster, and drawn out; it appears as Â£200 received from the London and Westminster Bank on that dayâ€”on 1st July Â£60 was drawn to office cash; it appears in the books, and I can identify itâ€”it was paid either to or on account of Mr. Wilfred Smithers, the prisoner's sonâ€”this is a receipt of 1st July for Â£60: "Received on account of A. E. S., Â£60; W. A. S,"â€”on 14th July, 1891, I find the office cash was deficient Â£7,146 7s. 2d.; by examining the private account-book I find that sum had been employed by Mr. Smithers for his own purposesâ€”on the same date I find an entry to the debit of Office loan account of Â£7,146 7s. 2d.; the entry is, "Balance of your account in office cash per pass-book, per <hi rend="italic">now</hi> debited to this account per your <hi rend="italic">instructions</hi>"â€”<hi rend="italic">among other</hi> papers which I found on</p>

Joan account; balance to his account of office cash, Â£7,146 7s. 2d.,"marked by a clerk's initialsâ€”it is also credited in the office cash book, and debited to loan account, under the same date, 14th Julyâ€”between 1st June, 1888, and 30th August 1890, it appears by the loan account that Smithers had borrowed from the bank Â£28,749 11s. 3d., and against those advances he would seem to have lodged securitiesâ€”on 5th December, 1890, according to this book, the bank made him a further advance of Â£12,767, against various securities: I believe there is a charge on his house and some land at Gods tone, some life policies, and his life sharesâ€”no part of the Â£7,146 has ever been paidâ€”no securities were lodged against that advance; nothing except his monthly salaryâ€”I find entries of the balance of Mrs. Smithers' account running throughout the private account, purporting to show the sums of money paid to her in the course of each monthâ€”there is a varying balance, but it very nearly exhausts the amount of his salary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I find that in October, 1890, Mr. Smithers paid Â£1,000 in deduction of the money drawn from cashâ€”I hare thoroughly gone into the affairs of this bank so far as I was able; so far as relates to this prosecutionâ€”the defendant was one of the founders of the bank; he was made managing director under the articles of association of the companyâ€”previous to his connection with this bank he had been for thirteen years manager of the River Plate Bank in London, and abroad also, I believeâ€”the company was in every way a respectable company, and the directors responsible men of businessâ€”Mr. Burke, chairman of the Central Argentine Railway; Mr. Cator, Hon. S. C. Glyn, a director of the Bank of Egypt; Lord George Hamilton, Mr. Moses, of the firm of Moses, Levy and Co.; and Mr. Best, Liverpoolâ€”this bank was founded in 1881, with a paid-up capital of Â£750,000, and a subscribed capital of as much moreâ€”Mr. Smithers held about Â£2,000 worth of shares, speaking from memory, it might be Â£3,000â€”he continued td hold that up to the time of the winding-up of the bank; that carried with it and included liability for as much more as had actually been paidâ€”the shares continued to stand in his own nameâ€”I found that the bank had been exceedingly prosperousâ€”it appears that the balance-sheet of 30th June shows gross profit to amount to Â£265,000, after making provision for bad and doubtful debtsâ€”the auditors are well known in the City, Mr. Vanderline, and Mr. Kemp, of the firm of Ford and Co.â€”in 1888 the divisible profit was Â£120,079, the gross profit close upon Â£200,000; in 1889 the divisible profit was Â£197,326, the gross profit close on Â£300,000; in 1889 the divisible profit was Â£188,725, the gross profit above Â£200,000â€”the amount of the reserve fund was Â£350,000; that was invested in English securities, or India stock, in good securitiesâ€”in the balance-sheet of 1890, after paying 10 per cent., there was carried to the reserve fund Â£75,000â€”what brought about the downfall of the bank was the state of things in the Argentine Republic, and that was followed by the failing of Messrs. Baringsâ€”a law was passed by which the debtors in Buenos Ayres were absolved from liability for a time from the payment of debts, so that no action for the payment of debt could be brought for a certain periodâ€”no doubt that deteriorated very largely the original securities, it has not yet fully recoveredâ€”the depression was in some cases even more than 25 or 30 per cent.â€”I know generally that</p>

               <p>Mr. Smithers was interested in Argentine securities, and very probably suffered when the crash cameâ€”a call has been applied for on the shareholders of the bank, it has not been actually made at presentâ€”it would be rather a bold thing to say that the bank will be able to pay its debtsâ€”I daresay we have put that forwardâ€”Mr. Stewart, the Official Assignee, is not in Courtâ€”I attended the meeting the other dayâ€”I agree with the statement then made, that the gross liabilities were stated at four millions, of which three millions were expected to rank; so that upon this estimate the capital of the bank would, if realised; prove to be intact; but I may explain, as regards the branches, the uncertainty of all the values of the property would to some extent diminish the profitsâ€”assuming the values should turn out as we hope, there would be an estimated surplus of a million, Â£40,000â€”I have had access to the minutes of the companyâ€”I believe in the case of each loan by the bank to Mr. Smithers a proper minute was made, and a proper entry in the accountsâ€”I have in my hand the office cash-book, that is one of the regular books of the bank, open to inspection to any officer of the bank, and might be called for at any meeting of the board, and by the auditors if they desired to see itâ€”I find in this book, under the date of 10th October, 1890, this entry, "A.

S., Â£60"â€”those items exhaust the sums charged in the indictmentâ€”the result is that in this bank-book there is correctly recorded the sums Mr. Smithers got from the cash, the sums now charged against himâ€”these entries are not all in one handwriting; there are four or five handwritings of different clerks in the officeâ€”there was no secrecy about the payment of these sums, as far as this book is concerned; it must have been known to the persons making the entriesâ€”the principals and clerks have been continued in the employment of the bank, which is in course of reconstructionâ€”they are men against whose character nothing is allegedâ€”Mr. Smithers did not in any way seek to deny the receipt of these items from the cash, after he was asked about itâ€”I have only been able to find two of the books called "private"â€”I believe all the sums are entered there which have been entered in the office cash-booksâ€”the private pass-books are in different handwritings, so that those books must have been known to a number of persons in the officeâ€”the books anterior to October, 1890, had similar entries in them; the system had continued for a number of yearsâ€”I have not traced a single penny paid to Smithers that has not been entered in the proper cash-book of the bankâ€”one of the two private account-books is numbered 2; that goes from 11th January, 1890, to July 14th, 1891; that gives the balance from a previous book Â£3,200 oddâ€”all the items are properly entered and debited; they are a number of minute items (<hi rend="italic">the item were read by</hi> Sin <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES RUSSELL</hi>); it goes up to July, 1890, when the Argentine difficulties began; in 1884 he paid in Â£6,799 4s. 6d. to square the</p>

S., Â£797 16s. 2d."â€”that is in a book which the auditors would have before them; farther on there is an entry of the Â£4,000â€”if Â£7,000 odd came from Buenos Ayres through the branch there to Mr. Smithers, it ought not to have gone on the head office suspense account; it ought to have gone on the floating branch entries accountâ€”it appears under "Suspense account"â€”if that amount was expected from J. C. Dalcaine, it should come to the account of Smithersâ€”in the next page Â£4,000 is entered, leaving a balance of Â£3,697; Dalcaine's name does not appear in that entry; that balance is transferred from the suspense account to the branches' floating interest account; in Journal No. 12, under date of 30th September, 1890, there is this item, "Transfer from suspense account, <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>, 24th July, 1890, balance of amount to be received from J. C. Dalcaine, on account of A. E. Smithers, Â£3,697"â€”it appears by that entry that Â£3,697 was expected from Dalcaine; there is not anything wrong on the face of itâ€”I don't see how it could be entered in any other way, except it went to the man directâ€”I take it that the real objection is that there was no separate account opened, showing at a glance the amount that had been received by Smithers from the cash of the bank, except of course that he ought not to have had that money in the first place at allâ€”the winding-up proceedings commenced before 14th July, 1891â€”that entry correctly states that Mr. Smithers did owe to the office cash Â£7,146 7s. 2d., which he could not <hi rend="italic">repay;</hi> and it refers to the office-book, the items in which correspond with the items in the office cash-bookâ€”I should say that it should have been opened in his own name as a fresh account, as money taken from the cash-till, and called by its proper name, as <hi rend="italic">withdrawn from</hi> office cash; that would represent the transactionâ€”that is certainly the purport of the entry; however it was entered it would not affect the position of the bank or the position of Smithersâ€”stating it in that way, and making reference to the pass-book, would necessarily call attention to how the account was made up; it did call my attentionâ€”I can only say that it ought not to be in an account which is called at the top "Loan account"â€”that might deceive; it might show to the ordinary inquirer that he was authorised to take moneys from the office cash, or that there was an express authority given him for the loan; that was the inference that I think most would drawâ€”the moment reference was made to the cashbook it would appear what the real character of the transaction wasâ€”the rough office cash-book does not contain any of the entries which appear in the office cash-book, it is really only a copy of the account with Glyn, Mills and Co.; I should not expect payments of cash to Smithers to appear thereâ€”in addition there were ledger and journalâ€”comparison between ledger and office cash-book would have shown at any time the deficiency in cash, and would have shown that there had gone a considerable amount out of cash that did not appear in the ledgerâ€”that, if looked at any time over this period of year, would have been disclosed to any intelligible observer, except on that date when it was all balanced and cleared up at the end of the financial yearâ€”the entry of 14th July, 1891, under head of "Loans account"shows it was on the prisoner's instructions that it was made, and that is corroborated by the actual instructionsâ€”this is the slip I found in the office; in pursuance of</p>

               <p>it the entry was madeâ€”after I assumed the supervision of affairs at the bank, certain deeds relating to a house of Mr. Smithers, at Brighton, came into my possession; I believe it was freeholdâ€”the deeds are not entered in any bank book, so far as I have been able to ascertainâ€”in the securities-book securities lodged against each loan are entered; these deeds do not appear anywhere, but they were in possession of the bank and in the safe at the time of liquidationâ€”the property comprised in them realised Â£4,000, and that sum the prisoner has been given credit for in his general accountâ€”I should think about a month after the money was received he objected to it, and said he was entitled to get credit for it against the cashâ€”since liquidation Â£4,000 has been realised in that wayâ€”I was present at the Police-court when the prisoner was called on as to whether he had anything to say, and I heard what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deeds of the Brighton house were found by Mr. Byrne, a clerk in the Official Receiver's office; I have not been told where it was foundâ€”there was no entry in the bank-books, nor any indication that it had ever been taken as securityâ€”the only thing that has been realised in connection with the account are the deeds of the Brighton house, so far as I am awareâ€”other securities remain in possession of the official liquidatorsâ€”I should say there was no probability of the securities lodged against advances producing a surplusâ€”the general amount of loans and deficiencies comes altogether to about Â£66,000; of that sum Â£41,000 is attributable to loans which were sanctioned in regular course by the directorsâ€”every one of those loans was regularly earned through the books by a minute of the directors authorising it, and by the proper entries in the books, and the securities received against those loans were duly entered in the register of securities held by the companyâ€”there was no minute authorising the deficiency on 13th. July entered in the loan account, and no entry suggesting it was a loan or treating it as a loan, except the one which the prisoner ordered to be madeâ€”no securities are entered as held against itâ€”the deeds of the Brighton house were not entered as security in any bank-book, as far as I knowâ€”if money had been taken from the till and not entered anywhere it would have been detected directly we came to make up the balance at the end of the month, if we compared the office cash-book with the amount of office cash in the ledgerâ€”a certain amount of money comes from Grlyn Mills into the till, and that must be accounted for when the cash is balanced at the end of every monthâ€”the office cash-book shows these entries to A. E. S.â€”there is nothing in these books to show that they have been before the auditors of the company, I can see no auditors' marks in themâ€”the amounts paid by Mr. Smithers in order to enable the balance to agree for the audit on August 30th were Â£9,307 4s. 4d. in 1889â€”the cash balance at the end of June, 1890, appears in the account of office cash in the ledger as Â£13,262â€”the balance appears as Â£13,260 8s. 8d. in the hands of the officers of the bank in June, 1890; the office cash-book shows only Â£6,917â€”Â£7,697 15s. 2d. is entered in the suspense account as money to be received from J. C. Dalcaine, on account of Smithersâ€”there is no transaction as to that in the booksâ€”if it were acknowledged between Dalcaine and Smithers, it had no business in the suspense account; there was a debt of Â£9,000 due from Dalcaine to the bank in the regular course of busi<lb/>ness;</p>

               <p>there is nothing in the suspense account or branch floating entries account to suggest any connection of that sum with office cash; with the exception of Â£1,000 on 7th October, no sum of money was paid in by Smithers to meet the overdrafts, except the sum necessary to balance at the end of September, 1890â€”Â£672 16s. 10d., paid by a cheque of Smithers on the London and Westminster Bank; so that the auditors would again find that the actual balance corresponded with the balance as entered in the ledger; from 30th September, 1890, to 14th July, 1891, these continued takings of cash took place, and then we get the Â£7,146 odd loan account, which also remains unpaid.</p>

I was cashier at the bank from 1884 to 1888, and am still a clerk there; amounts of cash were from time to time paid out to Smithers which were not posted to the journal the following morning, like other payments out of office cashâ€”I do not know by whose orders they were so treatedâ€”I did not do the postingâ€”a clerk did that from the vouchers, cheques, and billsâ€”I have the office cash-book containing 29th Octoberâ€”Â£200 was paid out that day to McColl, and Â£287 to Walton on 31stâ€”Â£555 5s. to Dominiquez on 30thâ€”Â£100 to Famini on 1st November Â£100 to Witely on the 4thâ€”Â£170 to Walton on 7th, and Â£100 to Eiddâ€”Â£100 to Randall on 8th, and Â£100 on 13th, etc., total Â£2,500â€”they are the same persons as appear on the counterfoil of the cheque of 27th November.</p>

In 1888 I lodged with Mr. Wright the deeds of my freehold house and stabling at Brighton, which at that time were valued at Â£5,000, and I told Mr. Wright to take care of them, as they were valuable, and would be a protection to the bank for moneys I might be owing through his payments.

               <p>and in August, before I went to Buenos Ayres, I repaid the whole of the moneys then due, Â£9,000. During my absence, as usual, payments were made for me by Mr. Wright, and in July, 1890, I was expecting to be sent to me, through the foreign branch at Buenos Ayres, a sum of Â£7,000. Instead, however, of Â£-7,000 arriving, on account of the high premium payable on gold I only received Â£4,000; and that amount was paid to my account, and the balance expected from Buenos Ayres was placed in suspense, and debited to me in "Branches' floating entries account. "In 1890 the payments were continued as usual, and they now form subjects of the present charge against me. This sum would have been repaid by me but for the financial crisis in Argentina, by which I, equally with others interested in Argentine securities, suffered enormous losses. But for this crisis I was in a position to have repaid such advances, irrespective of the security of the freehold houses, the deeds of which I had placed with Mr. Wright as security for the bank. I emphatically deny that I allowed these payments to be made for me with any fraudulent intention. My present position arises from misfortunes over which I had no control. During my management the bank for years past made gross profits of upwards of Â£100,000 per annum, and was a flourishing institution, but was compelled to stop through non-receipt of the requisite remittances from the River Plate, owing to the crisis in Argentine finance, which latter likewise occasioned my own difficultiesâ€”Signed,</p>

At half-past twelve on the early morning of 9th December I was at the dock gates, and I heard some quarrelling going on between some German and English sailors near the bottom of the Glengal Road, near the George public-houseâ€”after the quarrel three of the Germans came up the road and passed by the gate going towards the bridge; in a few minutes they returned and met the Englishmen at the gateâ€”the four Englishmen came up to the gate nearly together, there may have been a few yards dividing themâ€”when the Germans and Englishmen met they renewed the quarrel again, with words and blows, and it did not last a minute before the man called out he was stabbedâ€”I did not see any blows dealt; not thinking anything was going to occur I was not looking; I had two gates to attend to, and I cannot tell what happened; my attention was attracted by hearing the cry, "I am stabbed!"â€”I went towards him, and he was turning towards me, and as soon as I saw the blood on his neck I ran to the man nearest to him (the prisoner) and followed him over the bridge to the gate, and caught him there and brought him back; Swain was lying on the ground apparently dead; I believe I said, "See what you have done," and he said, "Not me"â€”Bahrs was lying on the ground when I returned; he was bleeding from his arm, which ho was holdingâ€”I took the prisoner by the arm, and went to Cubitt Town Police-stationâ€”another constable took Krauseâ€”Striblow had not been brought back thenâ€”at the station all three men were charged together; no interpreter was there at the timeâ€”I do not think the prisoner made any answerâ€”I left him there in custody; I was not at the station afterwards when the interpreter was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that there was a quarrel, and "Shortly afterwards they came back, and met the Englishmen again, and recommenced quarrelling, and then got to blows;" and I may have said, "And the prisoners moved back about ten yards, the Englishmen driving them back towards the dock bridge"â€”I don't remember saving that, but I may have done soâ€”they were all mixed up togetherâ€”the three men were standing in the dock when I gave my evidence.</p>

I am a Baptist minister, of the Manse, Watford Roadâ€”I first saw the prisoner on 30th December, when he came to my house and said he was lodging at the house of one of the members of the church of which I am pastor, and he was in temporary difficulties, because he had come from South Africa, his people being very wealthy people there, and he having passed his B. A. degree, they were anxious he should have a holiday; that at Southampton he had lost his bag, with Â£40, and the people with whom he had been lodging for ten days or a fortnight naturally wanted the money; that he had been to his father's bankers in the City, and they had cabled to Cape Town, but while he was waiting he was in financial difficulties, and he desired me to give him a letter to the people with whom he was lodging requesting them to keep him for a week or so until his money did comeâ€”I said, "I cannot do so unless I know more about you"â€”he said he had with him</p>

I hope she will not die now"I first saw him at five minutes to nine, he was then drunkâ€”I saw him again at 9.45, he was still drunk; so drunk that I could not take him to the hospital; he could not walk, he was sitting on a chair in the reserve room.</p>

In my opinion the prisoner was not suffering from epilepsy on 10th November, nor from masked epilepsyâ€”assuming this savage attack was in a fit of epilepsy, a man would not be likely, either while the fit was on or immediately afterwards, to go about talking of what he had done; from the evidence I have heard the actions were those of a drunken man; in epilepsy there would not be the slightest recollection of it; in confirmed epilepsy the fits have a tendency to occur at stated intervals of a day or a night, perhaps a week or a monthâ€”it is uncertain in different individuals.</p>

I am a brother of the prosecutor, and the son of John Hurleyâ€”on Saturday night, 26th December, I was coming along Caterham Valley, in conversation with McCawley and Robertson; we went towards Warlingham, and when we got within 200 yards of Warlingham Station Robertson said, "I will go no further, as we are getting out of bounds, and shall be late at barracks"â€”they asked me for the price of a drink, and I put twopence into McCawley's hand he said, "I am sure you have got some more"; I said, "I have not; I have done no work since last Saturday "; McCawley said to Robertson, "Have you got your revolver?"he said, "Yes"â€”McCawley said to me, "You need not follow us any further"â€”I said, "I am not following you, I am going after my father and my brother"â€”we got to the he age</p>
