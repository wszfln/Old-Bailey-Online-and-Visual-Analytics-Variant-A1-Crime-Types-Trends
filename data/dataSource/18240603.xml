On the 20th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went out with my wife and family, leaving nobody in the house - I locked the street door, and tried it afterwards; it was then broad day-light. I returned about half-past ten o'clock, in consequence of information, and found the street door open - the box of the lock was broken off, and the screws broken from the door-post; it was put too, but not fastened. I got a light, went up stairs, and found the things as I had left them; but two candlesticks which stood on the shelf when I went out, were moved on to a board near the door leading to the back premises - I had left them on the shelf. and had left a white metal candlestick on the table, I found that on the floor, broken in two. I picked up the box of the lock and the screws. It is my dwelling-house. It was dark when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not you state before, that you left at six o'clock and returned at nine - A. No. I stated at Bow-street that I left at seven and returned at half-past ten. I noticed the candlesticks on the shelf when I went out.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live in White Lion-street, Chelsea. On the night in question (Easter Tuesday,) about nine o'clock, I was going to bed, but my sister called on me; I went out with her. The prosecutor is my brother-in-law. We were going to the next house to his; it was dark. I went to the prosecutor's door, and when in the street I saw a light in his up-stair room - we both went into the passage - I found the door ajar on putting my hand to it, and instantly called out, Watch! thieves! I instantly perceived the light put out, and heard a person come down stairs; I stood by the door; the prisoner came out and just passed me, but I pursued him, and was not a yard from him all the way until I caught him, and never lost sight of him. I caught hold of him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You villian, I will follow you go where you will;" he turned round, and struck me over the head several times, and cut me in two or three places; I do not know whether he struck me with his fist or what; I clung to him and succeeded in getting him on the ground, and never let go of him; he struck me several times, and cut a hole right through my coat, and cut my shoulder. An iron crow-bar was afterwards picked up by his side, with which I suppose he must have struck me. I am certain that he is the man. I struggled with him for ten minutes before assistance came; there was no watchman near. My sister got assistance. While I was down on the ground some persons came up and kicked me dreadfully on the side, but finding assistance was coming they ran off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure that you did not lose sight of him - A. Quite sure. I was not a yard behind him.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper of Chelsea. On the 20th of April, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner was brought to me; the prosecutor was covered with blood, and very weak; the blood appeared to have issued from his head, which was very much cut. I sent him to the doctor, then locked the prisoner up, and went with a candle and lantern to Anderson's house, and on entering the house found a phosphorus box about the middle of the lower room. I then went to the place where the scuffle ensued, and on the ground was a great quantity of blood. The prisoner had lost his hat and handkerchief in the scuffle; the hat and handkerchief were picked up in my presence, and he acknowledged them to be his own. I received a crowbar from Brown, and compared it with marks which were on the door-post, and it exactly fitted. The prisoner was also very bloody. In my judgement the marks on the prosecutor's door had been made with that instrument.</p>

I pawned the same articles she gave me without opening the bundle, for 25 s.; she stopped in my room while I went, and when I returned I gave her the money. Before I took the things I saw her put a pair of trowsers on a chair in my room, and she left them there, and on the Tuesday they were claimed, and I gave them to the officer. On Monday morning, in consequence of a message from the prisoner I got 5 s. more upon the clothes; I sent to her to say I wished to speak to her, but did not see her.</p>

            . I live in the house - my father does not; it is our joint property. My father has not slept in the house for two years; the lease of the house is his. On the 23d of April an opposite neighbour gave me information; I went out, and saw the two prisoners at the shop window; we have two windows to the shop. One of them stood with his back to the window, and the other with his face to it. I noticed them particularly - they walked away on my going into the street, and very shortly after one of my servants gave me information; I went out again, and the prisoners were then moving from the window; I caught hold of them both within a yard of the window, and a piece of silk handkerchiefs containing six handkerchiefs dropped from the person of one of them; it is worth 50 s. cost price - it is one entire piece of handkerchiefs; there is a line between each handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When you buy them are they charged by the number of handkerchiefs or by the piece - A. By the number of handkerchiefs; the invoice specifies it to be six handkerchiefs - it is not applicable to any other purpose; we call it in our shop a piece of silk handkerchiefs; the value of each handkerchief is 8 s. 4 d. prime cost. The piece has not been cut since I bought it. I cannot say which of them dropped it: they were both going away together - I seized them both, and it fell between them; I set my foot on it. I am sure they are the persons whom I saw at the window when I first went out; they were in company. I saw the handkerchiefs in the window when I first went out. Part of the pane of glass had been cut out in order to get it - it was whole about an hour before, when I saw it. The handkerchiefs are the property of myself and my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Your father has not resided in the house for two years - A. No. The house is occupied by my family alone; my father lives in the country, and comes occasionally to dine with me, but does not sleep in the house. I call the property six handkerchiefs; it is in one piece, not separated, but there is a border to each handkerchief; the mark between each handkerchief is cotton instead of silk; it is merely a mark to guide the scissars in cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to use one without using the whole till they are separated - A. Certainly; the size of each handkerchief is marked. I had been outside about an hour before to see how the window was dressed, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030005"/>it all safe. I found afterwards that it had been cut by some instrument.</p>
               <p>SPRIG HARMERWOOD. I live in the Strand, opposite to Mr. Christian. On the 23d of April, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoners together; one was looking in at the window, and the other had his back to the window, looking towards my shop; they went away together towards Hungerford-market, and returned again in five or ten minutes together, and looked in at the window, and in about a minute went towards Northumberland House, and went backwards and forwards three or four times, stopping at the window every time. I suspected that they were after no good, and took a description of them down on paper to give to the officers - I got a friend in my shop to watch them while I served a customer - he called out</p>
               <p>"They have got them," and I ran over to Mr. Christian's assistance, who had hold of them - they are the men I had seen lurking about.</p>

On the morning in question, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was at the top of St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoners together, and knowing them before, I watched them for five minutes; they were talking together. I went on, and as I returned from Piccadilly, in the Haymarket I saw Mr. Christian following them; he collared them, and called for assistance, and I saw Nibbs fling the handkerchiefs from under his coat - Mr. Christian put his foot on them. I assisted him.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3d of March, between twelve and two o'clock, I was at home, standing by the fire, and saw the prisoner in the tap-room; several other people were there - Burton served him with something. I lost sight of him a very short time afterwards, and saw him again between six and seven o'clock in the evening coming down stairs - he was at the foot of the stairs leading to the best sitting room; we have two stair-cases leading to that room, but only one is kept open - the stair-case he was at the foot of has a door at the top of it, which is kept locked - it is the door of the room at the top of the stair-case; I saw that door locked at eleven o'clock that day. When I saw him at the foot of the stairs my husband seized him, and I ran out for assistance. I saw him in custody afterwards, and swear that he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any property in the room the door of which was locked - A. No; we lost some money from our bed-room, which he could get to from that stair-case, but he must go through three rooms first. I had left twelve sovereigns and four half sovereigns in the bureau drawer in that bed-room, and know that the drawer was locked at five o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you see the door locked - A. At eleven o'clock, and at five I went to the drawer and it was locked then. I did not know the prisoner before. There were seven or eight men in the house when he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you come from the bed-room if one door is locked - A. Down the back stair-case, which was not locked up. I saw him at the front stair-case.</p>

            . I keep the Goat, public-house. On Wednesday, the 3d of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I went up the back stair-case to my bed-room, and on getting to the top of the stairs, the prisoner rushed out of the bed-room, and ran along the passage leading to the front stair-case - I immediately ran down the back stairs to the street door, and found him at the foot of the front stair-case, which is behind the street door - I seized him, shut the door, and gave an alarm, and almost at the same moment he called to another man for assistance; they both endeavoured to get the street door open, which they did, and got outside, but I still held the prisoner fast, and his companion finding that he could not liberate him, commenced beating me with a bludgeon until I fell from the loss of blood, but recovered before the prisoner got many paces from me. I pursued him calling for assistance - Saville joined me; I ran after the prisoner; he ran down Carter Hatch-lane - I got within three yards of him, and was attempting to seize him - he turned round and looked at me, put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and said if I approached him he would be the death of me - I ran close to him till assistance came, and he was secured. I walked home behind him, went up to my bedroom, and found a drawer taken out of the bureau chest, and put on a chair, and a picklock key laying by it - the gold, which was safe five or six hours before was gone; there had been about 20 l. there, most of it in sovereigns, and the rest in half sovereigns. The key of the drawer was in my wife's possession at the time. While I was following the prisoner he untwisted an apron which was round his waist, and threw it down, and on the following day I saw one Baalam; he accompanied me down the lane, and in my presence picked up a crow-bar, which has been tried in my presence to the door at the top of the front stair-case, and it made exactly similar marks to those we found on the door; there was a dent on the door as if the edge of this instrument had been pushed against it - I had found it open when I returned from following the prisoner. One of the Saville's brought me three sovereigns about half an hour after the prisoner was taken. Cuffley has the crow-bar and apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose property were they - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030006"/>Mine; they were in a little drawer laid within a large drawer. I had not seen the prisoner before that day, but am sure of him - it is impossible that I can be mistaken; I had him in my grasp for five or six minutes. My house is in Enfield parish; I rent it.</p>
               <p>ELIZABEEH BURTON. I reside in the prosecutor's house. On the 3d of March, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the house, and afterwards, about six I saw the prosecutor seize him at the foot of the stairs - they were together for some minutes; I went to his assistance. His companion came up (I had seen him there also about one o'clock;) he came to the prisoner's assistance, and got the door open, got into the porch, and began beating Mr. Reynolds, and hit me a violent blow over the arm, which made me leave go, and he ran towards the lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before - A. No.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Bush-hill, Edmonton. On the 3d of March I was coming towards the prosecutor's house, and about a hundred yards from it saw Reynolds, the prisoner, and another man scuffling outside the porch - Reynolds fell on the ground; the prisoner and the other man ran towards me; Reynolds got up and cried Stop thief! The prisoner said if I attempted to stop him he would kill me; Reynolds came up. I never lost sight of him till he was taken. My brother James came to our assistance with Smith and Huzzey - my brother secured him. When he passed me I saw him throw his hand out, and heard something jink, but did not see what it was. After he was secured, I went to the doctor's, and as I returned I picked up three sovereigns on the spot where I heard the jinking; it was in the open road, close to a shop. It was about half-past six o'clock when I saw him, and twenty minutes past eight when I found the sovereigns.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a man was the other - A. He was about the prisoner's height. I searched all round, but only found three sovereigns.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield. On the 3d of March, about seven o'clock, Reynolds sent for me - I found the prisoner at his house, searched him, and found five sovereigns, a shilling, two-pence, a knife, and a gimblet on him. Reynolds gave me a crow-bar, which I tried to the door at the top of his front stair-case, and made a mark myself with it; it made the same impression by opening the door with it as was on it before. Reynolds was all over blood, and the doctor was dressing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not fit the crow-bar to the impression - A. No. The house is in Enfield parish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Waltham Abbey, and went into this house to have some beer - a person ran down the stairs; he passed me, and ran out. Reynolds came and accused me of being the man who had come down the stairs.</p>

             keeps the house, which is in the parish of St. Luke. The prisoner lodged in the same house for about a fortnight. On Tuesday, the 13th of April, about one o'clock, I came home; I had left three sovereigns in a pocketbook in my box half an hour before; I had seen them on Sunday. The key was in my box; I do not know whether it was locked. I found the pocket-book open, and the sovereigns gone. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and took him about seven o'clock, on Holborn-hill, standing in the street. I got an officer, and gave him in charge. I told him I took him for stealing three sovereigns - he was very sancy, and threatened to strike me; but after he was in custody he said he would tell me all about it if I would go into another room. I said nothing to induce him to say anything; I went into another room with him; he said he took one sovereign on Monday, and on Tuesday, about one o'clock, took the other two, and bought a pair of new boots and a hat with part of it, and he had them on. He was searched at the Compter, and 8 1/4 d. found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Your wife said if I would confess, it would be better for me - Witness. She was with me at the Compter, but was not alone with him, and could not have said anything without my hearing it - I heard her say nothing of the sort.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. I received the prisoner in charge on Holborn-hill from the prosecutor's wife - I took him to the Compter; they went with me. He was very sancy to the prosecutor, but after I searched him he wished to speak to the prosecutor, and said he would tell all about it. Nobody threatened or promised him anything; the prosecutor went into the passage with him - I followed them soon after, and heard him say that he took one sovereign on Monday, and two on Tuesday - that he bought a pair of boots for 27 s., and a hat for 12 s., and had spent the rest.</p>

            . I am a conductor of the dismounted patrol of Bow-street; my beat is from the Angel Inn at Islington to Hornsey-gate. On Thursday, the 27th of May, about ten minutes before two o'clock in the night, just as I entered Cambden-passage, Islington-green, I saw one of the prisoners about two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards off; I cannot say which of them it was - he was standing under a gas-lamp. Newman was with me. As soon as he saw us he ran down a middle court; we made haste up to this court, as it is not a thoroughfare - we went down the court, but saw nobody. I saw all the three prisoners coming out of Mrs. Marratt's garden door, which opens into the court; it was quite dark; the front of the house is in Pierpont-row, and the court runs down by the side of it - the garden is behind the house; there are two bolts and a latch on the garden door, inside. They came through the door, and shut it (it was dark.) I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, who is here" - Thompson answered,</p>
               <p>"I have only been down here to ease myself;" he had his waistcoat unbuttoned, and was buttoning it up. I knew his voice, and said to my brother officer,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of him;" we instantly apprehended all three of them, and took them to Islington watch-house - I searched Johnson and Davis, but found nothing particular. I left Newman with them while I went out, and just on the curb stone of the pavement, about twelve yards from the watch-house door I picked up a chisel and a watch, in the exact direction we had brought them. I went on till I came to the court, got a watchman's lantern, and looked down by the garden gate, and found a small crow-bar. I returned to the watch-house, locked the prisoners up, and noticed that Johnson's shoes were loosely tied, as if they had been recently put on. I went to Mrs. Marratt's house, and found the back parlour window open as high as the sash would go; it looks into the garden; and at day-light, about three o'clock, I alarmed the people of the house. I went into the garden, and found a dark lantern, part of a phosphorus box, and a bundle of matches under the window, all scattered about. We were let into the house by the boy, and found a pane of glass broken in the parlour window, and the catch undone; a time-piece stand stood on a chair in the window. I found the door at the bottom of the stairs leading into the garden nearly open, except the bottom bolt, which was not quite undone, and just by the garden gate were several footmarks on the fresh mould. I went to the watch-house, and took a shoe off each of the prisoner's feet; I tried them to the various footmarks, and each shoe fitted one mark or other. I have no doubt but the marks were made by those shoes. The parlour window had been opened by breaking the glass over the catch, and then an arm could he put through to undo it. I found a bell under the window in the garden, and a handkerchief, which has not been claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What distance were you at first from the premises - A. About one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards. The prisoners were taken almost instantly; the shoemarks were of different sizes. Johnson's was rather larger than the other two. I tried the shoes to the marks about an hour and a half after - it was dark when I went back after they were taken. I have seen them all before, and knew Thompson.</p>

            . I am a dismounted patrol, and was with Norris, and accompanied him into the court about ten minutes to two o'clock on Friday morning, and saw one of the prisoners; he said he went there to ease himself; the other two prisoners came out of the back gate of the garden, and were secured; they all three came out of the gate - we took all three. I remained with them in the watch-house while Norris returned. I afterwards went with him (when the family were alarmed,) and saw the footsteps compared with the prisoners' shoes; different footmarks corresponded with each shoe. I took their shoes off myself. I firmly believe that they were produced by those shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found nothing on them - A. Except money; one of them had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030008"/>12 s. 6 d. Their shoes were nearly new, so that they left a better impression.</p>

            . I live in Pierpont-row, with my mother, who keeps a chandler-shop. The house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington; my father's name is William; he does not live at home, but is alive. On the morning of the 28th of May, about half-past three o'clock we were alarmed by the boy. I was the last person up the night before, and fastened the back parlour window myself about half-past eleven o'clock; I fastened the catch, and put the bell on it. The garden gate was bolted top and bottom - I saw it safe at ten o'clock, and the back door was locked and bolted at the bottom. In the morning I found the hack parlour window open, and glass broken by the catch, which was whole the night before. I missed my watch which I had left on the parlour mantlepiece the night before, when I went to bed, fixed in the time-piece stand, which was found on a chair under the window in the morning. The bell produced is what I fastened to the window the night before; the watch is mine (examining it;) I have had it six or seven years; it is a metal one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you go to bed at night - A. At twelve o'clock; my mother occupies she whole house, and is married to my father. I saw the footmarks in the garden, they were not confused. No strangers were in the garden except the officers.</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. I had been to see a friend, and stopped with him till between twelve and one o'clock, and as I returned I went down this court for a necessary purpose, was coming back and saw two officers with these two men in custody - the officer said,</p>
               <p>"Catch hold of that young man," and he caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON'S Defence. I went to the playhouse, and then accompanied a friend home - I left him in the Lower-road about half-past one o'clock, and on returning, at the end of this court met the officers, and told them I had been down to case myself.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I had been to my cousin's on Stamford-hill, was making my way to Westminster rather intoxicated, and went down this court, and finding it was not a thoroughfare I came back.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-passage, Hoxton. On the 25th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I had just come from my house, and turning round at the back of Hoxton chapel, I heard some persons running after me, and on getting into <placeName id="t18240603-9-crimeloc53">Ask-street</placeName>

                        targets="t18240603-9-off51 t18240603-9-crimeloc53"/> I saw about five persons; two of them crossed over to me, holding their heads down - one caught me round the waist, and made a stumble as if he was falling; he caught hold of the chain of my watch, but my fob being buttoned he could not get out the watch; the ring broke, and he got the chain, seal, and key - they both instantly made off. I called Stop thief! and went in pursuit, and was stopped by the other three, who wanted to push me into a muddy place, and as I turned round to look at them I was struck in the mouth by the prisoner, who sent me staggering backwards - there was a gas-light where I was stopped. I never saw the prisoner before, but am certain he is the man who struck me, for I followed him so close, and kept him in sight till he got to Pimlico, where he ran down; I was a very short way behind him, and in a moment I caught sight of him again; a woman had directed me which way they had ran; I saw Stevens, who got a light, and I found the prisoner standing up behind a dung hill, in a bye place, which is not a thoroughfare - he had his hand to his breeches, and seemed as if he had unbuttoned them; I collared him, took him to a public-house, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man who struck me, and is one of the three who were with the two who robbed me. He was dressed in a white coat and black handkerchief, and all the rest were dressed different.</p>

I can swear to the dress of four of them; the prisoner's hand was across his face; I could not see his features. He pretended to be buttoning his clothes up when he saw me.</p>

I went in search of her, and could not find her, but on the 28th, about half-past one o'clock at night the watchman came to me; she had given herself up to him; she had a black dress on, but it is torn all to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030009"/>pieces - I know it to be mine by my own work on it. When I got to the watch-house I asked how she could do it; she said because she choose.

               <p>"Though she is my sister, I am sorry to call her so, for she is now in bed with my husband," and that she had committed a felony in her husband's apartment. I went with her - she threw some dirt against the window, and desired me to call out</p>

I did not go into the room, and saw nobody but the prosecutrix. She said she put the gown on in purpose for it to be owned, that she might be hung or transported, for she could not live in this country with the idea of her sister living with her husband.

I was in the habit of receiving small sums of money to make disbursements for them; I keep it locked in a drawer in my desk, which is not locked. On the night of 25th of May, in consequence of suspicion, the witnesses marked several half-crowns and shillings; I put them in the drawer; I looked at it next morning, and the money was gone. The prisoner occasionally assisted in the house - I had her apprehended, and saw a purse of money found on her, among which was a half-crown and two shillings, which were part of what I had marked. A key was found on her, which I saw applied to the drawer; it opened it. I have known her for a year.</p>

I received directions to watch the prosecutors' premises in Ave Maria-lane, and on Saturday evening, the 1st of May, about nine o'clock, I and Hesketh went, and about a quarter past nine I saw Jones come out of the private door with a bag, and take it under an archway to Roberts, and in a moment I saw Roberts with it on his back; we followed him to Whitecross-street, Cripplegate, to Mr. Lloyd's - he threw it down in the shop.

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of April, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Lombard-street, with a bundle on his shoulder. Herdsfield looked at him - he said,</p>
               <p>"What are you looking at?" - I said, What have you got here? - he gave no answer, but said</p>

               <p>"I am going to Mr. Mills, Hollywell-street, Strand." I asked if he had got a bill of parcels - he said Yes. I said,</p>
               <p>"Walk into the Mansion-house, and I will see it." I took him there, and said.</p>
               <p>"Now where is the bill?" he said he had not got one - I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me just now that you had" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit and I will feel" - he did not produce any - I said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you bring it from?" - he said,</p>
               <p>"From Mr. Mills, 137, Whitechapel-road - it is the firm of Mills, but is carried on under the name of Matthews" - I said it was a pity he was not civil when he was stopped with a load - he said his master told him not to give an answer if he was asked what he had - I asked him why he came that way to go to Hollywell-street - he said he liked it - I was going to Whitechapel, but called on Mr. M'Kenzie, and brought him to the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am employed occasionally at the prosecutors' warehouse, which is in King's Arms Yard, Coleman-street - I was delivering parcels in a truck at different places - I stopped at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate - this parcel and two more were in the truck, and when I got to the Three Nuns it was gone - the truck is in closed with rails at the sides - it could not fall out - I had not left it after I went to the Saracen's Head, but I was in front of the truck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Cannot you tell when it was taken - A. It was safe when I was at the Saracen's Head - I had nine parcels when I set out.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phillips, a bookseller, who lives in George-yard, Lombard-street. On the 17th of May, at half-past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Courthorpe's house with two reams of paper under his right arm - he passed me, and went down the yard. Having my suspicious, from seeing another person peeping up the alley with him before, and seeing that person very near again, I ran over to Courthorpe's; a boy came, and from what he said I pursued the prisoner, caught sight of him in Lombard-street with the paper under his arm, saw the officer take him, and saw him drop it.</p>

            . I am a furrier, and live in Skinner-street. On the 10th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called into my shop, and found the prisoner offering a muff and tippet for sale. I asked him who it belonged to; he said, to Mrs. Fergusson, of Dover-street, Piccadilly; that it had been bought at my house, but she was taken ill, and had no further occasion for it, and he was desired to bring it to me for sale. I asked his name; he said it was

            , and that he was servant to the lady; and on examining them, I found the muff was very valuable, and the tippet inferior. I said I was certain that he had come improperly by them; he appeared confused, and said what he had told me was false; that they belonged to his mother, and he had stolen them from her. I asked where she lived, he said she was barmaid at the King's Head public-house, Finchley, and that she was sister to the landlady. I said I should detain him; he still insisted that it was his mother's; that she had bought it about twelve months ago, when in better circumstances. I said it was a fresh made article. I sent for an officer, and while he was being searched, he said if I would let him go he would tell the whole truth; that on going through some street at the west end of the town, he saw a gentleman's door open, went in, and ran away with them. Mrs. Schneider at last claimed them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it before you saw either of the men again - A. Not for four years; I described the prisoner to the officer on the night he was taken - I did fix upon a young man in Court as the person as well as the prisoner, and directed him to be taken into custody, thinking he was Harper - when he said his name was not Tubbs nor Harper, I let him go - I said he was the man till then, and that he was one of the two - I had never seen him before - I had seen Tubbs four or five times while he lodged with me; it might be ten times; he was always at home - I should not have known him in the street so well as in a house; he had not the same general appearance as when at home; the prisoner might have slept in my house or not; I don't know who enters my house or who goes out; they can go in and out without a key - I saw Harper go out on the night of the robbery; he gave my wife the key, and said</p>
               <p>"We shall be back presently."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does this man answer the description you gave to the officer - A. Yes; I described as him about my height, and from twenty-five to twenty-seven years of age; he had carried on the business of a working smith; he had a sailor's jacket on the last time I saw him; I described him to the officer in going along the street from Bow-street; I had not seen him before I described him to the officer; but I described him according to the recollection I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the officer any other date - A. Yes; I did say 1821, from memory only - I had the account of it on slate; it was legible to myself; I had kept it against the wall, but I did not look at it till I took it to the Magistrates.</p>

               <p>"I will give you the old rubbish that is left in Princes-street, if you wont tell my old landlord where I have removed, as I have saved seven guineas for rent;" that he and his wife had then fetched the basket and the chair. Some days after Cuthbert called on him and said,</p>
               <p>"Your wife has informed of me, and I will have my things back again; he offered to return the chair, but said the basket was lost, and the shelves were burned.

I live in Mr. Harding's house, and am his servant; as soon as I heard of the robbery, I went out, and saw the prisoner turn into an old iron shop in Gilbert-street (it was on a Sunday); he had something with him, and as he turned to go into the shop, I saw the end of the bars; I followed him into the shop, but did not speak to him; I heard him say to the person in the shop</p>
               <p>"Give me 1 s.;" I asked the person if the young man that did her business was at home; she said No; I said it was of no consequence, and I came away and told my master, who sent for a constable; I went with the constable and got this iron; I am quite sure that it is my master's.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop on the evening of the 15th of April, about seven o'clock, and asked to see some prints; she staid about half an hour, and bought seven yards of one - she was to leave 1 s. deposit, and call again; she left the shop, I suspected she had secreted something under her cloak; I followed and overtook her in Aylesbury-street, about a hundred yards off - I looked under her cloak, and found two lengths of print, they were not the same she had bargained for - but some which I had shewn her. She has bought articles of us before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 24th of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, in Craven-lane, Bayswater-road; there was another man with him when I first saw him, but I lost sight of the other - I took him, supposing all was not right, and found two bottles of wine, four skeleton keys, and a phosphorus box with matches ready for use upon him. I learned that Mr. Woodward had lost some property. When the prisoner was at Bow-street Mr. Woodward intimated to me that he had lost a coat similar to the one the prisoner had on, and next morning he saw and identified it. The prisoner gave no account whatever of it; this is the coat.</p>

I had no work, and a man whom I had known for some months past, asked me on Sunday before the robbery to carry some smuggled spirits for him; I agreed, and met him on Sunday night, near the turnpike in Bayswater-road - he gave me the property; I did not know that it was stolen. I could have destroyed the coat.</p>

On the 20th of April the carpenters were there at work; they had occasion to go down to the kitchen for some wood, and in consequence of something they said I went down, and saw the print under some boards in the back kitchen. I gave information to Mr. Pincott immediately; he came down and saw it there - he desired us all to be silent, and placed me to see who came for it. In about an hour the prisoner came to the place, and staid about a minute - he then went up stairs; I went immediately to the place, and the muslin was gone. I had seen the handkerchiefs in the shop which I found in the bundle of dirty linen. The prisoner was near me, and saw the bundle opened; he said nothing at the time. The private mark is on them.</p>

Any of the workmen might have gone into the room. I saw the prisoner come down and go to the place, but I did not see him take anything. I could not get out of the kitchen in time to stop him, but I followed him up stairs.</p>

Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 9th of May, Schroeder said he had lost his watch, seal, and key; that he had been in company with a female under the piazzas of the market, and she had snatched it and ran into one of the houses - he was not certain whether it was No. 7 or 8. I got under the piazzas and saw a light, and heard people talking in one of the rooms, and while we were talking, the light was put out. Two people came out of the house, and I desired another watchman to go round and meet them. Schroeder had described the person of the woman. I met the prisoner in Grafton-street, and she appeared to answer the description. I told her she was accused of robbing a gentleman, which she denied. I saw the watch at Mary-le-bone watch-house, in the possession of Howard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner Arnold into custody, and asked how he got the property; he said from a man at Highgate - he then said he was not the man who stole the property, but the Welchman stagged upon him, meaning, as I understood, that he told where he was to be found. He afterwards said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I will tell you; me and the Welchman went to Mr. Rothschild's, and robbed the summer-house; it is my first offence, and I hope I shall find mercy."</p>

Three shillings were left with me on Sunday morning, the 25th of April; I laid them on the table, and had occasion to go to the door. The prisoner came in - I thought he was a surgeon. As he went out again I saw something strange in his appearance - I looked on the table, and the silver was gone. I went after him, and brought him back - he said he had not stolen it; did I mean to say he was a thief? I said he had taken 3 s., and I could swear to them - he said,</p>
               <p>"Sooner than have words I will give you 3 s.," which he did, and I saw that one of them was one of the shillings I had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say it would be better for him to give you 3 s., and go about his business - A. I did not. I had looked at the shillings, and had noticed a mark on one of them; I had been in the habit of looking at the money that was left to see if it was good, and I saw a mark on the neck of the first shilling. They had been left in the hall where the porters generally sit. I had only gone to the bottom of the steps, and had but just left the room. The money was left for a patient of the name of Whitworth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to dine with a friend, and saw the door open; I went in, and read a board over the fire-place. I had got a little way from the infirmary, and he came and asked me to come back with him, and told me to give him 3 s. which I had taken off the table; I said,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about them;" they said they would fetch an officer, and I told them I would rather give them 3 s. than have any piece of work about it. I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 3 s., and then he said,</p>
               <p>"I can swear to this shilling."</p>

            . Q. Was there any person with him at the time - A. No. I am positive as to this shilling. There were persons who saw him give me the 3 s., and I immediately identified this one. I could see any one who entered the room - I am certain no person could have come from the interior of the Hospital without my seeing them; I was not down the steps more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there no other doors which lead to the hall - A. Yes; one leads to the surgery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The hall, I suppose, is the place that admits you from the street to all the other parts of the building - A. Certainly, my Lord. I was at the bottom of the steps when he passed me; I did not suspect him. He was going down the steps as I came up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had stood at the door while I read a printed board before I went in, and there was not another person in the hall - when I went in I read a large board of the rules of the place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with my brother officer in Oxford-street, on the 19th of April, about a quarter past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner carrying three saws in a dust sack; Jennings stopped him. I crossed over, and he said he was going to take the saws to his father in the City; he was near Regent-street. He said his father was working in the City, and had sent a man to tell him to bring the saws. I offered to take him to the City - he then said he found them in a load of rubbish.</p>

On the 24th of April, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with a basket, and asked to see some figured ribbons, which I showed her - she seemed to admire one very much, but said it was too high a price, and asked to see some plain ones. I went for some, leaving the drawer with her, and on returning missed the ribbon she had so much admired, and saw the end of it hanging out of her bundle. I let her take it up and go; and I then went out, brought her back, and took her bundle from her basket, and the ribbon was in it. She said she believed she had not got it - she had bought and paid for one yard of ribbon.</p>

We have three rooms, all on the ground floor; I went home again at eleven o'clock, and again at ten minutes after five; opened the bedroom door, and went to the box - the counterpane was safe, but the watch was gone. I had seen the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, sitting in the fields where we work; it is not far from our house; upon missing the watch, I went to my sister, who is his mother, and told her, in his hearing, that I had lost the watch, and suspected him; he began to cry, and denied it; I said if he did not let me know where it was my husband was coming - he took me to a fishmonger's - Connelly came out, and said he would take me to where the watch was; he took me to a stable, and the watch was down a cellar in the stable; the prisoner went with us, and Connelly handed the watch to me.</p>

            . This is my shawl. I have a mark in the corner where I burnt it. I have had it a year.</p>
               <p>WILKINS'S Defence. I was coming out of the public-house, and saw this woman on the other side of the way - several women and girls were round her, beating her. I saw the shawl on the ground, picked it up, and crossed over, and Wright said he saw this young man cross and give it to me. I had it in my hand intending to give it to her, when I got her from the crowd.</p>
               <p>CORDWELL'S Defence. The woman was beastly drunk, and I never had the shawl.</p>

I detained it till she brought the woman whom she said she had it from; she fetched the prisoner, who said it was her own. I asked if she could tell the initials on it - she said she could, and then that she could not - that she had had it many years, and that she lived in Rosemary-lane.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030023"/>I gave her in charge of an officer.

Smyllie passed as his wife. They slept there on Saturday and on Sunday, and on Monday I went to Greenwich, about twelve o'clock, leaving them at home; Smyllie promised to take care of the house until I returned. About half an hour before I went, the landlord called for my rent. I took out a pocket-book in her presence, and gave him three sovereigns, leaving nine. She saw me do it, and the money jinked as I put the pocketbook into a box under the bed. I locked it, put the key into my pocket, and told her I was going to Greenwich with my children, and gave her the key of the door. I returned about eight o'clock, found the door locked, and the key on the table in their room; they were both gone. I found my box broken open, and the pocket-book and money gone, with the other property stated in the indictment, I have found none of them. We apprehended them on Wednesday at the Horse-Guards; Smyllie was then dressed with a new bonnet and feathers like a lady, and when she came to live with us she had but one gown.</p>

I saw the prisoners about half-past 10 o'clock next morning, at the King's-mews Barracks, and had them apprehended. I knew neither of them before. Smyllie was dressed in a plaid gown, a new bonnet, and shawl. Nothing was found on them.</p>

I let him pass me for several yards, and when he had got to the light, I saw my gown and cloak sticking out of his bundle. I stepped up, and caught hold of him, saying,</p>
               <p>"My friend, this is mine." He said, it was no such a thing. I said,</p>

I am sure of his person - the bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, which were all in my room on that day - they are worth about 44 s. He had wrapped them in his own apron.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Sherwood. On the 1st of May, my master had a sow and nine pigs. I locked them up safe in the stable at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; there was also some fowls and rabbits in the stable, and in the morning, about half-past seven, I missed three rabbits and five pigs, and found the stable door forced open by a chisel or some instrument, and a great coat of mine was stolen; I saw two of the pigs that evening. I thoroughly examined them at the watchhouse, and am sure they are two of the five pigs.</p>

            . I am keeper of Pentonville watch-house. On Sunday morning, the 2d of May, at little after four o'clock, I was standing at the top of Chapel-street, Penton-street, talking to the watchman - it was daylight, and had been so for half an hour - two persons passed me. I suspected them, and went down the road; and nearly opposite the Belvidere I caught hold of one of them, whose name is Jerdan - he got from me, and threw down a pig, and then a rabbit, and sprang from me, but was eventually taken, and put into the watchhouse. I returned, and picked up the rabbit and pig - they were dead. I was returning to the watchhouse, and nearly on the spot where Jerdan ran from; I saw the prisoner; he was not one of the two; but suspecting him from his appearance I collared him, and said he was my prisoner - he raised his arm. I said if he raised his arm I would break it. I called two watchmen, took him to the watchhouse, and found a pig under his smock frock. Jerdon afterwards got away - they were both taken from the watchhouse, and fully committed. I shewed the two pigs to Daniels; they were not quite cold. The prosecutor shewed me his live pigs - they appeared of the same litter.</p>

            , I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th, dancing at the Golden Lion public-house, Leman-street, Whitechapel, about nine o'clock at night; there were about 200 persons in the room; she was sitting down, and was pointed out to me. I went to Dock-street, and searched a room, which was pointed out to me as her's. I stated before her next morning, that I had searched her room; described where it was, and said I had found a napkin, a piece of ribbon, and three duplicates there. She sent for her landlady, who was the person who shewed me the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you notice the prisoner's door - A. I did; it had been wrenched with the violence, but clum-sily; not as thieves generally do. The yard wall is about four feet and a half high; it was a very wet night, and in the soft dirt in the yard, there were prints of a man's feet and a woman's pattens near the wall</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the door open into a garden - A. Into a paved yard, my Lord. It appeared that persons making the foot and patten marks had got over the wall which leads to a court.</p>

            . I live in Sun-court, King David Place, Shadwell. On the 10th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was at the Whitehart public-house, Shadwell, with the prisoner and her husband, who is a seaman; two more men were there, one of whom did not belong to our party; we were drinking grog; the prisoner and her husband seemed in very good humour; she gave him the key of the door to go home; he went out and returned, and called for some grog, and I saw her aim at him to hit him; I had not heard them quarrelling, and do not know whether she had any thing in her hand; she aimed at his shoulder; whether it was in a passion or in fun, I do not know, or whether she hit him, but I saw a knife sticking in the shoulder of his jacket; she called out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my G - d! I have done it;" he said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, what have you done?" and then said," She has stabbed me." She fell as if she was fainting; he caught her in his arms, they sat down together comfortably, and I left; one of the men pulled the knife out of his shoulder, gave it to me, and I put it on the table; it appeared a new one; I saw a little blood on his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know her reason for doing this - A. It was something about a woman named Bonham, who had been there that evening - I have heard them fall out about her, but not on that night - she had come in and sat down opposite to him; he told her to go away, for he would have nothing to say to her; she went out, and after this was done she came into the room several times. I went to their lodgings on the Tuesday following, and saw the prisoner applying leeches to her husband's shoulder; they were friendly together then, and she said she was very sorry for it - he said,</p>

               <p>"Never mind, it cannot be helped now." I have not seen him for the last three weeks - he said he was going to sea.</p>

I was fetched again in the evening; his wife had applied leeches by my order; I then probed it, and found it about an inch and a half deep; it was a dangerous wound; he was under my care for a fortnight; it had struck on the spine.</p>

I came out at half-past nine or ten o'clock, and was going home to Berwick-street, and at the corner of the first street I found myself sick - I was rather intoxicated. Three young men came up, and said it was a pity that I should stand there; I said if they would procure me a coach I would give them a shilling; they said they would, and told me to follow them, which I did, but don't know along what streets, for I was never there but once before. I asked if that was the nearest way to the coach-stand; they said it was. We came to a house in Duck-lane; they said I had better step in, and one of them would fetch a coach directly; I went in - the room was quite dark - I felt for a chair - could fine none, and sat on the bed; they said I had better stop there for half-an-hour, as it might be that time before the coach came; I said I could not. One of them helped me to take off my coat, which I consented to - I held it in my hand - one of them dragged it from me, and then seized my waistcoat, another my boots, and pulled them both off at once, and all three set off and locked me in; there was the duplicate of a watch in my coat pocket, and a purse containing 8 s.; I called out of a window, as square of glass was broken, but nobody came. In about an hour and a half some persons came into the room, and said if I did not come out they would take me to the watch-house; I said I would not leave till I had got my clothes; the room was still dark, they came two or three times in the dark; I cannot say who they were; they at last brought a light; the first who came with it in his hand was the prisoner - I am sure he is one of the three who robbed me, but he was not one of those who took my clothes off. I remained in the room till daylight, then went for a female whom I knew, and she got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay when he brought a light - A. Not a moment. I heard a number of voices after that, and knew his voice, but saw nobody; I described them to the officer, and about two o'clock in the afternoon, saw the prisoner at a public house in Orchard-street, and gave him in charge. I cannot speak positively to his being one of the persons who took me to the house. When he brought the light, two or three others were with him; he told me to leave that house; he had a white hat on, and I believe one of the three had a white hat.</p>

I live at Norwood; Berry owed me 2 l. 15 s. for ground-rent - I have known the prisoner for five or six years; he was at my house on Sunday evening, the 2d of May - I sent for him to take a message to his master - he sat in my house about two hours, but has never paid me this money.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bailey, who is a carrier. On Tuesday morning, the 18th of May, my cart stood in Bread-street. The prisoner came and asked if I belonged to it - I said Yes - he said bring it to Pattison and Dudley's. I followed him to Milk-street, and saw him with a bale of goods - he said,</p>
               <p>"Here, my man, I have got the bale ready for you;" he was at the corner of Milk-street; he told me to turn about; we got a person to help us with the bale into the cart; he rode in the cart, and wanted me to go in great haste to Barbican; and when I got to the end of Barbican I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the place;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Go farther, and I will shew you." I drove to French Horn-alley; he told me to drive up the gateway, which I did; he said,</p>
               <p>"Set the bale down here, and I will not detain you any longer;" he went into the house, and fetched me 3 s. 4 d. for the cartage, and I went away, leaving the bale in the court. A man came out of house, and I saw them rolling the bale over, but did not see it taken into the house. When I got to the cart-stand, an officer was making inquiry - I told him where I took it to, and I went to Guildhall on the same day, and again next day. The prisoner had a cut lip, and a black plaister on it, at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said before that I stood with the bale close to a hairdresser's shop - how could that be, if I fetched the cart - A. You ran up the street before me, and when I came up you stood against the bale at the end of Milk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the officer offer you 9 l. to come and swear against me. A. No, he offered me nothing - he said he would lock me up with you. I did not notice what mark was on the bale.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Cheapside, and accidentally met a stranger, who told me to get him a cart. I was near Milk-street. He said if I went half-way down Bread-street I should get one. I went, and employed this man; and the person said, if I would take it to his lodging he would be there and direct me what to do with it. On arriving he was waiting for me - he took off the wrapper, and went away with it - he told me to wait till he returned, and in the mean time the officer came up and took me. How it came from the prosecutor's house I don't know.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, about eleven o'clock, I was going from my shop into the parlour, and as I entered the parlour I heard the shop window broken with violence - the shutters were not shut. I ran out, missed property, and went in pursuit. I ran up a passage three doors from my house, leading to the tap of a wine vaults, and saw a man running. Two or three women who were in the passage said he had thrown the property down - I looked and found nothing. I returned to the shop, and missed two gold chains, two gold seals, a gold key, a lady's watch, and two steel reticule clasps - the whole are worth 25 l. Mr. Watson, who was in my parlour, found the watch - it is an engine-turned one (looking at one) - this is it - it was in the window.</p>

On the 10th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I was crossing from Redcross-street, and saw one man at one corner of Mr. Tyas's window, and the other at the other corner, nearer to the door. The one at the corner near a cheesemonger's shop broke the window, and in a minute or two he ran away. I saw something glitter in his hand, and tried to stop him; he gave me a blow, and ran down the passage, and I after him, and called to a person at the end of the passage to stop him - he turned round, gave me another blow, and shut the door at the end of the passage - I forced it open, and when I got near to him I saw him throw a clasp down - he went into one of the houses; I could not tell which - Howard's door was open. The officer went in, and found him there; it was the prisoner; I saw his hand bleeding; he is the man I saw at the shop. I saw his face when he struck me.</p>

On Saturday night, the 10th of April, I heard Mr. Tyas's window break, and saw the prisoner running - he ran up a passage by the Redcross-tap, and I after him; I took him in three or four minutes, in the passage of Howard's house.

On the night he was taken, at a quarter to twelve o'clock, I examined my till, and found the screws of it drawn ready to take it down; three of them were quite out; by pulling the others the till would drop down; the shop is part of my dwelling-house. There is a large slaughter-house at the back of the premises, in Chequer-square; it has an open place in it to admit air; a person can get up it as easy as on a ladder, and then drop into the yard upon the bullock-house, and get into the slaughter-house. I am a butcher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. What day are you speaking of - A. The 19th. I cannot say whether the slaughter-house door was fastened. I do not know the state of the premises on the 13th. I went to bed last on the 13th, and saw that all the doors were shut - there is a space over the door, which is always open to admit air. A person could get in without breaking anything.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was watching the prosecutor's premises, and saw a light come into the shop. I got on the bench in the street, looked through the fanlight, and saw the prisoner come into the front shop, and draw some screws from the wood work of the till with a screw-driver, which I afterwards found in his breeches pocket; he was at the till for eight or ten minutes; he then went to the desk at the corner of the shop, and, in about twenty minutes he took the light to the back of the house. I had a key of the street door. I went in, and secured him at the foot of the stairs; the back door leading to the slaughter-house was open. I asked how he came there - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to a friend's, and got in there to sleep, as I was locked out, and his man had often asked me to sleep there. I had no intention to rob.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. SHEFFIELD. Q. If he got through this open place, could he get into the house without opening a door - A. He must open one door to get to the till - it is the back shop door. The open place is over the door of what we call the pound - it is not part of the dwelling-house. He must open a door in the outer wall of the house to get in, but one door leading to the yard was open.</p>

I asked what he had got, he said lead, that he had brought it from Deptford, and was going to take it to Clark, a plumber, in Sun-street. I tried, but could find no such person; and in the evening I found Mr. Wilson's house had been stripped of lead. I applied it to his premises on Monday morning, and it fitted exactly; about 1/2 a cwt. was still missing; it had been cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It had been daylight for some time - A. Yes. He was about three minutes walk from the house.</p>

I pursued, calling out Stop thief! - a person came in contact with me, and we both fell - the prisoner ran by, and joined the other man. I saw the prisoner taken in two or three minutes in St. Martin's le-Grand - he was taken into a shop and immediately gave the watch to Mr. Engelhart, and then told the officer that he might search him.

I went down, and found one of the bags gone. I followed him into the street, took his hat off, and found it there. He fell on his knees, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. When did you miss any flour - A. I did not miss it; the three bags weighed 11 lbs.; it was all in one trap. I did not give him in charge until next day, as I could not spare him; it had no business in his hat - if it was for a customer, it should be in his basket - he confessed that he had put the bags into the trap. I thought well of him before.</p>

            , JUN. I am apprentice to the last witness. On the 25th of April, about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I opened a door of the bath, and the prisoner was coming out at the other door with the glass and carpet - I did not speak to him, but followed him a step or two - he laid the glass against the front of the house and ran away. I saw him taken in about a minute - I had lost sight of him, when he turned the corner, but am sure he is the same man - he was taken about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from our premises. I went to see if the glass and carpet were gone, and they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of him - A. Yes; at the corner, only for an instant - there were three or four other persons pursuing him - my opportunity of seeing his countenance was but short; but I know him by his dress and countenance - he was dressed in a long pepper and salt coloured coat.</p>

I am quite positive as to his person - I did not go back with him, because Mr. Young brought the article which had been stolen soon afterwards, and I delivered him to the watchman.</p>

             YOUNG. I am in the employment of Mr. Neville, linen-draper, Mile-end-road, these goods were in the shop on the evening in question, hanging upon a line, about three feet from the door - I had seen them within an hour of their being taken. The witness, Harrie, came in and told me something had been stolen, and pointed in the direction in which the man had gone. I pursued, but could not at first perceive whether he had any thing, but I saw him throw away the cotton, and picked it up. Hill pursued with me, but in consequence of my stooping to pick up the goods, he caught him first. I gave the cotton to the constable.</p>

I saw the lead upon the roof about Christmas, when it was repaired - I did not hear of any being stolen till the 24th of April, when Mr. Matthews called, and said that the wet came through. I went with him, and got up at the front of the house, and missed lead from the middle of the gutter - it appeared to be fresh cut. I saw some lead found on the same morning, in another house of mine, No. 29 or 30, occupied by Mr. Chapman. I compared that lead with the vacancy, and it exactly fitted it; I have no doubt of its being taken from there.</p>

            . I occupy the first floor of this house; it is rented by Matthews; Campbell asked me to go with him to Bow-street; when we came back we went to No. 30, got up to the top of the house, and went along the roof to Mr. Matthews's house, and found the lead had been taken from there, it was in the loft at No. 30 - I saw it applied to the place, and it fitted exactly. I have no doubt but it was taken from there. The prisoner lives at No. 30; his mother keeps the front garret, and he keeps pigeons in the loft where the lead was found.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the lead in one or more pieces - A. The lead was in two pieces; they were both in one pigeon loft, the one kept by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are other pigeons kept in the next house - Witness. I believe there are.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Could another person have gone along the roof, and have put the lead into that pigeon-house or loft - A. Yes; a person could get from No. 30 to 33.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found this lead in the pigeon-loft or cock-loft, of No. 30. I met the prisoner coming in at the street door when I went down - I followed him up, and took him; his mother was there, and told him about the lead, but he made no answer. I saw it fitted to the place, and found three small pieces of lead in his pockets, which fitted the small spaces exactly.</p>

There was not room to get through the place he spoke of from my pigeon loft.</p>

I was going on gently, and my wife and daughter were sitting in the cart, which has a high tail-board to it. I missed the goods when we got just below the turnpike beyond St. George's Hospital. I knew nothing of their being taken till Mr. Maggs told me of it - it was about eight o'clock at night. I got out of the cart, and ran into Hyde-park, but did not see them, and I got into the cart and waited there - Mr. Maggs returned, and said he had got the man in Park-lane - I turned round and came to the place, and went into the public-house, and there were the three boxes - the prisoner was in custody at a shop, about two doors from the public-house - he was quite a stranger to me - he must have taken them over the tail-board - it had not been taken down.</p>

I went down on the Monday, and found the roof much disconcerted, the gutters taken away, and the flashing of the windows - upwards of three cwt. of lead was gone - I saw it afterwards at the watch-house, and the size of it corresponded with the spaces on the house - it had been cut, and torn off - the edges appeared bright, as if fresh cut, but in a haggling manner - the prisoners were in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the parish of Christ Church - this house is on my beat. About twenty minutes before three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the house; and knowing that it was uninhabited, I fetched my partner Lewing, and another watchman. I knocked at the door of the next house; we went in, and got over the pales. I heard some persons whispering in the house. I came round again, and the prisoner Lackey jumped out of the window; I laid hold of him in the yard - my partner sprung his rattle - the Whitechapel watchman laid hold of one of the other prisoners, and Powell and Brown secured the other two. They were taken to the watch-house, and I returned to the house. The roof was much damaged, and a quantity of lead laid in the garret; it had been cut, except one piece, which had been drawn from a gutter, and was hanging down; here is the piece that was hanging down; it is gutter lead; I then found a smock frock, which the prisoner Wilson said was his, but Cook put it on. After I left duty I went again to the house, and found a knife, which Hurling claimed; the lead was afterwards claimed by Mr. Story; it weighed 320 lbs.</p>

In about a minute she turned her head, and said,</p>
               <p>"My purse is gone;" in consequence of which I turned, and looked for the gentleman with the purse, but he was gone. I left the sale room soon after, and did not see him again till I saw him at Bow-street. I am certain he is the person.</p>

Soon after I entered the crowd, I was surrounded and pressed by a throng of person. My watch was safe just before - it cost 7 l. with the chain and seals; I felt it drawn from me, and saw the prisoner near me, on my left - his arm went across, and immediately the throng left me, and rushed down Long-alley; I pursued and took him; he declared his innocence, and said he had not a watch about him, and would go with me any where. I sent for an officer, who searched him, but did not find it. He said next morning at the office, that if I would drop the prosecution he would send and see for the watch; he sent a person, who did not return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he when he said this - A. In the parlour at the office; he came to me and said so. He was standing in a crowd of persons at the time of the robbery; there were not less than fifty people; he was near me - in front; there was no person between me and him. I saw no watch in his hand; I saw his hand near me, and pass with great rapidity towards my right. I did not see the property pass from him to anybody.</p>

I assisted in taking him to a place of safety. I heard him say to the prosecutor that if he would forgive him, and not take him before Magistrate, he would return the watch.</p>

            . I had seen him there more than once. I have heard there were two persons in the room. I heard two persons in the room most nights when I came home - he never came to my house after the woman was gone. I never observed any other man but the prisoner come to her. I cannot find the woman. I found the prisoner at his mother's house - they took the room in the name of Davis - a man came on the following Monday after they were gone, and asked for a man of the name of Wright, a painter. I said no such person lived in my house.</p>

I went to Mr. Nash, who claimed it.</p>

             is my son by my former husband; he is very ill in the hospital; the prisoner slept in the house three nights - I had taken the articles out of my son's box on the 23d of March, and put them in a chest in the room where the prisoner slept - there was a brooch, two waistcoats, three collars, a sovereign, and a handkerchief - these were afterwards missed - I have seen the handkerchiefs and two collars since.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 15th of April I was going down White Horse-street, and met the prisoner Harris carrying four deal boards on his shoulder. I asked him where he was going - he said to Westle's house, (the other prisoner.) They were both strangers to me. I then asked where he brought them from - he said from Fox's, in the Commercial-road - that Westle had bought them of Mr. Fox, and was to pay him so much a week. I took him back to Mr. Fox's, and some persons were working there. I then asked Westle who was there where he got these timbers from; he said it was his own; he had been doing a job at Limehouse. I sent the foreman over to Mr. Fox - he said it was his property, and he had given him no liberty to take it; they then both begged his pardon.</p>
               <p>The property was produced, but the prosecutor declined to swear to it.</p>

The prisoner came and snatched my necklace off my neck. I took hold off the beads and pulled, but got half of them and ran away.

            . I am a tobacco-pipe maker. I lived in the house with the prisoner, at No. 42, Cannon-street-road. I can take upon myself to say, upon my God, that on that evening, and for three evenings before, and three evenings after, he was at home from seven o'clock till he went to bed. I can positively affirm to the Jury, and to all present, that that is the fact. He is not in any business. He has a mother and a father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you work - A. At the west end of the town. I leave work at five or six o'clock in the evening. I have spent my evening at home for the last twelve months. I am a widower, and have no children. I sometimes go out by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this lad lodge with you - A. He occupies the front room of the first floor, and I occupy the back.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you go to bed - A. Sometimes at eight o'clock, sometimes at nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you watch their door - A. No; they might go out, and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. What impresses so strongly upon your mind about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030041"/>the three days before, and the three days after the time spoken of - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lad was in the house; can you swear positively to the six evenings you have spoken of - A. I do not know that I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you can say - A. I can answer nothing to the purpose I am called upon unknown to this business.</p>
               <p>HYAM PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. How did you know the name of the prisoner - A. Because I had had sold him fruit, and I have heard his name from other boys. The other boys were all bigger than him; I should not know any of them. It was very moon-light, and there was a gas-light. I cannot be mistaken.</p>

On the 12th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some ribbons; I shewed her some; she asked to see some narrower, which I found for her, she had some cut off. I saw her take a piece out of the drawer, and conceal it, and then put it into her right hand pocket. A young man who had also seen it told Mr. Townsend. Mr. Hardwick searched her, and found it in her pocket. She said it was the first offence she had committed.</p>

On the 1st of April I addressed a letter to Mr. Cox, Portman-street, Portman-square, and enclosed a 5 l. note in it; I have a memorandum of the number which I made before I sent it off; (reads) it was No. 15,774, dated Jan. 8, 1824; I sealed the letter with wax, and put it into the letter-bag in which letters are conveyed from the Governor to the receiving-house - I locked the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How many persons have a key of that bag - A. The Governor, myself, and the letter-sergeant have each one; the Governor was not at Sandhurst at the time, and took his key away with him, I suppose, as he generally does; he was in Scotland; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Look at this note (handing one) - A. This is the note, it has the same number and date.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. These entries appear all in the same ink, and to be taken at the same time - A. It is an entry of the notes made when I receive them, and I write against each note the person to whom I pay it. I have written the name of Cox against this one. I have not placed his name to the wrong number; I received the notes in Feb., and at this time had only one other left, which was 15,775; I remember that number in my hands afterwards. Here is a copy of the number, made at the time I inclosed it; at the time I sent it, I was not in the room in which the original memorandum was, and so I took the number on this paper, and entered it off on the original one when I went into the room; these notes were my private property, and did not belong to Government.</p>

            . I am letter-sergeant of the Millitary College, Sandhurst. On the 1st of April I opened the Governor's letter-bag before I sent the letters off to the post, in order to take the letters out and put them into the College-bag. I remember one letter being in it directed to Mr. Cox; I put it into the College-bag with the other letters, and delivered it to Hammond, who carries it from the College to Bagshot; the postmaster at Bagshot has a key of the College-bag; I have one, and Hammond has another, but nobody else has one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The Governor has a key - A. I believe so; he was not at the College, and is not here; I do not know what had become of his key - I generally look at all the letters - there were only four in the Governor's bag, and I read the directions of them all - I am not positive whether two were not addressed to the Horse Guards - I took a copy of the address of one.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Which did you take a copy of - A. One that was going to the Governor, as I intended to write to one of his servants, and wanted to know where to address it; I heard of the loss of this letter some days after. The Governor has a key of his own bag, but not of the College-bag. I delivered the bag to Hammond directly after I had locked it. I keep my own key hanging on a nail in the Post-office of the College; nobody but myself has access to the Post-office. I always lock the door when I leave.</p>

            . I keep the Cambridge Coffee-house in Newman-street, Oxford-street, and know the prisoner as a postman. He applied to me on a Saturday to change a five pound note from him, which I did, and wrote on the front of it at the time (looking at a note) - this is it. I have written</p>
               <p>"Postman 3 - 4 - 24 on it." Part of the word postman is torn off by cancelling the note, but I know my writing which is left.</p>

            How long have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030043"/>you known the prisoner - A. I cannot say; I have known him many weeks as a postman. I can swear, from what remains of my writing, that it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. There is the letters Po and an, 3 - 4 - 24; now might that not be the name of Portman - A. I know nobody of that name. I never change a note for persons whom I do not know, and always write the person's name on it when I know it. I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you distinctly recollect receiving this, and writing that upon it with the date - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is your house in his district - A. No; I wrote postman on it, because I knew him as a postman - if the postman of my district had paid it to me. I should have written the same; but I have no doubt of the prisoner being the man I took it from - he had his red coat on at the time. I did not change a note for any other postman.</p>

            . I am wife of the last witness. I know the prisoner - he used our house. I remember his coming on a Saturday to get change for a note. I saw my husband give him the change, and was present when he wrote on the note, but did not see what he wrote. It was a 5 l. note, for I had it in my hand; the prisoner gave it into my hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"Can you oblige me with change for a 5 l. note." I gave it to my husband. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I assure you. The gentleman must be mistaken in my person. I have borne an excellent character through life.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. John, Hackney. On the 29th of May, about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at the White Lion public-house, Hackneywick, with Brewer, and saw the prisoner in the road, leading a horse by an halter. I asked where he was going with it? he said he was going to turn it into a grass field just by. I asked if it was his own? he said No, that it belonged to his master. I asked who his master was; he said

            , a farmer, who lived close by the Three Colts public-house, at Old Ford. I asked how he came to be out at so unseasonable an hour; he said he had been to town after a load of dung, and was late home. I asked how long he had been in Marsh's service - he said for six months, and that he lodged in his master's house. I took him into custody, and Brewer brought the horse to the watch-house. I inquired, but could find no Mr. Marsh.</p>

            , junior. I put this horse in the field, at the Three Colts public-house, Old Ford, at seven o'clock on Friday evening. I went there again at five in the morning, and missed it. There were other horses there, one of which was my father's; the one missing was a grey one. There is no gate to the field. I went to the watch-house and found it there, and knew it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you leave a halter on it in the field - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARVA. I was constable of the night. The prisoner and gelding were brought to me about one o'clock in the morning. Sutton and his son saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Old Ford-lane, and saw the horse straying with the halter on its neck. I was going to take it into the field to grass. I could take it nowhere but to the field, for there is no road to lead any where else.</p>

I put the letter W. on it by desire of Wilkinson, and that is on the back of it now. I directed the letter to

            . I am daughter of the last witness, and remember the prisoner coming for change of a Bank post-bill. I saw him write on the back of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to BARNET. Q. Was Benjamin present when I wrote on the bill - A. No; he went out to fetch the watch while his daughter brought the pen and ink - neither he nor his daughter were present, nor was I, for I went out at the same time as Benjamin.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of you were present - A. No; I will take a solemn oath that nobody was present - the daughter was not present - she brought the pen and ink, and then went into the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present - how do you know whether she did not go into the room again - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the Bank post-bill in Albemarle-street on Sunday evening, and took it to the Bank next morning to be accepted - they told me to bring it on that day week, and it would be paid.</p>

Hawkins pointed him out - I took him to a public house - he denied the charge. I found a purse on him containing silver - I put it on the table - he took it up, and threw it on the floor. As I was taking him to the watch-house, I told him I knew he had stolen the coat, for he had been seen carrying it from the house; and that Mahoney, who he was at work with, was in custody, until I found him. He then said</p>
               <p>"I have sold it, and the money in the purse is what I got for it" - that he had sold it in Vine-street. I went there and found such a shop as he had described - I got a coat there, which I produced.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 18th of April, I came down about seven o'clock; Murrell, who had set up every night since Christmas, gave me information. I found the cellar door wrenched off its hinges - somebody had got in that way, opened the wash-house window-shutters, and both the windows, and this property was gone. One of the boilers were brought in by a man, and the other three were found at a broker's. The Park is behind our house - any one can get over the wall into the yard - the cellar opens into the yard.</p>

I was getting up at five o'clock in the morning, and on looking out of the window, I saw Reynolds getting over the Park wall into Mrs. Phillips's yard; he had a dark coat and a red handkerchief on, and a kind of a shoemaker's apron. I thought at first that it was Phillips, but looked again and saw that it was Reynolds; he was getting on the flat, which is level with the wall.</p>

I found an old copper boiler under the bed, wrapped in two old blue aprons, which I produce. I went to the premises; they appeared to have been broken open by some large instrument. I found the shaft of a chaise in the yard - it corresponded with the marks on the cellar door - it had been used to force the hinges off. I apprehended the other prisoner before.</p>

               <p>"Oh! my mother has got it" - she immediately brought it from the mantle-piece, wrapped in a towel, and gave it to him; he gave it to me.

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of April, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting on a step, two or three doors from the prosecutor's, with another boy; he was sharpening a knife on the step, and in a moment I saw him go towards Mr. Sharman's. Some cotton hung under the window, tied with two strings. I saw him cut the strings - he and the other boy then went and took hold of a piece of cotton, and carried it between them till they had passed the shop; the prisoner then carried it alone; I crossed over, and took him with it - he was trying to put it under his coat. I found a knife upon him; he cried, and begged to be let go. The other ran off.</p>

               <p>Q. That was not knocking you down - A. No; one pulled me by my cloak, and Stephenson knocked me down with her fist; I only received one blow, and that was on my breast. Stephenson put a handkerchief into my mouth, and Woodfield put her hand to my pocket, and took out my pocket-book, while I was on the ground. Stephenson said to Woodfield -</p>
               <p>"We are all right," and both ran up the street with it. I got up as soon as I could, and went to the bottom of the street and called the watchman; they ran up that street, and came down the same street again, and met me and the watchman; the pocket-book contained 4 s., and thirteen duplicates. When they got me down I asked what they were going to do; they said if I made any resistance they would cut my throat; this passed while they were taking the handkerchief out to put into my mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you not call the watchman when you fell - A. No; I had no power; I was stunned. I laid there for ten minutes before I had power to get up, after they had run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you tell which way they went - A. I heard them run, and told the watchman which way they went.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you sober - A. I was perfectly sober. I had gone out about nine o'clock, and only had one glass of liquor. I had not been with any gentleman that night, I never saw the prisoners before, and never spoke to them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVESON. I am a watchman, and was stationed in Skinner-street, close to Turn-again-lane. At three in the morning I saw the prisoners come out of the lane into Skinner-street, running as fast as they could; but not hearing any alarm, I did not take them - if there had been a cry. I am certain I must have heard it. In about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, I found a red pocket-book against the door at which the prosecutrix says she was knocked down. I did not see her till I got to the watch-house, which was in about twenty-five minutes - she appeared perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About ten minutes past three o'clock in the morning, I was sitting by the Rose Inn, Fleet-market. The prosecutrix passed me, and the prisoners behind her, singing a song. The prosecutrix bid me good night, and in about ten minutes I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030048"/>a cry of Watch! at the bottom of Castle-street. I ran there, and the prosecutrix said she had been knocked down and robbed. I ran up Castle-street and Turn-again-lane, but could not find them. I was returning to my beat, but a man said two women were coming down the lane - it was the prisoners. I knew them to be the women who had followed prosecutrix - she also said they were the women, and I took them; and as they went along, Stephenson said, three or four times over, that she would have the prosecutrix's *** life; and Woodfield said,</p>
               <p>"If I cannot do it myself, I will get somebody else to do it."</p>
               <p>MATHEW BANKS. I was constable of the night; the prisoners were brought to the watch-house. The prosecutrix said they had knocked her down, and robbed her of a pocket-book and 4 s. 6 d.; they were very ontrageous, and said the would serve her out. I found 1 s. 6 d. on one of them, and a few halfpence on the other. The prosecutrix gave the same account of it them as she has now - she had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>STEPHENSON. Q. Did she not say that she had been drinking with us from a quarter to twelve o'clock - A. She said she had been giving them a glass each, and that she had been with a gentleman, who gave her the money.</p>

            . On the 15th of April, at about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming up <placeName id="t18240603-141-crimeloc757">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I walked on, and as I approached two or three steps (at the <placeName id="t18240603-141-crimeloc758">corner of Angel-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18240603-141-crimeloc758" type="placeName" value="corner of Angel-alley"/>

I quickened my pace, and he came before me, then came round behind me, and struck me on the left arm - the blow did not hurt, but numbed my arm, - he snatched my bundle directly, and ran up Angel-alley - it was on my left arm, and contained the articles stated in the indictment. I pursued him, calling Stop thief! but nobody was kind enough to stop him. He took a turning on right of the alley, and at the top of that turning I lost sight of him. He was taken by Liman in a quarter of an hour - I pointed him out myself in the tap-room of the George public-house, which is a few steps from the spot on which I lost sight of him. I am confident he is the person - I charged him with the theft - he denied it - I have not found my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you seen the girl since - A. No; people were passing in the street. I noticed them for about a minute or two. He appeared to lear at me as I passed, which attracted my notice. I thought he meant to insult me, and passed on quickly. I looked at him sufficiently to know him - it was a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening - I am sure of the time - it was not later - I looked at Bishopsgate Church clock - it was then better than ten minutes past seven - I was taking the waistcoats home to a gentleman. The transaction did not occupy above a minute or two. I only looked at him once, when he leared at me - if I notice a person, I can speak to them again - I am confident that he is the man. I may have taken one person for another in the course of my life, but I am confident of him. I described him to Sapswell, the patrol, before I went into the George public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable and patrol of Bishopsgate, On the 15th of April, I was going upon duty, and was told this young woman had been robbed. I found her at Sapswell's door; she described the prisoner to me as a full faced young man, dressed in blue trowsers and coat. I took her to the George public-house - the prisoner was sitting there, leaning over a chair, and the moment she entered she said to him,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with my bundle?" he said</p>
               <p>"Me!" she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are the man who took it, and nobody else;" he said," I have not been out of the house for an hour and a half." I said to the people present,</p>
               <p>"How long has he been here?" nobody present would answer. I went to the bar, and asked a person there in his presence - he said he did not know - I took him to the Mansion House - he told the same story there, and was remanded till Monday, to bring persons to prove it; in which case, the Lord Mayor said, he would not commit him; but nobody came forward.</p>

I turned round and missed my handkerchief - the man pointed to the prisoner, who was about twelve yards off, and said he was theman who had taken it - he ran away.

I had hold of them; his hat fell off, and so did mine. I I went to pick it up - he gave me a blow in the eye, and ran off. I called Stop thief! - his companions stopped me. I got my hat, and pursued him down Three-fox-court; he held up a stick, and swore he would murder me if I followed - he got over a wall into the pig-market; the watchmen got over and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master expect you so early as four o'clock; A. I was to be at his house at six. I had come from Crown-street, Soho. I got up at half-past three.</p>
               <p>Q. When he unbuttoned your coat, then returned, and unbottoned your waistcoat, did you not suspect he was going to do something - A. Yes, my Lord; I struggled with him, and got my watch back, and put it into my fob. I did not lose sight of him.</p>

He was in the tap-room about eight o'clock in the morning. I had three sovereigns, two crowns, four half-crowns, and some shillings and sixpences in my pocket-handkerchief. I gave it to the landlord till I left; we went away together; he asked me to let him ride in my cart to Waltham-cross; he shook some hay about in the cart, and said,</p>
               <p>"Lay down and go to sleep, and I will drive." I did so. We kept on till we came to the Two Brewers public-house, at Ponders-end, and I was rather sleepy, but I saw that the horses were going wrong; the prisoner was then gone. I called to the horses to stop, and a man in the road stopped them; I then felt in my pocket and found it was cut, and the money was gone. I did not see him again till the Sunday week following, when he was in the cage at Cheshunt. I charged him with having my money, he said he had not had it.</p>

            . I am swan-marker to the Vintners Company and live at Vintners Hall; I am well acquainted with the marks of the King's swans, the Dyers and the Vintners. The swan-markers of these Companies go every year, on the first Monday in August, to mark the swans. We have none on the River but tame swans; the colour of the beak of the wild swans is yellowish, and they have not black legs. These swans (examining soms) and this cygnet, have the Dyers mark. I went in March, with Harrison, the City officer, to Carstangs's, and saw five swans there; these two swans were there, and I found another swan, a (pen,) which has died since it was in my custody. The pen was the King's; here is the beak of it, which I have preserved; they were all delivered into my custody, and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is the mark made - A. The mark is always across the beak; these scratches are a part of the King's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many swans in England - A. Yes, I suppose there are.</p>

               <p>Q. What marks persons in the country may put upon their swans you don't know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not be surprised at other people marking them on the beak? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. 
               <persName id="t18240603-152-person1311">Q. </persName>
            These swans were pinioned, and could not fly - A. No; there are six marks across the beak; I could see these marks very plain when the bird was alive, or I should not have seized it. This cob has the mark of the Dyers' Company; it is cut out with a penknife, and there are marks across the beak beside. It is smooth when first cut, but gets rougher; we cut them again next year. I can say upon my oath that these are the Dyers Company's swans.</p>
               <p>Mr. W. BENTLEY proved the charter of the Dyers' Company.</p>
               <p>HERCULES UPJOHN. I am one of the swan-nesters to his Majesty, on the Thames, and to the Dyers' and Vintners' Companies. About Christmas last there were upon the Thames in the neighbourhood of Chertsey, belonging to the King, the Dyers, and Vintners Companies, forty or fifty swans. About a month after I missed some; I can't say how many. There is a place called Docket Point, about three quarters of a mile from Chertsey-bridge; there might be ten or twelve swans there, and in about a month or five weeks after Christmas they were nearly all gone. I remember<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030052"/>one swan with one eye, and a female belonging to him, and two young ones; they were all the Dyers Company. I saw them sometimes two or three times a day; I have rested the one-eyed swan for three years, and know it perfectly well; I should know it among a thousand: this is the swan (looking at it). There was another brood of swans at Docket Point, and another at Chertsey-bridge. This swan nested between Docket Point and Chertsey, in a place called Dumsey-meadow; it is in the County of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Q. There being another brood of swans at Chertsey-bridge, and another at Docket Point, what effect would that have upon these swans? - A. They will not let the other swans go past: they come to their bounds and there fight, and never pass that point at the brooding time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose sight of the one-eyed swan - 
               <persName id="t18240603-152-person1312">A. </persName>
            About Christmas; it might be before or after, I cannot say. I did not see if sometimes for a week together; I do not recollect that I had seen him the week before Christmas; it might be a fortnight or three weeks, I cannot exactly say. I have been at Vintners' Hall since then; I have seen swans there, and the one-eyed swan was there; this is it - I saw it at Vintners Hall; it is the one I nested in Dumsey-meadow. I never heard of any one-eyed swan on the river but this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say that the broods fight very much; should you be surprised if one were to beat out another's eye in a fight - A. It might happen for anything I know. They moult every year, and get lighter by moulting. Some swans may wander a little way in a flood time; they might go a mile. There are a great many swans on the Thames, but no private gentleman has got them near our parts. I have gone to the nest of this pair very often in flood time, and put stuff to raise the nest, and they seemed pleased that the eggs were raised out of the water. They moult in the spring, but do not lose their mark by moulting.</p>

I should know by the mark to whom they belong (looking at one); this is the King's bird; I can see no other mark upon it. I am a nester, and not a marker. I live at Chertsey Bridge; I know Dumsey-meadow, but do not nest the swans there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been acquainted with swans - A. Sixty years. I have seen them marked, fed them, and nested them. I have had great experience, and I think this swan is the King's; this beak of the dead swan I think is the same as the other.</p>

            . I am one of the swan-markers of the Dyers' Company; I live in Moss-alley, Bankside. This swan with one eye I marked myself; it is the mark of the Dyers' Company. This cygnet was marked by me in August last. Mr. Page has sometimes assisted me in marking them, but I marked this myself. I believe I know but of one instance of Mr. Page marking a bird. The beak of the female swan has the King's mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not Mr. Rowsell great knowledge of all the swans about the neighbourhood - A. Yes; but he is only a nester not a marker; there are many old nesters who do not know the marks.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROAKE. I lived at Christmas last, at Back-lane, Chertsey, near the sign of the Bell, public house. I know the prisoner Snelling; he came to me on a Sunday morning, about six or eight days after Christmas, and asked me if I would take a walk with him to look at a few swans, which we could get very easily; we did so, and he said there were three swans we could get very easily; they were in some bye water in the neighbourhood of the Thames.

            . We saw three live swans; he said we could easily get them at night. I told him that Sunday night was a bad night for any thing of that kind; he said,</p>
               <p>"What does it matter to us as to the night;" there were two white swans and one brown one; I do not know the difference between a cygnet and an old one except by the colour. We then went over Chertsey-bridge and round Chertsey-meadow, and then home. About six o'clock Snelling came to my house again; it was then dark; he asked me to go out and get some swans - I went with him. There was nobody with him at my house, but Haynes joined us soon after; he had two sack. We went together to Dumsey-meadow, pelted the swans ashore, and caught them; we drove them on the meadow shore, and put two in one sack, and one in the other - I believe that they were the same as I had seen in the morning; we carried them and laid them under the hedge in Dumsey-meadow. Snelling said his father's cart was going to Leadenhall-market that night, and he would get him to let him go up with it, and take them; he said</p>

               <p>"We will keep these swans alive, for they will fetch double the money of dead ones;" we then went to Chertsey-bridge. When they were sold we three were to share the money. I saw Haynes two days after that, and again some time after. I never learned from him what became of the swans, but that he took them to Leadenhall-market to the salesman. He gave me 3 s., which he said was all he could give. I was taken up on the 3d of April, I believe. I and Snelling had been acquainted from the time we were in Dumsey-meadow till we were taken. I was taken before him, and was accused of taking the swans; I then laid the blame upon Snelling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you expect to save yourself by accusing him - A. No, I did not, upon my oath, expect to save myself, nor do I now expect it.</p>
               <p>Q. What then is your motive; is it pure love of justice - A. Yes; I have come from the House of Correction now. I objected to Sunday night, because I thought it was a very bad night to do it on, because it is the Lord's day.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not mind it on a week day then - A. I was very cautious about doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever accused of robbing any person before, or of any crime before this - A. I do not recollect being accused of robbing any one, or trying to rob any one before. I was taken once before a Magistrate for asking a man for my wages; that is the only time.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living - A. By gardening; I was not then in regular employment; I work at different<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030053"/>places, where I can get a job; I had been as much as three months out of employment, and have had relief from the parish; that was my chief support. I made up my living by working now and then for my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this place well, where the swans were taken from, Dumsey-meadow - A. I have known it sixteen or eighteen years. I never told this to any one till I came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet it is for the mere love of justice that you tell it now - A. I had not an opportunity of telling it before; I was nearly the whole of the time ill in bed; it was my illness that caused me to apply to the parish; I had applied before I was ill; they refused to relieve me at first, but did afterwards.</p>

            . I am a salesman of Leadenhall-market. I remember in January last having three swans; I do not speak as to one being a cygnet. A memorandum was made at the time in my book by my son; it was on the 26th of January. I cannot say who brought them; I believe they were sold for 3 l., but they are not paid for. It appears I got 8 s. commission for selling them; I am certain I had no other swans on the 26th of January.</p>

            . I live in Cross-lane. I did lodge with Mrs. Fletcher on the same floor, but not in the same room. I have seen the cap a great many times in Fletcher's possession, and I have seen it on the prisoner's head. On the 26th of February I went with Mrs. Fletcher to her apartments, and her landlady told us in her presence, that the cap had been on her head the night before - she denied it, and produced a cap, saying,</p>
               <p>"That is the cap I wore," which the landlady contradicted. I saw her afterwards with the cap on, and told Mrs. Fletcher of it.</p>

My attention was attracted by the elder one stooping down. I went up and laid hold of her, saying,</p>

I drew her aside, and the piece of silk rolled from under her clothes; there is twenty-nine yards and a half of it, it is worth 4 s. 6 d. a yard.

I then asked the prisoner what he had got - he said he had got beef - I asked where he was going to take it - he said to Newington-green, and had brought it from Newgate-market; he did not know the person's name, but a person whom he knew had given it to him. I detained him - I looked at the basket, and saw a bit of card tied to it, which had been a direction torn off; it had a calve's head, a loin of veal, and two pigs' cheeks in it, and at the bottom was a letter, directed</p>

            . I am the patrol. I saw the prisoner about eight yards from Beckett's house, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, with a pail and other articles; I asked what she did with them - she said if I would let her go, she would tell me where she got them. I took her to the watch-house, and found Beckett's yard open; the bolt had been shoved back by some means.</p>

On the 26th of March he brought an order from a gentleman of the name of Hoden, for a firkin of white lead; I gave it to my boy, Brown - it weighed 3 cwt. The prisoner did not go with him to deliver the goods. I never saw it afterwards. The prisoner remained in my service a few days - I then discharged him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he live with you - A. Yes; and he used to go and get orders for me, he was at liberty to send goods to customers. Hoden was a customer of mine, and had bought lead of me. I did not treat it as a civil debt. I never received 1 l. on account of that lead; it was on account of other monies, that he had received from other persons. I did not apprehend him about this before I had received the 1 l. He went round with the officer to the customers, to see what he was deficient. I never agreed that he should pay me by instalments. He collected some money on that day, and brought me 1 l. of a certain man's account. I had had him in custody, and let him go - I then took 1 l. from him. He never executed orders - I always did that myself. I took the 1 l. because I thought it was some money he had received from a man of the name of Capilliar; he then said,</p>
               <p>"I believe Capilliar did not pay me," and I said I must erase it; but I went to Capilliar, and saw the receipts in his handwriting, for 30 s. I saw Mr. Hoden some time afterwards; it might be three weeks or a month after I saw him, that I apprehended the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Mild-end-road. On the 26th of March I had not given any order for white lead - I might have done so prior to that. I received some on the 17th of March, and on the 6th of April I received 3 cwt. 1 qr. 14 lb. I believe it was delivered by the prisoner, but I was not at home. I did not receive any on the 26th of March - I saw Mr. Atmore on the subject after the 6th of April. Firkins have different weights. I cannot say that the lead delivered on the 6th of April had not been ordered on the 26th of March.

I went up Brick-lane. He rolled the firkin along after he took it off the truck. Mr. Hoden's is about three quarters of a mile from Whitechapel-church. I never saw a firkin rolled so great a distance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner live in the same shop with you at the time - A. Yes. He was in the habit of taking orders for Mr. Atmore.

            . I am a dealer in marine stores. I recollect the prisoner coming to my shop, and offering several books for sale. She said her master had given her them to dispose of as occasion required. I told her I could only give waste paper price, (3 d. per lb.) for them. She came one day with two books - one was sermons, the other a geographical book. I said they were too good to sell to me, but she would not take them away, and I bought them of her. I kept them till Mr. Galloway came and searched my house, I gave them to him.</p>

On the 18th of May, about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the evening, I was very busy, and saw the prisoner in the shop - she asked for some shawls. I had shown her some. I saw her cross from the counter, and take a piece of Irish linen from a pile on the other side; she brought it to the counter, and rolled it up in a piece of calico, which was also mine. My boy was then at the drawer, reaching some more shawls. I showed her some more shawls myself - she did not buy any, but said she would look in again in the morning, and went out of the shop. - I followed, and stopped her at the next door, and gave her in charge.</p>

I sent her out at three o'clock, and the officer met her - she was then asked where they were; she told the officer to come up stairs, and pointed to her bed - we found the goods between the bed and the sacking.</p>

I went behind the counter, and saw her looking at some lace, with one piece in her hand; I turned as if to look on the shelf again, and saw her put a piece of lace under her shawl; she said,</p>
               <p>"Will you give me a pattern of this silk," and asked if we had gauzes to match it; I said, Yes, on the other side - she would not turn round for some time, but at length she turned, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will call again." I followed her, and in Berner-street I found this piece of lace under her shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you accuse her of it in the shop - A. No; there were other persons in the shop. She said she was going to bring it back.</p>

No; we had two-pints of beer at the Rose public-house between two of us, and I took part of the quartern of gin which the four of us had at the house - I was frightened when they got me down to take my money - I never saw the prisoner before; she held me by the legs.</p>
               <p>Q. She was more down on the ground than the others. A. They pushed me on the bed - I could see her when I got up, and saw her before I was frightened; I should know them all if I was to see them.</p>

The prisoner lived about two hundred yards off, and passed the house almost every day; I saw him pass next morning. About two months afterwards I saw him in company with a man named Eden, who had a coat on which looked like the one I had lost. I followed them to a house, and asked Eden if that was his coat - he said,</p>

            . I am a silk weaver, and live in John-street, Brick-lane. I know the prisoner - he came to my house on the last Friday in January. In the evening I went with him to the Duke of York public-house, Turk-street, Bethnal-green - we met Phillips at the door. I knew him before. I did not go into the Duke of York. Phillips said to Taylor and me, that Taylor had only one shilling more of the property than the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first thing he said - A. Yes; he was rather in liquor. Taylor had told me that Phillips said I was suspected of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; but had you spoken to him about this before Phillips came up - A. Yes; I told him I was out of work and very much embarrassed, and that I had been suspected of the robbery. Taylor said, that on the night after robbery he came to my mother's to bring me one pound, but was told I was not there - the pound was to send me away - they had a reason for it - he said he would have given me a pound if he could have seen me - he knew that I was suspected.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what made you tell him of it - A. I thought it hard that I should be suspected, when, according to every appearance, he was concerned in it. I had seen him at my brother's, at No. 21, Wilmott-street, on the Sunday week after the robbery, and told him I was out of the way, as the officers were after me, and I knew nothing of the robbery. He told my brother to come to the corner of Air-street, about nine o'clock that night, and he would give me some money, and would speak to the other parties to send me some, as I was out of the way for it. I did not see him again, to my recollection, till the last Friday in January, when we went towards the Duke of York public-house. I met Phillips, who said Taylor had had one shilling more than the rest, and if there was a Bank note lost,

            , who came back with them. Blacket, who had been left to watch, came to the public-house about nine o'clock, and told them it was all right. There were then six of them, and they went down - Taylor got in at the window, and let in two of them, saying,</p>

               <p>"Come in, Bob - come in, Tom;" three of them went in, and Haydon, Walker, and Phillips, were outside; Taylor and Jones went upstairs, and Blacket was sky-larking below; Taylor and Jones took the box from over the stairs - then Blacket came up, Taylor caught hold of the money, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here it is, Bob," and gave him the money; and after they came out of the house, they threw the plum-pudding about the place, and brought the bread and beef out, and found a string of candles, which they brought away, and came along the road - that is all he said. We then went to the Ship public-house, at the corner of John-street, Brick-lane, and there saw Blacket - Taylor spoke to him about wronging him of the note - he said he had not had one - Taylor said, if any thing should happen to him, he should blame Blacket - we had a quartern of gin and parted. I saw him again last Monday three weeks at a fight - his arm was dislocated - he said, that when that was well, he would break the other over me. I had told my father of it before this, and he told Powis. I did not give information myself till after I met Taylor at the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were out of the way for this robbery - A. Yes; I was accused wrongfully; I was not there. I was tried here for a highway robbery, which I was innocent of.</p>

               <p>Q. You said nothing about this till the prisoner threatened to break your head - A. No; he told me every thing about the robbery. I have been at work for the last three or four months. I was out of work for a month before Christmas, and for two or three weeks after. I might be out of the way for two or three months after the robbery. I recollect all that Taylor told me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get your living while you were out of the way - A. I had plenty of goods, and sold them all off. I lived about a hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor, and the prisoner lived nearer. I was concealed in Wilmot-street, which is not three hundred yards off. I went out frequently in the day-time, and went home two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at nine o'clock on the 25th of De- December - A. At a public-house about thirty yards from the prosecutor's. I was not out of there after six o'clock on that evening - several people saw me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to the prosecutor's house lately - A. Last Thursday, as we came from Hick's Hall, I went in as Taylor's mother was standing by. Powis did not wish to hurt her feelings, so we went into the house till she was gone. I was there last Monday, and staid about half an hour; I went to ask when they would go to Hick's Hall. I did not talk one word about this business - we did not mention the prisoner's name.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of April, Goodwin gave the prisoner into my charge. Clayton had given me information about three weeks before that, and I received information from his father about a week or nine days before. The prisoner denied all knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The officers had been on the lookout for Clayton - A. I believe so. I went into the prosecutor's house last Friday, as we came from Hick's Hall. I had no reason for going in, except that I was tired - no other reason was assigned.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 12th of April I met the prisoner, and asked if his name was not Taylor; he said No, that he lived in Tyson-street, Bethnal-green, near or next door to the sign of the Duke of York; I said he did not live there - he said he did, and offered to take me there, but I did not go, not believing him. I took him towards King's, and in the road met an officer, and said to him,</p>
               <p>"What is this man's name?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Sam Taylor, is it not Sam?" he gave no answer. On the morning of the robbery Mrs. King gave me a crowbar, a dark-lantern, and the iron tip of a shoe. I took his shoes off at the first examination; one had an iron tip, and the other not, and the tip corresponded with the heel of that shoe; he wore the shoes in prison, and I afterwards found he had torn the other tip off; I could not compare the tip with the shoe, as it had been heeled, and has nails in it. I asked what he had taken the other tip off for; he said he had kicked it off in prison, but we could not find it there. When I examined the two tips they appeared to be fellows, but I cannot say that the loose tip had been on that shoe, as it had been mended; he appears to tread on the back of his heel, and both tips were worn alike.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He offered to go to Tyson-street with you - A. Yes. We had received information about Clayton on the day after the robbery. I was desired to to look after the prisoner a few days before the 12th of April.</p>

I began to dispose of it on the 22d of March last, and ended in May. Barnett was employed to cut it to go to market - he has worked eight or nine years for me. I superintended the making of the hay myself; I believe it was the best that has been made for forty years. The prisoner Cook had a rick of hay last year within six or seven yards from mine. The prisoners were apprehended in consequence of information from Barnett.</p>

            . I have been seven or eight years in the prosecutrix's service. In March, April and May, I was employed to cut this hay from the rick in Kensington-gardens; the prisoner Cook came to me one morning between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked if his haybinder had been there? (that was Langton) I said No; he asked if I had done any thing this morning? I said No; he said</p>
               <p>"Well, get what you can; I shall give you 1 s. a truss for it;" he said no more, but went away. Langton came to me next day, and I had a quarter of a load of mistress's hay - Langton said,</p>
               <p>"Can we get another quarter of a load," and we got it - I cut it - he fetched some of it away and bound it, and I bound some; he took it into his shed. I generally twist my hay-hands shorter and lighter than other people; it was quite a light brown hay, and that in Cook's rick was a very dark brown; it was loaded on Cook's cart, and taken away - a quarter of a load is nine trusses. Langton paid me 4 s. 6 d. for it as soon as I had done it - that was 6 d. for me, and 6 d. for himself. I have drank at the King's Head public-house with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose you went and told Mrs. Medley of this proposal directly - A. No; I agreed to steal it for 6 d. a truss - it was not my wish, but they came and bothered me so. I was found out about a week after - I have seen Langton's brother since I made this charge, and said I was very sorry that it should happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would not have said one word about it, if Mrs. Medley had not told you - A. No; I said no such thing; I stated at first to mistress that I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030065"/>nothing about it. I went away, and they sent me word that I should not be hurt, if I would come back and tell the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mrs. Medley ever tell you what to say - A. No; when I was accused of it, she wrote down what Puttick, the carter, had said; that I had been doing. I denied it at first, but when she read to me what he had said, I ran off, but came back, as they said if I told what had been done, she would not hurt me. She said nothing to me about Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Cook said he would give you 1 s. a truss - A. Yes; 6 d. for me, and 6 d. for Langton - we had that before when we took some.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL STRICKLAND. On the 21st of May, I bought thirty-six trusses of hay from Cook, in the Hay-market - it was divided between me and Mr. Knight. I had eighteen trusses - it was brown hay - I did not notice whether, it was all of one colour. When the officer came I had seven trusses left, which they examined.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Strickland's on the 31st of May, and to Knight's on the 2d of June. I saw four trusses at Strickland's - Barnett picked out three of them, and picked up a hayband, which he said he had made; he fixed on one truss at Knight's, and a band.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMSON. I was with Buckeridge - Barnett pointed out three trusses at Strickland's - it was rather lighter and brighter than the other hay, and smelt sweeter; there was very little difference in the colour, but one appeared mouldy.</p>

               <p>JOHN PUTTICK. I was carter to Mr. Cook. I remember some hay being in his shed; he took it to the Hay-market for sale, on the 21st of April - eight trusses were taken from the shed to the loft, and then to the market by me, and sold to Strickland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You do not know who brought it to the shed - A. No; I drove it to market with a load, the rest was made up from the loft.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and have frequently seen Mrs. Medley's hay in Kensington-gardens, and have seen Cook's hay. About three weeks, or a month ago, I was passing through the gardens, and saw two of Cook's carts loaded with hay, near the spot where his own and one of Mrs. Medley's ricks stood. I was brought up a farmer, and have often noticed Mrs. Medley's stacks and Cook's - her's was very good, and his very bad; some of the hay in his cart looked much better than his own. I took no further notice, thinking she had borrowed his cart. Cook is a respectable man, and the last person I should have suspected - the upper trusses were covered with cloth - I have not the least doubt but what I saw was her hay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to swear that it was her's - A. By no means.</p>

I observed the tract of a narrow-wheeled cart going in and out of the gate. I traced it about one hundred yards into the road - there is a paddock there, in which I found a quantity of lead, such as I had lost.

            . I was convicted last Sessions of this robbery. On the morning of the 6th of March I was apprehended at Brentford, with a quantity of lead. I got it from Mr. Dickason - the three prisoners were with me. I took my cart into Mr. Dickason's meadow, and they all put the lead into the cart. Grimshaw was with them - a cistern, a pump, and some more lead were put into the cart - there was more than I wished to take - the prisoners said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you bring such a horse and cart as not to be able to take so much;" - I said, I had a great mind to shoot it all out, and have nothing more to do with it. I had met them at the Swan public-house, at Isleworth, on the 5th. I had the cart from Wasley, at Isleworth, and went straight to the prisoners. I was stopped at Old Brentford with the lead - neither of them would go with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030066"/>you been tried before this last business - A. Once; and was imprisoned eight or nine months. I have told the truth for my own sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that if you swore against them you would get off very light - A. Yes; Mr. Thackey said, if I would tell who robbed the premises, I should be free.</p>
               <p>Q. It was from no motive of repentance or the love of justice, but to free yourself - A. I had repentance; I gave information a few days after I was convicted myself.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You have received your punishment, and have no hope of any further favour; A. No; four men could hardly lift the cistern. I mentioned their names to Mr. Thackey - he said they were all desperate characters, and wished me to speak the truth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your house is the resort of the lower orders of people - A. Yes; they were drinking and amusing themselves. I never remember seeing them together before - one Wasley, who has absconded, was in their company.</p>

            . On the evening of the 5th of March I was at the Red Lion; the prosecutor and Grimshaw came there; they had two pots of beer, and there was a good deal of whispering; they might stay there an hour and a half, and went away towards Mr. Dickason's estate; the Duke's Head public house is in that direction. I went from there to Lady Baroness Howe's premises, and laid down under the lean-too of a cow-house to sleep; this is half a mile from Mr. Dickason's; and about three o'clock in the morning; Somerset came and awoke me, and wanted to know why I lay there; he said there was a warmer place further on; and in the morning I found him, Grimshaw, and Coultman, all laying in a place where they cut chaff. When they left the Red Lion Somerset was not with them; they said they were to meet him by the Duke's Head public-house, and if I saw him I was to tell him they were waiting there. For a quarter of an hour before I went away they were cleaning each others clothes, which were very dirty with cobwebs, as if they had been lifting something. When they went from the barn Grimshaw said,</p>
               <p>"Be d - d if it will do to go all one way." He and Somerset went over the fields at the back of Twickenham to come in at the end of Cross-street and meet the other two. Coltman went over the footpath towards his mother's to breakfast; it was then about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Somerset awake you - A. Yes; and told me to go to a place where I found the others in the morning. I noticed their jackets; they appeared as as if they had been lifting something; Taylor was not there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How far were they from their homes - A. About a quarter of a mile; I had been at work, and had no lodgings; I came to apply to the parish for relief, but could get none that night.</p>

Somerset said</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what have you Isleworth chaps been at." I said the wooden legged cobbler's horse and cart was stopped at Brentford with lead in it, and the man who was in it jumped out and ran away.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 20th of April, about one o'clock I was coming through Smithfield and saw the prisoners - they followed a gentleman up Cloth-fair into Long-lane - I saw Neal take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket and give it to Greenwood, who put it into his breast - I seized them, and took it from Greenwood's breast - Newton ran after the gentleman but he would have nothing to do with it.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of April I was on duty; and as I went my rounds, my attention was directed to the shop of Mr. Richardson, a fishmonger, nearly at the top of Fleet-market, I found the door open, and, upon going in, I found two young men there. I went in, and asked what they did there - one ran away, and the other who was the prisoner, remained: as soon as I got inside, he shut the door, and struck me with his fist - I returned the blow, and was knocked down - I got up, and he took up a crow-bar which laid on the ground, and struck me with it; but before that, he said he would serve me out, and would do for me; he took this crow-bar (producing it,) and struck me with it on the head and arm - he struck me with it as I was against the wall; I happened to have a thick hat on, which stopped a good many of the blows, but I received one on the head about two inches long - my hat was off at that time. I received a blow on my arm by putting it up to defend my head; he used but one hand, and struck in this way (beating with it.) I received a wound on my arm, not quite an inch long - I was obliged to go to the hospital, and remained there a month and three days; my head was entirely all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. On recovering yourself, what did you do - A. I asked him for mercy - he told me to sit on the block, and if I moved, it would be worse for me. He ran away - I followed his out, and sprung my rattle, and kept him in sight till he turned the corner of Stonecutter-street. Four or five more watchmen came to my assistance, and in four or five minutes he was brought to me - I knew him again - I caught sight of him as soon as I turned the corner of Stonecutter-street - nobody but him was running before me - he was stopped just by Robin-hood-court, Shoe-lane, by a watchman of St. Andrew's. I examined the fishmonger's shop, and found the crow-bar there. I felt the effects of my wound in about an hour, and went to the hospital about six o'clock that morning. I was ordered to bed, and my head dressed - I felt great inconvenience from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did it happen - 
               <persName id="t18240603-197-person1695">A. </persName>
            At a quarter or twenty minutes before five o'clock - he shut the door upon me - they were both in the shop when the door was shut - I was alarmed very much, but did not lose my recollection - there was no light there - it was daylight; the back door was open, and I had plenty of light; I saw him take the crow-bar off the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you were possessed of your senses sufficiently to know the manner in which he struck you - A. Yes; he struck me with one hand, and the sharp end of the crow-bar turned towards my head - the dresser of the hospital saw me about five minutes after I got there; I attended before the Alderman the second day after it happened.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We understood you to say that you saw two men, one ran away and the other stopped in - A. Yes, my Lord - he went away directly after the door was shut; I and the prisoner were then left alone; I saw no marks of violence on the door; the lock had been sprung; the crow-bar did not appear to me to have been used to get in with.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does any body sleep in the shop - A. No; I left about ten o'clock at night, and did not hear of this till Monday.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 26th of April I had occasion to go to see a quantity of lead on the premises of Messrs. Walker and Maltby, in the Commercial-road, Westminster - there was about 800 lbs. weight. On the 27th I obtained a search-warrant, and took it away. I went to the prisoner - he lives in Strutton-ground, Westminster, at the bottom of Orchard-street. I asked him if he had sold any lead to Messrs. Walker and Co. - he said he had - he could not be particular as to the weight, but it was about 8 cwt. I asked where he got it; he said from his houses in Shoe-lane, which were repairing. I ordered him to attend the Magistrate, which he did on the 27th, and again on the 4th of May. I afterwards met him at Shoe-lane on the 30th of April - I had examined the house in Shoe-lane on the 27th of April; it was a tiled roof, and part of this lead came from a slated roof; I did not compare it with that roof, being satisfied that it could not come from there. I told him so, and he then said he had more houses in Strutton-ground, Westminster, and wished one of us to attend there with him, which my brother officer did. I went to Mr. Copeland's house, in Regent-street, on the 29th, and examined that roof with Green, and one Mason, who had the key of it. I took about 1 cwt. of the lead with me - I took part of it up, and compared it with the parts of lead, which remained on the roof, and it fitted as near as old lead could fit; it had been knocked about a good deal, and would not fit entirely without beating out, but it fitted the nail holes and the marks on the tiles as near as could be; it fitted in three places particularly - the thickness exactly corresponded; it had been torn off from the roof; most of the roof had been stripped, and the hips also. Some portion of it had been left on the roof; my belief is that it had come from there; I should suppose about 2 cwt. had been stolen from that house. I found some lead in the watch-house at Westminster, and got the watchman to bring it to Mr. Copeland's house, but that was different. The prisoner attended at the office on the 4th of May, voluntarily, and a person of the name of Coney with him, who he said was his plumber.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have looked at a book, have you put down there what Mr. Gamble said - A. No; I have put down dates, but not the conversation - I have put down that Gamble said he had sold the lead, and that it came from his house in Shoe-lane - I wrote this as near the time as possible. I did not warn him to be cautious what he said. I could trust to my memory, because there was so little passed except his appointing to go to Strutton-ground. I have a complete recollection of what passed; he said he had had it at Strutton-ground for some time.</p>

            . I accompanied Mitchell to the prisoner's house at Strutton-ground. Mitchell asked him if he had sold any lead over the water to Walker and Co? he said he had - Mitchell then said he had seized it - that he was an officer, and suspected it was stolen - he asked, where he had got it from; - he replied, from his houses in Shoe-lane; that he had been repairing them, and this was the old lead from them - he told him he was ordered to attend the Magistrate's on the day following, which he did - he said he had had it in his cellar for some time - his house is about a quarter of a mile from the house which had been robbed - he attended the Magistrate's the next day, and we went to Shoe-lane and examined the roof; but the lead had not the least appearance of being taken from there - there was no appearance of any new lead; it appeared to have been there for two years - we examined the house in Regent-street - the lead had every appearance of having been taken from there - there might be about one hundred weight of the lead which we had with us taken from that house - it fixed itself on the roof in two or three places-particularly - it fitted as to the nail holes in the sides - we compared it very attentively, and the result is upon a fair examination - that I believe it was the identical lead stolen from that house - Gamble was not with us. I told him I considered that I knew where the lead came from, and that it was impossible it could come from his premises in Shoe-lane - he attended again on the 4th of May, and was then committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He attended after you told him you considered you knew where the lead had come from - was Mitchel with you when you went on this business - A. Yes; most times - he was there when this conversation passed - we did not take any lead to the house in Shoe-lane - the lead there seemed to have been on two years more or less - I don't swear positively; but I think so - it had an old appearance - it is only a mere vague guess. Gamble said it had come from his houses in Shoe-lane - he did not say that he took it from there; but it had come from there - he said afterwards that he had other houses in Strutton-ground - I saw Coney at Shoe-lane - he lives next door to Gamble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much of the lead you had with you fitted the roof of the house in Regent-street - A. About 1 cwt.; the whole quantity gone seemed to be 2 cwt.; it appeared to have come from a slated roof - and from the colour it appeared to have been there about the same time.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in the yard of Messrs. Bennet and Co. Horse-ferry-road, Westminster - the key of the prosecutor's house was in our office - it was then unoccupied, and had been so for some time - the witnesses came to our office for the key. I accompanied them to search the house - we found the ridge, the hips, and the dormer door had been stripped of their lead - the officers produced some and compared it with the ridge of three pieces; one on the ridge of one on each hip fitted the nail holes - where it went down on the slates it corresponded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030070"/>with the pieces left as near as old lead possibly could do; it fitted exactly; it was of the same thickness - flatted lead is sold at so many pounds to the square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean that it fitted exactly - A. I mean it fitted as near as old lead could, because it had been rolled up; we flatted it out a little at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a single piece that you will swear came from that dwelling - A. Yes; it fitted the nail holes exactly, and the places too. I compared one small piece on the bottom of the hip which was left on, and it fitted to this piece exactly - it was about eighteen inches long.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Walker and Co., they are lead-merchants, and live in Southwark. We received some lead from the prisoner, which was taken afterwards by the officers; there was 8 cwt., 13 lb., it came in butter baskets, on the 26th of April, in a cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the value of old lead - A. Twenty shilling per cwt.; it was paid for in the counting-house, in Thames-street; I gave a receipt for the quantity, but do not know what money was paid for it; it was brought about eleven o'clock in the morning; in open day. I do not know who drove the cart, but Mr. Gamble accompanied it - there was nothing suspicious about it; I should have had no objection to take it - we do not often buy lead of butter merchants, but I understood he was in the building way, and did not ask where it came from.</p>

Mr. Coney came to ask the young man one Sunday evening to take some lead for him on the next morning; my master was not at home; he came again next morning, and asked my master to take it; my master refused, and said he did not like taking it, but at last he did, and the cart came about nine or ten o'clock. My master came back soon after the cart went away; I did not see him give Coney any money or paper. There were some butter baskets in the cart; Coney has some, because his son deals in eggs. I believe the same sort of baskets are used for both. I never saw any lead in my master's cellar in my life. There is no communication from Mr. Coney's cellar to ours that I know of.</p>

I saw a waggon driven by the prisoner; it was about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, and quite day-light. We had dined; I was perfectly sober; I had not had more than two glasses of wine. It was a broad wheeled waggon and seven horses; both that and my gig were going from London. I attempted to pass the waggon on the near side, in order to avoid the dust; there was sufficient room for it. I had passed the waggon and the shaft horses without any inconvenience; there was abundant room for me to pass. I think the prisoner is the man who drove the horses. He touched the leaders with the whip, and drew them across the road; he was on the near side, where he ought to be; this prevented my passing him on the near side. The gig was then so near him, that he must have seen it; and he turned round and looked at us before he 
               <persName id="t18240603-203-person1737">drew</persName>
             the horses towards him. I immediately pulled up and let the waggon pass, and then went round on the off side. I had again passed the waggon, and he then laid his whip on the horses lengthways, and they then crossed the road, in consequence of which I could not pass on that side, and the gig got entangled with the waggon, and was dragged half the length of this Court before it was overturned. The driver did not make any attempt to stop the horses, but persevered in going on. I believe some of the leaders were in a trot in consequence of being flogged. Somebody behind hallooed to him to stop. I should conceive that he must have heard the call to stop as well as me, but he never attempted to stop the horses. I believe he did turn round, but cannot be positive. I am positive that he did not stop, or attempt to stop. The gig, which was very strong and heavy, went over; I was thrown under the waggon, the wheel went over my hat. I can not tell how I escaped. I could not see in what direction Ruth M'Koul fell. The moment I saw her she was lying quite flat, and the two wheels I suppose had gone over her head; she must have died momentarily, as the waggon was loaded. The driver did not stop, nor take the least notice any more than if he had gone over a rat. There was a person with him, who, I believe, at the time of the accident, was in the waggon. I understand the prisoner is the guard, not the waggoner. I staid by the deceased, and did not see the waggon any more on that evening. I saw him on the Friday following, (the accident was on the Wednesday.) I had not the means of discovering whether he was at all the worse for liquor. The person in the waggon did not get down or stop, but went on with the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. What distance were you from your house - A. About seven miles; I had dined with Mrs. M'Koul in London, but not at a party. I was perfectly sober.</p>

I think the road is wide enough for three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030071"/>waggons; it was my duty to go on the right side of the waggon, but I went on the left to avoid the dust. The wind was blowing from south to north upon the lady. I was on the driving side. The distance of the foot-path from my gig, when I had passed the waggon was, I believe, about a foot; the driver was then at his leading horses. He touched them gently, and I stopped and went round on the other side. There was a sandman examined by the Coroner; I do not know whether he was the man who called out to stop. There was a man before, who did not interfere at all. Nobody said,</p>

            . I am the guard to Mr. Jones's waggon. I was on the road at the time of this business. I was walking along with our waggon. I saw the waggon which occasioned the accident. The prisoner is the man who was driving the horses; I was behind it. There was a sand cart between their waggon and ours. I saw the gig with the lady and gentleman in it behind the waggon. It attempted to pass on the near side, and had run up as far as the horses, and there pulled up; I did not see what prevented its passing; it then drove round on the right side, and went as far as the horses. I could not see any further than there. I saw the gig turned over; it went a little way, I believe, before it turned over; it was entangled with the chains. I believe the waggon was very handy on the near side of the road; they were likely to get into the ditch. The horses were very much on the near side. I could not see what stopped the horses; they then came on the off side, and the gig turned over. I did not see the driver whip either of them; I was not near enough for that. I did not call, but ran as fast as I could. I was pretty near two hundred yards behind the waggon when I began to run. I could not see the gig entangled, but as soon as it had turned over I ran. I had not called to any person. When I got up the waggon-wheel had gone over the lady's head, and she was dead. The waggoner was in the waggon, or up at the head of it; the guard was driving; they did not stop, but were a good way on. The gentleman was coming back; I stopped and lifted up the lady. The waggon was gone on a goodish step, but the horses were only walking at a smart pace. After I had lifted the lady up, I remained there to carry her to a public-house. I saw the waggoner get off the shafts just after the lady had been killed; he was not then more than the length of this Court from me; he went up to the horses; I could not see whether either of them looked behind, but they did not stop. There was room enough for three waggons to pass between the waggon and the off side of the road. The dust was flying from the left. I did not see the waggoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. When this poor woman met her death, she was on the off side of the waggon - A. Yes; I don't know whether the driver knew what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner on the proper side of his horses, and driving at a proper rate - A. Yes; it did not strike me he was trotting or driving his horses fast.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man driving the gig had done his duty, could he have got entangled with the chains - A. No; there was room enough for him to have got out of the way; I think room for three waggons to pass. I think there was great fault in the man's driving. I did not see whether he directed his couse towards the waggon, or whether he used his whip. If any body had called to the waggoner I must have heard it. I could not judge whether Mr. Perno was sober or not. Our waggon stopped at the public-house. When he passed me he was on the off side, and the dust blew in the lady's face.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PULMAN. I live at Kew, and am a carpenter. I was on the road coming to meet them; the first thing I observed was, when the gig was on the off side of the waggon; I then saw the waggon drawn up very near the ditch, on the proper side, the gentleman appeared to be passing, and the man driving the waggon called the horses very near the ditch; when the gig had passed the waggon and the shaft horses, on the other side the horses turned square round, brought the gig round square, and the wheels getting entangled, occasioned it to be turned over; the lady was thrown under the waggon; it might have been dragged a little distance, but I did not notice that - I saw it turned over; the waggon had been drawn near the ditch, but it was then keeping off the ditch, and I suppose it was to keep it from the ditch that the driver had put the horses off; they went off in a slanting direction; I made as much haste as possible to the spot to assist; the driver and his companion went directly on; the horses quickened their pace; I did not call after them, but went as fast as possible to the deceased - she was quite dead; Mr. Perno had got up by that time. I saw the man who drove the waggon - it was the guard; the waggoner was sitting on the shafts with his face towards the ditch; I believe he could not see the accident; the forwardest of the waggon-horses were about a yard from the centre of the road when it happened, I think about a yard beyond the centre of the road, and a considerable distance from the ditch; the gig was pretty near the waggon, and Mr. Perno must have turned out of the road to have got away from it; I considered that it happened by his pulling the right-hand rein very tight, to get past the waggon on the road. I did not see the prisoner or the waggon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Might not the waggon-driver have done all this mischief, and yet not have been conscious of it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there would have been no blame attached to his going on; there was a ditch about three feet deep on the near side, and the horses crossing the road was to get away from the ditch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was ample room on the off side for the gig to pass - A. Yes; when I saw it, the gig was crossing the road, and the off wheel of the waggon overturned it. I saw no effort on the part of the driver to whip or hurry his horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you think the driver must have seen that the horses were entangled - A. Yes; he did not stop. I did not notice whether he whipped his horses or not.</p>

            . I sell sand and live at Egham. I was behind the waggon; my horse was close to it. I saw the gig with the gentleman and lady come on the near side of me; there was room enough then for the gig to pass on that side without touching the wheels of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030072"/>waggon. I saw the horses of the waggon drawn towards the driver. I cannot say how that was, for I did not see the driver do anything to make them draw that way; I was near enough, but did not see him touch the horses; that prevented the gig going along, though it had passed the body of the waggon. Mr. Penro stopped his horse, and the waggon passed the gig; I stopped my horse; there was space enough for Mr. Perno to pass, he did pass; and went on the right side; I did not see what happened then, as I was behind the waggon; I saw the gig on the near side of the waggon, but not when it got on the off side, till it was turned over; when I got up the lady was dead. I did not call to them to stop, nor did I hear any one call to them; they were then gone on about five yards from the spot where the body was laid; they went on to Belfont, I overtook them before they got there, and told the waggoner (not the prisoner) that the waggon had passed over the lady; they did not stop; the waggoner said he would not go back, he could not bear to see such a thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the horses entangled together before you got up - A. No; I did not hear the gentleman use any improper words to the driver.</p>

            . I have travelled with this waggon and the prisoner a good while; he drives steadily and carefully, and would not wilfully take away a fellow-creature's life, quite the contrary; I was at the head of the waggon at the time; I saw the horses entangled, and called to him to stop the horses, and he tried to stop them, but this gentleman kept driving his horse upon our horses, so that they would not stop; I was getting down, and almost run over, I was so frightened; I hallooed six or seven times as loud as I could; the gig kept running against them, which made them go the faster, that is as true as I stand here; the horses were out of the road, on some stone heaps near the ditch, and this gentleman kept driving upon them; there were only two wheels of the waggon in the road, the others were on the stone heaps; he came quite across the road to run against us; I said</p>

               <p>"What are you doing?" as loud as I could; I am certainly sure of it, every body must have heard me; there was all the road for him, but he came there on purpose to do us an injury, and almost overturned the waggon; he might have gone by it if he pleased; there was nothing to hinder him - he had got past four horses, upon my oath; I told Cooper that the man was in fault, and attempted to injure my horses.</p>

In January last the prisoner was in my employ, and had been so for three or four years - he left me on the 7th or 8th of January. He handed me over his cash-book some days afterwards. He <rs id="t18240603-204-deflabel1064" type="occupation">had the management of the butcher's-shop</rs>

I saw an order entered in the book from Mr. Charlton, on the 3d of January, and I think it was for three quarters of a hundred weight of beef; he probably ordered it of me, and of Birket also. On Monday, the 5th, or Tuesday, the 6th of January I asked the prisoner if the Leander's bill was paid; he said No - here is an entry of it in his writing in the day-book, but there is no credit given for it in the cash-book. In consequence of what he said I wrote down to the North.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he leave you, and open a shop in the neighbourhood - A. Yes; he was a clever man in business. He remained with me till the Wednesday after, as Law, who succeeded him, requested he might be there; he had a bed-room in my house, but had not slept there for some time - my son slept with him; he did not enter it for several days afterwards - I did not know for a fortnight or three weeks after, that Mr. Charlton had paid him. He did not tell me at the door of the Green Dragon, that 7 l. 10 s. of it was his own, and he would give me the remainder, when I let him have a cistern and some other things belonging to him. There are some other things belonging to him, but I do not know what they are. He said</p>
               <p>"Will it suit you to have a settlement with me to-day, for I am a small trifle in your debt, having received Captain Charlton's money."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it after he was gone, before he said that - A. A few days afterwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030073"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you several account-books - A. Yes; a cash-book, and several others. The whole of the items are in Birket's own writing - the book is made up to the 3d of January, at which time I appear to be a debtor to him 7 l. 6 s. 9 d., and at that time he gave me up his books, except his private cash-book; this account was always in my possession. I cannot tell exactly when it was made up. I have never said that he was great annoyance to me, and if I could remove him I would, nor anything to that effect; or that he has taken several of my customers away. He had managed my business for some years, but I did not then know of his conduct. I never said that I would have him hanged for signing a receipt - I cannot tell how long it was before I knew this money had been received; it must have been about three weeks. I wrote to Captain Charlton, and he wrote to say he should be in town in a few days. I think it must have been in February.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When Captain Charlton arrived, did you charge the prisoner with this - A. Yes; he could have had his things at any time if he had sent for them. The amount of Captain Charlton's bill was 8 l. 6 s. 9 d. Birket has made a balance due to him of 7 l. 6 s. 9 d., admitting this cash-book to be correct, but it is incorrect; there is a balance due to me; it has been examined by an accountant. I do not know when the prisoner made it up. He took this book away with him, but he let me have it again after some time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner cease to be your servant - A. His week ended on Saturday; he was hired by the week, and paid by the week.</p>

            . I dealt with Mr. Battershy, and knew the prisoner. I was in the River in January last, and went to get three quarters of a hundred weight of beef - I ordered it on Saturday, but did not take it till Sunday, the 4th of January. I do not think I saw Birket at all on Saturday, but I saw him on Sunday, when the other man called him down to cut the beef for me; he cut it out, made the bill, and gave it to me. I went down to the ship with it, and in the afternoon I came to the house next door to Mr. Battersby's, and gave Birket a 5 l. Bank note, and four sovereigns - he gave me change. When Birket was called to cut the beef he came from the next door, the public-house.</p>

On the 21st of May, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner coming out of the passage leading to the stables - the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030074"/>was only latched. I knew him as a tenant of my master's; his premises are at the back of my master's; but he had no business there - he had a right to pass the passage, but not to go into my master's back premises - when he came out he had a truss of hay on his shoulder. I followed him down the New Road, leading to Battle-bridge - he then turned down a place, and pitched the hay. I asked him what he was going to do it - he said he was going to take it to Russell-square, which is quite in a contrary direction. I asked him where he had got it - he said, it was sent him from over the water. I wanted him to bring it back to my master, which he refused to do - he wanted me to go with him and have something to drink, and hush the matter up, and say nothing about it. I told him that I believed it to be my master's hay. I went and examined the place, and there was a vacancy as if a truss of hay had been taken - it appeared to be the same hay, though we did not take it to compare it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner a lodger of your master's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he to go through a part of your premises - A. Yes; but he had no occasion to go through my master's stable or slaughter-house to go to his apartments - he had access to these premises, but had no business there. I went before the Magistrates and told the same tale there to the best of my recollection. I was not asked to swear to the hay - there is a great similarity in it; when the prisoner came out, I followed him two or there hundred yards - he was walking. I wanted to see where he went to - he pitched the hay, but did not sit down upon it - when I accosted him, he said he was going to take it to Russell-square, but he was going towards Battle-bridge; he said he had it from one Jeffries over the water.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he any business whatever in the passage - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could I get into the kitchen without going through the passage - A. Yes; there was a way through your own room.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Tottenham-court-road - the prisoner rented a shop and parlour of a house of mine in Warren-street - there is a shop-door and a private passage - he has nothing to do with the passage whatever; in consequence of information I went to Warren-street, and found my man and the prisoner with the hay - he appeared much agitated or very drunk; I cannot say which. I said</p>
               <p>"Hickman, I am afraid you have been at this a long while, and other things as well." He said</p>
               <p>"No; I have not." I said,</p>
               <p>"It appears pretty clear, and I shall give you in charge." He said he had had it from a friend. I went to the stable and missed a truss of hay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he behind in his rent - A. I believe he was a week or two behind. I sent him word that if he did not pay better I must seize, and then he paid better.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you not seized his goods since he has been in custody, and turned his wife and seven children out - A. He owed me a bill of 4 l. besides for meat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man of the name of Jeffries came to my house, and I said I wanted a truss of hay for my children to sleep upon, and he sent one. I had it two or three months; my mistress had been confined, and had not an opportunity of making a mattress to put it in for the children to sleep upon - she then said she thought it would not do, and I was going to Russell-mews to sell it, when I was stopped by Sanders.</p>

            . The prisoner came to lodge in my master's house; on the 22d of May, he was to pay 9 d. for his lodging. I slept in the next room to his; my boots were by the side of my bed, and the coat on a chair. I got up about half-past six o'clock; he got up about half-past seven; directly he went away I went up and missed them, and a sheet was gone from the bed I slept in - he never came to the house again, but was taken in about a fortnight. I have not seen the property since.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 2d of June the prisoner came to the office, and inquired for an officer of the name of Godfrey, and asked what time we left Shoreditch, and said he wanted to speak privately to us. He then said that a lodger had stolen a coat, a pair of boots, and a sheet - and then said,</p>
               <p>"I am the person. I have sold the coat for 8 s., the boots for 4 s., and the sheet for 3 s." I asked him why he did it - he said through distress - and he gave himself up, because he expected to be taken, for he had been at Worship-street a short time before.</p>

            . I am a newsman - I was returning from town on the 12th of April, a little before eight o'clock, in a cart, to my residence at Knightsbridge - I saw the prisoner - he crossed the road and followed the cart three or four yards, and then took out the three boxes - the moon was quite bright - I saw him plainly - I told Mr. and Mrs. Blake, who were in the cart, of their loss - he put the box under his arm, and walked away with them - I pursued him as far as the Duke of Gloucester, public-house, which is about 200 yards - when I came up with him I said,</p>
               <p>"These boxes don't belong to you" - he said they did. I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you step into the public-house" - he said Yes; but he dropped them at the door and ran away; I did not pursue him, but he was brought back to me about five minutes afterwards; and I swear that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you loose sight of him at all - A. Yes; I lost sight of him while he ran about two hundred yards - there were three persons in the cart, but none of them observed him - I took him to the public-house - he remained in the back parlour alone while the officer was gone for - I had seen him when he crossed me to go to the cart - it was dusk, but the moon was full - he was out of my sight for a short time; but I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was in Piccadilly on the 23d of April; about three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the two prisoners on the opposite side of the way in conversation with each other. Low had something on his shoulder; from their manner I suspected something wrong; they went into the Green-park, and when they came to one of the benches they laid it down to rest; I went up and turned up the corner of the canvass and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" It was about 80 lbs. of lead; they made no reply; I took them into custody, and put them in the watch-house, and then went down Piccadilly and saw Condon, who went with me to the watch-house and saw the lead.</p>

            . I live with Messrs.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to Messrs. Walker and Maltby, Commercial-road, Lambeth, and took some lead from there; there were 813 lbs. - I got it from the foreman, Bolland, on the 26th of April; I went to the prisoner on the same day, and saw him at his house in Strutton-ground - I asked if he had sold a quantity of lead to Messrs. Walker and Co - he said he had, about eight cwt., but could not exactly tell the weight of it. I asked where he got it - he said from his houses in Shoe-lane. I ordered him to attend the Magistrate the next day, and he did so; he said his houses in Shoe-lane had been under repair, and the lead had come from there. On the 29th of April, I took some of the lead to the house of Mr. Storr, at the corner of <placeName id="t18240603-216-crimeloc1124">New-street, Westminster</placeName>

I went to the top of the house, and found the tops of the three dormers or garrets stripped of their lead; they have windows that project out, and they are covered with lead; I took some of the lead in my possession to the top of the house, and found part of it to fit one of the tops of the garret windows; it consisted of three pieces, and they made a complete covering for that dormer; a nail left in the lead exactly fitted a nail-hole in the top of the dormer; and a nail on the dormer exactly fitted a nail-hole in the lead; there was no nail-hole but what fitted; I found the wood of a sink in the wash-house, and a piece of lead I had fitted it; the lead of that sink was missing; the pipe from the water-butt was gone; I had two pieces of lead with me which corresponded with the size of the pipe; the wash-house had been recently white-washed, and the pipe I had was white-washed; this lead had been torn away; part on the dormer had been cut into three pieces to get it off the top, and there were the nails where it was torn off. On the 30th I saw Gamble and Coney at Shoe-lane; Coney is a plumber, who lives next door to Gamble - they took me to the top of a house to point out where the lead had come from; I did not see any place where such lead had come from; Gamble said, then it must have come from his house in Strutton-ground; he had not on the former occasion said any thing about houses in Srutton-ground; I made an appointment to meet him next day to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030077"/>look at his house there; my brother officer examined the house in Strutton-ground.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Did you find Mr. Gamble to be a man who keeps a respectable shop, and likely to have many houses - A. Yes; I have heard since that he had been a warrant officer in the navy; my first question was, whether he had taken any lead to Messrs. Walker and Co.; he said he had, but did not say for whom, but from his houses in Shoe-lane; and when he and Coney went there, he also mentioned about houses in Strutton-ground; his plumber went with him to point out where the lead had come from; but he did not state that the lead had come from him; Coney was supposed to be his plumber, and that he could show best where it had come from; he is his brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What weight of lead might there have been taken from Storr's house - A. From two to three cwt.; the whole of the lead was torn from the dormer tops - when we went to Shoe-lane he said he had been repairing that house, and pointed out the gutters - I said it was not gutter lead that I had got; but there was no part of the house from which it was possible that it could have been taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went over the water to the prisoner, and asked him if he had sold some lead to Walker and Maltby, as they had got some which I suspected to be stolen; he said he had sold about 8 cwt. Mitchel asked where he got it from, he said from his house in Shoe-lane, and he had had it in his cellar in Strutton-ground for sometime; he was ordered to attend the Magistrates next day, which he did; we afterwards met him at Shoe-lane to point out the place where it had come from. I was on the roof, and told him I could see no part that appeared to have been lately new leaded; he said I might say so if I pleased. There are no dormers, nor did I see any place from which it could have come. I afterwards discovered that the prosecutors house had been stripped; all the lead taken from the three dormers; the lead taken there exactly fitted with the dormers, cistern, or sink, and the pipe. I examined the dormers particularly, and can speak with certainty of them. In the middle dormer there was a narrow piece gone about six inches wide, that we could not find; the others were completely covered with the lead we brought; and as far as we could conscientiously and honestly judge, it had come from there; we went into the kitchen, and the lead exactly fitted the cistern and pipe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mitchel with you during all the conversations with Gamble - A. I believe he was, and Gamble's wife was there, and I believe there might be somebody else, but I cannot say who, or whether they heard the conversation - he attended the office according to his promise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you fit the lead on the dormers particularly - A. Yes; and there were several nail holes that exactly fitted; there was one nail in the lead which fitted a hole on the dormer exactly; there was another which had remained on the top of the dormer.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Walker and Co. I received this 8 cwt of lead from the prisoner on the 26th of April; it came in a cart in baskets, such as butter dealers use. I believe twenty-one shillings per cwt. was paid for it, but I did not pay it. I have seen Mr. Gamble before, but had no acquaintance with him. It was brought about eleven o'clock in the morning, and taken away by the officers afterwards.</p>

I delivered the lead myself, but did not notice what it came to; the clerk gave me the order to receive the money; I came out and gave it to Coney's servant to receive the money.</p>

            . I am a plumber. I live at No. 273, Strand, and No. 50, Strutton-ground. I am the prisoner's wife's brother. I had been doing some plumbing work for him in Shoe-lane; he lives in Strutton-ground. In April last I made application to him about some lead. I had sent down a lot of lead from the house in Shoe-lane, with some wood to burn; and I had also bought a lot of lead of a man named Turpin, who keeps a broker's shop in Peter-street, Westminster. Not having conveyance myself to carry it to Walker and Maltby's, and as I was then indebted a trifle to them, I asked Gamble to take it in his cart, and I would lend him mine in the mean time; he objected to it; I dont know why he objected, but his wife however prevailed upon him - this was on the Monday morning. It was then taken in some baskets to Mr. Gamble's stable; he went with it himself, and my boy

             with him. My wife received the money for it. My reason for asking him to take it was this - I was about changing some lead for my own use some time before, and sent some lead to Walker's and Co. to make up a quantity, and it was stopped by some officers, who asked what I had got in the cart, and I was ordered to attend at the Thames Police Office for it; and if I had taken it, the officers might have stopped me, as I had been up to the office once before; and as I owed Messrs. Walker and Co. 6 l., and could not spare the money just then. I begged of him to take it; he had nothing to do with it but to carry it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you here yesterday - A. No; I was not here yesterday when my brother was tried. I had to go to Pentonville, and I went; and it was understood from the solicitor that my attendance was not necessary. I came to see if I should be wanted - he was tried for stealing a part of the same lead. I had told the attorney that I would give any evidence, but I left the place and went to Islington before the trial was over. I attended at the Thames Police Office; I did not give the same account there. I was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sworn by the Magistrates to tell the truth - A. No; they asked me to swear to the lead, and I said I could not - it was the same lead that was then inquired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030078"/>about; but they only asked me if I could swear to the lead. I was not called upon to account for my brother's possession of the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you not tell the Magistrate that the lead in question was taken from a house in Shoe-lane - A. I did not, Sir; I was not asked the question. I went to Shoe-lane with the officers to point out where part of the lead came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you had not told the Magistrate that it came from there, how came you to go to Shoe-lane. A. I had not told them; but Mr. Gamble had told them that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you bought part of the lead of a man in Westminster - A. No; I said I sent some old lead and some wood to Westminster; and that lead, with some I took from No. 7, Shoe-lane, was what Mr. Gamble took for me. I pointed out to the officers where a quantity of lead came from on that house - it was sent to Mr. Gamble's on the 26th - it was put in the baskets on the same day, and sent to Messrs. Walker and Co. - it could not have been in his stables for some days before, nor any part of it. I think the money received for the lead was seven or eight pounds; but I cannot, nor will not, swear it. I had a returned bill of about fifteen pounds the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no bill of parcels of the lead - A. There might have been one, but I never saw it - the boy is here, and can tell you more than I can; it was signed in Messrs. Walker and Co.'s books.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you again solemnly affirm that you did not tell the Magistrates that she lead came from the house in Shoe-lane - A. No; I did not; they asked if I could swear to any part of the lead, and I said I could not.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What part of the house in Shoe-lane did you point out to the officers - A. I pointed out a quantity of new lead that had been laid in a gutter, and a quantity from a dormer window that had been replaced with slates - it had been taken away by my man, and sent to Westminster. I superintended the work, and know that it was done. I could not swear to the lead when I saw it; it is impossible, when lead is taken, by other persons, to swear where it came from, unless it was re-laid. I know of no lead from a cistern or a pipe; but I have no doubt the whole of it was in my possession, as I bought a quantity. I had no idea of its being stolen. I got the cistern lead, and pipe, from Turpin; he brought it in a barrow. I did not tell the Magistrates I knew of that lead, because I could not safely swear to it. I knew Gamble was charged with having lead in his possession; but I did not notice the sink; there was a quantity of lead.</p>

            . I have lived with Mr. Gamble eleven months. I see the cellar several times every day - there never was any lead there; if there had I must have seen it. Mr. Coney's house is next door; but there is no private way of getting there, without you get over the wall. I heard my master say to his wife,</p>
               <p>"Coney wants me to take some lead; I don't like it; but being one of your family I suppose I must do it, or the whole fat will be in the fire." I did not see the lead come in the morning, but I saw the cart waiting for it. I have now left Mr. Gamble's; Mr. Coney engaged me yesterday after I had been here. I was Gamble's servant yesterday, but I am not now. I believe Mr. Coney keeps a horse and cart such as plumber's use. Coney first asked for the cart on Sunday evening, the 26th of April.</p>

On the morning of the 2d of June, having been rather restless in the night, I went into a room which overlooks the river, and saw a vessel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030079"/>come into the wharf. I then looked on the wharf, and saw the prisoner with a pint pewter pot in his right hand, and a tube in his left. I saw him put this tube into a puncheon, and draw liquor out of it, and put it into the pint pot - he went to a dust-bin immediately opposite, and put the contests of the pot into something I did not know what - he then came back, did so a second time, and then put the bung in with his hand. I saw the liquor run into the pint; he then went on to the puncheons in the next tier near the dust-bin; I saw him draw some liquor from there, and put it into the dust-bin; the first puncheon was foreign Geneva. I believe it belonged to the Crown - the second was Geneva too - they both belonged to the Board of Excise. I left the window; and after going to my bed-room and dressing, I went down, and then found the prisoner in his watch-box on the premises, about ten yards from those puncheons. I called him; he came to me; and I inquired where the officer was who had charge of these spirits - he said his feet were swelled, and he had sent him to the lodge to rest himself. I sent him to the lodge, while I went to the dust-bin, and discovered two bladders, four glass, and one stone bottle, and a pint pewter pot. I asked the other officer if he had charge of these spirits - he said,</p>
               <p>"I have." I said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry you have broken your trust;" - he said the prisoner had told him, in consequence of his feet swelling, he might go down for half an hour, and he would take care of his charge. I then asked the prisoner how he could do so - he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake forgive me this time, and I will never do so any more." I put the pot and the other things into my premises, and communicated this to the officer who came in the morning to take possession of the place. I then went back with him into the wharf; this was about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were these seized spirits - A. Yes; they had been seized by the Crown; but I cannot say whether they had been tried and undergone a legal condemnation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does this distillery belong to the Excise - A. Yes; nobody else keeps anything in it to my knowledge. I could see that he had something under his arm when he was in East Smithfield; there are very few persons in the streets at that time in the morning. There is a boundary fence and a lodge; there is nobody there but the watchmen. I was up the yard when he went out.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 2d of June I was in Lower East Smithfield, with Howard and Stevenson, going towards the Excise distillery; the prisoner was coming towards me, in a direction from the distillery - he had a handkerchief, and something tied up in it; he passed me; I immediately turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer, what have you got there?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am an officer also; you have no business to stop me." I touched him, and felt something in the left breast pocket of his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"You must stop." I gave the parcel to Stevenson, who was with me. He said,</p>
               <p>"Take the things, and for God's sake let me go, it will be the ruin of me." I took him to the office - he said several times,</p>
               <p>"Let me go," and that he would give me all the money he had in his pocket. I searched him, and found bottles in his breast, a bottle in each side pocket of his coat, and three bottles in the handkerchief, containing altogether about three quarts of liquor. The bottles were wrapped up in a towel, and a night-cap and the handkerchief tied over all. I asked how he got them - he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me anything about them, but take them and let me go; you don't want to know my name, that is of no use to you." I 
               <persName id="t18240603-221-person1892">drew</persName>
             the cork, and said I thought it was whiskey - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is only British spirits." I found afterwards that it was Hollands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the necks of the bottles out of the handkerchief - A. No. He was about one hundred yards the Excise distillery. I was twice examined at the Police office; I did not then say so much as I have now - there was about two hours between the two examinations - the first was very short; the Magistrates asked me if I knew much about him - I said the other officer knew most. I had not ascertained then that these spirits were 2 per cent. lower than the bulk. When he said it was British spirits he might have told the truth for what I know.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Is it easy to reduce the strength of spirits - A. Yes; the officer said various causes would make a difference in the quality; changing it out of the bulk, or the beat of the sun, would make a difference.</p>

On the 2d of June I went to the office, and saw him sitting in a small room there - I asked what brought him there; he said the officer, for taking some gin from the distillery; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you been plundering the casks" - he said, No - it was stowed away in different parts of the yard, and he took it away. I told him I had but one duty to perform - I thought he was going to say something, but I did not hear him. I represented this to the board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not say he was going to take it to the Excise-office, and was stopped - A. No. He bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it ever happen that persons bring samples in these bottles, and they are left behind - A. Not that I ever saw or heard of. I am not acquainted with the nature and strength of spirits.</p>

            . I have tasted the contents of one of these bottles, and of one of the casks at the distillery, and compared them - they are of a similar quality; it is what we call foreign Geneva, condemned under the Revenue laws. I had tried the strength of the vats, and this sample also - the greatest variation was 2 1/2 per cent.; the lowest was 7-10ths of 1 per cent. lower than the lowest of the puncheons. The prisoner had access to seventy-nine puncheons, which were in the yard on the night of the 1st of June. The increase of the temperature would make a difference in the spirits; the better the spirits the weaker it appears. I consider that it had come from the puncheons, but was a little reduced in strength.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you tasted this in a public-house, should you have said it was the same quality - A. I do not know that I should. The spirits might have been got out by knocking out a bung; each vat is locked up by a spirit lock; he could get into the warehouse. We try the spirits by an hydrometer - I tried these spirits at the office at the same time, by pouring it into a tube. The temperature would not be the same in them as in the puncheons, because it would take two or three hours for them to get the same temperature.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could there have been 2 1/2 per cent. difference in the quality of the spirits and those in the casks, unless something had been put to them - A. Certainly not; I consider that water had been put to them.</p>

On the 4th of May I saw the two prisoners together - they asked me for a pin - I said I had not one, but I found one in my frock, and gave it to them. I had a basket, and some bread, tea, and sugar; my shawl blew up, and one of them said</p>
               <p>"Put the shawl on her;" the other did so, I thanked him, and then they ran after me and took it off, and ran down a gentleman's garden. I was crying for my shawl.</p>

               <p>Prisoner MUNT. Q. Did you see me take the shawl off your back - A. Both of them took it off - they were behind me.</p>

On the 9th of April the prisoner called at our shop, he was then dressed in a brown coat, a red handkerchief over his eyes, and a white apron; he looked out two tubs of butter, two sides of bacon, and a Cheshire cheese; the amount of the bill was 9 l. 12 s. 2 d. He said his name was William Hall, 10, North-street, City-road; there was to be 1 s. taken off for ready money, and I was to be there by half-past six o'clock, he wished to have them earlier; I was to have the money when I went; he was a stranger to me; Mr. Tipping was at home and saw him; the goods were delivered to Harrow, the carman - I gave him the direction, and told him to bring back all the goods or all the money; this was the prisoner's own proposal; I had taken the direction in writing, and made him spell it; I entered the goods in the name of Hall.</p>

               <p>"Young man, this is the house." I pulled the cart round, and gave him the goods; I think it was a green-grocer's shop; he took the two tubs of butter and put them in the passage; I gave him the cheese and the bacon, and they were taken into the cellar - he asked if I had got any thin cheese - I said No - he said he was sorry, as he looked three out - I said that was impossible, as he took the bill before he left the shop - he then asked if I had any objection to copper; I said No - he said some people had great objection to it - I said I had none, as I had the horse and cart - he said he dealt with many publicans who paid him in copper - he gave me eighteen papers, five sovereigns, and some silver; I put the copper in my cart and came away - I did not discover what I had got till I got home; then I found it was lead - my master and I went back immediately, and he was gone - it was at the house of one Mr. Morell.</p>

               <p>The papers were produced and shown to the Jury, which contained pieces of lead of the shape and size of pence and halfpence.</p>

            ; on Thursday, the 6th of May, the prisoner brought a cart load of oats to the stables - he should have brought twenty sacks - he had a man from a coal-waggon with him. I was backwards and forwards; but after I had seen two sacks shot I went away for some little time. He asked me to count the empty sacks, but I had not time. I saw some oats, which appeared to be of the same quality, at Mrs. Catharine's, in the Mews, and brought a sample back with me.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner brought some oats - my husband called me, and I went to see them shot. I saw sixteen sacks shot - my husband came back just as Greenfield had done shooting them, and he asked him to stop and see the sacks counted, which he could not do. I had remarked when he came to the fourth or fifth sack, that he put down two sacks instead of one. I was in a loft where he could not see me. I staid there all the time; there could not be more than nineteen sacks delivered at any rate; when he went away, there was a sack of oats lying in the cart, and the others over it - while the men were gone into the public-house, I went to the cart, and saw the oats - they drove the cart, to Mrs. Catharine's, in London-mews. I saw it stop there and turn round. I do not think they saw me at all.</p>

               <p>"I will tell you the truth; I am employed as a mason's labourer at Poet's-corner, Westminster-abbey, and this was thrown down to me to go and sell it." I left the lead in the house, and took him into custody.</p>

            . I am a chemist, and live in Gravel-lane; there are some premises next to me belonging to Messrs. Fyler - I had the key for letting the house. On the 24th of March the articles stated in the indictment were all safe; Thompson took possession of the house adjoining; this house is No. 145, and Thompson's is 145 1/2; I was occasionally there, but did not miss any thing till the 24th of April, when I missed the articles stated in the indictment. On Tuesday the 27th I went to Wellington's shop, and saw the copper boiler which had been in the parlour. I saw Wellington there. I found an aperture, four feet high, cut from Thompson's kitchen to the unoccupied house. I went with the warrant to Wellington's shop, and took the copper - it was the same which had been in the parlour; in the room passing through the shop we saw the cupboard, and we found all the articles except the stove - there was no appearance of the doors or windows having been forced. Thompson lives a quarter of a mile from Wellington, who is Thompson's father-in-law.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to Thompson's house on the 27th of May, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have a warrant to search your house; the next house has been robbed, and the things are suspected to have been carried through your house; he said</p>
               <p>"They may be, but I know nothing about it." I went in, and found the aperture very badly nailed up. I was going up stairs, but he said,</p>
               <p>"You need not go up, there is no bed; I sleep with my father in Ratcliff-highway." As we were going to Wellington's I said,</p>
               <p>"Shall we find the square copper boiler there;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't think you will." I then said,</p>
               <p>"Is it not exposed for sale on your father's counter;" he said,</p>
               <p>"My father has a square copper boiler for sale." I went to the house; the copper boiler was on the counter; I asked the price of it; he said 15 s.; I said,</p>
               <p>"Of whom did you buy it;" he said he did not know the man. I asked what he gave for it; he said he had bought it some time, and could not say when; Wellington then said, he was not master of his house, but that it had been brought in by somebody</p>

            . I heard the rattle sprung, and assisted in taking the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Paddington. On my return, passing near Portland-chapel, I found this lead laying on the ground; I took it up, and being seen by the watchman, I threw it down and ran away; another piece of lead was found the same night by the watchman - I hope the Court will believe it was so with mine.</p>

I had a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a pair of boots, and some penny-pieces in the inside pocket of this waistcoat. I pulled off my clothes, and put the waistcoat between the bed and sacking - the other clothes I left quite careless about the room. I awoke about seven o'clock I believe, to the best of my knowledge - I felt about before I made any alarm, as I could not see, and did not wish to accuse any one wrongfully - I first missed my boots, and then my other things - I have got my property since - the prisoner slept in the same bed with me - I know him by his voice.</p>

            ; we live in George-yard, and take in persons to lodge for the night. I remember the poor blind man coming to lodge there on the night of the 10th of April; the prisoner came before the blind man - they both had the same bed. I recollect the prisoner left a porter's knot, because he had no money, as he stated - he was to pay 4 d. for his lodging - the blind man got up about seven o'clock next morning, and said he had been robbed of his clothes and money. The prisoner was gone - I do not know how he went; he had no money the night before, and left the knot as security, but he has never called for it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw this person in my life - Witness. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>MARY M'GEE. I am the wife of the blind man - I did not sleep with him on this night, but I know that he slept there; he used the house. He had a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, and some money. I saw the prisoner with them on the 15th of April, when he was in custody; he had my husband's trowsers on, but nothing else; they were my husband's trowsers - I looked at them, and knew them to be my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any pieces in the pockets - A. Yes; I put them in myself.</p>

On the evening of the 1st of May, about nine o'clock, a woman said two boys had run away with a hat - I saw the two prisoners carrying a hat, and running away together, about fifty yards from the house. I pursued them; they turned round Windmill-street, and dropped the hat - I took them both myself. They denied any knowledge of the hat. I gave them both in charge. We had missed a cap on the same day.</p>

I was acquainted with the prisoner; he was out of place, and called on me on Saturday, the 29th of May, about three o'clock - I asked him down stairs, and took him into the pantry; he remained there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then went away. The plate was in the pantry, and about three hours after he was gone I missed a large fish fork; I had seen it in the morning. I made enquiry, and reported it to my master. I saw it on the Wednesday following.</p>

            . I keep a silversmith's shop, in Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square. The prisoner came to me on the Saturday, and asked if I bought old silver - he laid down on the counter a fork, broken in two pieces; I said,</p>
               <p>"I can't buy this, it has got a crest upon it, and is almost a new one;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Give it to me again" - I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I can't, I must send for an officer, and secure you." There were two gentlemen in the shop, and I begged of them to detain him till I got an officer.</p>

Britton had a bundle under his arm - I asked what he had; he said some printed cotton; that he picked it up at the back of the London Hospital. I took him into custody, and Scott attempted to escape - I told my brother officer to stop him.</p>

I had been gone about a minute and a half, and left no one in my shop but my little boy, who is seven years old. I think it was six or seven shillings, and the rest sixpences, and about 3 s. 6 d. in copper besides; the money was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030086"/>loose; I had been giving change for a sovereign -

             gave me 6 d. in payment for the tobacco - I went in, and got the three-halfpence, and detained them till my husband came. I then got two officers, who took them into custody; they were searched at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long were you gone - A. Not more than a minute or a minute and a half; I only went as far as the coach-stand; I could not keep my eye upon the door all the while; my back was turned towards it, and there was time for them to go into my shop and come back to the sill of my door. I am certain no one else went in; there was not time for it. I have no doubt the prisoners had intended to go; but they did not make any attempt to run away. I believe the officer said, one of them had got 1 s. 6 d. in his pocket; I saw them moving as if they had been in, and they were standing on the sill of the door - I did tell the officer there was 12 s. 6 d. on the table; but there was that sum, with the halfpence and all; the halfpence were not touched. I can swear that the silver was from 8 s. 6 d. to 9 s. 6 d. I am certain there was not 10 s., because I had given change for a sovereign. A man and his wife and four children occupy my first floor - I am certain they did not come down - they were at dinner.</p>
               <p>- WELCH. I am seven years old - (this witness perfectly undertood the obligation of an oath.) I recollect my mother going out; she was gone but a short time; these men (the prisoners) came to the shop - I was at the door, but they did not speak to me - the one with a black hat on went into the room for about a minute, and then came to the other - my mother came directly afterwards, and then he asked for some returns. I had seen the money on the table. I had been at home all the while my mother was out, and nobody else came in but these men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your mother came home, and these boys were taken up, and you did not say anything about it for a long while after - A. My mother went to Hatton-garden before I did; I went there last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell your mother when she came home,</p>
               <p>"Mother, these boys have been taking your money;" - A. No. I do not know why; I said nothing till I heard her say,</p>
               <p>"These boys have been robbing me;" - it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When your mother came home, and asked you about it, did you tell the same story as you do now - A. Yes; and went to the office, and told the same story.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Welch's house - the prosecutrix came and fetched me; we found two or three hundred people there; Barnett had a white hat on, and the other a black one - they were charged with stealing some silver. I took them into the parlour - one of them said,</p>
               <p>"Don't expose us;" - A. Abrahams sat down on a chair, and he had some tobacco in his hand - I saw his hand in his pocket, and found seven shillings, three sixpences, and three halfpence in his breeches pocket. Thompson asked him where he got it - he was going to say, but the other checked him. I took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the other prisoner - A. Yes; and found on him a sovereign and some silver; he said it was his own money; I gave it him back again. Mrs. Welch said as we came along, that there were nine or ten shillings; she was in a flurry; this little boy said nothing about it in my presence - I don't think I saw him. I knew nothing of it until they had two examinations at Hatton-garden; the boy was not present until the second time; he was not taken at first because he had not said that he knew anything about it.</p>

               <p>"How many more have you got;" she was putting her hand again to her pocket, and I got over the counter and took her to the end of the shop - she said she had laid two half-crowns on the counter - it is very unusual for women to come into a shop and take ribbons without asking the price - no other person served her - I saw her come in; and as soon as I took her to the end of the shop, she said she had put two half-crowns on the counter, which I had not seen before - I went and found one on the counter, and one in the drawer.</p>

             - these two pieces of ribbon were taken from the pocket of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the shop to buy one yard and a half of ribbon at 3 1/2 d. per yard, and two yards at 5 d. - I asked for some other - he laid hold of me, and shook my hand, and said I was going to steal the ribbon - one gentleman came in with one half-crown, and said it does not belong to her, it belongs to somebody else - I said I had given two half-crowns, and the officer sent him to look for the other, which he found.</p>

               <p>"No, you shall not go home." I went to clean myself, and he went and got his clothes on, and slipped out at the side door - I have not seen him since, till he was in custody - my other apprentice has likewise run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Mr. Harmer come to you on Thursday, the 18th of February, after the officer had been in pursuit of the prisoner, and could not find him - A. Yes; Mr. Harmer said whenever I filed a bill of indictment against him he would come forward - this was when I went to Bow-street; before I had been there previous to that - I saw Mr. Harmer there a second time, and then he told me the same thing, and said he surrender him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you file your bill against him - A. Not till last Sessions, on account of the absence of a material witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your material witness here to-day - A. No - I had a premium of 40 l. with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a trial at Guildhall - A. Yes; he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, do you not know that he expended his money in paying the expences of the witnesses - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you did not know from Mr. Cartridge that he paid part of his expences - A. The witnesses were at England's eating-house - I paid when I was there, and I paid him what he told me he laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay him - A. I can tell by my book - the first day he was there was on the 5th of January, and I asked him if he had money enough to pay for his dinner - he said he had. On the Tuesday I paid 5 s. 10 d., and 11 d. on Wednesday - and Thursday he said he had laid out a half-a-crown - on the 10th I paid him 4 s. - I had sometimes five witnesses there - I paid the dinners when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, on your solemn oath, when he told you he had taken the 1 l. 5 s., did he not tell you he had paid the expences with it - A. No - I knew nothing at all about his paying the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact did you not have the 1 l. 5 s. from his mother - A. No, never - I have never received it.</p>

               <p>"Put it away, seal it up, and put it in the box." When we went down to the Magistrate he would not go into the case, and Perry either took away or lost the key. I cannot open the box; it is here - I do not know what is in it; I cannot open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you, at the time Perry received it, and brought it into the shop, if he did not tell you that Wild's mother had sent the money - A. No; I have not to the present moment the least notion of what is in the box.</p>

               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. When did the prisoner tell you he had taken the property - A. On the 10th of January; and the paper was sent on the Monday - he had stated that he had given part to his father and part to his mother, and disposed of the rest himself - I did not, upon my solemn oath, give him leave to take my money to pay the witnesses - when I attended at Bow-street to make a complaint, Mr. Harmer undertook to produce him, but he did not bring him till to-day, to my knowledge - he never went before a Magistrate; and finding I could not get Perry, I put it off to this Sessions, in hopes to find him, which I have taken pains to do, but have not succeeded - he ran away on the 1st of April - I did not go to the prisoner's mother and say he should not come back into my service; I do not recollect any thing more than saying I would not have him on the trial any more - I sent a person to his mother, and to call on Mr. Farebrother to say he should not come again on the trial; but I never directly, or indirectly, sent to any of his relations to say I would not take him back into my service.</p>

               <p>"Let me have it;" he put it into my hands; here it is (producing it) - I put my initials on it before it went out of my possession. I paid 4 s. for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did there appear to be many books in the shop - A. It appeared to be well supplied with books.</p>

               <p>(The Libel was here read.)</p>
               <p>MR. FRENCH addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the defendant, contending that while Unitarians (whose doctrines he considered highly blasphemous) were tolerated, by law, that it was unjust to prosecute persons in the prisoner's situation of life.</p>

               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door. The defendant Hassell was in the shop - I asked him for another book, and then for</p>
               <p>"Paine's Age of Reason;" he said he had merely come into the shop to keep it open, as some of the men there had been taken out, and would not serve me with</p>
               <p>"The Age of Reason" then; but if I called in an hour or two I should have it, as he had a person coming into the shop who did not care what he served. I left, and returned about half-past three that afternoon, and found both the defendants there. I said to Hassell,</p>
               <p>"Can I have it now;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is it;" - I said,</p>

               <p>"The Age of Reason."</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this shop - A. It is a large double-fronted shop; O'Conner was not more than a yard from Hassell - he spoke quite loud enough to be heard. When I said I wanted</p>
               <p>"The Age of Reason," he turned round to a small box kind of a place behind the counter, and brought me two copies, one bound and the other not; the books were further from O'Conner - he brought them to where I was standing; I asked the price - the bound one was 8 s., and the other was 4 s.; I said I would take the unbound one; O'Conner was within a foot of him at this time. I was going to pay Hassell for it - but he pointed to O'Conner, who held out his hand, and took the money and jingled it on the counter. I then asked for</p>
               <p>"Palmer's Principles of Nature." Hassell said they had not got a copy in the shop. O'Connor said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; we have got one; let him have it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. Do you know O'Conner - A. From seeing him on that day. I put no question to him, but paid him the money - Hassell referred me to him; and he held out his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hassell. Q. Did O'Conner appear to have any concern in the shop - was he not sitting down reading at the time - A. He was not; he was behind the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. For whom did you buy this book - A. I was sent by the Solicitor of the Treasury. I have not read it.</p>
               <p>(The Libel was here read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. FRENCH addressed the Court on behalf of O'Connor. The Learned Gentleman, after pursuing the same arguments as upon the trial of Jeffery, stated that the defendant, who was a member of the Established Church, was driven by poverty to enter this shop, but that he himself had not published the libel, and that there was no proof of his knowing for what work he was receiving the money. The Learned Gentleman called the following witnesses: -</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Thomas-street, Grosvenor-square, and have known O'Conner for fifteen years - he was a moral, well-disposed young man, and always kept to the Established Church - he has an aged mother entirely dependant upon him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you - A. I keep a green-grocer's shop - he was abroad for four years, and returned in December - he has always frequented church since his return.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. I am keeper of Newgate. I saw O'Conner on Sunday week attending the chapel - his conduct was very proper. I noticed him particularly; he has only been in my custody for two Sundays.</p>
               <p>HASSELL'S Defence was of a most blasphemous and revolting nature.</p>

               <p>"Oh, very well, then you shall have it;" he went and brought me this number (producing it) - I paid him 6 d. for it, and marked it before it went out of my possession.</p>
