                  </hi>. I am a clothier's cutter, and live at 45, Wel<lb/>lington Street, Old Ford—on the evening of 29th November, about half-past 6 I was in the Bethnal Green Road—at the corner of Edward Street I saw a man standing in my path—I had my hand in my pocket—part of my chain was exposed—one man was standing on my left and two men on my right about four yards apart—the one on my left snatched my watch—this portion of the chain dropped down—I stooped and picked it up, and went in pursuit of the thief, who darted down Edward Street, and ran away—as I turned to pursue him the prisoner and another man were standing there—one of them, I won't say which, put out his foot to trip me—I escaped that, and went on in front of them—I was gaining on the thief—I found the pri<lb/>soner and the third man gaining upon me, and I turned round and struck out with my fist at each of them, and missed them—they did the same to me with the same result; they missed me—nothing was said—they then turned round and ran down the street, and I after them—we proceeded a little way when they turned round at me again and struck at me, and one of them cried out, "Down with the b—, hit him on the head"—they then proceeded round one of the bye turnings and got into Chilton Street—one of them then cried out, "Where is the knife?"—then we faced other—I never lost sight of the prisoner—he stooped down and picked up a stone and threw it at me—I moved my head on one side, and it whizzed by my ear—they then ran away down the street—one of them turned down a bye turning—the prisoner ran straight on—I then began to call out, "Stop thief!"—I followed the prisoner—he ran into a constable's arms.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron merchant and hardware factor, of 203, Upper Thames Street, City—I know the prisoner—on 11th May last he brought me this bill of exchange—he said it was a good commercial bill, drawn, as I understood, upon a customer of his, and he asked me to discount it—I hesitated at first, but I ultimately did it as he pressed me so much, saying that he was a little pressed for money, but in all probability he would pay me before the bill was at maturity—I handed him a cheque for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my cheque, payable to order, endorsed by him—I subse<lb/>quently found that the acceptance was a forgery—it was not paid—he endorsed the bill in my presence—I had had one small transaction pre<lb/>viously with the prisoner—I had lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had paid me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not find out that it was a forgery till a day or two after it became due—I did not know Mr. Cox at the time I advanced the money—I never had any business transaction with him—the prisoner told me he was in communication with Messrs. Carritt &amp; Son, solicitors, about some money on a mortgage—that was after the dishonour of the bill—I did not take any proceedings until after the proceedings in bankruptcy against him—I should have done so I admit; I can tell you why I did not—I dare say he filed his petition in November—there was an advertisement of the meeting which I attended on 12th December—I received no notice—I did not prove on this bill—I don't know that it was proved for me—don't know that this bill was included in my proof; I don't think it was—I did not attend to it myself—I handed it over to my solicitor, and told him to do what was necessary under the circumstances—I gave the prisoner into custody the same evening after the meeting at the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Courts—Mr. Arnold, the solicitor for the prosecution, may very possibly be the solicitor to the trustee under the bankruptcy—I know that he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The reason I did not take proceedings till after the bank<lb/>auptcy proceedings was this: I thought my first loss would, perhaps, be the least, and although I knew it to be my duty to do it, I hesitated, thinking, perhaps, it might not be a forgery after all, and not liking to press the man on account of his wife and family; but at the meeting of creditors I met a great many larger creditors than myself, and they thought it my duty to do it and to expose it—I had not the least idea it was a forgery till after it became due.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 743). On Sunday morning, the 29th September, I was on duty on the Surrey side of London Bridge, on the left hand side—I saw the defendant drive up in a mail-cart—I did not see a four-wheeled cab—I saw a Hansom cab just at the foot of the bridge, going towards the City on its proper side, the near side—the mail-cart drove up and came in collision with it—it met the cab and ran into it, and the off-wheel of the cab and the off-wheel of the cart got tucked—the cab<lb/>driver was thrown from his seat on to the ground—the defendant said to me, "Was I not on my right side, sir?"—I said, "No, or else you would not be where you are now"—he said, "I thought I was on my right side"—he was not on his right side—there was no other vehicle there at the time—there was nothing between the mail-cart and the eastern side of the bridge—somebody said something to me, and I went on a little further—I found a four-wheeled cab 3 or 4 yards past the first recess, on the City aide of the bridge, about 86 yards from where the Hansom was—I saw Police-constable 79 holding the horse of the four-wheeled cab, which was close against the kerbstone on the proper side—I then returned back to where I had left the Hansom—I did not find the driver there, but I found him afterwards in Guy's Hospital—I also found the driver of the other cab there—both of them were injured—at that time of night there is not much traffic on the bridge.</p>

I am a cab-driver, and live at 83, George Street, Bethnal Green—on Sunday morning, 29th September, I had a fare of two persons in my Hansom cab—I took them up at London Bridge, and was to drive them to Old Ford—when I got to the bottom of London Bridge I was driving on the near side, about half-a-foot from the kerb—I saw a mail-cart about forty yards off coming towards me—the prisoner was driving—I was going scarcely six miles an hour—the stones were very bad—the prisoner was driving about ten miles an hour—I tried to pull my horse up, and I caught hold of the rail of my cab to save myself, and the next instant he dashed into me and turned me off on to the pavement—I became insensible—I was picked up and taken to Guy's Hospital; my knee-cap was broken, and likewise my ankle—I have not been able to work since.</p>

On 31st October I was lodging at Mr. Weeks', 175, Liverpool Road, Islington, and on that afternoon, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I locked up my valuables in this iron safe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my apart<lb/>ment—there were three diamonds, several rings, two diamond rings, an opal ring, and other articles, and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, silver, and copper—there were also some photographs there—the value of the jewellery was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this ruby ring, these other rings, these fifteen Cape rubies, this diamond ring, and these two big loose diamonds belong to me—one loose diamond and some rings are still missing—these photographs were sent me from Germany—my brother's writing is on the back of them—all those things were locked up in the safe—I returned at a few minutes before 12 o'clock, and the safe was gone—I did not see it till I got it at the police station.</p>

I live at Umberstone Street, Commercial Road East—on the night of 21st November, just after 12 o'clock, I was in Central Street, and a person who I do not know gave me charge of two parcels while he went into an urinal—I waited for him, and while he was there, four men came up to me—the prisoners are two of them—Davis said "Shall I carry those things for you?"—I said "No, I am carrying them myself"—he went to get hold of them, I would not let him, and he struck me on my breast and knocked me down, and two of them came to my pockets—I called out "Police!"—the police came, and two of them ran away—these two were over me, and the policeman got hold of them—a gentleman came up—I was on my back, and Davis was <hi rend="italic">tussling</hi> with the officer—I had some money in ray pockets, but they were too small and narrow, and I only lost my knife, with which I was cutting some tobacco just before—I never lost sight of the prisoners; they were right over me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlton Crescent, Islington—on 22nd Novem<lb/>ber I came out of the Royal Mint Refinery in the afternoon, and saw the prisoners coming by the Clock House immediately opposite—one of them said "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>, do what I tell you," and he made a motion with his fingers—I saw them take hold of a sailor; but thinking it was a joke, I passed on—one of them struck the sailor three times in the stomach—I went down to Dock Street to purchase some oranges, and Driscoll passed me—Sullivan came in front of me, and snatched my watch from the guard, and dashed it into the road—he endeavoured to stop me, but I picked it up—my first impulse was to chase Sullivan, but the prisoners ranged themselves on each side, and I thought they would close in behind me—there were 100 people, but not a soul would lend me a hand—Sullivan ran up the yard, and I turned round and said "I will mark the lot of you"—one of them said "Drop it," and I immediately received a blow on my right arm, in which hand the watch was—Shea withdrew his hand from his pockets, and said "Take that," and I saw something glittering—I cannot say what it was, but I received a cut in my eye and a severe wound on my leg by being pushed against the wall—I went to the police and gave information, and afterwards went to the hospital—I saw the whole of the prisoners—Shea is the one who struck me in the eye; I stated on the first occasion that it was Murphy—on the Thursday afterwards I went before the Magistrate for the first time, and identified Driscoll and Shea out of seven or eight others—I was then asked to go over to a public-house opposite, where they said there were several of them; I went there and looked round, and behind several others I identified Murphy and Foy—I took one in each hand, and said to the detective "Take them; that is two more"—I then went over to the Police Court and charged them, and they were committed for trial—the Magis<lb/>trate</p>

               <p>asked me if I would swear to Murphy as the man who struck me—I said "Not positively"—I did not call to mind the position in which the men placed themselves—after they were committed I was asked to go to the police-station, and in a few minutes I was asked to go into a room—I saw eight or ten men, among whom I identified Shea—I told the Magistrate I was in error in stating that it was Murphy, and that I was confident it was Shea—you might put him among 1000, and I could identify him.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Hoy, and live at 10, Pierpoint Row, Islington—I am stepmother to the prisoner, he lived with-us and also my three children, aged eight, seven, and two—on Wednesday morning, 4th December, about 8 o'clock, whilst I and my husband were in bed, the prisoner brought us up a cup of tea each—he gave me a cup and his father a cup; he brought it in his hands—I can hardly say to whom he gave the first cup—his father drank his and I drank mine, the whole of it—I did not hear my husband say that he was ill after drinking his—having taken mine I got up, and dressed and washed my children, and sent them to school, and in about two hours I gradually came over very funny at my chest—I felt that there was something there that wanted removing, and I felt very ill; then I came over very sick indeed, and vomited very much and was purged very much; they were not particularly painful purgings; they pinched me a bit; there was great looseness, I was very ill all that day with purging and vomiting—at 3 o'clock I had some hot brandy and water and felt much better—I got well—on the following Saturday morning the prisoner again brought up some tea to me and my husband, I did not feel quite well, and I asked him to put mine by my bedside, and said I would drink it in a few minutes—my husband drank his—I did not hear him complain of any ill effects—about 10 o'clock I got up and went down stairs and took the cup of tea down with me, I did not drink it, it was cold, and I threw it into the sink—I was just going to wash the cup when I saw a thick white substance at the bottom—I showed it to my husband and he kept the cup—I don't know what was in it—on the Thursday evening previous my eldest little girl Emily said something to me.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—the prisoner is my son—he was in the habit of bringing me a cup of tea on the Sunday morning as a rule—on Wednesday morning, 4th December, he brought up two cups of tea, one for me and one for my wife—I had not asked him to do so—I drank the cup of tea that he gave me—I did not feel ill after it—I saw my wife drink hers—she was very ill afterwards, vomiting and purging—I keep a shop—I had arsenic in the shop; it was in this drawer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), concealed in the shop—I hid it behind some goods—the drawer was not fitted into a table or anything, but was hid behind some furniture—I had no knowledge that anybody else knew of the hiding-place—the arsenic had been given to me by my landlord five or six years ago, because I complained of the rats in the place—about two months before this Wednesday morning I had used some of it for the rats—I cut a potato up, and put some of it into it, and put it under the holes in the boards in the kitchen, as I usually did—I put the remainder of the arsenic back where I took it from, and hid it in the same way—I think I took the arsenic in the drawer into the kitchen, and put it back again in the same place in the shop—no one was in the shop when I did so that I am aware of—my wife was in the kitchen—I don't think the prisoner was there when I used the arsenic on that occasion, because I was always very cautious—between that time and the Saturday when my wife gave me something in a cup I had not been to that arsenic—on that Satur<lb/>day I went and looked at the arsenic after I came back from the doctor—I found that it had been disturbed; the box had been moved, and the coverings over it had been moved too; some mats that I kept over it—the box had been shifted, and the best part of the arsenic was gone—it was in two papers, one inside the other, and the outer paper was gone—it was a paper similar to the inner one in which the arsenic is now—both papers had labels on them—about 11 o'clock on that Saturday morning my wife gave me a teacup; there was something on the bottom of it—we talked a little while over it, and then I put the cup aside on a chest of drawers in the shop—it remained there about an hour and a half, when I showed it to Dr. Harle—he came by, and I called him in and asked him what he thought it was—nobody had touched it since I put it there—I had remained in the shop, and I had put it out of any one's way—the doctor did not take it away with him; he was going somewhere, and told me to bring it to his surgery, which I did, between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon, and gave it to his assistant—Mr. Harle was not there—the stuff in the cup was of a dirty whitish colour, like the arsenic—it was the similarity between the colour of it and the arsenic that roused my suspicions, and caused me to speak to the doctor.</p>

               <p>six weeks or two months—the water runs out two or three times a week—when I put the arsenic on the potato I covered it well; I took the potato in my hand, cut a slice off, undid the wrapper and put a little on, and then rubbed my hand over it, and shook a little on the potato out of the package—that was in the kitchen—I think I placed three slices of potato, all equally covered—I did not ask the prisoner to bring up the tea on the Saturday morning, I was getting up when he brought it up—my wife was in bed—it was a usual thing for him to bring up a cup of tea on the Sunday without being asked—on the Wednesday he brought it up just before 8.30—I hardly know whether the prisoner can only read imperfectly; it is not for want of going to school—his education is not so good as I should like it—he has his different books at home, the "Leisure Hour" and the "Boys of England," and such books as those—he reads those—he reads them to himself; he has read so seldom in my hearing that I could not say whether he reads well or badly—I know he can read a little—he is not thirteen yet.</p>

I am a surgeon at 23, Essex Street, Isling<lb/>ton—on Saturday, 7th December, I was called by Mr. Hoy into his shop—he said something to me, and showed me a cup containing a dirty white substance at the bottom—I did not form an opinion what it was at the moment—I did before I left the shop, from what I saw and from what hestated—he did not show me this drawer—I did not take the cup away with me—about 7 o'clock in the evening when I went home, I found the cup there; I received it from my assistant; it was in the same condition—I afterwards analysed the stuff—there were about three-parts of a teaspoonful; about a drachm; I proved it to be arsenic—if it was taken it would kill a person—it would kill a dozen persons—it is a heavy material, it would sink to the bottom of any liquid that it was put into—I have heard the symptoms described by Mrs. Hoy on the Wednesday; purging and vomiting are the symptoms that would be produced by arsenic—I have heard that it was two hours before she felt unwell—the quantity she then took I should imagine was very slight—this box contains arsenic—it is exactly the colour and appearance of the stuff in the teacup.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I lived with that man twelve years, and out of that I have had ten years of misery, knocking me about, even in my confine<lb/>ments. I had to be taken to the hospital. I had my ribs broken, and he threatened to put me into a boiling copper. He would not support me, and has left me with a pennyworth of milk for me and my child. I had to go to the workhouse, and he had to pay for my maintenance for a fortnight. He then begged me to come back again. I was in the family way, and he turned me out; I had to go about carrying a dead child in me, while he was living with another woman. I came home after two months with brain fever. He was then cohabiting with another woman, underneath. He struck me on the head, and I was taken to the Marylebone Infirmary, and was out of my mind for three weeks through his ill-usage. When I came back there was not a stick in the place; he had taken both my children away, and left only a bag of shavings. I then collected another home, and he came home on 12th January. On 28th March he commenced breaking up my things again, and ill-used me, and struck me in the breast with the leg of the table. I left him for some weeks, and then came back. I was then in the family way again, towards the latter end of the year; my breast was very bad, and after a three weeks' confinement I had to go to the Middlesex Hospital, and remained there four months, and during that time he never came near me to give me even an ounce of tea. The last fortnight he deserted my children, and did not give them a loaf of bread. I had to leave the hospital before my time to see my children. On 5th September, last year, I was taken ill in the street, and taken to the union, and was laid up for a month, and when I came home I found my home gone, and these two living together as man and wife. This time I would not have gone near him, but I wished to see my children. I asked him to leave me the eldest, as she did not belong to him. He said he would do as he liked with her, and I should not have anything to do with her. I went to see her on the Saturday night, and found that my husband had been to the Magistrate making a statement that I only wanted to get her away from her situation in order to pawn her clothes, which was quite wrong; the girl wanted to leave. When I found that I was refused admission to the girl I went and bought this, but not for him; I did not intend to find him at home, as he is generally at the public-house at that time of night. My sister answered me through the door, and defied me to come in; she said she was inside and she would take care to keep me out. I sat on the stairs for a quarter of an hour, and when he came up stairs she called out "Look out, Amos; there is somebody on the stairs;" he said "Is there?" I said "Yes, there is," and I threw the cup in the darkness. I could not see where I threw it. I then waited till the policeman came. That is all I have to say.</p>

I am assistant relieving officer to the Strand Union—on 14th November, about 6.45, a person named Eliza Chirgwin, with three children, applied to me for a night's lodging—I told her that the wards were closed, but that I would give her an order for another workhouse—this is the order I gave—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Strand Union, 14th November, 1872. To the Master of St. Giles's Workhouse. Admit Eliza Chirgwin and three children, Mary, William, and Charles. G. Keller, assistant relieving officer.")—It was given to the bearer at 6.45 p.m., when she was informed that if it was not presented within one hour of that time admission might be refused—it was a stormy night, and the mother and her children appeared wet—I did not think it a case to take into the house at once, but that it was a proper case for the casual ward—I acted in obedience to orders that were given for my guidance—the woman was quite sober when she applied to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live in Cleveland Street Workhouse—I am a single woman—on the night of 13th November I had three children, Mary, seven years of age, William, four years, and Charles, three months old—their father is named William Jerrard, and is gone to Chicago; I was going out with him, but they would not take me on board—I am a waistcoat hand,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187212160033"/>
               <p>but I do anything I can—on the night of the 13th I slept at my aunt's, in Crown Street, Soho—on the following morning my cousin came home, and consequently that night I was not able to sleep there—having no means of paying for a night's lodging I went to the Cleveland Street Workhouse—it was raining very hard—I wanted to be taken in for the night only, as I intended to go back to my aunt's the next day—I asked Mr. Keller to give me a night's lodging; he replied "I would take you in if I possibly could but the wards are closed"—he then gave me an order for St. Giles's Work-house, and I went away—it was then raining very hard, and on the way I stopped at two or three doors for shelter—I got the order about 6.30, I should think, and I went direct to the St. Giles's Workhouse, Short's Gardens—I rang the bell, and the prisoner answered me—he said "You want a night's lodging?"—I answered "Yes"—he then asked whether I had been elsewhere, and I said "To Cleveland Street"—he then asked whether I had an order, and I said I had—he said "Come in"—as I went in he said "Oh! you are drunk again, are you?"—I said "No, I am not; you accused me of that the last time I was here"—he then said he would send for a constable to lock me up, adding "March over there, you drunken beast"—I gave the prisoner the order—I had drunk only half a pint of beer that day—his wife, who was standing by, with a shawl over her head, said "That's right, lock her up"—she then went away, and Mr. Cannon sent the gate<lb/>man to get a constable—in the meanwhile I sat down on a form, and the children began to cry because we were going to be locked up—we were then very wet—a constable came in five or ten minutes—the prisoner told him that he wanted to charge me with being drunk and abusive—the constable spoke to me, and then called Mr. Cannon on one side—I did not hear what they said to each other—subsequently Mr. Cannon ordered the constable to take me to the station, and I was taken to Bow Street—there Inspector Usher would not take the charge brought against me—I did not use any abusive language to the prisoner—the Inspector told me to sit down by the fire, and sent out for some coffee and bread and butter—the police surgeon was called in to see us, and then we were sent back to St. Giles's by another constable, because, the Inspector said, perhaps Mr. Cannon would take me in then—when we reached the workhouse Mr. Cannon was standing at the door—he spoke to Mr. Smith, the assistant surgeon, and then refused to take us in—the policeman said "Then you will not take her in?"—he replied "No"—the policeman then said "Then I must take her to Cleveland Street"—the prisoner added "Take her away then"—he also said "She is quite able to walk"—the constable then took us in a four-wheel cab to Cleveland Street, where we were taken in and put to bed, supplied with tea, and our clothes were dried—when I first reached St. Giles's I think it was about 7.30, and when we got to Cleveland Street it was 9.45—when the constable took us into custody we walked to Bow Street—it was raining then, and also when we returned to the workhouse, but not quite so much—the baby was in long clothes, and they were very wet—the baby remained with me during the night—before this day it had had a slight cough, but nothing to speak of—it had a cold about five weeks ago, but had recovered—it was a beautiful little dear, and was fat—on Friday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, it became very restless—it coughed, and had a kind of wheezing at its chest—I spoke to the night nurse about it—at 11 o'clock on Friday morning I showed the baby to the doctor, and he prescribed for it—medicine was given and poultices were applied—on Saturday it became</p>

On the evening of the 14th November, I was on duty at the Bow Street Police Station—at about 8 o'clock I saw Eliza Chirgwin in the dock, and the prisoner then charged her with being drunk and using abusive language—I told him that I could not substantiate a portion of the charge, that of drunkenness, as I believed her to be sober—the woman denied using abusive language, and said the prisoner had called her a drunken beast—the prisoner afterwards said he would charge her with giving a false name, adding that on a former occasion she gave tie name of Gerard, and that now she had come in the name of Chirgwin, which he believed to be false—the woman then said that the former name was the name of the father of her children, and that her own name was Chirgwin—I then told the prisoner that I did not consider that a false pretence, and I refused to entertain the charge—I next told him that, in my opinion, he had acted very cruelly towards the woman and her children in sending them out in the rain; and that I should send for the divisional surgeon and procure his opinion on the subject; and that if he thought fit, I would get a certificate from him and send them back to the same workhouse—he then said that if I did so he would not receive them—he did not say why—it was a tempestuous night, the rain falling incessantly—the children were very wet, and apparently very tired and worn—I directed them to sit by the fire and sent out for some refreshment for them—Dr. Mills came and saw them, and then wrote this certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner returned to the station in about half-an-hour with an Act of Parliament; and pointed to a clause in it, saying that under that clause I must take that charge which he had made respecting a false name—I was well aware of the clause, and I said it was of no use, as I should not take any charge against the woman that night; I also said that I con<lb/>sidered the charge an afterthought—the prisoner then asked for the Superintendent, but he was not in the station—he then went away, and I got another constable named Scutt to go back to the workhouse with the woman and her children telling him to show the certificate of Dr. Mills,</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police—about 8.30 on the night of the 14th November, I went to Bow Street police-station and saw Eliza Chirgwin and her children—they were wet and miserable-looking—my attention was particularly called to the baby, who looked pale and cold, and had a cough; its clothes were thin and wet—I thought it was proper to send them to the nearest workhouse, and I wrote a certificate to that effect—it was very dangerous to allow a child of that tender age to remain in wet clothes—that produced is the certificate—(<hi rend="italic">Read:"</hi> I recommend that Eliza Chirgwin be admitted to the workhouse of (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) Union, as she has a baby at the breast, having a very bad cough and looking badly nourished. She has also two other children who want food.—Samuel Mills, divisonal surgeon, November 14th, 1872.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant medical officer to the united parishes of St. Giles and St. George, Bloomsbury—at about 9.30 on the night of the 14th November I was at the workhouse, when the prisoner came to me, saying that he had some casuals below, whom he wished me to see—he said that they belonged to the Strand Union; that he had taken them to Bow Street, and charged them; that the Inspector had refused to take the charge; and that he had brought them back, and wished me to see them—he gave me to understand that he had brought them back, and he wished me to state my opinion as to whether they were able to go to Cleveland Street—I then went to the surgery and saw them—I read the certificate brought by the constable—the baby had a slight wheezing at the chest; but I stated that it was my opinion that they were able to pro<lb/>ceed to Cleveland Street—the slight wheezing indicated bronchitis—I thought they were able to walk, but I heard the constable say he would take them in a cab—the woman was quite sober—when she went out she exclaimed to me "God bless you"—I attended her at the workhouse when she was suffering from uterine hemorrhage—I attended her first as an out-patient, and subsequently she came inside—that was three months ago—the clothes of the woman and children were wet, but not wringing wet—it is no part of my duty to see casuals, but I thought the prisoner had obtained authority to come and ask my opinion—after they were taken in, if they became ill, it would have been the duty of the prisoner to send for me—I have told all that was said between us on that occasion—the prisoner did not tell me that the woman had been to the Strand Workhouse, or that they had come to be admitted to St. Giles's Workhouse—he only told me that he had taken them to Bow Street; he did not say how long they had been in wet clothes.</p>

I am a labourer, of 20, Warwick Street, Blackfriars Road, Southwark—the deceased was my brother—on Sunday night, 10th, November, about 10.30, I was with him in Parliament Street, going towards Charing Cross—when we got to the corner of Charles Street I saw a cab coming up at a very unusual pace, and within 10 yards of the top of the street I halloaed out, and put up my hand—my brother attempted to get back to the kerb again, and the hind wheel struck him on the breast, and knocked him backwards, and then he fell insensible—the prisoner stopped, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Cabby</hi>, what has caused you to come round the turning at such a rate as that?"—he helped me to put my brother into his cab, and take him to the hospital—nobody was in the cab, but some one was riding on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the superintendent of the Gaslight and Coke Company, at Beckton Station, Kent; that is their largest place of manufacture of gas—our Company supply the whole of the City and the greater portion of the West End—our power of storeage at Beckton is very limited, not more than a third of a day's make—it is quite necessary that the manufacture should go on continuously, night and day—for that pur<lb/>pose we employ about 500 workmen, and divide them into two gangs, the night and the day gang; that is in the retort houses alone, where the fires are attended to, and the gas made—the night gang goes on about 6 in the evening, and they work until about 5:30 the following morning—they are obliged to be on the premises during the whole of that time, the actual time they are at work is about five hours—the change from the night to the day gang takes place between 6 and 7; some go at 6 and some at 6.30, and some at 7, for different portions of the process—with some of the 500 workmen we had written contracts, signed contracts; the others were under a weekly engagement; an advertisement to that effect was posted up at the pay place, to give and take a week's notice—about 22nd November a matter was reported to me with reference to Dilley, who had been, and then was, a servant—I did not speak to him myself, but I gave directions for his discharge—nothing further was brought to my knowledge with reference to the matter until Monday, 2nd December—Collier, a foreman, came to me about 6.45 that morning, and in consequence of what he told me I went to one of the four retort houses on the works—I there saw the night and the day gangs—the night gang should have left the premises by 6 o'clock—before the gangs begin their work they usually change their clothing—none of the day gang that I could see had changed their clothing—I noticed Jones and Wilson standing close to me—I also noticed Webb there—I asked them what they wanted to see me about—they said they wanted to see me about Dilley's case—Webb was the first spokesman—I called for the day gang, because it was their duty to have gone to work—Jones said they were all there—I said "Why do you not go to work?"—Jones said "We have decided not to go to work until Dilley is reinstated"—Wilson spoke to the same effect, and Webb also—I told him as he belonged to the night gang it was not his business; he should have left the works, it was then past 7 o'clock, and I said "The time has now elapsed at which the whole of</p>

               <p>you should have gone to your work; the Company have always behaved liberally towards you, they have conceded all that you have asked from time to time, and I call upon all those of you who are well disposed towards them to go on with your work"—Jones said "Yes, ask them that"—not a man stirred or separated himself from the rest—I asked those who were well disposed to separate themselves from the rest—I said both to Jones and Wilson "Am I to understand that you refuse to go on with your work until Dilley is reinstated?"—they said "Yes"—they said Dilley's discharge and the Fulham matter had been put into one—I said I had nothing to do with the affairs at Fulham—this was said loud enough for the other workmen to hear—they made no sign, they all stood together—I told them that I should give them ten minutes for consideration—I left them, and went into the stokers lobby; I saw some men there; I spoke to one of them, a fireman, named Simmonds, and then went back to the body of men, and, in consequence of what Simmonds had said to me, I asked for Bunn and Ray, and put the same question to them: "Am I to understand that you refuse to go on with your work until Dilley is reinstated?"—they said "Yes"—I said "You know you are acting illegally, that you cannot leave your work; some of you are under a monthly agreement, and some under a weekly, and you must not leave your work without giving us proper notice; I will give you ten minutes more to consider of this, and then you will let me know the result"—Jones said "We may as well tell you at once, we have made up our minds"—I said "No; I will let you have the ten minutes for reflection"—I then went away, and in about ten minutes' time returned—Jones, Bunn, Ray, and Webb were there—I won't be sure as to Wilson—the gang were still there, but there were not so many men there—this took place outside the retort house—Jones said they were still of the same opinion—I said "Very, well, then, I will reinstate Dilley, but I reinstate him under protest; now go on with your work"—Webb said "They do not understand what you mean by protest"—I said "Do you?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Then, perhaps, you will explain it to them"—he said to the men "The governor means to punish you," and he said to me "Will you withdraw that word"—I said "How can I? you insist upon Dilley being reinstated, and I rein<lb/>state him, but under protest," and I said to them again "Now go on with your work"—Webb said "We may as well tell you we can't go on with our work until the men at Fulham are let in"—I said "That is a matter with which I have nothing whatever to do, end I can do nothing further in it"—Webb said they could not go to work until they received orders from their delegate meeting—I then left them, and consulted with my assistants and foremen—that was the end of the matter—the day and night gangs walked off in a body—I saw Dilley walking away with the men—while the men were there I saw this written notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the lobby door, close to the retort house—it is a large dining-room where the men take off their clothes—it was pasted on the outside of the door—the defendants belonged to the day gang—the lobby I speak of is where some of the men would go to change their clothes—we have four lobbies all the same size—this was the lobby connected with the retort house where the meeting took place between me and the men—there were two of these notices—there were two pairs of lobbies, with the doors opposite one another, and there was another notice, similar to this, on one of the other lobby doors—ia the ordinary course of things both the men coming on duty and those going from duty would pass those lobby doors—they could get into the</p>

That was not any notice of mine—my attention was called to it by one of the day gang that morning, after the first conversation—the others were not there—it was before they had spoken to me about their delegate meeting—the men would not, according to any business of ours, be bound to answer to their names at 6 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. This is a monthly agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th October</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">and was an agreement between the witness as agent for the Company and the defendant Bunn, to be determined by a month's notice on either side, and contained the conditions of the employment and the amount of wages, viz.</hi>: 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for first class stokers</hi>; 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for second class; and</hi> 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">for third class; coke spreaders</hi>, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">and labourers</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per day.</hi>) When a man enters our employ we hold him responsible to fulfil any of the duties included in that agreement—he may be called upon to work either as a labourer, or a stoker of either class, or to do piece work—these forms have been in use ever since the date of that, about 1871—during 1871, Bunn was employed in the retort house, either as a first, second, or third class stoker—as far as I know he was engaged in one of those three classes—I believe he never was removed from the retort house—the first class men look after the furnaces, the second and third class stokers charge the retort with coal; the coke spreaders tread the coke back—after the coke is drawn from the retort, it is stored by the coke spreader—the labourers would have to make themselves generally useful—stokers as well as labourers would be called upon to do piece work, only by mutual agree<lb/>ment; the mutual agreement only refers to piece work; labourers would be liable to stokers' work if they could do it—that was to a certain extent the practice of the works—Dilley was in the service from the date of his agree<lb/>ment, about eighteen months—I don't know that he came after an eight years' service with the Imperial Gaslight and Coke Company—my conversation with</p>

               <p>the men on 2nd December took place between a few minutes before 7 o'clock and 7.30; the whole thing was covered by about three quarters of an hour—there was no violence of demeanour or threatening of any sort on the part of any of the men in my presence—what led me to reinstate Dilley was my anxiety to get the work performed—I understood from the verbal state<lb/>ments of the others that the men would not work unless I did—Dilley before his discharge was what is called a pipe jumper, that is included in the third class pay—pipe jumpers are not set down in this table, they would go under the class of third class stokers—he would be liable to do other work besides pipe jumping—pipe jumping is keeping the ascension pipe from the retort clear—there has been an increase of wages since those agreements—his wages now would have been 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—since the agree<lb/>ment made with Bunn his rate of wages has been altered—the gangs change every week; the men are paid on the increased rate of wages, 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the rate for seven days work; if they only made six days, of course there would be a corresponding diminution—I have not known a man come to the works in the morning and be told that he was not wanted for that day, only as far as a casual labourer is concerned, not a person who has signed an agreement—Dilley left the employ on Saturday, 30th November—the men leave their working clothes at the works in their lockers; each man has a locker.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the whole law of conspiracies affecting trade, or in restraint of trade, was governed by two statutes</hi>, "The Trade Union Act, 1871" (34 and 35 Vic, c. 31), <hi rend="italic">and</hi> "The Criminal Law Amendment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187212160048"/>
               <p>(Violence, &amp;c.) Act, 1871" (34 and 35 Vic, c. 32). <hi rend="italic">The combination of workmen was now legalised, and all offences under the last-mentioned Act must be prosecuted under the provisions of the</hi> "Summary Jurisdiction Acts." <hi rend="italic">The first section defined the meaning of molestation and obstruction, and the meaning of threats and intimidation, and provided "that no person shall be liable to any punishment for doing or conspiring to do any act on the ground that such act restrains or tends to restrain the free course of trade, unless such act is one of the acts hereinbefore specified in this section, and is done with the object of coercing, as hereinbefore mentioned." There were two classes of Counts in the indictment, some alleging a conspiracy at common law, by means of intimi<lb/>dation and molestation, to induce the master to alter his mode of carrying on business, and others alleging also a conspiracy at common law to injure the Gas Company by the defendants and their fellow-workmen agreeing to break existing contracts at one and the same time. With reference to the first class of Counts, the proviso applied, and proceedings could only be taken before a Magistrate. With reference to the second class of Counts, the servant must be a person, and the contract must be a contract, within the meaning of the previous statutes, which gave a master power to punish a servant for not fulfilling his contract; and the defendants were not such servants, and had not made such a contract. He applied to</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">also urged that there was no evidence of conspiracy; that if the defendants were punished at all for what they had done, it could only be as offending singly against the provisions of the</hi> "Masters and Servants 'Act," <hi rend="italic">and that the fact of any previous concert' or combination on their part was not made out.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">admitted that if the conspiracy had been one the design and object of which was to restrain trade, there might have been a colour for the argument that the proviso quoted applied; but it was a conspiracy the effect of' which would not only be to restrain trade, but also to restrain and coerce the personal will of others. The allegation was that the defendants conspired to extort and force the Manager of the Company to promise to do something which otherwise he would not have agreed to do. The</hi> "Criminal Law Amendment Act" <hi rend="italic">did not apply to this case; it was not intended to repeal the common law of the land, and any conspiracy to interfere with the free will of others by an illegal act, such as the breaking of contracts, was a conspiracy at common law; he would not, however, press the special Counts, which had reference to isolated threats and violence towards individual men.</hi>

It is not suggested that the third Count is not good; the only point taken is that there is no positive evidence that these are contracts for the breach of which a criminal information would lie, and, also, that the defendants were not persons employed within the meaning of</hi> 30 and 31 Vic., c. 141. <hi rend="italic">I think they were, and that a criminal information would lie for a breach of those contracts.
