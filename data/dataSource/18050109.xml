               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of them again? - A. Yes; in a few days there was a neck handkerchief and the slings found in the apartment of the prisoner; I was with the constable at the time they were found, at No. 9, King-street, Seven-dials.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your coat? - A. Two pounds; I had had it about three months, it cost me two pounds eighteen shillings; the two waistcoats are worth ten shillings, two pair of breeches, a guinea and a half, the stockings four shillings, the Bible five shillings, the linen-cloth five shillings, and the slings, I suppose, sixpence.</p>

This neck handkerchief is mine, and the braces are mine; one of the buckles was wanting, and that part was cut to go over the button of my breeches, and the linen I know to be mine; it was sent to me from Scotland by my mother, cut off the web; I know it by the quantity and the quality; I have been in the habit of wearing my mother's linen all my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The linen is my own, I have a pair of sheets of the same now in pledge; the handkerchief was left in my room by a person that slept with me; I know nothing about the name of the person that left it; the duplicates are all my own, they have been advertised, and nobody has come forward to own any thing; I have three small children, and am pregnant now.</p>

               <p>Q. One of those men, I believe, made his escape? - A. One ran to the right, and the other to the left; the man who ran to the right was the prisoner at the bar, whom I immediately fixed my eye upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass when he came out of the house? - A. I saw him make a blow at Mrs. Wilson, she was standing by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had made that blow at Mrs. Wilson, which way did he take his course? - A. He ran immediately towards Hind-street, and he had not got above twenty yards before he was stopped by a gentleman, who seized him, I was then crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that gentleman keep hold of him? - A. Only for a minute; he got away from him, he made a double across the street, and whether the gentleman struck him or not, I do not know, but the prisoner fell down in the middle of the street; he got up again, and kept on my side of the way back again, opposite to No. 11; he then turned a corner into William-street, which is within one door of where I live; I pursued him, crying stop thief; I never lost sight of him, I saw him stopped in Marybone-lane by several people.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. About seven, or half past seven, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away from those persons by whom he was then surrounded? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A merchant, in Crutched-friars: On the 20th of October last, I was passing through Thayer-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you remember having seen him there? - A. Yes, I saw him first coming out of the house, No. 11; I observed him make a violent blow at a lady, who was at the door; he immediately ran towards Hind-street, he passed so close by me, that I seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the purpose for which you seized him to apprehend him? - A. Yes; he struggled, and made a blow at my head, which I avoided, and he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he attempt to strike you with? - A. I saw that he had something in his hand, but could not then discern what it was; I afterwards saw that it was an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he escape? - A. I returned the blow, and he fell; he got up again, and turned, and escaped for a moment; I pursued him down two small streets, and kept sight of him till I saw Chantry at the door of his own house; I called out to him, stop thief, stop him; Chantry then laid hold of him immediately, I told Chantry to take care, for he had an iron in his hand; Chantry looked round, and in a few moments afterwards he lifted up his hand, and made a violent blow at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090007"/>Chantry with the iron; he was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see what that iron was? - A. Yes, it was a crow; it was delivered to the officer.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Where do you live? - A. At No. 33, Marybone-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Saturday, the 20th of October, did you hear any cry of stop thief? - A. Very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon hearing that cry? - A. I ran out, and saw this gentleman pursuing a man, and singing out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I stepped over the way to meet the man; as I came up on one side the pavement, he stepped on the other; he fell down, and I caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you catch hold of him? - A. Because I heard the cry of stop thief, to apprehend him; I led him along very quietly forty or fifty yards, Mr. Holford told me there was something in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether he had any thing in his hand? - A. Not to my recollection; he struck me at the corner of William-street with a piece of iron, and I was taken to the Hospital. Twelve or fourteen pieces of bone have been taken out of my head, and there are more pieces coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hold of him at the time he so struck you? - A.I still continued to have hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this, did any person come up to your assistance? - A. Yes, a butcher of the name of Snowden; I told him he had got something very hard, that he had struck me upon the head very hard, and two of them got it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it prove to be? - A. An iron crow; me and the butcher conveyed him to the watch-house together; I was taken to the Hospital, and was there five weeks and three days.</p>
               <p>Q. You were under the care of Mr. Parroquet, the surgeon? - A. No, Mr. Harwood.</p>

             was under your care? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the injury he had received likely to be produced by an instrument like this? - A. Nothing more likely; a portion of the bone was cut away from the skull, it was cut in a strait line, about as broad as a goose's quill, three quarters of an inch long and very deep, as if it was done by such an instrument as that; it made an incision into the bone, there was a complete piece taken out, as if it had been sawed out as it were; the scalp that covers the bone was very much torn; besides the fracture, there was a wound on the side of the head, and after examining that wound, the bone was discovered with a piece of it cut out, a slit in the bone as if from a violent blow; you may form some idea of it, by cutting off a piece of a goose's quill.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it appear to be broke off, or cut out? - A. Cut out.</p>

I had been to my master's warehouse with my work; on my returning, I went up to their apartment, knowing they had been separated the day before, and when I came into the place, I was so shocked, I cannot tell hardly whether the door was shut or open, I saw the deceased lying in her blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any of her clothes lying about the room? - A. They seemed to be all on as far as I observed.</p>

               <p>Q. Her name is Nicholls? - A. So I have understood since, I acquainted her with it; I had some of my master's property about me, and that I carried home.</p>
               <p>Q. After speaking to Mrs. Nicholls, did you see the child again or Mitchell on that day? - A. I did not see Mitchell again, but I saw Sally, the child, again; I returned back to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he came to you, had you seen Mitchell in the morning? - A. Yes, I heard him about half past eleven o'clock; I went out to market, and when I returned he asked me what it was o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he at the time he asked you what o'clock it was? - A. In his own room; I did not see him, I only heard his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the girl? - A. No, I only heard her go up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you hear the girl Sally go up? - A. After school-time, after twelve o'clock, she went to a charity-school, in Spitalfields; I heard her go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know it was the child? - A. Only by the step, as usual.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether you knew that on the day before the woman had separated from her husband? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard a step of a child, you supposed it was Sally going up the stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard Sally go up stairs to her father, when they were in the room did you hear any noise? - A. I heard the quill-wheel go, and I heard the man weaving, I heard the noise of the loom.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you heard the girl, as you supposed, at the quill-wheel, and the man weaving, that Godby came in? - A. Not above half an hour, as I supposed.</p>
               <p>Q. When Godby came to you, he gave you some information, and you went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any body go down stairs before Godby came to you? - A. Before Godby came, I thought I heard a woman go down stairs, and I thought I heard a man's foot; I saw neither of them, I did not open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing else before Godby came? - A. No, a man knocked at my door, I asked who was there.</p>
               <p>Q. It turned out to be Godby? - A. Yes, he went up with me; I stood upon the top of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090009"/>stairs, I was afraid to go any farther, I saw the child lying in her gore of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time, or any future time, the wound? - A. No; I called out, murder! to Mr. Byron, my landlord, he came up, but I was afraid to go any further.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 18th of December, between the hours of twelve and one? - A. Yes; he came to my apartment, No. 26, Skinner-street, Shoreditch.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what passed between you, distinctly? - A. I was at work; he knocked at the door, I let him in; he asked me to come down stairs with him, he had something particular to communicate to me; I pointed out to him the inconveniency of leaving my work, and absolutely refused to go unless he would tell me his business; he rejoined, something had happened that day that had never happened before, he should go to Newgate; seeing him in that violent purturbation I reluctantly left my work, anxious to know the cause of it; he went down stairs, and I went down soon after, and found him at the street-door, we went about fifty yards from our door, and with a countenance full of grief he turned round to me, and said, Ned, I shall die; I asked him what was the matter with him, or what had happened, thinking there might be a degree of illness about him: he said, directly, I have killed my Sally; I asked him if the child was dead; he said, yes, I have cut her head half off. It was a severe cold morning, and he shivered with cold, and desired me to go into a public-house that he might warm himself, and have something to drink; I went with him into the first public-house we came to, which was the Cock and Magpie, in Worship-street; we had a pot of beer, he called for it, and a pipe of tobacco, the landlord filled him a pipe with tobacco; there were three men and a woman, strangers entirely to me, in the tap-room; he said, sit down, I have something to say to you; seeing them strangers I thought it imprudent to speak before them, desiring him, at the same time, if he had any thing to say to me not to say it there; we might be a quarter of an hour there probably, in that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not say any thing there? - A. No; then we went out, and he resumed the discourse; I asked him what he was going to do, and what he meant to do with himself; he said he was going to Sun-Tavern-fields, Wapping, to see two friends of his, who were rope-makers, who would, when he was in prison, allow him a shilling or two; he then asked me when the Sessions would begin, I told him; he said, he should give himself up to Justice, and suffer, with this remark, - what odds will it make to me if they cut me into a thousand pieces, when I go hundreds will go at the same minute; I told him he should not have killed his child; he looked me in the face, and said, I know that, do not you retort on me now, it is done; I accompanied him as far nearly as Whitechapel church, and then shewed him the necessity of my returning to my business, I shook him by the hand, and saw him no more till I saw him at the office before the Magistrate; when the Magistrate sent for me, I gave the same account then, nearly, as I have given now.</p>

On Tuesday the 18th of December, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I received information that the prisoner was in Hare-street, at his daughter's; I went, in company with Bishop, a brother officer, to No. 24, Wheeler-street; I went up into the garret of that house, and there I saw the body of the deceased, lying with her head towards the door, about two feet from the door, with no cap on, and her throat cut across all the arteries, and cut through the wind-pipe, she was done bleeding, the blood was warm lying on the floor; I looked round just by the fire-place, I saw the quill-wheel, and on the block of that wheel was a quantity of blood, and there was a track of blood from the wheel to where the body laid, which might be about a yard; there was a low stool close by the wheel, where a person might be sitting down to work at the wheel; a razor was lying on the ground close by the side of that wheel, and there I got this razor, covered with fresh blood; between the wheel and the body of the child I found this cap, it had fell from her head, it is stained with blood, I saw there was no prospect of restoring life; I enquired if there was any one there belonging to the child, the room was full of people; I then, with the assistance of Bishop, put them out of the room, as there was property in the room belonging to the master of the prisoner; I took Godby and Byron to the Magistrate; we were all that day, and all that night searching after him, till about twelve o'clock at night; Armstrong, Mason, Bishop, and I, were together, we received information then that he was in custody, and was in Spitalfields watch-house, we went there to satisfy ourselves; when we went into the watch-house, the prisoner was sitting by the watch-house fire, he turned his head round and saw me, he said, Kennedy, I have given you some trouble to-day; Armstrong said to him, what do you mean by that; he answered, in searching after me; Armstrong then said to him, is your name Mitchell; he said, it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him? - A. I had seen him before; I have known him for these five or six years. Armstrong said, I have seen a razor and a cap today in the possession of Kennedy; do you know you are charged with killing your daughter, and the razor and cap was found in your room; he then answered, with that razor I have often shaved myself, and with that razor I committed the horrid deed; Mr. Armstrong gave the warrant to the officer of the night, and left him in the watch-house; there were no signs of blood about him at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Dellafour.) Q. I would ask you whether, at the time you saw the prisoner, you observed any thing about his person? - A. I forgot to mention that when I was at the public-house, I observed on two of his fingers on one of his hands, a small quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think? - A. Very trifling, not more than would come from the prick of a pin.</p>

            , Esq."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I stand here before you a horrid spectacle of misery, of guilt, and of disgrace. I will endeavour to be as collected in my reason as possible, though unhappily for me, at certain times and seasons, I am particularly under heavy pressures of mind, which my wife well knows, and was well aware of it. That I have committed the horrid deed laid to my charge, I have no wish to deny, any more than I have to avoid the dreadful punishment that awaits my guilt, to that I am resigned, nor was it my wish from the unfortunate moment of my crime, to evade justice; but that I committed the deed maliciously against my poor child, who was the victim of my fatal passion, I solemnly deny. I loved my child, and I hope no one will think it was done in malice. I solemnly declare it was not, in the presence of God, before whom I now stand, and before whom I must shortly appear, and whom I hope will direct you and guide you in your decision upon me in the course of this day; for malice I had none, I loved her most tenderly, and love to the child, wishing her not to be from me, strange and perverse as it may seem, is owing chiefly the sad cause that brings me here this day. I am married to a second wife, by whom this was our only daughter; we had long known each other before our marriage, when I was in better days; and when she and I were the wife and husband of others, I thought I could be happy with her, but I did not know the nature and temper of her family; I found afterwards the friends and family with which she was connected, thought her marriage to me degrading. As her family disliked the union, she knew me well, why did not she avoid having me. What has occurred was done through the height of passion and despair, as disputes and controversies had taken place between us for ten years, in which unhappily both were in fault too much so. Those disputes were often carried to a pitch of fury, and what still more exasperated me was, that those she called her friends, always sided with her whether right or wrong; and, what is still worse, they would put their hands to mischief; and many of them, I am sorry to say, were strenuous professors of religious principles. May the Lord forgive them and me, and take me to himself! Our disputes at last ended in a mutual agreement to separate, and the child I so tenderly loved was to go with her mother. This my unhappy temper and feeling could not bear, and led me to the fatal resolution that neither she nor I should have the child, by committing the horrid deed of putting an end to her life, in the manner I have done. I pray God Almighty to forgive me, and to direct you in it, and may this spectacle I now stand be a warning to those who form second marriages, if they meet with double families, to have more love to their duty than giving way to intemperate disputes that may lead them, as they have done me, to acts of desperation and vengeance beyond the controul of reason and reflection! If my wife was present, she could vouch and prove that it was impossible I could ever have deliberately executed such an act; she could vouch that my disposition is not cruel, and that my resolutions have always led me to the side of virtue; but as here I stand, in the presence of God, when unfortunately under agitations of mind or provocations of temper, I am not really the same man at all times, and my weakness, under such circumstances, when I have been under the most resolute purposes for good, have very frequently led me into excesses of frenzy. I have often felt it, and I have wondered at it; in cool moments it has often astonished me how I could do so. There was a circumstance that happened to me at one time; my own business failed me, it has often failed me, and I frequently, when I could get no work at my own business, used to strike out to out-door work; but once in particular when I could get no work, forced by distress to apply for relief at my parish-workhouse, there was something that disappointed me, I had come too late in the day, and because I was disappointed, I broke as many windows as cost the parish four pounds, and yet the parish-officers did not punish me, though they might. I have no more to to say, but I hope God will of his infinite mercy forgive me; I must die a spectacle of sin, disgrace, and horror.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There was a single point I have got to mention, which I wish my wife was here, she could attest the truth of what I am going to say; that when I have been the most resolute to good purposes, that frailty and weakness would often prevent it; she was well acquainted with my misery, I have been frequently so, as well as my mother, an old woman, that was sensible, and yet at times she would go the same way; she has often<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090012"/>asked me to cut her hair, for unless her hair was kept cut in a particular close manner, her weakness was upon her so as it has been with me.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 5th of November last, did any thing happen to that house? - A. On the night of the 5th of November, I was in the office till near eleven o'clock, the clerks had quitted their office about nine o'clock; when the clerks had quitted their office, I was sitting in my office with the door open, and my groom came in, from the door in Tudor-street, to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door fastened? - A. I heard the door shut, and the groom came in, and had some conversation with Mr. Le Blanc; I heard Mr. Le Blanc go out, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out at the door in Bridge-street? - A. Yes; I went to bed about half past eleven o'clock, I got up the next morning about half past seven o'clock, when I received some information; I went into my own office, and found the uppermost drawer on the right-hand side of the desk broken open, the lock had been attempted to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090014"/>forced, and the mahogany that the lock was fastened to had been cut out; they had forced it open by a poker, or some such instrument, and in that part of the mahogany that had been forced away I found this screw, (producing it); I observed on my desk a number of papers that were in the drawer when I went to bed the preceding night; on my examining the drawer, I missed the several articles mentioned in the indictment, and some others.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen this drawer the night before? - A. Yes, I had only occasion to pay money out of the drawer; I had left it locked the preceding night with these articles in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a miniature picture set in gold, a pocket compass, a leather bag, and a canvas bag? - A. Yes, and eleven half-guineas; there were more seven-shilling pieces than the number in the indictment, but I am not really certain how many.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any crown-pieces? - A. Yes, and half-crowns, and about three pounds in shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a French crown? - A. Yes, and French half-crowns, and there was a foreign coin that passes in the East-Indies, called a Macarony.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Bills of Exchange? - A. One of 3007 l. 8 s. 11 d. another for 500 l. another for 434 l. 14 s. another for 100 l. another for 25 l. one for 500 l. and another for 360 l.; three Bank-notes of five pounds each, and two of two pounds each; a great number of one-pound notes, and certainly more than is in the indictment, and one note of twenty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. After this robbery had been committed by somebody, did you obtain a search-warrant? - A. No; I obtained a warrant on the 17th of November, to apprehend the prisoner, Mr. Nalder, the City Marshall, and Mr. Tipper, possessed themselves of it, and another constable: we went to the house of the prisoner, the corner of Suffolk-street, Dirty-lane, in the Borough, the King's-arms public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to that house what did you first do? - A. The constable seized the prisoner, and as soon as he was secured, I desired Mr. Tipper to accompany me; we went up one pair of stairs into the bed-room, and in that room we searched and found a trunk, it was locked, and when we had searched the different parts of the house, I went below; and desired the mother of the prisoner to come up stairs, the key was brought up by Mr. Nalder, and Mr. Tipper unlocked the trunk, I produce the trunk, and the first thing I put my hand upon was a canvas bag, I immediately said, this is mine; the next was the pocket-compass, this compass was in the canvas bag, the ribbon was hanging out of the bag, that was in my desk on the night of the 5th of November; I found this miniature picture in the bag, that was in my desk on the night of the 5th of November; the Bills of Exchange for 3007 l. 8 s. 11 d. for 500 l. for 434 l. 14 s. for 100 l. and one for 25 l. were all in the bag, and this bag I kept the silver in; I did not then examine any further; we found the prisoner's pocketbook, it was opened by Mr. Nalder before the Lord-Mayor, in my presence; and in one of the pockets was this bill for 360 l. which was due, and was in my drawer on the 5th of November.</p>

               <p>Q. Your brother resides in the house? - A. He has not for some years, he did about five or six years ago, we never both jointly lived there; he built a new house, and when that house was finished, he gave up this to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your yard is paved with very rough stones, so as the waggon might be put in such a position that a package might tumble out? - A. It was not rough at all where the waggon stood.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher, I live in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner carry the sheep out of the shop, I did not see him take it; it was a carcase of mutton, and as he carried it out of the shop, he dropped the cloth from off his shoulder; he took it out of one butcher's shop, and went into the next shop with it, and when he came out of that shop, I gave him the cloth; he said it was his; I told Mr. Scales what I had seen; we then went across the way, and fetched him back, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of this carcase of mutton that was in this shop? - A. Mr. Scales had it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this man who went into that shop with the carcase of mutton was the same man who took it out of Mr. Scales' shop? - A. I am sure, I never lost sight of him; it was about seven o'clock in the evening last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Scales.) You had an information against this man by the witness - you went across the road, and took him? - A. Yes; I took him back into my shop; I went into the shop where the sheep was, I knew it to be my sheep; he said he knew nothing about it, he did not take it; I then asked him his name; he told me,

               <p>Q. You are sure it was your sheep? - A. I am certain of that; the next butcher does not kill mutton, and that was the only sheep there was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know myself very innocent of the crime alledged against me; I was going over the way; this gentleman took me on the shoulder, and shoved me along, and said, you have stole a sheep of mine, will you come to the shop along with me; I said, by all means I will; they overhauled my cloaths to see if I had any grease about me; I had no grease whatever about my clothes; that man said I had it on my back; I am a hardworking man, I have been with Lord Nelson at Egypt; I belonged last summer to Alderman Curtis's pleasure boat.</p>

               <p>Q. How is that hen-house with regard to your dwelling-house? - A. There is a coal-house that joins to the hen-roost, the coal-house is next to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it all under one roof, and connected together? - A. It is the same nature as the brewhouse, but not of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you and your man pursue him? - A. Yes, and we found him in the lane; as soon as we came to a waggon, we asked the waggoner if he had seen a man with any poultry; he said, he was the off-side of the waggon, and he pulled the poultry out of the waggon in a moment, and said he had just put them in; the waggoner was quite a young fellow, I was obliged to hold the prisoner down by the butt-end of the gun; he said he would lick us all.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you find him next? - A. I found him along with the waggon, I asked the waggoner where he was; he said, he was the off-side of the waggon, and the poultry was in the waggon, and there we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sure that that man you found with this waggon was the same man you saw in the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Are you quite sure that this poultry was your's? - A. Here is my wife here that will swear to them; she had put some red rags round their legs to mark them for store-ducks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been going about for work, I was coming down the road, and these men met me; they began knocking me about, I thought they were going to take my life away from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Has any more been found besides this single spoon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - sworn. - I am one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street: On the 30th of December, I was sent for while the prisoner was in custody to receive him into my custody, at the watch-house, St. Giles's, where I immediately searched him, and in his right-hand coat-pocket I found this spoon, in a pocket-book; on Monday morning I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090025"/>to Bow-street, Mrs. Magrath came forward, and swore to it, and he was committed.

I am a private soldier, I belong to the 23d regiment of foot, I never was servant to captain Shaw, I only came up with him; as he was an officer, he said, he would renew the pass to Sunday morning following, neither did he trust me with any property whatever; I never received any property from the woman.</p>

             sent to me to go down and look at this bacon; I asked him how much he had got of it, and where he got it; he said, it was a very unfair question; I told him that a neighbour of mine, that rented a shop of me, had her shop broke open on Sunday morning; then I asked him what he gave for it; he said he gave two shillings a stone for it; I said, you have bought it cheap enough; I said he could get money by it; he said he could tell me where he bought it, and if I would send the young woman down he would tell her; as soon as she went down, the bacon was gone; I saw three large pieces.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go and tell her? - A. Not directly;

             told me when she went it was gone; the wife told her he had taken it back to the person he had bought it of, and when we got the warrant, he and the bacon were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In point of fact did he not surrender himself? - A. Yes, he sent word afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. It is old rusty bacon? - A. No, it is bacon of two years old.</p>
               <p>Q. It is an inferior sort? - A. It is old bacon, the salt eats away the rhind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What might it be worth? - A. You can buy it at one place at 3 s. a stone; you could not buy it at other places under 3 s. 6 d. a stone, at 8 lb. to the stone; that is the wholesale price.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in bacon? - A. Not now, I have.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) Did you go to the shop of the prisoner after Mr. Pike had been there? - A. Yes; I told him I had come to see the bacon; he said he had sent it all away to the person he had bought it of; he told me I could not hurt him, he could tell me the person he bought it of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he? - A. No; I told him if he would not tell me, he must be made to tell; I left the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You went directly from the shop; you did not give him time to tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not tell you, and when you came back the bacon was gone and the prisoner too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When Mr. Pike came to me to see the bacon, he saw it in the shop; while he was looking at it I said to him, here is some more of it; he saw it all; I then had a man who had bought two hocks, I told him; and I said, if you please, I will go, and fetch the two hocks from the people, if possible, perhaps there may be some marks on them; he said he did not think it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090026"/>the bacon, it was too wet to be her's; I told him I could sell it all, a man had bid me 7 d. a pound for it, it was all open in the shop, and if I had known it had been stolen, I would not have put it there; the man came back that bid me the money, and I let the man have it that bid me the most money for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you? - A. No, he gave me a push upon some steps; he laid hold of my arm and set me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take? - A. A little box of tickets, a shilling, and a night-cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the shilling? - A. In my pocket, he took them out all at once, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - A. No, I know him because I could see him by the lamps; I did not call for assistance, because there was nobody to call to, and I was frightened; there were duplicates of a pair of blankets, a gold wire to put over a ring, a silk handkerchief, a waistcoat, and a coloured apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes, I had but one glass, and that could not fuddle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any beer that day? - A.Yes, about a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your husband? - A. At sea.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning? - A. None; the woman gave me the shilling to get something to drink; she is very bad, in Love-lane, and her husband is at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tumble down, instead of being pushed down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry any bottle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had the shilling in your hand to pay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the shilling was in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you never said you would not have prosecuted this man, if it had not been for Mr. Brown, who told you there was 40 l. reward? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said so to Mr. Duff? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to the pawnbroker, that you lost the box, and it was not taken from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner the day after? - A. Yes, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not say you had never seen him before? - A. No, I never saw him before to speak to him; I said I had never spoke to him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you complain of this transaction? - A. I went to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown told you of the reward? - A. No, I never heard it till now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had the shilling and bottle in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner play? - A. The landlord said he would take one hand with him, if he would walk out of the house afterwards; the prisoner agreed, and pulled out a two-pound note, and so did Davis; they were both given to Copers; a squabble took place, and Davis wanted his note back.</p>
               <p>Q. The landlord desired him to go off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Davis asked for, was his own two-pound note? - A. Yes; Mr. Davis desired him to walk out, and the prisoner said, I will not for you nor any b - r in the town; Copers said, I will back you for fifty pounds, or a hundred; the prisoner struck the landlord on the face, and after he had beat the landlord he robbed me of two one-pound notes; the landlord came up again; then the prisoner asked for the two-pound; Mr. Copers pulled out a one-pound note, which was Mr. Davis's; I do not know whether Mr. Copers gave the two one-pound notes to the prisoner, or not; he asked me for it; I said I have only got a one-pound note, which I laid down on the table; I said, that is not the note; Mr. Davis said, no; the prisoner at the bar put his hand over to the one-pound note, and tore it in half, and put it in his breeches pocket; I said, do not rob me; yes, he said, you b - r, I will rob you, and you shall not take it again; I begged him to give it me; he called me a d - d b - r, and struck me over the face; I struck the prisoner, and knocked him on the floor, and when he came to me again, I knocked him down again; then they said, if I was a man, I should give him room; I knocked him down again; after that he acknowledged that he had robbed me of two one-pound notes; he said, Mr. Armstrong, I beg you will not take the law of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say he had robbed you? - A. He spoke the same words that I have said myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Give us the same words over again? - A. He said, Mr. Armstrong, I acknowledge I have robbed you of two one-pound notes, I will give them to you, and ten pounds to-morrow, I have none about me now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for robbing you, or striking you? - A. I take it, for robbing me; the prisoner wished to leave off, as he had the worst of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Copers say any thing then? - A. He said they were school-fellows, and he would give me ten pounds, or twenty pounds, if I would not take the law of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time? - A.He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Being in liquor yourself? - A. Yes; this woman, the prisoner, sat down in the same box where I was sitting, and when I came out of the public-house to go home, Mr. Scholey asked me if I had my property about me; I put my hand to my sob, and found my watch was gone, and my money out of my pocket; he wanted me to go back; I, being in liquor, did not, but desired him to look after it, and the next morning I found the prisoner in the watch-house; I did not know that I had lost the watch till I came out of the public-house.</p>

             sworn. - Last Saturday night I went out on duty in the King's road, at nine o'clock, and about ten o'clock my wife came to me, and informed me of the circumstance; I asked my wife, if I met with this person, whether she could swear to her; she said, yes, she could; I took her before two o'clock in the morning, as she was going up Gray's Inn-lane; I took her to my wife to see whether she could say she was the person, or no, and when my wife saw her, she said, that is the person that robbed me; I said to the prisoner, return me the property, and I will have no more to do with you; then she denied that she took the property, and as I was taking her to the watch-house, she acknowledged that she took the property, and had pawned it, and she had the ticket in her pocket; she gave me the ticket and the money, but my wife would not take it; when I came to look at it, there was only three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I know the prisoner by coming to our shop several times; I know the cloak, I took it in myself of her; she was the person, I can swear to her. (The cloak produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please you, my Lord, I was very intimate with these people; I went on Saturday night to this woman's house, and told her I was deficient of a little money, and I was going to meet a person; if she would lend me a trifle, I would bring it her to-morrow; she said she could not lend me any money, but she would give me something to make it on, but she did not wish her husband to know it, which she did accordingly; I went to this pawnbroker's, where I have dealt a number of years; if I had stole the cloak I would not have gone where I had been known so many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090029"/>years; I bought a small article out of the money I had pledged the cloak for; I gave the man the rest of the money, and the ticket; they accepted of the money, and the ticket, and when I was at the watch-house, they returned the money again; since I have been in the milk business, because she could not drink tea to do her good, as she had an asthma on her lungs, I have sent her bottles of neat milk from the cow to do her good.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Please-you, my Lord, I never took an oath before a Judge or Jury in my life till now, and I will take my oath I never saw the woman before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Can you speak God's truth, Macdonald - do not you know me? - A. No more than any other woman in the neighbourhood; I know you by seeing you in the street, that is all I know of you.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have seen her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a milk-woman? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My cousin is a milk-woman.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutor.) Q. How came you to know this woman had robbed your wife, when you met her by accident in Gray's Inn-lane? - A. When I came home to my wife, I said, can you describe the woman to me; yes, said she, she is a very big woman, with a full breast, and she wears a bonnet like a scuttle; with that I went out, and found her a little before two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, this is the ribbon that she bought for my cousin, being so kind in sending the new milk to her; I am telling you the truth, if you please to hang me up this minute.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw this evidently enough? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was close fast too? - A. It was upon a single latch; he went up close to the door, trying to open it, in a kind of fly way.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been inside of the house before? - A. No, not that day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What paper is it? - A. Printing demy.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have plenty of that paper; is there any private mark upon it that you can possibly distinguish it from any other paper that might be found at any other wholesale dealer's? - A. I cannot pretend to swear to any particular mark upon it, I can say I saw it in the warehouse that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us any particular mark? - A. There is no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Did you miss any paper before you heard it was gone? - A. I only knew it through my neighbour, I was up stairs at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays the rent of the house? - A. Myself and partner; we pay jointly in proportion, I allow my partner something for the dwelling, and the partnership comprises the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been distressed, and several times Mr. Champante has thrown me back, though he has had thousands that came from my father abroad; I have been put on one side as a beggar; I unfortunately lost a trifle of money, I have applied to him upon several occasions, and could get no relief.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What answer do you make to this charge, because no distress should make a young man like you do this; tied to no country, you could get your bread any where.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I had seen him frequently before, I knew him by sight; he said he wanted some arrow-root, but he thought ours was not very good, but he might call again if we had not shut up shop when he came back; with that he went out of the shop, and I went up stairs to get some candles for the shop; when I brought the candles into the shop, I saw his face appear through the glass-door; I said to my fellow-servant, that I thought Williamson was the person that took the two glass bottles we had lost three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. He was outside was he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his name? - A. Yes; I knew his name before.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you only knew him by sight? - A. I did not know any more of him; with that, I told my partner we had better put out the lights in the accompting-house, and one of us go on each side of the door, which we did; and in the course of five minutes he opened the door, and came into the shop, and made towards the window; a gentleman came into the shop for some pill-boxes, and he then ran out of the shop directly; as soon as I served the gentleman I went into the accompting-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090031"/>again, the clock struck eight; I said to my partner, we had better shut up the shop windows; he said, no, stop a few minutes; with that, he came in again directly, and made towards the window, and took the bottle out of the window; we followed him to the door, he held the door on the outside, and we pulled on the inside, till he let go; and as soon as we got out of the door we cried out stop thief; he turned round the corner of Bevis-Marks, and as he ran, he threw the bottle down, and broke it; I then got hold of him, and took him to the shop; I saw him take the bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. When the gentleman went out, did you see him shut the door? - A. The door was shut, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. On the day laid in the indictment, were you in London? - A. I was in London on the 29th of October, and about eleven o'clock at night I was returning down <placeName id="t18050109-35-crimeloc184">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. At last you did go? - A. As a man who has the fear of the Maker of an oath in his heart, I did not stop above a minute or two with her; I felt something move from my side, and seeing her hand going to her bosom, I seized hold of her hand, and felt the pocket-book in her hand; I was positive of having it, and when I put my hand in my side pocket it was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen your pocket-book before? - A. In Fetter-lane, about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - A. It must contain what I had in it at the time of my coming out; it contained a twenty-five-pound Bank-note, a forty-pound, and a five-pound Bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave home for the purpose of coming to London? - A. When I came to town it might be about three o'clock. Finding my pocket-book was gone when I got to St. Bride's passage, I laid hold of her hand, she cried out murder, and she said was I going to rob her; the watchman never offered to move.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman? - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to where you were? - A. It might be about the distance from where I stand to where the prisoner stands, or not quite so much.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the watchman? - A. Yes, when I came down to the watchman, I took hold of both the woman's hands, and brought her down to the box, as he did not move up to me; I told the watchman to take charge of this woman, and that she had robbed me; says he, I will not take her in charge, I won't take her he said, for you will say I have taken your pocket-book; I was obliged to do his duty, and she walked very readily with me to the watch-house; she then was searched by the constable of the night before me, and no book being found, my suspicion immediately turned to the watchman, as no object being near in the street but him, but the constable gave so good an account of him it staggered my opinion, I did not take him in custody that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards you proceeded against the woman, and the bill was thrown out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how soon you took up the prisoner? - A. On the second day of the December Sessions he was taken in Chancery-lane, by

               <p>Q. I suppose you were not perfectly sober to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090033"/>take up with such a sort of a woman as that - were you sober or drunk? - A. Sober, as I believe, from my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Some men have not their recollection when they are drunk? - A. I had drank a chearful glass, and a chearful glass will not make a person drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a plain question to answer - were you sober or drunk? - A. Sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you, as a sober man, took up with such a woman as this, and went down Bride's passage with her? - A. It was in my way to Blackfriars-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pick the woman up, she picked you up? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After you lost your pocket-book, you took hold of both her hands, you never let her hands go till you took her to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had seen your pocket-book, and the contents of it, a little time before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watchman in his box? - A. He seemed to remain in the dark side outside of his box.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not charge him with this that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you took the prisoner before the Alderman, and heard his confession, were you drunk or sober then? - A. Sober.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. The moment you felt something go from you pocket, and when she put her hand to her breast, you put your hand on this woman's hand, did you feel the pocket-book there? - A. I felt it in her hand, but somehow or other she seemed to get rid of it; while she was crying out murder, she struggled much, and by that means it gave her an opportunity of parting with it from her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the watchman to where she was? - A. He might be about the distance from where I stand to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. She cried out for him to hear? - A. Yes, she cried out very loud, but he never came to my assistance nor to her's.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it the appearance of being defaced? - A. It has; there was A. Miller, Coach and Horses, Deans' yard, Westminster, marked on the pot, and on the handle was engraved, No. 5, but the figure of 5, on the bottom, was not engraved; we left the pots at the scourer's, as we found them, and proceeded to the prisoner's house; the scouring woman came into the house with a basket full of pots and pints; she delivered them into the custody of Mr. Kaley, down on the tap room table, and before I had said any thing to him about the pots, a publican came in, and asked him, if he had not got some of his pots; he examined the pots, and Mr. Mitchell, that was along with me, said, you have got one of mine; he claimed one, Clifford claimed one, and I claimed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pot in your hand, the pot you saw at the scourer's? - A. Yes; he said they were not our pots, he had bought them at a sale, and we had better not take them away without proper authority, if we did it would be worse for us, he would take us before a Magistrate; we told him we would not give him the trouble of going to a Magistrate, we would go ourselves, which Mr. Mitchell and I did, and they immediately sent an order, and brought him before them; he was examined how he came possessed of these pots, to prove which, he said he bought them of a respectable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090034"/>broker; the broker was sent for, and by his books he denied having ever sold those pots to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There was a sale of a publican's goods, some misfortune had happened to him, in consequence, there was a sale of all the pots he had in his house; the prisoner said he purchased those pots at his sale? - A. The prisoner said he bought them of that man, pointing to the number in the catalogue; the broker said, the pots I sold at the sale were to a blind man, but they are not the pots.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Queen-square, he had not absconded? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The mark is defaced on the handle but remains perfect at the bottom? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Officer of Queen-square; I apprehended him on the 5th of January; I have got six quart pots at home and five pints, besides what I produce here; they are all defaced, and some of them with his own name put on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you? - A. He said he had bought them at a sale.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man that sold me the pots went about selling Jews pots, his name was Green; it is all spite and malice of the publicans in the neighbourhood; when I first took the house it had but little custom to it; I brought the house round from three butts of beer a month to three butts a week; the publicans in the neighbourhood have even sent people into the house to quarrel with me, on purpose to ruin the house; the house for many years went up seven stone steps; I took them away, and made the tap-room and bar level with the ground, but seeing how I was envied, I agreed to let the house; the pots I bought of this man on the same morning of the sale, part of them he marked in the house that day, but on account of the small engraver, the edge being broke, he could not mark them all; I said to him, you must be sharp, because I am leaving the house; I did not with to stop at Westminster.</p>

Yes; I was certain I had seen him before; I asked him where he lived; he said he lived over the water; I asked him where he had been; he said he had been at his laundress's, she lived in Crown-court, Liquor-pond-street; I thought it looked singular, as he had a dirty shirt on, and no bundle; I went to enquire; he gave several references over the water, where he said he worked, but all false. On Monday, when he was examined, finding all that he had said was false, we sent him down for another examination, where he remained till Thursday; and on Thursday, not giving a good account of himself, he was sent on board the Tender, and between that and Saturday I found that he had returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090035"/>from transportation; I applied to Mr. Leech for an order to fetch him from on board, and they gave him up.</p>

When you apprehended the two men, and took them into custody, what sort of a house was this; were there not a good many people that inhabited this house? - A. It is a house where the girls of the town live, and where the woman of the house was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You found two men in bed together? - A. Yes, up stairs there were other lodgings that were let to two girls; the woman that inhabited that room was sent to Bridewell Precinct.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This room had been inhabited by a woman who was in custody? - A. Yes, it had been occupied by that woman who lived with Kemp; she had been in custody about three weeks, the prisoner told me so, and he said, he had been in possession of that room since that woman had been in custody.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Look at that canister? - A. It is my canister; I know it by the mark inside of it, No. 4, and by a scratch made in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. When was that mark made? - A. By the supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he makes that mark wherever he goes? - A. No, sir, when he comes the first time he always marks it.</p>
               <p>Q. So he always does to every shop? - A. I know this is my canister.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the appearance of it, as well as the marks, do you know it to be your canister? - A. Yes, I had it nine months last Lady-day; that canister was in my house and full of tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taken with that canister in the room, and I have people to come forward that will prove, that I have had that canister a twelvemonth; at the Office they asked them if they could swear to the canister, she said she could; they asked her what marks were on it; she said, no marks at all; they asked her particularly if there was any mark at the bottom; she said she was never so particular as to look; there is a mark and it is stamped; they asked her what tea was in the canister; she said it was full of green tea; when I was taken there were about four ounces of black and green tea; I will call a witness to prove that I have had this canister a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. I shall advise you to let the case stand where it does.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who said they had known him about four or five months, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this piece of print? - A. Hanging outside of the door, on a round piece of iron, on the left-hand side of the door; the prisoner at the bar, and an elderly woman, were together, the elderly woman stood right fronting the door, and the prisoner stood on the left-hand side; they went away about twenty yards, and they had a little bit of discourse, I do not know what they said, I was not high enough to hear them; they came back again to the same place, and looked at the same print, and the prisoner at the bar unpinned it, and then went away about twenty yards again; they came back again to the same place, and looked at the same print they had unpinned; the elderly woman still kept her place towards the door, for a little while, and the prisoner at the bar snatched it off; they both then went away, looking at it for a little time, and then the elderly woman went a different way; I then run across the way, and told the gentleman that a woman had taken a piece of print from the door; the shopman and the master came out directly, and the shopman ran after the prisoner; I am very certain the prisoner at the bar is the woman that took it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wilder.) When you were informed of this by the boy, what did you do? - A. I pursued her, and took her with this print; when I came up to her she threw the print down, and dropped on her knees, and begged that I would forgive her. (The property produced, and identified by

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. What was the prisoner? - A. I took the prisoner as my <rs id="t18050109-45-deflabel236" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. When did you miss these articles? - A. In the month of November last, from information that I then had, I applied to Bow-street for a search-warrant; I saw the things taken out of the box by the Officer; it was a box of mine, but I had no particular use for it; I desired him to send up all the keys of what I had in the house; having some suspicion, he sent every key whatever, except the key of this trunk; he appropriated this trunk intirely to himself, it contained every thing of his own property; when I saw the contents of this trunk, the thing that struck me most was the handkerchiefs, and from what I understood, he had accused the other servants of taking them; what we found in that trunk he owned; the four handkerchiefs and the two card-racks were found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090039"/>in that trunk at my house, No. 3, York-street, Baker-street, Westminster, on the 24th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Those things were found in your box; do you know them to be your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed them in November? - A. I was informed of it in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned any thing to the prisoner of the loss of cambric handkerchiefs? - A. No, I did not, because he mentioned it to me on my arrival in the house of the four handkerchiefs being lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep these handkerchiefs in York-street? - A. They should have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the handkerchiefs lost before the watch was missing? - A. I believe the watch was missing many months before the handkerchiefs; I was informed of them both on the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner at the bar had accompanied you to Ireland? - A. Yes, I arrived in Ireland on the first of August, and remained there till the 21st of November.</p>
               <p>Q. During all this time the prisoner was attending you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether this watch was in Ireland? - A. I do not recollect it, if it had, I should have taken notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not seen the watch at the hotel? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. The intelligence you received of the loss of your four handkerchiefs was immediately upon your return from Ireland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the prisoner to have appropriated them to his own use, can you say it was done in your house in York-street, or that it was not done in Ireland? - A. I cannot say whether it was done in Ireland; they were found in his possession after my return to York-street; I received information from the prisoner himself, saying, that there were four handkerchiefs lost, and after he had had some conversation about some other servants, he charged them with taking them; with respect to the watch, I had delivered it to the housekeeper, for the use of the servants, when I took the house in York-street, there being no clock in the house, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Therefore, if it had been taken down, it was not by your own knowledge? - A. Certainly not.</p>

I do not know, I asked the prisoner if he had got the watch, and he said no, and about three weeks or a fortnight ago I asked him if he had got the watch, he said he had not, and he told me not to bother him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in his own room; - A. Yes; he was at his chest of drawers, and I turned round and saw the watch in his hand, I said nothing about it at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the box contain? - A. Wearing-apparel belonging to the prisoner; there was no property in the trunk belonging to Mr. Dillon, but what is mentioned in the indictment; and on the 26th I went to Dixley and took the prisoner into custody, at his Lordship's house; I told him I had a warrant for him from his master, charging him with stealing a number of things belonging to his master, and that, among other articles, he was charged with stealing a silver watch or time-piece; he said the time-piece he had in his trunk; I took the key from him immediately, and took him into custody; I unlocked it, and he put his hand down and pulled the watch out; the flannel shirt was in the trunk at Dixley; the stockings were in a sort of drawers in his room; they were locked up with some of his own things; he said he put them there to send them to wash, but being only three pair, he had not sent them; he always kept them to a greater quantity to send to the washerwoman's. - (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) What is the value of the watch? - A. Twenty shillings; the flannel shirt, 2 s. 6 d. the cambric handkerchiefs, 1 s. each; I know they are mine, and I am certain I did not give them to him; and the card-racks, 6 d. I am sure they were in my possession; they are either mine or General - .</p>

Yes, and I received another letter before he came to Marlow, wherein he informed me he was coming into the country, and he would make Great Marlow in his way back to town, for half an hour's conversation, he said, would do more than a week's correspondence by letter.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this letter he came to you? - A. Yes, he came in about nine o'clock in the morning; he said his name was Moreton, and acknowledged this letter; I then began talking to him, about this bill of 75 l. 16 s. 7 d. I wanted to get discounted; I asked him upon what terms; he said he knew the nature of these things, he must not charge any more than 5 l. per cent. but he must charge the expenses down to Marlow; he then asked me to let him have the bills; I said I did not like to part with the bills out of my possession; he then asked me for a copy; I sat down and wrote him a copy; he stated the inconvenience of doing a bill of 75 l. he only having a hundred pound in his possession, he wanted me to make it up a hundred.</p>

               <p>Q. When Moreton held up his hand, did you see Spraggs then? - A. I did, but before I got out of the door they both disappeared.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You never heard any thing of your bills afterwards till in point of fact Moreton was taken up? - A. Never: On the 13th of December, near three months afterwards, I came up to London; I was walking up Parliament-street with Mr. Goldsmith, and met Spraggs in Parliament-street; I challenged him with his name; Spraggs said, do you want to say any thing to me; I said, no, but here is a friend of mine does, pointing to Mr. Goldsmith; with that they both talked together, and I walked a little way behind them; I heard Mr. Spraggs mention Mr. Ticken's bills; I went up to Mr. Spraggs, and told him my name was Ticken; Mr. Spraggs said, if possible, he would get my bills back again; if I would behave like a gentleman, he thought probably he might do something for me; Mr. Goldsmith made an appointment to meet him the same evening at eight o'clock, at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; he refused to give his address.</p>

He was crossing; I saw them within two yards of each other; it appeared to me that they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether they went one way or separate ways? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. When Mason came out of the White Horse cellar with the bills, did you hear him say where he was going to? - A. He said he was going into St. James's street, and that he would be with me in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go? - A. In fact, for a minute or two, I did not know what to do; some time elapsed before I did any thing; when I came out of the door of the White Horse to look after him I had left my hat; I went back to get my hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was it necessary for him to have crossed the street, in his way to St. James's street? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. He did cross the way to where Spraggs was standing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew where you lived because he had been at your house? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You never after heard of him till you saw him at Bow-street? - A. Never.</p>

I told him we were going to Mr. Julian; he said, you had better not go to Mr. Julian, he did not behave handsome to me in the last, for the stiller and the quieter we were in this business the better; he then asked me whether I had seen Mason; I told him no; Mr. Ticken made answer, I hope I shall see him in half an hour at Bow-street; I do not know whether the prisoner heard him, or not; he said he wanted to see Mason, and he would give five guineas to see him; we then parted, and he asked me my name, and he promised to meet me at the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, which he did, at eight o'clock, and Rivett came and took him to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Spraggs's defence. I would wish to state all the transaction that I know about this business. Gentlemen of the Jury, I am implicated here in a very disagreeable manner, of stealing a bill; I know just so much of stealing or swindling a bill as any gentleman in Court. I unfortunately, about twelve months ago, got acquainted with Mason; the first of my acquaintance with this man was in Newgate; I paid some money for his discharge, and from some circumstances I relieved him, and after I relieved him, he, not having it in his power to pay me, used to come backwards and forwards to do some things for me; sometime last September he came and told me about Mr. Julian, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090043"/>had transactions with him; what transaction, I said, can you have with Mr. Julian (for I would not take a bill, nor even a Bank-note from the hands of Mason;) this Mason said to me, Mr. Julian will accept a bill of thirty pounds, provided any person will draw it for me; I 
               <persName id="t18050109-46-person490">drew</persName>
             a bill on Mr. Julian for thirty pounds, I never had the least intention to discount it at first or last, whatever Mr. Julian had. After I had done it, I thought I should be implicated without any benefit; I went to Mr. Julian to know the transaction of it; Mr. Julian told me the particular transaction, for at that moment I meant to burn the bill; I saw Mr. Alley afterwards, and it was agreed that he should pay the five guineas; I then went to Mr. Julian with the bill, and he gave me five guineas; he told me about Mr. Ticken, of Marlow; I said, what have you done with it; he said, there is a warrant at Queen-square; I said, I know nothing at all about Mr. Ticken's bills, nor shall I trouble myself at all about it. On the 13th of December, as I was coming up Parliament-street, I met these gentlemen, and after we had passed each other ten yards, he came up to me, and asked me if my name was Spraggs; I said, yes; he said, do you know a Mr. Moreton; I said, no; he said, do you know Mason; I said, yes, I would give five guineas to see him; Mr. Ticken said, have you heard that he has got a bill from me; I said, I have heard that he has got a bill from a gentleman of Great Marlow; he said, can you render me any service in getting that bill, for I find that you have got Mr. Julian's, if I could get him the bill he would behave like a gentleman; I never told him I would, if he would behave like a gentleman; he said it first; he said, seventy-five pounds was a great deal of money to lose; they wanted me to meet them at their lodgings in the City; I said, that is a great way, cannot we meet nearer; I appointed to meet them at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; I told them, if I could render them any service I would; I went there; Mr. Goldsmith and Mr. Rivett came into the coffee-room, and said I must go along with them; Mr. Rivett began searching me in the coffee-room; I said, do not expose me in the coffee-room; they took me to the Office, and Mr. Ford asked me what I knew of these bills; I said nothing, but that I heard that that man had got some bills from Mr. Ticken, of Great Marlow; Mr. Ticken gets up, in a kind of surprize, and said, now I am satisfied Mr. Spraggs knows something about this business, as I have not mentioned any thing about the other bill of 25 l. no, not even to my wife; that, he said, he drew at Marlow, payable to one Holmes, and that he voluntarily gave Mason, but he catched up the other, and ran away; I was committed for re-examination, but Ticken swore positively that he saw me in the street both before and after Mason took the bills. Now I declare to God that I never was in the street at that time; Sir

             asked him how he came to know that my name was Spraggs; he said, from the description that Mr. Julian gave of me; I was recommitted, the bill was due on the 20th of December, to see whether the bill would be presented for payment; and when re-examined again, the bill was not presented for payment at that time; Mr. Ticken was particularly asked whether he had endorsed the bill; he said, no; the bill not being endorsed by Ticken, it was said that Mason could not have stole it; Sir

             said, there was a something stole, but nothing to go to a Jury; he should commit Mason fully, and me on suspicion; and he said, Ticken had no occasion to trouble himself so much about the bill, as he had not endorsed it, it could be of no use to any person but him; Mr. Walker was still a debtor to him as before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I gave it her to pawn where I was, because I could not go myself, to pay for my lodging; and when Mr. Williams came to pay me, he would not give me more than sixpence a day, I could not sleep in the street.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Officer: I apprehended the prisoner last Tuesday, about one o'clock; I was sent for to Mrs. Burr's, to take the prisoner into custody; as soon as I went into her room Mrs. Burr gave me charge of her, and told me she missed two sheets and one blanket; the prisoner told me she had pawned them, and I immediately asked her for the duplicates; she pulled out her hussiff from her pocket, and presented it me; these are the duplicates I found in her hussiff, with sixteen more duplicates of other articles; she told me she expected her husband home that afternoon with money to redeem them; I asked if she was a married woman; she said, no, the man she lived with was a soldier in the Tower-Hamlets militia, and a weaver by trade.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did she come to your house as a married woman? - A. Yes, and the person who gave her the character said he was a soldier; he did not come with her when she took the room; I have seen him go up and down stairs; I thought it might be her husband, but now it seems he is not. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to defraud her of the sheets, or of her blankets; I was out of work at the time and the young man too, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090045"/>was very much distressed; when they sent the Officer, on that day the young man was to bring home half a guinea, which he did, but before he was come home I was at Clerkenwell; I meant to get the things out with that money; I hope you will have mercy on me; I never mean to do so again; when I was taken to prison I was all that day and the next day without any thing to eat till dinner time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I had a good account with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. This is the dollar; here is the mark I made upon it; I said to her, you know it is a bad one as well as I do; I returned it to her, and she went to Mr. Barber's, who is an egg-merchant, and deals in butter, up Ship-tavern passage, in Leadenhall-market, about five doors from my house, on the same side of the way; I followed her for the purpose of watching her; there were a number of butter-flats piled up; I stood behind them, and heard her ask the price of two lumps of butter; she agreed for the price, and went into the accompting-house to pay for it; I saw the clerk found a dollar, and upon hearing it found I thought it was the same, or one similar; I went in, and said to Mr. Barber's clerk -</p>
               <p>"this woman is offering you a bad dollar, and she knows it is a bad one, I have just convinced her of it; Mr. Barber's clerk desired her to go about her business; I went to my own shop, and she immediately came to me and abused me very much, and said, if she took the devil she had a right to pass it again; I examined the dollar at Mr. Barber's, and found it was not the dollar I had rubbed upon the steel; I take so many that I am partly a judge of them, and I knew that to be a bad one; when she abused me, I told her, if she did not go about her business, I would send her to the Compter; she then went to Mr. Dawson's again, and told him she would come for that goose directly; I watched her to Mr. Wood's, the Poulterer's Arms; I saw her go in; she stopped some time, and I saw a man sounding a dollar upon the table; being a busy time, I went away, and sent my lad,
