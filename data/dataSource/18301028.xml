I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock; the house was then quite safe - the shutters were fastened with an iron bar; I got up a few minutes before six, as usual - it was not light then; I suspected nothing - I got down stairs a few minutes after six, with the plate, which is kept in my own room at night; when I got towards the kitchen stairs I saw a glare of light, and as I entered the back kitchen I found the window wide open, and the shutters also - the bar laid on the dresser under the window; it was bent, and so became shorter, and came out - great force had been used; I went and opened the front kitchen window, and found every thing strewed about; the house had been rifled - I rang all the bells to alarm the family, but could make nobody hear for some time; I did not like to leave the back kitchen, and rang the bells again, hallooed up stairs, and presently I heard my fellow-servant calling out that the bottom of the house was broken open, and in two minutes all the persons in the house came down to my assistance - I sleep in the back garret; I went into the parlour, and almost every lock there was broken open; I went up to the garret, as I had heard footsteps going up stairs - I called out, but received no answer; I was certain somebody was in the house, but nobody would believe me - I went up to the bed-room, and saw a man's leg under my bed; I closed the door, and kept him in till master's nephew came to my assistance; I then opened the door, and said, "Here you are, come out;" the prisoner was under the bed I had slept in - he could not have been there when I left my room; he must have come from another room - he was loaded with master's property; all the articles stated in the indictment were about him; I got a constable, and he was secured - it was day-light out of doors when I came down, but not sufficient for me to do my work without a candle; it would take a considerable time to ransack the house-I heard him say in the parlour, in the presence of us all, that he had been three hours in the house; nothing was said to induce him to state that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I throw myself on the mercy of my God and the Court; I have suffered severely through poverty prior to the time the crime of which I am accused of was committed - I was religiously and morally brought up, and at one time possessed property, but through unforeseen circumstances was deprived of it, since which I have held three respectable situations; I have brothers and sisters respectable in society, whom I am anxious to screen from the infamy attached to me - prior to the present charge my only crime was poverty; not expecting or seeking mercy from my prosecutor, I now only seek of my God and the Court for that mercy which it may consider me entitled, for which, as in duty bound, I ever shall pray.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the public drawing office in the Bank of England. On the 8th of October, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner appeared at the counter of the office, with an East India Court warrant in his hand, and presented it for payment; this is the paper which he brought, (looking at it)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280006"/>- I marked it with my initials, by which I can speak to it - I first requested him, as is usual, to write his name and address on the back; he then left me and went to a side desk, and brought it back to me - I observed that the address on the warrant was wet; the name appeared to have been written before - upon his handing it to me, I asked him how he would receive it? he said, in cash - on my looking at the signatures, I suspected their being genuine, and inquired of him from whom he had brought it; he said he was deputed by Mr. Goodhall, the clerk of the office, to receive it on his behalf - Goodhall is one of the parties to whom it is payable; suspecting the signatures, I thought it my duty to bring it under the notice of the chief officer of our department, Mr. Bryant - he examined it in my presence, and compared the signature of Mr. Mortimer, which we have in a book for comparison, the same as bankers have; Mr. Bryant observed to the prisoner, that the signature of Mr. Mortimer, in particular, rather differed from his usual signature - the prisoner replied that Mr. Mortimer had lately been very unwell; Mr. Bryant then felt it his duty to take the document to the chief cashier of the house - he left for that purpose: I remained in company with the prisoner during his absence - he began to express some impatience at being delayed; it might be twenty minutes or half an hour before Mr. Bryant returned - the prisoner offered to produce a clerk of the house to identify him as coming from the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you infer symptoms of impatience, or did he express any impatience? A. He did; he said it was very unusual to detain him in that manner; he could not conceive the reason, and buttoning up his coat, he said, "I cannot possibly be delayed in this way; you must get the cash ready, and I will call again." When he offered to produce a clerk from the East India-house, I told him the document being in the hands of the principal of the office, I could not give him an answer, and he must wait Mr. Bryant's return - after observing that he should leave and call again, I told him from the circumstance of the document being under investigation, he must not entertain an idea of leaving till he had an answer from the principal - shortly after this Mr. Ormes, who bad gone away by Mr. Bryant's desire, returned with Mr. Goodhall, in whose favour the document is drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Bryant directed Ormes to go and make inquiry, in the prisoner's hearing? A. I cannot say - he brought Mr. Goodhall, and in the prisoner's presence Mr. Ormes told Mr. Goodhall the prisoner was the person who had presented the warrant in his name; Mr. Goodhall looked very gravely at him, and said he did not know him - he shook his head, and said he scarcely knew him; the prisoner then addressing himself to Mr. Goodhall, begged to be allowed to depart, and said to Mr. Goodhall, "If you proceed against me, you will ruin me." I then left them, and went to the chief cashier's office, and found Mr. Bryant there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. I have no recollection of having ever seen him - I disputed all the signatures to the warrant; I knew the hand-writing of Mr. Astell and the other gentlemen purporting to sign it - the signatures are very close resemblances.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the drawing-office; I am the deputy principal in the office - Mr. Bryant is principal. On the 8th of October I remember the prisoner coming there - I did not hear the conversation between him and Evans in the first instance; I remember the paper being referred to Mr. Bryant, and then overheard Mr. Bryant question the prisoner as to the rectitude of the signatures; I suggested to Mr. Bryant, privately, the propriety of my going to the East India Company's warehouse, to know if Mr. Goodhall had authorised any body to receive that sum of money; the prisoner could not hear this suggestion - I went to the East India-house, and brought Mr. Goodhall back, and on confronting the prisoner with him, I said, "This is the person, Mr. Witham, who has presented the document," and asked if he knew him - Mr. Goodhall immediately disclaimed having seen him before, or having any knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call him Mr. Witham? A. That name had been written on the back of the document; the prisoner then confessed that it was a forgery - his words were "I confess it is a forgery - I am ruined, and if the document can be destroyed, I would leave by the mail tonight, leave London, and never be seen again;" I then introduced Mr. Goodhall to the chief cashier - the prisoner remained in front of the office: I returned to him, and begged him to take a seat in the office, and there he remained till he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give you any account of the state in which he was? A. No.</p>

            , who is the chairman - I should say it is not his hand-writing; it certainly is more like his than Mr. Lloyd's, which I should say decidedly is not his; it is a better imitation than Mr. Lloyd's- I believe it not to be his; the next signature is Masterman - he is a director; I do not believe that to be his.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. As far as you can form a judgment, do you believe all the signatures purporting to authenticate the document, to be forged? A. I do believe them all to be forged; my own name is not my writing, certainly - I authorised nobody to write my name; I never authorised any body to sign my name, as treasurer, in any case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your name like or unlike your signature? A. Totally unlike it, quite a different character.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280007"/>Q. The other names are so far like, that some inexperienced person might be deceived by them? A. I should think so, but I am in the habit of seeing them every hour in the day, perhaps three or four hundred times in a morning - I think the accountant-general's signature, Mr. Lloyd's, nor mine, would deceive any person in the habit of seeing them.</p>

            . I am a porter in the accountant's office. I remember seeing the prisoner on the morning of the day this took place, at half-past seven o'clock; he was in the accountant's office - he has a desk there; I saw him go into the compound which encloses this desk - he unlocked a drawer, and locked it again, as I suppose from the sound; I could not see him take any thing out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear the worse for liquor, or as if he had not had his proper night's rest? A. He saluted me not in an ordinary way; he said, "How are you, Smith," and as he left the office he said he was devilishly bad.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been asked how he came to the office that morning, would your answer be, "I thought him rather tipsy, as if he had been drinking?" A. Not at the time, I should not.(The warrant was here read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Overwhelmed as I am at the awful situation in which I am now placed, it would be unbecoming and unjust in me to deny the truth of the statement made by the respectable persons who have been obliged to come forward against me on this occasion; but, my Lord and Gentlemen, if in the merciful administration of justice, a crime committed under the influence of a disordered and distempered mind can receive a more favourable consideration than when committed by means of art and premeditation, I trust I am not asking too much in begging mercy at your hands. By an infatuation, which I now blush to confess, I had for some time past been addicted to drink, the effects of which rendered me at times completely insensible; it happened that on the Wednesday previous to my apprehension I had been induced to join some friends, and in their company became exceedingly intoxicated, by which means I was prevented attending my accustomed duty at the India-house - at night I went to my lodgings, and on the following morning, when the hour for going to business arrived I found myself completely unfit and unable to go out; on the afternoon of that day I began to reflect on the consequences of my absence from my business - I was aware I had no excuse to offer which ought to be accepted as an apology for my conduct, and I was satisfied my dismissal must take place; the contemplation of the disgrace of being discharged distracted me, and for relief, I again flew to drink, and to drown my distress, drank to such excess, that without knowing how or when I got there, I was found in a watch-house in Leadenhall-street, from which place, full of the liquor which I had taken, a heated and excited brain, and without rest, I went to the India-house; the fatal paper tempted me at the moment, and I used it in the manner proved - I am aware now (it is too late) of my fatal error, but in proof, my Lord and Gentlemen, of the truth of my assertion, that I acted from momentary impulse, and not from any preconceived or arranged plan, it will be evident that had I given a moment's consideration to that which I was about to do, I should not have presented a paper for payment which bore the signatures of persons totally dissimilar in their character from the genuine writings of those persons, and with whose genuine signatures I (from the situation I held) was aware the person to whom the document was presented for payment was well acquainted, from the fact of thousands of documents with the same names being presented to him; I, too, was no stranger at the Bank, and might, had I reflected, have known that by presenting the order myself, detection was certain, probably from the Bank clerks themselves, but unavoidably so when any persons from the India-house should he sent for: these circumstances, my Lord and Gentlemen, I humbly take leave to lay before you, in the hope that the justice which you are bound in the discharge of your duty to administer, may be tempered with the mercy which a wretched being now asks of you.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' employ. On the 18th of October, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and took notice of a piece of silk which was laying on the counter - I have since seen some silk in the possession of the pawnbrokers; it is of the same description as that I saw that day; it was on a roller in our shop, and I should think there was about forty yards - it was part of a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know what protion of the silk had been sold? A. No, but being in the habit of cutting silks, I can form a pretty good idea how much is in a roll - it was not a whole piece, but it was in one length - I did not see any of it sold that day; I saw none cut while I was in the shop - I was not absent an hour that day; there was none sold from the time I saw it till it was missed, which was about half-past six, when inquiry was made for it - we have about twelve or fourteen shopmen altogether; it is not my department to keep the silks in order; I did not see it after half-past two - I can say none of it was sold between that and three, because I was passing through the shop every two or three minutes, and if any of the shopmen sold it I must have seen it, because I always notice what others are selling - we are stimulated to sell goods and watch each other, and I swear it was not sold after I saw it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did you see it at half-past two? A. About a yard and a half from the desk - persons coming in as customers could see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At times you are not all present in the shop? A. Except at meal times; we occasionally notice what passes between customers and other shopmen - I should think there was full forty yards on the roller; I have seen Harris and Mitchell in the shop together once before- that was in the middle of the summer. I recollect their being very difficult to serve, which drew my attention to them.</p>

            . I serve in the prosecutors' shop. On the 18th of October I remember three women coming in as customers - I can swear to Davies being one of them; I know the other two by sight, but cannot say whether they were there that day - Davies came in with two women; I cannot say what they asked for at first - it was between three and four o'clock; I recollect selling them some merino and a habit-shirt - only one dealt for it; the others were not with her all the time - they were in different parts of the shop; I dealt with the woman on the drapery counter, and observed them part of the time at the haberdasbery and the hosiery counter; I do not think they asked for things - they did not buy; I had not seen the silk on the counter - it would not be in my part of the shop; inquiry was made about the silk about six or seven o'clock - neither of them bought any silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was between three and four o'clock when Davies, accompanied by two women, came to the shop? A. I think it was about that time - it was four before they left; from twelve to four is our busiest time - there were a good many customers; I cannot say whether any of the silk was sold that day - it had been inquired for by some lady in the course of the day; whether she bought any I cannot say - we have not distinct counters for goods, we sell any where; Davies purchased what she asked for - I do not recollect selling to the other women.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you observe either of the other women near the desk? A. They were there - silk runs various lengths: I had not seen a lady inquiring for the silk, but by its being on the counter I suppose so.</p>

            . I am a shopman to the prosecutors. I went to dinner, returned about a quarter past three o'clock, and observed Mitchell and Davies in the shop - there was another person, whom I cannot identify; I believe it was a woman - I knew Davies and Mitchell, by having served them before; I saw them standing near the desk - Mitchell and Davies stood together, and I believe had shawls on; I saw the piece of silk laying on the counter, about a yard and a half from where they stood, and had also seen it about half an hour before I went to dinner - Mitchell merely said, "How do you do?" to me- I left them standing in the same place, and went to my business; the silk was missed between five and six o'clock that evening; it was on the counter while they were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there a good many customers in the shop at that time? A. Not a great many - we had been pretty well off for customers that day; I will not swear there had not been a dozen in the shop at a time - the customers were in different parts of the shop; the desk is about the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where customers would most likely be? A. No, it depends on what they are buying, or where they sit; muslins are kept nearest to the desk - silks are at the bottom of the shop, and at the top also; the merinos are next to the muslins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When an article is shown, and you want another, it is put aside? A. Yes; that causes articles to be near the desk sometimes; the customers that day were persons of apparent respectability - I had no reason to suspect any of them.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutors' employ. On the 18th of October I remember all the three prisoners coming into the shop, about twenty minutes or a quarter to four o'clock; they went away between four and five - I had seen the roll of silk on the counter previous to their coming in: while they were there I walked up the middle of the shop, and on returning I heard one of them say, "It will be no good to stand here;" I immedi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280010"/>ately went up, and inquired if there was nobody attending to them: Mitchell replied, "Oh, Yes, there is, I thank you;" I said if there was not I would do so - I was employed in serving other customers, but took notice of them; I do not recollect seeing Harris and Mitchell leave the shop, but they left before Davies - she was the last; they were in the shop nearly an hour, and left between four and five o'clock- the roll of silk was missed in an hour and a half or two hours after, between six and seven o'clock; I perfectly well recollect seeing the three prisoners at the spot where I saw the silk - a lady came in. and placed a chair at the spot where the prisoners had been waiting, and I cleared the goods away from there to serve her, and perfectly recollect that the silk was not among the goods I moved away - this was a quarter of an hour after they had left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was you first examined about this? A. Yesterday - I heard of the silk being lost the evening it happened; I was not required to attend before the Magistrate - I am quite positive it was not before three o'clock that the prisoners came in; the usual time for dinner is about one or a quarter-past - it depends on our being engaged with customers; I cannot say at what time Willis dined - I saw the prisoners come in, and think it was a quarter to four o'clock; I am positive they were not there as early as a quarter-past three - I did not see them at that time; I am speaking as far as my recollection goes - there was not so much doing between four and six as before; we were busy - I can venture to swear this silk was not sold at all; I cannot say none were sold, but this was not - I saw it on the counter last about twelve or one o'clock; I cannot tell what became of it after I had been to dinner.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Grosvenor-row, Pimlico. I produce a piece of silk, pawned on the 19th of October, for 16s., by Mitchell; and another piece, pawned on the 20th, by Harris, for 1l.; there are about twenty yards in the two pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you knew them before? A. Yes, for three years, and knew their names; a boy wrote the duplicate for Harris, and put the name of Doherty on it - the other is in Mitchell's name: I did not write Harris' ticket, and suppose I was not aware what name the boy put - I received the article from her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoners on Thursday night, the 21st; I had found the witness Scofield at Mr. Morrit's, the pawnbroker's, in York-street, and took her to Queen-square office - she there gave me a duplicate, and in consequence of what she said I went with her to No. 7. Ebury-street, and found the prisoner Mitchell, who told me she had the duplicates from Harris - Mitchell took us to Harris, and told her the officer had come about the silk; we went up stairs to a room which Harris occupied, in an empty house, and there saw Davies - Mitchell said, "Here is the officer come about those duplicates;" Davies said, "What duplicates?" she said the duplicates of the silk - Davies said, "What silk?" Mitchell said, "Don't appear strange about it - you will throw it all on my back;" Davies then said, "You did not have it from me - you had it from Harris:" Harris said, "I did not give them to you - you took them off the shelf;" I then asked all the prisoners how the duplicates came on the shelf; they said they did not know - Mitchell said, "Why, it is the silk you told me you got on tally, and was not going to pay for it, therefore you pledged it;" Harris denied it, and said she knew nothing about it - I took them all into custody.</p>

            .

I don't know what you mean;" she said,"Don't be strange - I mean the duplicates of the silk, the slate coloured silk;" Mitchell then said to Harris, "Well, if Ann knows nothing about it, what do you know about it?" Harris said, "I know nothing at all about it;" Mitchell said, "This is a very pretty go, bowever - you none of you know about it; if you know nothing about it how came I by these duplicates?" Harris said there were some duplicates on the mantel-piece;" Mitchell said, "Do you think I should take such things off the mantel-piece without they were given to me?" Harris said, "I said there were those duplicates, and if they were of any use to you you were welcome to them;" Mitchell then said, "I took the duplicates to Mrs. Scofield, and asked if she knew any person she worked for who was likely to buy them, as they were not things I could wear;" I am a dress-maker. The officer took them all into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. PETERS. These lengths of silk have all constituted one piece, I have no doubt; they are exactly the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280011"/>colour and pattern as what I lost - the quantity I lost was worth at least 6l. to buy it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many yards do you swear there were? A. I will swear to there being forty yards; it is gros de Naples - I should pay 3s. a yard for it, the wholesale price - it cannot be bought for less; I find, by measuring the silk produced, there are forty-four or forty-five yards.</p>

The witnesses called me down; I had gone to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and locked the bar door myself - I saw the house properly secured, and am quite sure the staircase window was closed, but cannot say whether it was hasped; it is about six feet from the ground - there is nothing to assist a person to get up to it; I did not know the prisoners before - they had not been at my house that night as customers; I am sure they were not in the tap-room when I went to bed - there are two doors to the bar, and a sliding window which latches at the top, and after getting into the bar, the parlour door is bolted inside - I found marks on the bar door, and a crow-bar or chisel was found, which exactly corresponded with the marks - I saw the chisel found, and gave it o' Pattison; there is a lead to the tap-room door, which would make a noise - I found that cut off; it was there when I went to bed; a coat, a hat, a pocket-book, and tobacco-box were found in the tap-room - I had left them in the bar that night; I am certain they had been removed - they are mine, and worth 20s.; I found the back door leading to the yard open - I had fastened that the night before.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, both the prisoners came to the shop-Elizabeth asked me if I would take a cheque for drapery goods; she had not then bought any - I said if we had any knowledge of the parties we had no objection to take it; she took her pocket-book out, took these two cheques from it, and gave them to me - I sent them to Cockburn and Co.'s, bankers, at Whitehall, and in the mean time showed them the goods they wished to look at; they purchased to the amount of about 7l. - they both purchased cloaks, shawls, and other things; I asked Elizabeth if either of the names the cheques purport to be drawn in favour of was her name; she said they were not, she had received them from her mistress - she did not give her mistress' name; they were more than an hour in the shop, looking at things, and did not offer to go away; the boy returned from the banker's, and stated the cheques to be forged - they were not aware of my having sent the boy: he produced the cheques.</p>
               <p>Q. Did their looking at the goods occupy an hour? A. We were extremely busy, and I apologised for detaining them, as I served other ladies at the same time - when the boy returned I told them we had sent to the bankers's, and they had pronounced them to be forged -Elizabeth said they were not forged; we sent for an officer, who came and took them both into custody, with the cheques - they both stood close together when the cheques were tendered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had all your conversation with Elizabeth? A. Yes - they staid there during the hour of their own free will; all Ann did was to look at the goods with the other - she negociated no cheque.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You amused them by saying you had other customers to serve? A. Yes; our shop is not more crowded on Saturdays than on other days - three o'clock is a busy time.</p>

I went on this Saturday afternoon to Mr. Brooks', and saw the prisoners there; I was asked to take them into custody for uttering two forged cheques - they got up, and went with me immediately; Elizabeth said she was very willing to go, and as we went along she said she was sorry she had offered the cheques - if she had known they had been had she would have destroyed them, and at the office she told me she had found them in Hyde-park; Ann was near enough to hear this - she said nothing in my hearing; I produce the cheques - I have had them ever since, except for about a day and a half, when they were in the hands of Mr. Stafford, the clerk of Bow-street; I put my mark on them before I parted with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They went willingly, without any resistance at all? A. Yes - the conversation was with Elizabeth entirely.</p>

I said, "Yes, at Knightsbridge, at the grocer's;" I did not name the grocer - his name is Lawrence; he is not here: after some little hesitation he said, "Yes, I did change one;" I said,"Then where is the change?" he would give me no answer- I then said, "If you will not tell me where the change is, tell me where the other notes are;" I told him a large sum of money was stolen at the time the 20l. note was, and he must know something about them - he said he had seen no other, and knew nothing about any others; at that moment I received information respecting a 10l. note, and asked him where the change of the 10l. note he had just got changed was; he then said he had given it to his wife - I again asked him to tell me where the other notes were; he said he knew nothing about them - I left him in the guard-room, in charge of the serjeant of the guard, and went immediately in search of his wife, in a room in the barracks, but found she was not there; I went down stairs, and saw her coming across the mess-room - a serjeant who was with me said we wanted to speak to her; we took her into her room - I said I had come to her respecting the money she had stolen from Miss Whitfield; she said she knew nothing about it, she had taken none of them, and asked"Where is Oddy?" I said, "He is in custody, and you must consider yourself in custody; where is the change of the 10l. note your husband gave you just now?" after some hesitation she said, "Here it is," and took this purse out of her bosom, containing nine sovereigns and 14s. - I asked where she got it she said it was no matter, it was her own; I then asked her "Where is the 20l. note you gave your husband, and which he got changed at Knights-bridge?" she said that was her own - she did not deny giving him a note, but said it was her own; I asked her to tell me where the other notes were - she said she knew nothing about them; I said the 20l. note had been traced to be Miss Whitfield's property, and she must know something about the other notes - I said, "At all events tell me where the 50l. note is;" she again said she knew nothing about them - I then began to search, and in her box found an old pocket-book, in which was a receipt of Cox and Greenwood's, the army-agents, for 18l. paid in there on the 23rd of September; it says "Received of <rs id="t18301028-14-deflabel91" type="occupation">Corporal</rs>

On the Monday, after she had been before the Magistrate, (the 4th) I asked her if she had any thing to say to me, for I was going to leave the office - I did not hold out either threat or promise to her - she said she would be glad if I would tell Miss Whitfield that she was very sorry for what she had done - that she had never been happy since she had done it; she did not know it was so much, and she hoped Miss Whitfield would not prosecute her this time.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on the 17th of September - I am not aware of having seen him before; he said he was desirons of having a bill for 50l. discounted, and was recommended to me by a gentleman, named Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of your business to discount bills? A. I am acquainted with gentlemen who discount them - they are friends of mine; I told him I would cause inquiry to be made, and if the bill proved to be good, I or a friend of mine would discount it - he produced the bill at the first interview; this is it (looking at it) - it is in the same state as when he produced it; I asked him what business the acceptor was - he told me he was chief farrier and smith, at Mr. Wood's, the coal-merchant; I called on Mr. Wood, who stated that Quin could neither read nor write - no money has been advanced on the bill; I took it to a friend, and saw Quin, who said he could neither read nor write, and had not authorized his name to be put to it - I should not have taken any steps myself, but Mr.Flight, who I applied to, to discount it, said it devolved on me to have him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On your oath did not the man tell you Quin had authorized him to accept the bill for him? A. I do not recollect any thing of the kind; I understood him to state it was the acceptance of Quin, unquestionably.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not tell you he had been authorized by the man to accept it? A. I am sure I cannot answer the question; I received 8s. for the trouble of making the inquiry - he gave me a correct address of Quin and his master.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gaols have you been in in the course of your life? A. That has nothing to do with this - I object to the question; I was never in Newgate for debt - I consider I am not bound to answer whether I was ever there; I do not know that I was ever in this Court before, or the other - I do not recollect it; I swear I was never tried for any offence in either of the Courts - I never was tried in either of the Courts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here as a prisoner? Q. I decline answering that; when you say the Courts I conceive you do not mean the prison - I do not believe I was ever in either of the Courts; I have been in the Court of King's Bench, but there was no judgment passed - there was a conviction there, which was not good, and no judgment was passed; I went to receive judgment, and was discharged - it was for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not spend two years in Newgate before you were discharged? A. I will not answer the question.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him he might put your name to any paper concerning money? A. No, not to my recollection - he never asked my leave to do so; the acceptance was never written by my order or consent, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it a thing you would be likely to forget? did you ever in your life give authority to any body to accept a bill? A. Never - I am in Mr. Wood's service now, and have been so for five years; I am to be found there from six o'clock in the morning till seven or eight o'clock at night - I remember being in a public-house in Northumberland-street with the prisoner; he asked what I would take, and then asked the landlord for a tent of ink - I did not ask what he wanted it for, nor did I see him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the paper was not produced, and that you did not give him authority to sign it? A. I did not - I have been in Ireland, and left there to get employment; I was confined there for twelve months about a turn out for wages; and I was once flogged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Quin ordered me to do this twenty times - I was to give him the price of two chaldrons off coals out of it, and not to tell his wife of it.</p>

On Saturday, the 25th of September, I saw the prisoner at our shop; I saw him at his own house on Monday, the 27th, and saw him the same day at our house - I then showed him three separate parcels of ham, all of which he agreed to purchase - after we had weighed them I said, "Mr. Phillips, it is usual, as you don't pay for them, to leave a deposit;" he was a perfect stranger to me - he said it was not convenient to give me a deposit then, but that before eleven o'clock next day he would send 5l., and then I agreed to send him the first draft, which was thirty-four hams, weighing 3 cwt. 13lbs., which came to 5l. 6s. 6d. - he was to send the 5l. first, and pay the porter the 6s. 6d.; I never received the 5l. from him - I afterwards discovered that the hams were sent to him; about eleven on Tuesday, the day they were sent, I met him in Lombard-street; I said, "Mr. Phillips. have you sent the money for those hams?" he said, "I have not, but I am now with a gentleman, who is to let me have the money, and I will send it on immediately;" I said, "You had better send the money for the whole, as it will save us a journey; we can send them all at once:" he said he would if he could get it; in consequence of information I called at his shop that day, and said, "Mr. Phillips, have you sent the money for those hams?" he said,"I have not but I have got the hams, and paid your porter or man 6s. 6d., and I will send the 5l. in less than half an hour;" I went to his house, and saw him again next day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for the 5l., as he had not sent it; he said, "You d-d rascal, I paid you the 5l. at the time I purchased the hams; you d-d rascal, I owe you nothing:" I then told him he was a swindler, that he had not paid me; and he shoved me out of the shop - I again repeated that he was a swindler, that he had obtained goods fraudulently, and then refused to pay for them; he then struck me a blow over the month, which induced me to apply at Bow-street for a warrant - he was brought there on a charge of assault, and there produced the receipt, in the altered state, purporting to be for 5l. 6s. 6d.; I had received 6s. 6d. from my man, but nothing from the prisoner whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite certain he never paid you the 5l.? A. Certainly - I told my porter about nine o'clock on Tuesday morning, that Phillips was to send 5l., and then he was to take the hams and receive 6s. 6d.; he was not to take them till the 5l. was sent - I went out for five or six hours; my partner was in lreland at the time.</p>

On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner at master's, and on Tuesday Mr. Flintan desired me to take thirty-four hams to the prisoner, to receive 6s. 6d., as I understood him, and that the 5l. was to be sent to the shop afterwards- I took thirty-four hams to the prisoner's shop; he came in just as I had delivered them, and paid me 6s. 6d., but no more; I wrote a receipt for the 6s. 6d. at the bottom of the bill - (looking at it) this is my signature at the bottom of the bill; I wrote "Received 6s. 6d., S. Stone," and that is all I wrote - I did not make the figure 5, or the £. over it; the 6s. 6d. has been smeared over since I wrote it- when he paid me the 6s. 6d. he said he would send the 5l. to my masters; I never received 5l. from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Am I to understand that you put the 6s. 6d., with s and d over it? A.

            . I live on Holborn-bridge, and am in the employ of Mr. Carr, a grocer and oilman. The prisoner showed me this receipt on the 29th of September (looking at it); at that time the 5 was apparently very recently written - the 6s. 6d. was blacker then, and blacker than it is are now; the 5 was then much paler than the 6s. 6d., by which I inferred it had been more recently written - I saw it between nine and ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it appear to have been made three or four days before? A. No, it appeared much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280017"/>more recently done - it might have been done the day before for what I know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am now a hundred and forty miles from my native place, which prevents me producing that number of respectable persons I could have done, had my trial taken place in Herefordshire, but not withstanding the few I have to speak to character, will, I hope, satisfy you that I am not that fraudulent person my prosecutor would make you behave; I came to London only four months since, with a capital of 300l., with which I went into business in my present shop - my returns being from 30l. to 40l. per week, therefore it is not probable that I could be guilty of so paltry a crime, and yet serious charge; had I been guilty of such offence, should I have placed the document in the way of the man who has tried every thing in his power to blast my character and reputation - I have a wife and seven children; I solemnly declare before my God, and in your presence, that I am innocent.</p>

Yes, we have an ink-stand with very bad ink, and there was a leaden ink-stand - the leaden one writes very bad; he said, "Your ink is very bad" - I said, "Dip down there, it is darker." and he did so;

             are customers of mine - the prisoner was authorized to receive money for coals, and should account to me every evening for what he carried out in the course of the day, whether it was paid for or to be booked - he was sent out with some coals on the 8th of July; when he came home in the evening he booked one sack of coals to Mrs. Jacobs, saying she had not enough to pay him, but had given him 3s. on account; I am quite sure I never received the rest from him, which was 5s. if I had, it would have been entered. On the 23rd of August he booked 12s. to Mrs. Jacobs, saying she had three sacks of coals, and had not money to pay for them; he never paid me for them - he stated that he had delivered to Mrs. Kelly two sacks which came to 8s., on credit; he never paid me that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS, Q. Were you in the habit of seeing Mrs. Jacobs? A. I had not seen her when he paid the 3s.; I have known him sometimes give receipts, but not always; I had no quarrel with him more han charging him with being lazy - I took him to the office about furious driving, but not about breaking my horse's knee; the charge was dismissed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day of the week was it? A. Tuesday - I keep a chandler's shop; the prosecutor assists me in the business - the shop is on one side of the passage; there is an inner door at the foot of the stairs, beyond the shop door - the staircase door has no communication with the shop; I am frequently in the passage, and looked at that door - I found it shut; we heard a noise over-head, which alarmed us - Mr. Merriott went up stairs, and found the prisoner; we thought we heard the staircase door open and shut just before that - we went to the door, and it was then shut; we came back, and heard the noise over-head - nobody else lives in the house; I had not been out of the house all day.</p>

Yes, I made the bed at that time - I did not look under the bed; I am certain nobody was under it, for there are chests under it, so that a person could not get the whole of his body under - I did not look at the shirts and things that afternoon, but am certain they were there; they were in the drawer, and not on the table - one room communicates with another; you are obliged to go through the sitting-room to go to the bed-room - there is a back door to the house, but the staircase door is between that and the bed-room; the back door is kept bolted - a person coming in at the back door must open the staircase door to get up stairs.</p>
               <p>EDWARD EVANS. I am a porter. I was called by Keen, my next door neighbour, to assist in detaining the prisoner in the first floor room; I was obliged to go through the sitting-room to get to that bed-room - I there found the prisoner in custody; there was a strong smell of fire - I thought the place was on fire, but we found it was a phosphorus-box which was in his pocket; I saw him throw the case of it but of his pocket - I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you as drunk then as you are now? A. I was not drunk, nor am I now - I am a porter, and have lived twenty years with Messrs. Middleton and Co.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASHPLANT. I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered to me - I found a key in his possession, and a latch-key was picked up among others, by Mr. Merriott, on the floor; I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. He was rather in liquor - I had not the least reason to suppose Evans drunk; I do not think him perfectly sober now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you try the latch-key to the staircase door? A. Yes, and it opened it.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live in George-yard, Snow-hill. The prisoner lived there with his father - I have known him twelve months; he bore a good character, and kept regular hours - he worked for Hadley and Co., the engine-makers, in Blackfriars-road; he was there till between one and two o'clock on the day of the robbery - an old man in the shop had got married, and stood a drop of beer; the prisoner had some, and perhaps was not able to stand it as well as others.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are these keys used is his business? A. This iron is one of his working tools - this latch-key I firmly believe he made to open his father's door; the others are common box lock keys - this one is a common key used in gentlemen's houses; it is called a master-key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that key with open wards at each end? A. Some such key as this is used in gentlemen's houses; it might have got into a locksmith's hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you upon that see the prisoner? A. I had been in the habit of seeing him frequently, and I saw him next morning; Bradley was present - they did not come together; the prisoner was taken up stairs at our house - Mr. David Brand was present; not the slightest promise or threat was held out to him by any body whatever - Mr. Brand charged him with having betrayed his trust, the prisoner said he had betrayed his trust, and wished to know whether the affair could be compromised - he said he did not care so much for himself, but it was for his wife, who he was sure would break her heart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say you have repeated the very words of the prisoner? A. I think I can say I have exactly; I do not mean that I have said every word he said, but the substance of all that was said, except that after Mr. Brand left the room, I asked the prisoner what could have induced him to have done as he had - he said he could assign no cause at all for it, he did not want the goods; the goods were not produced to him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it said in what respect he had broken his trust, or did Mr. Brand simply say "You have broken your trust?" A. He stated at intervals the different quantity of goods he had taken; I have mentioned all that passed when Mr. Brand was there, as near as I can recollect - nothing more passed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did I understand you to tell my friend, that he gave you some particulars, in the course of conversation? A. I said after Mr. Brand left the roomt he prisoner and myself had some conversation; I have stated the substance of all that transpired.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Messrs. Sharland and Co., Bishopsgate-street, linen-drapers. I sold to Mr. Danby goods similar to these; they are very likely to be the same - they are the same pattern: I have no mark on them - there was no mark of mine on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the handkerchiefs you sold? A. Apparently they are.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there tickets on them? A. There are, and I believe they are the same tickets which I saw on the articles I sold - I have no doubt of it; I sold the articles to Messrs. Leaf and Co.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. I have seen him three or four times - I first saw him at Mrs. Wallis'.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you sold the goods did you see the prisoner at Mrs. Wallis'? A. About an hour and a half; I went to Wallis' - it is No. 4 or 6, George-street, Minories - I saw the prisoner there; he asked me if I had not sold some goods to Leaf and Co. - I told him I had, 45l. worth - he told me that he and the party would pay me the amount if I would not call at Leaf's in the morning for the money - I had appointed to call at Leaf's in the morning for payment; the prisoner said if I went in the morning he should lose his situation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to buy these goods at all? A. I believe my employer had been in the habit of buying goods of Wallis for some years; the firm of Robert Sharland and Co. have been in the habit of buying of her - she does not keep a warehouse that I am aware of; she is a French milliner - she has some show-rooms; I have been in them - it must be a week ago since I saw her last; I do not know where she is now - I do not know that she has absconded - I have not searched for her; I am not aware that my master has endeavoured to find her - I never bought goods there myself; I sold these goods to Messrs. Leaf and Co., in in the name of Bradley and Co.; I am not one on MR. Sharland's firm - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did not you sell them under a false representation? A. I did, certainly; I had my reasons for that - they were nothing but honest reasons; it has been done in the trade before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, in a respectable house, consider it honest to sell goods under a false representation? A. I should not consider it dishonest - it was not done with any idea of fraud; I consider it a crime to tell falsehoods - these goods were in my possession, and I sold them in my own name: I have no company, and they were not my goods - they were mine as long as they were in my possession; I considered them mine when in my possession - I had not bought them; they certainly belonged to

Leaf and Co., and found the prisoner there; I had had a communication with Mr. Leaf, the day before, respecting these goods, and spoke to the prisoner on the subject; I did not promise or threaten him in any way whatever - I asked why it was he had betrayed the trust we had put in him - that was the first word I said to him; he said he had betrayed the trust we had put in him, and that he was very guilty - he wanted to know if it was possible the matter could be compromised; I told him No, it must stand on its own merits - he said he did not care about himself, but it would break his wife's heart; he asked a private word with me, and Mr. Danby retired - he said he hoped neither my brother nor me would do any thing rashly in the business; I questioned him as to when he began to pilfer; he said about the time I left London for Brighton, which was about three months ago; part of these articles were shown to him - these spider-bordered goose handkerchiefs, which are of a peculiar fabric; my brother Robert is the manufacturer of them - he lives at Glasgow; we had a consignment of that particular article, not more than two months before - half a dozen of them were brought to our house on Friday evening, from Messrs. Leaf and Co.'s, and were shown to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, go on with the conversation you had in the morning? A. I asked how many he thought he had taken beside the 45l. parcel produced - he said he believed he did not take more than 5l. or 6l. in addition to this parcel - the six constituted part of the parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did this conversation take place between you two alone? A. Yes, he gave the explanation after Danby retired; he had seen the six handkerchiefs the night before, but they were not produced at the conversation, which took place at Messrs. Leaf's, and we had it all over again at our premises.</p>

Certainly it has - I do not know who brightened it; it was in the prosecutor's possession above an hour - it was brightened within the hour; it looks better for it - there was a violent altercation between him and the prisoner; the prosecutor asked me to come with him before the Grand Jury, and I said I thought there was enough already.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Tottenham-street. I bought this pistol of the prisoner about October or November in last year - I had known him as foreman to Mr. Smith; he did not say how he came by it - it is an old pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you went to Mr. Smith's to purchase a pistol? A. I went and asked Mr. Smith what he would make one for, and he said 25s. or 30s. - I declined that, and the prisoner said he had one to sell; I think Smith was then gone out of the room: then the prisoner said he had something of the sort he thought would suit me; he said it was at home, and he would let me have it on the day following - there was no secrecy or concealment in his dealing with me; any one coming in might have heard it - if there had been any concealment I would not have bought it; I frequently saw Mr. Smith, and attended his family professionally - I believe he never said that he had lost a pistol till he had indicted Allely.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I know this pistol, and swear it is mine - there is a mark on the cock, and one under the barrel; I made one of the marks - it was sometimes in the window, and sometimes in a drawer; this and some other things were missed the latter end of November; I got it from Mr. Langley in July last - he had given it to a boy in the country; I told him how I had been robbed, and he said he bought a pistol of Allely - I asked him if he would let me have it to bring down to Allely's trial, and I at last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280024"/>got it; I knew sometime before he was taken that he had sold Mr. Langley a pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before? A. Before the July Session; but I did not indict him then, because I had not the property - he had given it to a boy in the country; I made inquiry of every one about it; my young man is here to whom I mentioned it; I have repeatedly told him and others - I cannot tell when; I believe about March -I said I had been robbed of three or four pistols, and I had got two of them; I said one of them was a percussion pistol, but I did not particularly describe it - Allely left me in February, but he had sold this while he was in my service; he sold it in November - I did give him a good character on leaving me; I never said that if two or three indictments would not got the prisoners from their shop, four or five should - I never said it in my life, to, or in the presence of

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Clerkenwell. About two months or nine week ago, I saw the prisoner - he said he had left Mr. Smith, and had commenced business for himself, and he had told Mr. Smith he was going to Ireland, but he had met with a friend, and was gone into business - he said, "Mr. Smith seems very bitter against me, and says I have robbed him of a pistol, and you will do me a service to come and give me a character;" I said,"It is a very hard case for me, as I have known Mr. Smith these twenty years."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he was innocent? A. Yes; he bore an excellent character - I went and asked Mr. Smith, and he said he had given him an excellent character, but had since found out he had robbed him; he gave me the card of his shop, but I have not got it.</p>
               <p>- I am in the prosecutor's employ; he told me he had lost that pistol and another - he did not describe them in any way; he said he had got another indictment out - this was about two months ago; he did not tell me so in March last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Mr. Smith tell you he had preferred another indictment? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I wish you to ask him whether, on the day this trial was put off, Allely, Green, and his party, did not overtake me in Holborn, collect a mob round me, and put me in bodily fear.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, how came you to swear that you described that pistol to him? A. I did.</p>

I went to the house in Princes-street, and got this spoon - I was going down the street, and saw the two prisoners together; I saw Sloane give something to Rugg, who went into the shop; the other stood opposite - I waited till she came out; I then went and asked them what they got for the spoon; they said, "What spoon?" I said I had seen her selling a spoon in the shop as I passed by - I again asked what they got for it, and Rugg said 2s. 3d., and as we were going into the shop, she put 3d. into Sloane's hand, and said 2s. 6d., and they had found it in St. Giles' - I got the spoon, and found whose crest it was at the College of Arms.</p>

The prosecutor applied to me, and I took the prisoner in Knightsbridge, at a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning: I found six shillings and six sixpences in her hand - she said to another woman, "Go and find the purse;" I took the other woman that she should not go - the prisoner did not say any thing to me about the purse; I went and found it in the place the prosecutor had described - he said he had 9s. or 10s.; I had the money then, but did not know what there was of it - this is the purse - the prosecutor might have been drinking, but did not appear any way in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had given the contents of his purse to her, saying that it was not much, and afterwards wanted it back, as she would not allow him to take indecent liberties with her.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GORDON. I am quite sure I did not give her the money; I did put my hand to my pocket to give her a trifle, as I had been foolish enough to talk to her.</p>

I came up, and found Mr. Smith had hold of the prisoner; I took his arm loosely, to go to the watch-house - he snatched it from me, struck Mr. Smith, and ran about twenty yards, but was taken; he said in the watch-house that he bought the apples of a tall man; the man was brought there - he did not go to the market, nor ask to go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you know the man? A. He is a remarkable tall man; there is not one so tall as he is - the prisoner had offered money for the apples, and given 8s. 6d., but the man would not take it, and then he said he took them, but he did not know what induced him to take them, without the devil did, and he was not happy till he took them.</p>

On the 24th of September, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner looking into his shop - he then went in and brought out the looking-glass; I went and asked if it had been paid for - they said No: I ran and saw the prisoner in John-street - he put down the glass; I lost sight of him for a moment in Windmill-street, but he was taken soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this a pretty good thoroughfare? A. Yes; I had never seen the prisoner before - I saw him go in and come out with the glass; the prisoner had turned a corner before he put down the glass - I lost sight of him then for a few minutes, but when I saw him again he had the glass; I took up the glass - he then turned the corner of Windmill-street, and I lost sight of him, but I can take upon me to swear he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the gentleman here who stopped him? A. No - he was a gentleman going by; he did not say, "If that is the person who took the glass, he must have come a different way to this man" - he let him go, and I took him.</p>
               <p>DAVID THOMPSON. This is my glass, but I was not at home - I missed this glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Paddington, and was returning home through Windmill-street - I heard Stop thief! called and ran as others did, when a man stopped me and detained me three or four minutes; I said I was not the man, but he might search me - I did not know what had been taken; he seeing the mob run in a different direction to me, let me go; the Policeman then came up, and in about six or seven minutes this man came up with the glass, and said, "This must be the man as I never lost sight of him," and at the office he said he did lose sight of me - I never was in John-street.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner, and in going to the lock-up house he requested to walk by my side, which he did - we crossed some ruins, and when we got near the station he started off; I pursued him - his hat fell off, and he was taken by a Police-officer - I found this kaleidoscope in his pocket; this cash-box was in his box at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. HAYLTON. These are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath, had you not contracted to sell the prisoner these very things for 1s. 6d.? A. No, Sir - he asked me the price of them, and I said 1s. 6d., which he said was too dear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 19.</p>

            . I am a gentleman, and live at Notting-hill. On the 5th of October I was returning from Shepherd's-bush, and saw the two prisoners coming out of the side garden door of this house - Jackson came out and made towards Lord Holland's park; Wood turned to the right, towards the fields - suspecting them I looked at my watch, and found it wanted ten minutes to one o'clock, and thinking it not likely that workmen were taking their tools away, I followed Jackson across the road, and seized him, with a basket of tools at his back, and said I thought they were not honestly come by; he said a person in the building had given them to him - he dropped them, and they remained in the road; as I was taking him back to the house he bolted after the other prisoner, and both ran away - I found nobody in the house; I gave an alarm - a witness hearing me, pursued them, and they were taken at the top of Portobello-lane; I am positive they are the men.</p>
               <p>Jackson. He said at the office that the other man had the basket. Witness. Jackson carried the basket - I saw them in the watch-house, and looking at them for a moment, I thought it was the other prisoner, but at the office I was positive it was Jackson; they both came out of the garden door.</p>

On the 6th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home alone, and was sober; I had three half-crowns in my pocket - the two prisoners came up to me in <placeName id="t18301028-84-crimeloc458">Camomile-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you cry out Watch? A. I could not, I was so terrified - I told them they had robbed me of three half-crowns; Brown said once or twice, "What do you want?" I said she had robbed me of two or three half-crowns - I heard the money jinking, as if passing from her to Field, and Field went off with it; Brown held me round the neck the while, so that I could not get away - my hat fell off; a gentleman on the other side saw the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call out to him? A. She held me so tight- she held my head down between her breast and arms; I did not see the gentleman on the other side - I made an alarm a minute or two after she was gone; I called out that I was robbed of three half-crowns - the gentleman came up to me; I could not call Stop thief! I was so terrified from the fright I had - I do not think any body was standing in the way; the witness Pilley, who was on the opposite side, came to me, and asked what was the matter; I said, "For God's sake assist me, for I am robbed of three half-crowns," which were not my own money - they were my employer's; he is an auctioneer, and gave them to me to purchase goods which he wanted for sale; he gave them to me at ten o'clock at night - the auction-shop was open at that time; it is in Ratcliff-highway - they were to be sold by auction next morning; I did not complain to any watchman that night - I did not take notice of any, I was so frightened; Pilley complained to a tall gentleman in Bishopsgate-street, who I believe was an officer - Pilley got the woman himself; he and I went different ways - Field was brought to the watch-house in about a second, and three half-crowns found on her; I described her person - I had not pointed her out, I was in such trouble, but the constable never had her out of sight; I told the constable of it in Camomile-street, when he came to my assistance - Field was not searched in my presence; Brown was brought to the watch-house in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you related to the boxer? A. I am his nephew - I was frightened at the women; I am a hair-dresser - my master is an auctioneer, but he is not the man I was bound apprentice to; I dress and shave now when I can get any thing to do - I have no shop; I have been six months with the auctioneer; I was to buy razors, scissors, and knives; I left my master's shop at ten o'clock - Camomile-street was not in my way home; it may be two miles out of my way - I went for a walk; I did not stop to drink - I am not in the habit of drinking; I called out "I am robbed of three half-crowns;" I had not been with any women - when she laid hold of my arm I did not know what she was going to do; when she asked me to treat her I said I had no money - I was perfectly collected then; I saw nobody to call to - I, of course, made a bit of a fuss about it; she tucked my head under her arm - I had no power to call out, I was so frightened; I did not describe them to the officer till they were taken, for I could not see them; I told what sort of a dress she had on - I told the constable she was a tall young woman, certainly not shortish; I will not swear that I described her dress - I did not describe Brown at all; I expect 3s. 6d. a day for coming here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much do you get for attending the auction-room? A. One shilling a day; I have been here two days - my master is Peter McPherson, of No. 86, Ratcliff-highway.</p>

            . I am a saddle-tree maker, and live in Webber-street. I did not know the prosecutor before this; I was in Bishopsgate-street, at the end of Camomile-street, and heard a disturbance - I walked down, and heard the voices of two or three women and a man; I heard Mendoza say, "It won't do," and after that I heard Brown say, "What do you want?" she repeated it three or four times - it did not appear a serious dispute - I saw Field cross, and go up the passage; I had no suspicion at that time of a robbery - I then saw Brown and the prosecutor struggling together for a minute or two; she then pushed him from her, and walked away at rather a quick step into Bishopsgate-street, looking once or twice behind her - Mendoza then picked up his hat, and ran away from her, in a contrary direction, and in a direction from me; I had stopped on the opposite side of the way, facing them - I heard Pilley call to him to know if he had been robbed; he said he had, of three half-crowns - this was not a minute after; there was nothing to prevent his calling Thieves! he appeared agitated - had he spoken in time I could have stopped Brown; she had just turned the corner - I lost sight of them both; Pilley brought Field up - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280038"/>think there was a robbery, but that they belonged to each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them when you heard him say "It won't do?" A. I should think two yards, the width of the street; he could easily have seen me - there was nothing to prevent his calling to me; I took a glass of ale with him last night, in St. Paul's church-yard - that is the only house I ever went to with him; I treated him, as he had no money - I was looking attentively at the prisoners, but saw no robbery; the street is lighted, and I believe with gas - I fancy the money had been taken just at the time I got up; I heard him say "It won't do;" it might have been done without my seeing it - she must have tucked his head under her arm before I came up, if that took place; I was not above two minutes looking at them.</p>

            . I am a poulterer at Leadenhall-market - I am now serving in my own right as a constable. On the 6th of October I was on duty, going round the ward, and when I came into Camomile-street my attention was attracted by two women and a man struggling together; the man was making a noise - he said, "Leave me alone," or words to that effect; I might be forty or fifty yards from him then - he spoke in a loud voice: I advanced, and immediately Field crossed the road, hastily. into a court - I called out "Have you lost any thing?" he said three half-crowns - I had then got a full view of Field going up the court; I followed, and took her in Bishopsgate-street, which the court leads into - I told her she had committed a theft on a gentleman; she said, "It was not me - it was the other girl; there she runs up the street;" I brought her back - Payne searched her at the watch-house, and produced three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you told us all that Mendoza said to you? A. Yes; he said nothing more than that he had been robbed of three half-crowns - he did not describe the women as tall or short, or say a word of the kind - it is as false as God is true.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Brown accounted for her money? A. Yes - Mendoza seemed very much frightened, but perfectly sober; I do not recollect his giving any description of the women - I should consider him very likely to make a mistake.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. About two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Warwick-square, and saw through our back door, which is in the square, the prisoner at the gates in Warwick-lane - he was standing there; I walked round, and when I had got round, I saw he had got five or six feet from the shop, and was rolling a piece of lead in his apron - it was a small piece, rolled up; I stopped him just as he was getting out of the shop - I asked what he had got there; he dropped it, without answering - a constable was sent for.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Grant, pawnbroker, No. 70, London-wall. On the 23rd of September the prisoner pawned this flute with me for 1l. 1s. - I am confident of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the person before? A. Never - I gave him a duplicate, and have the counterpart; ours is a shop of considerable business - there are goods hanging in the window as in other shops; I do not consider it dark - the light is certainly impeded by the things in the window; he was not long in the shop - I did not write the duplicate for him, but was close by when it was written; it was taken in under my direction - I did not speak to the person who offered it; I believe he had a black handkerchief on - I am sure he had no great coat; I do not know the colour of his body coat, and am not certain whether it was a frock or body coat; I do not remember his dress, but have a perfect recollection of his face; the person who dealt with him is not here - he is well, and could have been here.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Have you a doubt of his person? A. None.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any private mark on them? A. No - I have a good many of this description; I have sold some, but not these, for I never send one out of the house without a mark - that is a rule in the house; I make them myself - if this was put into my hands fifty miles off I should know it, if it was in another manufacturer's shop; I swear no other maker makes flutes as I do - I have been thirty-five years in London, and if any flute was put into my hands, I could tell who made it without any private mark; I do not think more than twenty or thirty persons make this kind of article - I have no patent; I have four or five journeymen in the flute line - they do not work for other houses.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is your name stamped on that? A. Yes; no other maker has my name on his flutes - I always have a mark put on what goes out besides my name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it entirely to the mercy of the Jury.</p>
               <p>MR. GEROCK. I made this flute myself - there is an unicorn on the top of my name, and when I send any to a customer I put a star under my name, which is not on this.</p>

            . This is my flute - I value it at 5l.; they are sold for a great deal more; the silver and workmanship came to a great deal more - it is my own make.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your name on this? A. No, nor the unicorn; we do not always mark them directly they are finished - they are put into a drawer; there is no mark on it - I am certain it is my manufacture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose a gentleman offered you 4l. 19s. for this flute, would you take it? A. No - I have given an under value.</p>

            . I saw Lynes last Tuesday week, in the evening, between Ratcliff-cross and Cock-hill - she asked me to go home with her; I said I would not, and would have no connection with her; she walked all the way up the highway, and asked me to give her something to drink - I said, to get rid of her, I would give her a pot of ale or porter; I went with her to a private house, went up stairs, took out my money, and gave her a shilling - she called another girl to go and fetch the porter or ale- she then said the girl stopped a long while, and she would go to look for her; when she was gone, I missed a 10l. note, and seven sovereigns, which were wrapped up in it; they had been in my purse, in which was some small silver in a separate department - I know I had it safe when I saw her, because I took the purse out, put it on the table, and gave her the shilling out of it; the purse was in my left-hand breeches pocket - I missed the purse and all, but I found that was returned into the side pocket of my coat; I did not perceive it taken from me - I had had two glasses of grog with a gentleman, at Limehouse; I was in the room about a quarter of an hour - it was about ten o'clock at night, I think; I did not change the state of my dress at all - I am sure of that; I went down, and called the Policeman - when I called a second time he answered, and came to me; he told me to remain there, and sent another to me, who observed the number of the house, and took me to the night-officer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose this is your first beginning in robbery? A. Yes, Sir - I had lived with my master two years; I had seen Nathan before this time, passing up and down the street, but had never spoken to him - I went with a boy, named Young, who is not here - I had known him three months and better; Farrell is a person who was likewise present when we took the cloths, but he was acquitted - I was in jail three months and a fortnight - after I had done it I thought it was harm to do it, but I did not think so before; I did not give it a thought - I never intended to go back to my master; I did not intend when I went out to sell the cloth to any one who would buy it- I thought the night before that I would not go back; it was a good heavy bale of cloth - the boy is not here; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280041"/>am sure the prisoner is the same man - I was in the house with him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I slept that night at a lodging house, in Bunhill-row - there was one or two females in it; I had been there once before to call for a boy. who lived there - I was in prison five days after my trial.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at the corner of Shrewsbury-court - I know the prisoner's house. On the 13th of July I saw the coachman stop against my shop door, and this boy brought out the cloth - Nathan's house is fifty or sixty yards from mine; I went up the court, having some suspicion, and I saw them take it to a house opposite the house in which Nathan then lived - I went into a water-closet adjoining, which has a window, which looks into the yard of the house they went into - I heard some boy say, "Forty-pounds," and I heard Nathan say, "Ten-pounds;" I knew his voice, and am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you went and gave information? A. I did, when I received information of some cloth being lost from Mr. Brand - I had some suspicion it was stolen; I did not go to any Police-office - I am sure it was 40l. I heard; I am positive of that - it was not 30l.; I do not know about getting any expences; I am subpoenaed to come here - I never said that Nathan did not buy the cloth - I have heard him say he never bought it; I do not know that he did buy it - I will not positively swear that I never said to any body he did not buy the cloth - I never said, "Where is the use of my coming to give evidence when I can say nothing whatever about the transaction;" I never said so to an officer, nor ever said, "I can be on my oath Nathan did not buy it" - I did not go to Mrs. Nathan and say so; I did not go to her house and get drink since this trial - I had prior to it; I never went in after the day in question to my knowledge; I do not recollect that I did - I cannot say whether I did or not; I have drank in the house several times; I am sure it was not to myself that it was sold - I was not sure it was stolen, I only suspected it - I could not leave my business on any consideration.</p>

When the prisoner called on me, not at the time I paid this - my husband does not assist in the business at all; I generally paid for the beer, one after another; it might happen that I was not well or had not change, and the next time I paid for that and the other - I have no entries of what I pay; I conclude, by seeing these receipts, that I paid him - no one paid but me; he always signed the receipt on the day I paid; I am indebted to the prosecutor now for two casks of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever pay him without a receipt? A. No; when he left it without payment I paid him on the next occasion, but I never paid him for two at one time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing he came to you on the 19th of April, and had written a receipt without having the money, might he not have come on the 21st and given you a receipt dated on the 19th? A. Never; I always paid him the money before he wrote the receipt - I do not know whether he sat down to write; he wrote it in my presence, and put the day of the month and the date of the year - I have no particular recollection of either of these days.</p>

            . I was clerk to the prosecutor up to September last; I have received money from the prisoner, but never unless it was entered in the dray-book; I have examined the dray-book, and these sums are not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it your office to count the casks that went out? A. Yes, and I do generally, but if I was busy some other person might do it - they were counted again on their return, and the result expected to be found in the book, and the money paid down or accounted for; the amount of casks he had laid down were entered in the dray-book - a cask might be made up, but I should expect he would bring an account of what he had had; I do not know how there could be a balance created; I should have demanded the account of him - I went round, and inquired after this circumstance; there might be some cases in which the prisoner had paid for beer which the party were still in debt for, but I cannot speak to any one distinctly; I have seen some accounts in which the parties have got down beer, owing to the prisoner, which the prosecutor has no account of.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you, in the course of your examination, discovered that the person who was put down as a debtor, had never had the cask at all? A. No, if the prisoner had left a cask, and not got the money, he would have left this blank to show he had not yet received it; so on the 19th of April if he had left a quarter cask at Singleton's, he should have left the blank, that is the case uniformly through the book; it was his duty to leave the blank on the day he delivered the beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if he brought back the casks, or returned the money, the blank would not appear? A. No; I should have expected the money, unless he delivered the beer.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. But would you not expact to find the blank there? A. Yes; the book was made up the first thing every morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But if he did not leave the cask he would not enter the name? A. No.</p>

I was on duty, at past two o'clock in the morning of the 30th of September - I saw the prisoner on the bridge, with a pair of sculls, one in each hand; he was going from London towards Surrey - I asked him if he was going to work so early; he said Yes - I asked if they were his own sculls; he said Yes, and his name was William Jones - I found they were marked W. T., and I took them to the watch-house; a waterman, who was there, said they belonged to a man named Tyrrell, and I found him in the morning.</p>

I have had a great demand for copy-books and paper since I have been here, owing to my having been educated in the neighbourhood; you will oblige me by sending as below, as early as possible, by Salmon's coach from the Cross Keys, St. John-street, Smithfield. I am, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,

On the 26th of June last, a lady named Cashin, came with her daughters, to lodge at my house - the eldest daughter was Catherine; she appeared in perfect health when they first came, and continued so till within four or five weeks previous to the time that I went with her to Mr. Long, which was on Friday, the 13th of August - he lives at No. 41, Harley-street; Miss Catherine Cashin introduced me to Mr. Long - Mrs. Cashin, on the morning of that day, requested I would go with Miss Catherine to Mr. Long, and state to him her fears with respect to the wound on her daughter's back - I did so; he did not examine her back in my presence - he said Miss Cashin must go and inhale, and after that he would look at her back; I went with her while she inhaled, and after that Mr. Long had her in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe, as well as you can, what the process of inhaling was? A. When I went into the room there appeared to me to be two cabinet-pianos; on her entering the room, each lady took a pipe about a yard and a half long, and put it into an orifice in the machine, opposite to which she placed a chair, and put the other end of the pipe into her mouth; I should think there were eight or ten ladies in the room - Miss Cashin was half an hour or three quarters inhaling; she then went into a room down stairs, to which I did not go - I saw Mr. Long as we were going into the carriage; that was after Miss Cashin had been in the room: as we were going to the carriage Mr. Long expressed a wish that Miss Cashin would not omit coming every day to his house, for the purpose of inhaling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the wound on her back? A. He said it would be quite well in a few days - I went home with Miss Cashin.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of August, in consequence of the state Miss Cashin was in, and something Mrs. Cashin said to you, did you write to Mr. Long? A. I did, and between six and seven o'clock he came to the house, and saw Miss Cashin, in my presence; he examined the wound on her back, said it was in a beautiful state, and that he would give one hundred guineas if he could produce a similar wound on the persons of some of his patients - I directed his attention to a particular portion of the wound, which was much darker than the rest; it presented a dark inflamed appearance - he said it was the consequence of inhaling, and unless these consequences were produced he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280049"/>could expect no beneficial result. [Here the witness doubled a piece of paper, about five inches square, to show the size of the wound.] Mr. Long asked how I had treated the wound - I said I had applied a poultice of bread and water, with a large portion of hog's lard, and had given her a saline draught; he said I had done very well - I asked him what was to be done to allay the irritation of her stomach; he said he had heard of no irritation of the stomach; I told him that in my note I had expressed the words "unceasing sickness;" he said I had not, but on referring to the note, which he had with him, he found I had stated it - he said the sickness was of no consequence, but on the contrary, a benefit; I begged he would order something to quiet the stomach and bowels - he said it was altogether in consequence of inhaling, and that these symptoms combined with the wound, were proofs that his system was taking due effect; I begged of him to give her a composing draught - he said a tumbler of mulled port wine was a better composing draught than all the doctors could give, for that he hated the very name of physic - he directed me to give it to her, and on the staircase he requested I would expose the wound to the air; I objected to administer the mulled port wine, but he insisted on its being given - I gave her a wine-glass full, which was immediately rejected by the stomach; he requested I would expose the wound to the air, lay on a piece of linen, and keep a constant application of cold cream - I said, to expose a wound like that to the air would produce madness almost; he then said that, on reconsidering, he thought there could not be a better application than the poultice I had already named - he requested I would continue that poultice, and he should rely on my judgment, for an account of the wound on the following morning - that as I had constantly applied the poultice I should be better able, to from a correct opinion than he could; he then took his leave: I applied the poultice as he desired, and she got worse - Mr. Long came again on the following morning,(15th) between eleven and twelve o'clock; I was in Miss Cashin's bed-room with him - Mrs. Cashin was also there, and nobody else; Miss Cashin was in bed; on going into the room he very hastily took off his coat, threw it on the bed, and requested some soft dry linen to be procured; this was before any thing had passed, except the customary compliments on entering the room - he had asked how Miss Cashin was, and I said she was worse; after ordering the linen he very uncorteously stripped off her night dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say "uncorteously?" A. Because I never saw a <rs id="t18301028-112-deflabel630" type="occupation">medical man</rs>

               <p>Q. Before he put on his coat, and Mrs. Cashin thus addressed him, do you remember his saying any thing of the complaint she would have been under? A. He said that within two months she would have been seized with consumption - that the state of the stomach and bowels were all symptoms he wished to produce, and that they were proofs there were the seeds of consumption in her- when he had put on his coat, he said, in answer to Mrs. Cashin, that no person could be doing better than Miss cashin was - I pointed out to him again the same spot in the wound, which I had pointed out on the Saturday; it was then darker, and the wound had materially extended in that interval - he said that probably a number of biles would come out, which would be the consequence of inhaling, and what he wished to produce - he said she was going on uncommonly well; the linen he desired had been brought to him, but he made no use of it at all - Miss Cashin's back was laying exposed during all this conversation; I should think the wound was exposed to the air for ten or fifteen minutes - I again pressed his attention to the sickness, and Mrs. Cashin did the same - he said he had a remedy with him which would stay the sickness, but he would not then apply it, for the sickness would be of ultimate benefit to her, and he liked the sickness; Mrs. Cashin said, "Good God, Mr. Long, why don't you now apply it?" he said he did not wish the sickness to be stopped, that he had had a lady who had had sickness for six weeks, and she was better for it; that our fears were perfectly groundless, for no person could be doing better than Miss Cashin was - I then named the irritation of the bowels, and he ordered her to have some rhubarb and magnesia; before he went away he said if the sickness was not over by eleven or twelve o'clock at night he would call, and give her something that would stop it - this was Sunday morning; (Miss Cashin died about ten o'clock on the Tuesday morning;) he called again that Sunday night, between eleven and twelve, of his own accord; the sickness had continued, and he gave her some medicine which he brought with him; it was thrown off her stomach before Mr. Long left the room - he had stated in the morning that he was going to Richmond for the day, and would call on his return.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state, according to your observation, was Miss Cashin in the morning while Mr. Long was there? A. She presented in the morning a very distressed and restless appearance; she was tumbling and tossing about the bed - she got gradually worse, and when Mr. Long called, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I told him I thought the nervous system was so much affected something ought to be done, and probably some medicine might be given with effect - he said my fears were perfectly groundless, and it was my ignorance of his system, and that she would be perfectly well in two or three days; he then took his leave; I was with Miss Cashin till past two o'clock in the morning; we were constantly removing her pillow - her distress was extreme; Mr. Long called next morning between eight and nine o'clock - I was not then in the bed-room, but I stepped into the drawing-room, after he left Miss Cashin, to ask him how he thought she was; he said she was doing uncommonly well; I immediately left the room - he came again in the afternoon, after Mr. Brodie had been;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280050"/>Miss Cashin had continued gradually getting worse, in consequence of which Mr. Brodie was sent for, and saw her about six o'clock in the evening, and ordered a poultice and saline draught, which was administered, and she had temporary relief - Mr. Long called about seven o'clock the same evening; I saw him pass in and out, but did not speak to him - the poultice had been administered before he came; Miss cashin passed a very had night - I saw her on Tuesday morning, at half-past seven o'clock, and gave her a saline draught, by Mr. Brodie's prescription, and in half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, I gave her a cup of coffee and some dry toast; Mr. Long had not interdicted her from any kind of food at all - I heard him state, in the course of his attendance, that his patients night eat and drink whatever they liked, without restriction; after giving her the coffee and toast, I left her - she was then extremely ill; this was about eight o'clock - the bell rang violently, and there was a great thumping on the floor while I was at breakfast; I immediately went up to her bed-room, and found her dying - I tried to get a tea-spoon full of brandy into her mouth, but her jaws were quite set, and she was dead- Mr. Foulkes, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, had been sent for, but she was dead; I should think she died at very near ten o'clock, but, in my agitation, I cannot speak to the time - I had seen Mr. Long about six or seven o'clock the night preceding; he was not informed of Mr. Brodie having being called in, in my presence -Mrs. Cashin is not in this country.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did two ladies, named Cashin, come from Ireland? A. Yes, this and a younger one; the other was a patient of Mr. Long's before her - I understand she had been his patient from the time they came to England; I only went with Miss Catherine - she appeared in perfect health, and continued so till within four or five days of her going to the prisoner with me; she had been his patient for four or five days before I went with her.</p>

            . I live at Dublin. I married a sister of Miss Cashin's - in consequence of a letter which I received, I came over to this country; she had left Ireland about seven weeks, and was then in very good health - I arrived in England on Saturday, the 14th, about six o'clock in the evening, and went to see her immediately; I remained below stairs while the prisoner was up with her - he came down shortly after my arrival, and I asked him what he thought of Miss Cashin; he said, "As to Miss Cashin, she is doing remarkably well, just as I wish," and was just in the state he wished her to be - I remarked that her stomach was sick; he said that did not signify, that would be well of itself - before he came down I was in the hall, or on the stairs, and heard him conversing with Mrs. Roberts; she asked him if something should not be done to allay the heat of Miss Cashin's back - Mr. Long said it should be exposed to the air; Mrs. Roberts said she thought something ought to be put to it - he said,"Then, if there must be something, put a little cold cream, and sop it up with linen from time to time;" Mrs. Roberts said she (Miss Cashin) could not bear that - he then said, "What would you put?" she said she had applied a poultice, which had given relief in the morning: next morning, Sunday, I breakfasted with Mr. Long - I went on account of my sister; on leaving him, I told him I had come from Ireland to inquire into the health of the two Miss Cashins - he told me with regard to Miss Catherine Cashin, that her friends need be under no apprehension, for that her back was in the state he wished it to be, and that there were many of his patients would be glad to have such a discharge; her stomach, he siad, would get well of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in the course of your conversation, say any thing about what induced her to become his patient? A. He told me that a young lady, a patient of his, asked him what he thought of Miss Cashin, and that he told the young lady, unless Miss Cashin put herself under his care she would die of consumption in two or three months - that the young lady told Mrs. Cashin, the mother, the conversation she had had with him, and the consequence was, that Mrs. Cashin put Miss Cashin under his course of treatment, hoping to prevent her from consumption; he told me his treatment was to rub a mixture on different parts of the body, sometimes on the back, sometimes on the chest, head and the eyes also - he said that had been done to Miss Cashin, and asked me to sign a book which he had, binding every one to secrecy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say, "Binding every one to secrecy?" A. He produced a book, and asked me to sign it - I wished to see the purport of the obligation; I read it, and remarked that I had no objection to sign it, as it required us not to divulge what the mixture was, or the colour of it, and I could not divulge it, for I never saw it, and did not know what it was made of; there was a gentleman in the room at the time, who said, "Are you going to swear Mr. Sweetman?" and remarked that it was all nonsense - Mr. Long replied that he had his reasons for making people sign the book. My sister died on the Tuesday following - Mrs. Cashin is in Ireland.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. I believe Mrs. Cashin had come from Ireland on account of a younger daughter, Miss Ellen? A. Yes, she was supposed to be in a consumption - she brought her to England to put her under Mr. Long's care.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she lost one of her children before of consumption? A. I suppose it was considered consumption - her son had died about a year before at Lyons, in France; he was nineteen years old - Catherine was twenty-four, and the younger sister sixteen or seventeen; not more than seventeen.</p>
               <p>B. C. BRODIE, Esq. I am a surgeon. I went on Monday, the 16th of August, between five and six o'clock, to the house of Mrs. Roberts, and saw Miss Cashin - she was confined to her bed; I examined her person, and found her back very extensively inflamed - the whole of the inflamed surface must have been as large as the whole of a common plate, and in the centre of the inflamed part there was a spot as big as the palm of my hand, which was black, dead, in a state which we call slough or mortified - she was also suffering from incessant sickness; I was informed that nothing whatever would remain on her stomach- I prescribed some medicine for her, merely to allay the sickness - nothing further could be done at that time; I ordered a poultice to be applied to the back - I believe it had been poulticed before; I desired it to be continued -I thought her very ill indeed, though I did not at that time regard her to be in such very imminent danger as she was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280051"/>Q. Had you any means of judging how the place on the back had been produced? A. I should think some very powerful stimulating linament had been applied to the back; I called at the house on the following afternoon, and found she had died in the morning - in her state I should think it quite absurd to administer a tumbler of port wine - it was impossible it could stay on her stomach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. When you arrived at the house, and heard the young lady was dead, I believe you were perfectly astonished? A. I did not expect her to die that day; I do not know that I expressed great astonishment - I saw the body; mortification had extended in the course of the night very rapidly indeed -I did not examine the entire body.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a system among some of your profession of curing disease by counter-irritation? A. It is very common; a blister causes counter irritation.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not the things which are made use of as counter-irritation have different effects on different persons? A. Yes, they will; I have known cases where a blister will not disturb the system of one person, and produce very great distrubance in another: the bad appearance in this wound would not alter after death.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there means which may be used by professional gentlemen to check counter-irritation, if it proceeds too rapidly? A. Yes, there are, and they require to be used with discretion.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you think it right to apply to a person in perfect health, stimulating linaments, which would produce such a slough and sore as you saw on this lady's back? A. Certainly not, and I doubt very much whether any stimulating linaments, in common use among the profession, would produce the same effects - the same extensive mischief; I mean by that to include the constitutional effects and the local effects: the sickness and vomiting were as much the effects of what had been done as the mischief - if the linaments had not been applied to the back there would not have been the sickness nor the mortification.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon your judgment and experience, if lotion of so powerful a stimulating nature as to produce the effect you observed on the person of the patient, was applied to a person of her sex and appearance, being then in perfect health, was such an application likely to produce a derangement in the system, and to produce disease and danger? A. I think it would, and it has fallen to my lot to see another case, exactly similar, since.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there much difference in the constitution of persons, so as for the effect to be different, according to the constitution? A. There is - it depends on the constitution, the thickness of the skin, and other things; it is not uncommon to apply stimulants to the chest, blisters for instance - I never knew stimulants applied where there were no symptoms of consumption; I did not know the young lady before - when I saw her there was a black spot of mortification in the centre of the wound, which extended during the night; the black spot itself was as large as the palm of my hand; wine would have been proper to administer if the stomach would bear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you say it was improper is on account of the stomach? A. The question put to me was whether a tumbler of wine would be proper; mulled port wine, administered in a proper quantity, would not be improper, if the stomach would bear it - I was not present at the post mortem examination; the appearances I saw on the back were quite sufficient to account for death - I can say nothing about what produced these appearances, except from what I was told by Mr. Sweetman, Mrs. Roberts, and others in the house; I did not examine the back after the body was opened - I saw a portion of the dead skin, which was taken from the back.</p>

            . I am a bachelor of medicine. I attended at Mrs. Roberts' house, and saw the body of the deceased there, stated to be Catherine Cashin, on the Sunday morning after her death; I examined the body, and the wound on her back - (producing a memorandum) this was not made by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Give us an account of the appearances of the body, as well as you can, without referring to that? A. I will endeavour to do so, but it is not usual with medical men to recollect these things - we commit them to writing. I have heard Mr. Brodie's evidence, and concur in every thing he has stated, most certainly; I went to the tomb where she was buried; I saw the same body there, as far as I could possibly ascertain - it had similar appearances to the body I had seen; I had sewn up part of it - it had the sewing up which I had made, and also the incisions I made.</p>

            . I attended the examination of the body of the deceased, at the Roman Catholic chapel, Moorfields, on the 24th of August; Dr. Thompson, and various other surgeons were present - there was a piece of dead or disorganized skin, which we call an eschara - (which Mr. Brodie calls slough) between the shoulders, nearly the size of the crown of my hat; the parts beneath the skin were gorged with serum.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the appearances you saw on the back seem to you to have been produced by? A. If I was to hold a piece of hot iron about a quarter of an inch from the skin, it would produce such an eschara - we examined with a view to discern if there was any latent disease; we discovered none whatever - I examined under the brain and spinal marrow; the muscles were in a tolerably healthy state - they were in the state I should expect after laying some time in the tomb.</p>

            , ESQ. M.D. I attended the tomb, and was present at the examination of the body - the limbs and breast were plump and fleshy, and so was the body generally; there was no appearance whatever of disease, except where the wound was inflicted - not of disease which could have preceded the inflication of the wound; I believe there was no disease existing previous to that - there was no evidence of it whatever; I examined the brain - it was perfectly sound, and the spinal marrow was perfectly sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Was this on the Sunday after her death? A. On the 24th, the Tuesday week.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOGG, ESQ. I am a physician. I examined the body of Miss Cashin, with the other gentlemen, in the tomb at Moorfields chapel - I observed the appearances on the back very particularly; I have heard the evidence of the other gentlemen - I differ a little with Dr. Johnson's description of the spine, but I agree in the description of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280052"/>the wound on the back; I should have supposed it was produced either by fire or gunpowder - it had that appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you conceive any state in which, in a healthy body, the application of any thing which could produce such a sore could be of service? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, do not you agree with Dr. Johnson about? A. It struck me the sheet of the spine was discoloured opposite the external wound - the inference I should draw from that was, that there must have been very great constitutional disturbance ensuing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not state before the Coroner, that not having been present at the first examination, it was difficult for you to ascertain the cause of death? A. I said so, and that violence done to the nervous system was sufficient to cause death, particularly if done to a nervous young lady.</p>

            . I am in the prisoner's service, and have been so for six months - I was in his service on the 3rd of August; I remember Miss Cashin being a patient - she had a sister also a patient; I rubbed some liquid on the back of Miss Catherine Cashin on the 3rd of August, by Mr. Long's order - that was the first time I rubbed her back; I did not do it afterwards - I do not know what the liquid was composed of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Had Mr. Long a good many patients? A. Yes, a good many, many of them persons of rank and station - I was employed to rub the ladies; I used to take the lady who was to be rubbed behind a screen, which separated them from the rest of the room - the rubbing was for the purpose of producing a sore of discharge; she was rubbed but once - she came day after day to be dressed, and I washed round it with a lotion; I rubbed her the same as I did other persons, and washed her with the same lotion as others - it did not produce a greater discharge on her back than on that of other persons; there was not more discharging from her back than was usual - the rubbing usually produced a little discharge, not very much the first time; she was only rubbed once - she came to have it dressed till the 13th; I dressed it every day - it did not produce a worse appearance than usual; the bottle of lotion stood in the room where the ladies were - the Marchioness of Ormond and her daughter, Lady

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the same lotion applied to wash as had produced the sore? A. Yes - Miss Cashin's mother and sister were in the room when I rubbed her back, nobody else; when I had done this, I kept the bottle for other patients - when the liquid was out Mr. Long put more into it; the sore on Miss Cashin's back, on the 14th, was not bigger than the palm of my hand - not worse than other ladies; it was rather red - my master attended her every day.</p>

             came to me, with her mother and sister, the latter of whom was deeply affected with a pulmonary complaint, and had, as they informed me, been given over by her physicians; the deceased was supposed to be afflicted with the same disorder, and was, by her mother's desire, put under my care for examination and cure; the means I used, and the mode of treatment I adopted, were those, by which, in the course of the last four years I have been enabled, under God, to restore to perfect health a great number of persons of the first respectability and of high rank, after their cases had been declared hopeless, and they had been given over by some of the most eminent medical men of the present day: if the course of treatment by me in the case of the deceased happened to fail, it was a dispensation of Providence, which human means could not avert - it was such a failure as frequently occurs to medical practitioners of the first repute; I utterly deny that I have in any way been accessory to the death of

Gentlemen, I now leave the case in your hands with hope and confidence: an intention to do evil no one will impute to me, and it will be for you to decide whether a medical practitioner, he his comparative knowledge or skill what it may, shall be criminally answerable for a fatal event, which he could neither foresee nor avert. I am to be tried, not by any fancied system of justice, but by the law of England, constitutionally administered - to that law I make my firm and solemn appeal; you, Gentlemen, will have it explained by the learned Judge, and on his wisdom and your conscience, I place my firm reliance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had stolen them, he had plenty of time to sell them? A. He put them off his shoulder when the witness asked to look at them; he had the basket on his shoulder, as workmen usually have.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure of it? A. I have my mark on it, and I took the No. 2154 - the prosecutor did not describe it before he saw it - he had said it was a gold watch; he could walk as steady as I could - he stated he had been robbed in Farringdon-street, and I found the prisoner about four hundred yard from there.</p>

On the 5th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and bought a sheet of paper, which came to 1d.; he gave me a shilling - I gave him change, and put the shilling into the till; there were two other shillings there, but I put this on the half-crowns - I am certain the other two shillings were under the half-crowns; I had hardly shut the till before the officer came in, and asked to look at the shilling - I took it out directly; I found it on the half-crowns; I did not know there were any more shillings in the till - I turned the half-crowns over, and found two under them; the shilling he gave me could not have got under them - I marked it, and gave it to the officer; I am sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you rattle the silver about to find a sixpence? A. I gave him a sixpence, which I took from the half-crowns I had laid the shilling on - there was but one sixpence; I did not rattle the silver about - the sixpence was on the top of them; there were three or four half-crowns - they were in a small bowl in the till; I gave him the sixpence out, and then put the shilling into the bowl - the half-crowns entirely concealed the two shillings.</p>

On the 27th of September she was about to leave - I had given her warning; I demanded to see her box, which she opened very readily - I discovered four dresses, three gold rings, four worked bands, a black velvet collar, and three cambric shifts, and in her stockings I found two damask napkins; I immediately claimed them, but suffered her to go - in consequence of some further discovery, I made inquiries for her, and found her the next day at Madam Giradour's, a mantua-maker, in Albemarle-street; she was in company with a great many other persons, who were work - people, I suppose - I told her I had missed other articles, and asked her about them; she was excessively impertinent, and said she did not know where they were, nor had she robbed me - Madam Giradour said I had better go down and look into her box again; the prisoner pointed out her box - it was opened, but I did not examine it, as the first parcel I saw in it was sealed; I took it up, and in consequence of what then took place I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280058"/>got an officer, and gave her in charge - I gave the rings and damask napkins to the officer; I kept the other articles myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any thing of yours in the second box? A. I had not time to see, for she flew at me, and said she would stranger me, and so did Madam Giradour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you been separated from your husband? A. Perhaps eight or nine years; I have a sufficient maintenance from him - I know General Palmer; I was not living with him- the prisoner had quitted my service once, when I found she was in the family-way, and I sent her to Paris; I afterwards wrote to her, and sent the letter by Mr. Ess - she went to my lodging at Paris, by my desire; the porter had charge of my things there, but the prisoner had the keys of my property, and when I went there I found all my property safe; I afterwards sold my property there - I did not then make the prisoner a present of any thing; I have given her some things in England - I never gave her a small basket; on my oath the prisoner had not said she would not stay in my service - I had given her warning a week before; she had not told me she should return to France, nor had she ever hinted such a thing - I was acquainted with all the gentlemen attached to the British embassy in France; I was intimate with them all - I was not aware, to the last, where she was going; she said she was going to France; but had not her passport, and I offered to write to the secretary of the embassy to afford her the opportunity of going that day: the landlady's son and another person brought the box down to my room - I sent for the prisoner; she went up stairs, got the key, and opened it herself - I did not say, while the box was searching, that I had missed a great quantity of jewellery; I said I had missed some things, and for that reason I searched her box- she did not say, "Here are the rings you gave me in Paris;" she said they were brass, and she had found them- I have not charged her with stealing the dresses, as I was fearful it would be made a capital charge - I am perfectly certain I did not give these things to her; I did not give charge of her at first, as she was a foreigner, and I did not wish to hurt her - the next morning I missed other things, and I knew she was intimate with the cook at Madam Giradour's; I had returned a dress to Madam Giradour, which had been made badly - I asked to see her box, and did; when I saw that the parcel contained papers I took my hand off it - she then flew at me, and swore she would strangle me; I never said I would be revenged on her, let it cost me what it might, nor any thing of the kind - I took her that day because she flew at me, and so did Madam Giradour, and perhaps twenty people besides; I did not say before the Magistrate that it was the conduct of another person which induced me to prosecute.</p>

               <p>MARY WYATT. These are my rings, and the box in which they are, and these napkins are mine; I never gave them to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not given her things? A. Yes, I have given her hats and dresses, but not these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked to go away, as I was forced to be up three parts of the night, and my health was injured; so long as she thought I was going to Paris she would not prosecute me, but when she found I was to stay in London she swore I should not stay in any place, and she would do me every injury she could - she made me carry my box down; she said she had lost a few trinkets, and told me to open it - I said, "Madam, here are the things you gave me in Paris, when you sold a few goods;" I gave her all these things myself - I went to Madam Giradour, and the next day she came and said she missed a great number of things; I said I did not believe it - she asked to look into my trunk; I said I was willing - she went into the kitchen at Madam Girarour's; I opened my trunk, and she took out a paper, which was sealed - I begged her not to unseal it; she took the paper, opened it, and would not give it me; I took it, and it was torn - I told her I wished a justice would come, and look into my trunk.</p>

I met the prisoner on the 30th of September, in Ropemaker-street, with this piece of oil-cloth under her gown - she went up a passage, and when she came out I stopped her, and asked whose it was; she said her own property, and she lived in the Commercial-road - I took her to the station, and then she said she met a woman who gave her 2 1/2d. to carry it, that she wore a cloak and had a black eye; I went to some shops and found the owner - she was about two hundred yards from Mr. Hughes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he perfectly collected? A. Yes, and gave the same statement he does now at the station-house, and before the Magistrate; I do not recollect the prisoner saying he had asked him to show him to the Commercial-road; the prosecutor said to him, "Confess at once whether you have taken it or not," and I think he used the words "It will be better for you."</p>

            . I received the money from this lady. I went to the shop and purchased 1 lb. of arrow root, and a pot of golden ointment, for which I paid the money she gave me to the prisoner; he gave me sixpence in charge out of the till - I should know the money again.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. I went to my till about a quarter before nine o'clock on that Saturday morning, (the purchase was made at eight;) I found only one of the half-crowns and the shilling - I afterwards, with the assistance of Clements, searched the prisoner's box; I found the half-crown in it - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you any other shopman? A. No; there were other shillings and sixpences in the till, about the same money I had seen in at seven o'clock, when we opened the shop - we generally take from two to five shillings in the morning; I never knew him to go to the till and take change for any money- it is not usual in my shop, though I do not know that I should have objected to it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you a drawer from which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280061"/>you gave change? A. Yes; but he had no access to that.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I went to Mr. Jones', and searched the prisoner's box; I found in it this small box, containing three half-crowns, twelve sixpences, and nine shillings - I think there were two sovereigns in it, which the prisoner had; this is the half-crown which the prosecutor identified - it is marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner there? A. Yes; it was in his bed-room - he pointed it out to me; I took the key out of his pocket and opened the box.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. This is the half-crown - here is a sort of a J. under the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About five years - I went for his character, but did not see the gentleman; he had conducted himself with propriety up to this time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say what money had been paid him that morning? A. No; there might have been 2s. 6d. substituted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has it not frequently happened that 4s. 6d. has been paid one day, and 4s. 6d. another, to the same account? A. No, I do not recollect it; I have occasionally called on the witness, but I do not recollect receiving money for which the prisoner gave receipts; he had no commission on the sale of beer - he had his wages at the end of the week, a sum for cask-money, and 3d. in the pound for what he brought home; there was nothing due to him - he was settled with every Saturday night; these receipts are the prisoner's writing - this in the book is my own; I swear on these days I received no more than I stated - there is nothing to call my attention to these sums but the book.</p>

I was on duty about half past twelve o'clock; when I got to the corner of Hatton-garden I heard the prosecutor say, "Give me my watch;" I went up, and Collins gave me this watch out of her hand; I took both the prisoners, with the assistance of my brother officer - in going along one of them said she knew nothing of the other party; the other said she told her to take it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was on the opposite side - the officer called me; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoners; I took hold of Collins - in going up Hatton-garden I said,"Did you take the watch?" she said, "No, the other one took it and gave it me;" I do not think the other heard that - when we got to the station Collins said she took it, but the other told her to take it; Rowley was present all the while, and said she knew nothing about it.</p>

The prisoner came on Tuesday, the 21st of September, about four o'clock, to my house on business from a customer named Shields - I was sitting at my desk when he came in, but had occasion to remove to my ledger after I had found the nature of his business; the ledger was in the counting-house, but about three or four yards off - I had before drawn a cheque for 64l. 2s. 6d. on Grote and Co., and had placed it opposite me on a desk; I had drawn it about noon, but had seen it safe not five minutes before the prisoner came in - I made out a small account from the ledger, and gave it the prisoner, who went away; it did not occupy me two minutes, and I should think not one - while I was making it out my back was towards the prisoner; I am certain the cheque was safe when he came in, and in about five minutes after he was gone I missed it - I had noticed it there, as the person I wrote it for did not come for it, and I had been considering whether I should lock it up or destroy it - one of my partners was in the counting-house, and a servant had come in, but no other person; I sent a person to the banker's to stop the payment, who returned and said it had been paid - I sent about five minutes after the prisoner left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you two partners? A. Yes - the cheque was drawn about twelve o'clock; I suppose it is full a mile from our house to Grote and Co.'s, the bankers - their house is in Thread-needle-street; I had not seen the prisoner before - I saw the cheque five minutes before he came; he came about four o'clock - we are in a large way of business, and many persons call in the course of a day, but I am certain no person came in after I saw the cheque, but my partner, and my servant, who are not here, and the prisoner; the cheque was about the middle of the desk - the door of the counting-house was to my right-hand, and the desk I went to was on my left; the prisoner stood on my right-hand - it is a double desk; my partner was opposite to me, but when I went to the ledger, he came round and spoke to me there, so that at that time his back was towards the prisoner - I should think I was not two minutes drawing out the account; this is the cheque.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe any thing at all particular about the person? A. No, Sir - I did not observe him to be heated or out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280066"/>breath; I only recollect I gave him half a crown, and he asked me to give him two shillings and sixpence - I never said the prisoner was not the man; I should think the distance to our house from the prosecutors' is about a mile - it is about the middle of St. John-street.</p>

I said, "I have a particular reason for asking you;" he said, "Go hang yourself; I am going in doors" - I said I would not let him go unless he gave me a more satisfactory answer; he said he would not tell me his name; I said I would lodge him in a place of security - he said, "What for?" I said about a cheque; he said, "D - n the cheque, I know nothing of it;" I said, "Do you know Musgrove?" he said Yes; I said,"He gave me the information;" he said, "D-n his b-y eyes, when I see him I will do for him" - I said,"You must accompany me, but I will go to this lamp to search you;" he said No, he would go to the station-house, but I should not search him there - he then said,"Well, well, you seem to do as you like with me" - I put my hand into his pocket; I found several papers, and saw him shifting a paper apparently into his waistcoat pocket - I laid hold of his arm, and between the sleeve and the arm I found this paper (reads) "Left 48l. 10s., watch, and spoons.

            . My husband is a miller - we live at No. 11, Frederick-place. The prisoner had lodged with me, but left me in the middle of September - he owed me some money, and on the 7th of October he came, between five and six o'clock, paid me 1l., and said he would pay the remainder that night or in the morning; he came again that night, and paid 15s. more, which was all that was due - he came again about eight o'clock on the Saturday morning; he had left a brown coat with me, and took out of the pocket of it, a paper parcel, open at one end, but what it was I cannot say - there was some writing on it, and at the bottom I saw "Marylebone;" at the time he paid me the money, I saw he had some sovereigns and silver in one hand, and in the other some paper, which appeared to me to be notes - he held it out in his hand, and said, "You think I have no blunt, but I have."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you never said to any person, or persons, that you never saw me with any parcel at all? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did he ask the price of the trousers? A. No; that I will swear - I did not show him any trousers, but I did the others; the prisoner did not offer me any money - I showed the others two or three pairs of trousers; I sold them a waistcoat and a pair of trousers, but not of the same description as these - I suppose the prisoner is a sailor; I found him afterwards sitting on his chest, at the Peacock, with the hat he had bought in his hand - the officer said to him,"You must go with me;" he made no answer, but took his key, opened his chest, and gave me the trousers - he said, "I thought I had paid you; I will pay you for them;" he offered to pay the officer, who said he dared not take it.</p>

I said, "For taking a pair of trousers from Mr. Davis' shop;" he took out the key, unlocked the chest, and took out these trousers, which the prosecutor said were his, and had been taken from the shop - the prisoner said, "Have I not paid for them?" the prosecutor said, "Certainly not;" when we got outside the prisoner said he would pay for them, and pay me for my trouble.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe be behaved well to you? A. Yes; he wanted to speak to me, but I was hasty; it was cold weather, and I had given him some drink that morning-I would take him into my employ again.</p>

The prisoner came into our service the latter end of May, recommended by the matron of Covent-garden workhouse; I had a ring in my care, in my father's house - it belonged to a gentleman, and a neck-chain of my own; I missed them on the 14th September, with the other things - they were in a box, which I placed in my father's bed-room, on the first floor, when I left home, which was in July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer me the neck-chain to pawn for you to get money to go to the fortune-teller, because you could not get to your father's till before you went to school? A. No; I had the neck-chain in my possession, and desired her to go and ask the value of it, and she brought it back to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marylebone. I was fetched to Mr. Martin's, on the 15th of September, and found the prisoner there - I inquired among the servants, and suspected the prisoner; she gave me this pocket-book, with eight, duplicates in it, one of which relates to a ring pawned at Chapman's; he gave it up before the Magistrate - as she was a female, I desired Miss Martin and her mother to search her; Miss Martin brought me down two duplicates, one for a petticoat, which the pawnbroker gave up; the other was for a shift - one duplicate was for a silk handkerchief; that was given up - Miss Martin produced a white handkerchief to me, as coming out of her box.</p>
               <p>MISS MARTIN. I was present when her box was searched, and I found the handkerchief in it, marked with my father's initials; this neck-chain I know - it was my sister's, who is dead; this is a mourning-ring - it is my father's, and was in the same drawer with the neckchain; the other ring is mine.</p>

I listened to what they had got to say; I asked what concern it was - Smith said it was an out - and - out concern, and as safe as the Bank; Phillips up and told me it was where he had been living on Ludgatehill - he said there were a great number of shawls up in the one pair, which was a warehouse, and there was a great deal of money in the big desk; I asked how it was to be done - he said there were apartments to let, and one was to go up to look at the appartments - another was to follow in close after, and go down stairs; he asked me to take a walk and look at the house - I went with Phillips and Smith; neither of us went in at that time - they asked if I had got any tools or instruments; I said No - Smith said he could get another man who would find the tools and every thing, if he would he in it - we separated, and next day we three met again; Phillips left us to go and find the man - I and Smith were coming up near Liquorpond-street, and met a man who was a stranger - Smith said he was one of the grand mob, and went and spoke to him, and in about five minutes they both came up to me - we went to have something to drink together; I do not know that man's name; we went to a public-house - the man said he had not got any thing of the kind himself, fro he had left it off, but he would find a man; Smith said he could get a man himself - the young man said it was only a few minutes' walk; we all three went down to Mount Pleasant, close by the House of Correction, into the Cheshire Cheese public-house - the young man went to speak to Wilson, and brought him to Smith - Wilson said he could complete the concern, if it was worth while; Smith told him how it was to be done; Wilson said he should like to see the young man that put it up - we came out, and met Phillips at the corner of Liquorpond-street; he told Wilson how it was to be done, and what money there was - Wilson asked if any men lodged in the house; Phillips said only a few old people, who lodged up at the top of the house - Wilson asked if he was sure the shawls were good for any thing; Phillips said that he should see some of them, and that he had lived at the house a few weeks before - we all went on together to a public-house in Monmouth-street, St. Giles'- he told us to stop there and he would go and get the duplicates of some shawls which he had pledged - he went and returned with a bundle and three duplicates; the bundle contained three shawls without borders; one duplicate was for a shawl pawned for 21s., another for 15s., and the other for some stuff for 3s. 6d. - Wilson said he should take them to a party to look at, and tell them he should have a quantity of shawls for them, and they might judge by them what they were worth - the shawls were got out of pledge by some people who were to buy them -I did not see the money advanced, but I saw the shawls after they were redeemed - they were pawned some where in Goswell-street; I saw Phillips go into a person's house, who I understood was to purchase the shawls - we then all four went to Spitalfields; Phillips gave the shawls without borders to Wilson, to do away with, and he brought 10s. as the money he had got for them - Wilson and Phillips then left us; Wilson said he would bring the instruments down to the Cheshire Cheese next morning, and next morning we all four met there - it was agreed among us to be done on the Friday following, but it was afterwards put off till the Monday; on the Monday we all went down to Mr. Cleland's house, about two o'clock in the afternoon; Wilson went up to look at the apartments, which were to let - Smith followed in close after him: Wilson came out in about ten minutes, and told Phillips it was all right, and that Smith had gone down safe - we all three came away to the Cheshire Cheese; I went to Mr. Cleland's that afternoon, alone - I had given information on the Friday before to Mr. Cleland; I went on Monday, some time after Smith had gone in - I rang the bell; a young man belonging to Mr. Cleland came to the door in Ludgate-hill - I told him what would take place in the night, and that a person was concealed; I did not go in - I went down towards Gray's Inn-lane, and at the Cheshire Cheese I found Wilson; this was before dark - he asked where I had been to; I gave him no positive answer, but he said if he thought there was any thing amiss, he would knife me, if I did not stick true - I understood he meant to put an end to me; I told him I had been out, but did not say where - Phillips and Wilson had been playing at skittles; Phillips said it would be best for him to go home, because then there would be no suspicion, and he went - we were then there would be no suspicion, and he went - we were to meet him at White Condnit-house at four o'clock precisely next afternoon, and to bring his share there; I was with Wilson from that time, except for an hour, when he went to tea; a coach was to meet us on Holborn-hill between eleven and twelve o'clock, to carry away the shawls - we got into the coach a little before twelve that night; I did not know the driver- we got out again, and walked to the coach-rank in the Old Bailey, the coach following us; another coach overtook us, with another party in it, and we both stopped together at the rank in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other party acquainted with your intention? A. Yes, they knew what was going to be done; they all got out and got into the coach we had at first got into - there were seven of us in all then; we then drove to Bridge-street, to the rank - we all got out, and came opposite Mr. Cleland's house, on Ludgate-hill, and four of them went away; they were going to another part of the City; they left one of their party with me and Wilson; Wilson told us to go down to the coach in Bridge-street, and he would walk up and see if all was right - he came back, and told us he had tried the door, it was fast, and he thought the vagabond had gone to sleep, with drinking the ale in the cellar - he went back again, and tried the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280075"/>I staid by the coach; he did not return, but was taken into custody - I was in sight of the persons who had him in custody, and was afterwards examined by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. I asked what you were doing for your living, and you said if I would stop till the evening I should see? A. No, I told you I had been at work driving a hackney-coach and as a horsekeeper - I did not say I was following my old course of life; I did not go with you that evening and pass off 25s. in bad coin - I had come out of the Penitentiary in April last, and knew you there; a day or two after we first met, a hackney-coachman came in, and asked how I got on about a case - I said I had had ten days' confiuement for charging 1s. more for a fare than was due to me; I did not say I had three warrants out against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "We have both been transported, and are not going to give in yet?" A. I said no such thing, nor that I had stolen a coat from Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How many names have you gone by? A. The name of Hussey, and no other; I knew if I did not give information I should have been hung, for I could not get rid of any of them, and I knew if I did something of this kind they would have nothing more to do with me; I have had nine years' transportation, and I thought that enough - I was not innocent of what I was transported for; I gave information on purpose to get rid of them, thinking none of them would entice me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say, "I am going to give information?" A. Yes, but then they would make away with me; I have been transported twice - the first time was for brushes and several articles, taken from a gentleman in Bryanstone-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a burglary? A. No, down an area - I was more than five years at the Penitentiary for it, and exactly five years afterwards I was sent there again - I was not in custody between those times; I was four years with Mr. Wilkinson, a post-master - the second conviction was for receiving some knives and a time-piece, stolen from' Squire Horsefall; they had been given me to carry - I was guilty - I was in the Penitentiary for that a little better than four years; I came out last April, and since that have had ten days for over-charging 1s. - I never drove a night coach; I drove for Mr. Smith for four or five weeks and a few days for Mr. Fenny, of Ratchliff-highway, while his man was ill; I had let a man drive Mr. Smith's coach one night, and he charged 2s. too much - Smith wanted me to pay for the Summons - I would not, and left him; I did not return to him after the ten days were up - I aferwards worked for Chapman, a farmer, at Northall, and left him because he had nothing to do-he said he would employ me if I could cut corn. The coachman said if I did not pay 1l. he would get warrants against me, but I never saw them; I know nothing of a warrant for exacting 4s. 6d. -I have told Smith several times that if we went down into the country we should get some work, and be more comfortable than going on in this way; I did not object to the proposal at the Cans, because they would have been after me continually, at every place I got, and I thought if this spread, about my giving information, they would not come near me; I still went with them after giving the information - I cannot state whether I told the Magistrate about their playing at skittles, and Phillips going home; I must have told him Phillips said he would go home to avoid suspicion, and I stated also that his money was to be taken to a public-house by White Conduit-house - I must have stated that; you will find it down if all I said was taken down - I have been kept in the Compter ever since this, to be a witness here; we were in the public room at the Cheshire Cheese - the master and mistress were there at times; there is a girl here who lived with Phillips - she must have seen us at the Cans; she was no acquaintance of mine - I never saw her till I saw her with Phillips: I have had no conversation with her about what she was to state here, nor on the subject of this robbery; I have been in the Compter all the time - I saw her at Guildhall, but had no conversation with her about the robbery.</p>

            . I live in Arthur-street, Goswell-street. I was acquainted with Phillips for five weeks, and saw Smith two or three times, but did not hear any thing said by them about Mr. Cleland's house - I know nothing of the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Pressey? A. I have seen him five or six times - I saw him with Phillips at the Cans, and before the Magistrate: we said nothing about the robbery - I went there about pledging two shawls; Pressey came to my place and told me Phillips was taken up - he took me to a public-house, and then told me all about it, about Mr. Cleland's house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who did you pledge shawls for? A. One for myself and one for Phillips - they both had borders to them; I never inquired where they came from - I have not seen them since; I pledged them about a fornight before Phillips was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How came you at Guildhall? A. Forrester, the officer, came and searched my place, and took me there; Pressey came to me just before the officer - the officer took a great many of my duplicates away, to see if the things were Mr. Cleland's, but found nothing - I had given the duplicates of the shawl to Phillips.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday night, the 23rd of August, at twelve o'clock, I received information from an officer - I looked out and saw some suspicious characters on Ludgate-hill; I saw six or eight persons about - I kept about Cleland's house, and about one o'clock in the morning I saw Wilson try<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280076"/>Mr. Cleland's door; he pressed against it with his hand- I missed him for some time, and took him into custody in the Old Bailey, which is nearly opposite to the house; I saw him cross from St. Martin's-court into the Old Bailey, ran after him, and took him - he attempted to get from me twice on Ludgate-hill; Ridgley was with me - we kept hold of him, and at the end of Farringdon-street he threw himself down; his hat fell off - we got him up, and took him to the watch-house; I did not receive the bag till it was brought. to the watch-house - it contained a phosphorus-box, dark-lantern, and pieces of candle; Mr. Cleland gave me a centre-bit a few days afterwards at his own house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body there besides Ridgley? A. No other officers - some friends of Mr. Cleland were looking out, as it was excepted the house would be robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLELAND. I found that centre-bit in the dust-bin in which Smith was concealed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Phillips had been in your service? A. Yes, from the 27th of April to the 27th of August - I had trusted him with property to a considerable amount, and when he left I promised to take him again if I should have employ for him.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. Do you or your man recollect seeing Pressey on some excuse before he gave the information? A. I never saw him till he gave the information - several questions have been asked at my house since this; Phillips' mother called, and asked if inquiries had been made whether that was No. 17, Ludgate-hill - this was after Phillips was in custody.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I had just been liberated from the Penitentiary - I met Phillips, whom I knew before, on Holborn-hill; we were together an hour or two - I saw him several times after, and met him at the Cans, and at another time I was at the Cans, Pressey came in; I asked what he was doing for his living - he said he was following his old course, and asked what I intended to do; I said my character was lost, but if I could get employ, I should - I asked what he was doing; he said, "If you will go with me to-night, you shall see" - I went, and he passed 1l. worth of base coin at a shop at the corner of Red-Lion-square; I have sent to know if they did not receive two crowns and four half-crowns that night - they say they did, but do not know the person; Pressey asked me several times to put him into a concern - he said, "Who was that I saw you with?" I said Phillips - he asked what he had done; I said he had lived at a shawl warehouse - he said, "Cannot you get a little information about that;" I met Phillips, and asked him some questions about it, then went and related the matter to Pressey - he said,"We can do that if you have a mind;" I said I never did any thing of the kind, but agreed to accompany him - he said he knew Michael Smith, and he asked him several times about the tools; he kept putting if off, and said he would have nothing to do with it; he said, "It is as good as bread, let us do it" - we were all three together; I went and found money to treat with - I refused to go; he said, "Well, I will take the things and go" - he went on Thursday: we waited on the opposite side - he came out, told me somebody was on the stairs, and they could not go down; he afterwards asked if I would go down -I said I would; I swear, before God and man, that Pressey was to commit the robbery, but Phillips and Wilson had nothing to do with it.</p>

             called in the morning, between ten and eleven o'clock; I answered the door myself - he said if a parcel should be left there, directed for Mr. Horne, a jeweller, in Houndsditch, would Mr. Morrow take it in; I had not seen him before - he then came back, and said if there was any thing to pay, Mr. Morrow was to pay for it, and Mr. Horne would call in the evening, bring some work, and settle for it; in the afternoon the other prisoner brought a parcel, directed for Mr. Horne, jeweller, Houndsditch - he demanded 1s. 6d.; I went and got half a crown, gave it him, and told him to go next door and get change - he went to the grocer's, at the corner, but I never saw him come out; he never returned - in the afternoon I was going out, and took the parcel to Mr. Horne; it was my father's money I gave him.</p>

On the 5th of October I concealed myself in a part of my premises, and watched him while he was cutting - I saw him much flurried, and looking about him; he put his things into his bag, and was going away - I called him back, and said, "I want to see the cut of a waistcoat you have in your bag;" he hesitated, and said, "I have been long enough here to cut out a waistcoat," but at last I said,"I want to see what you have got in your bag;" I turned out the contents, and found this yard and a half of cloth rolled up in the other things - the fellow piece of cloth was then laying on the cutting-board; he immediately implored forgiveness, said he did not know what possessed him to commit such an act, and it was his first offence -I had before spoken to him about cloth: I called in an officer, who found some things at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. Upwards of three years - I had the highest confidence in him; he is married, and has a family - I never allowed him to take home cloth to cut out; here are other articles which I know to be mine, but this piece of cloth I particularly speak to - he had not left my house; he was just going out - he should not have taken any cloth out till it was cut up for garments; this cloth could not have been put in undesignedly - it was rolled up tight.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What were his wages? A. Three shillings and sixpence a day, and he had what work he liked to do; he could get 35s. a week.</p>

I was walking with my wife in the Kent-road, and observed two coaches driving towards London; the gig, which turned out to be Mr. Minshull's, was a-head when I first saw it - it seemed to be driving steadily, but being a-head of them it was difficult to tell at what rate it was driving; the coaches were not driving at an unusual pace, certainly not at a pace at which the coachman could not have the command of the houses- the first coach passed on the right side- the next coach then came up, and it appeared that the horses and the fore part of the coach passed the gig without touching, but the hind part in some way, caught the gig - the gig might have been from seven to ten feet from the road, and the middle of the road was gravelled, which would have been an inducement to the coaches to keep near the pain; I have always kept horses, and been used to driving - it appeared to me that a person not used to driving might have been intimidated, and pulled his rein off, which would turn his hind-wheel towards the coach; it appeared to me to be accidental - the moment it happened the prisoner pulled up, seemed very sorry, and rendered every assistance in his power; he had not been going at an outrageous pace, but seemed to be avoiding the gravel, as every coachman would do - I ran up, and Mr. Miller had picked the deceased up; I desired him to take him to the Bells, where he was dressed, and then sent home; the prisoner was one of the most steady and respectable coachman on the road.</p>

Six besides the prisoner, but the others do not sell goods - they only make them up and get them ready, under his orders; our business is more particularly retail - we have a counter: the till is formed of the prisoner's desk - he puts the money into it; no one sells goods but the prisoner while he is there - when he is not, one of the men do, and give him an account; some trifling entries may possibly have been omitted, but that is provided for by his putting down sundries, if he has more money than is accounted for - on the day after the 25th of August, he appears by the book to have received 12s. 1d.; I am not aware he has ever forgotten something on one day and put it down the next - I should have told him to put the date against it, if he had mentioned it to me; people often buy things and pay for them without a receipt - it depends partly on him and partly on the persons who come, whether he gives a receipt or not - he has a family, and his wife has lately been confined.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I heard of the loss of the sheep, and on the 17th of September I saw two men on the road with potatoes, and followed them to the prisoner's house- I saw the prisoner, and told him as I had followed these men, and found stolen property in his house, I should insist upon searching the house - he put himself in an attitude of resistance, and said I should not, he would sooner lose his life - I said I would search; he then begged I would allow time for his wife to dress herself - I said I would, and I waited a sufficient time for that; I then heard a bustle, and went up stairs - the prisoner was not in the room; I asked his wife what she had in bed with her; she said, "Nothing but myself and my child;" the prisoner had been up once or twice to dress himself, and to tell his wife to dress - I then saw in the room a pan and a small piece of mutton in it, and some droppings of brine from the pan towards the bed - I said I should search the bed- his wife began to cry; I searched, and under the bed I found the mutton - I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said he bought it on Tuesday night; I said, "Who did you buy it of?" he said, "I don't know the man by name, but I should know him if I saw him;" I said,"Did you buy the whole carcase?" he said Yes: I said,"Was the head and skin to it?" he stopped a few seconds and then said, "It is of no use telling a lie, my brother brought it here on Tuesday night" - this is the skin of the ram.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not follow the prisoner to his house? A. No - it was a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning; he came down undressed, except his shirt - he refused to let me search his house without a warrant - I waited eight or ten minutes; there is one room up stairs and one down - I shut the door of the house, and locked it; I had an officer outside - the prisoner went up stairs once or twice, and I should think he had time to put the meat under the bed; I had his brother in custody, and he called out, "Jack, it is of no use;" I think I have told the precise words he used, as near as I can - I am sure he did not say it was bought; he at first said he bought it, and then said his brother had bought it - I had not his brother then in custody; he had made his escape on account of the potatoes - I have the skin in my possession, and it has been so ever since; I showed that and the mutton that I had found.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure he said it was of no use telling a lie? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a cutler, and live in Tower-street. On the 20th or 21st of September the prisoner came and asked me to buy some blades; I might have seen him before, but I did not know him - he asked me 2s. for one dozen of blades; he came the next day to know if I would buy the others, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask me many times if I had got such things? A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has called me out of the gate many times, and asked me, and in the street too; I had no work for fifteen months, and was willing to do any thing I could.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 23rd of October I was at the station-house, and was locking up a woman who was drunk; one Meadows was given in charge by Mr. Burke, on suspicion of felony - the prisoner seemed to know him, and had been lodging with him; I locked them both up - the prisoner said to me, "Take this (holding out this spoon), and it will make it all right;" I made no reply, but when I came from below I saw the prisoner come from the passage, and this spoon laid on the place he came from; it was a broken spoon he offered me, and this is broken - and to the best of my belief it is the same he offered; the inspector asked him where he got it - he said from John's, he had broken it in playing improperly with it, and he put it into his pocket for fear of having a row.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did you do with it? A. I put it back from me into your possession again - I saw you coming from the shelf, and this spoon laid there; the inspector the eatened to report me, but it was because he thought I was taking this to compromise a matter - I had put a small paper on that shelf before, and there was nothing there then.</p>

               <p>EDWARD COHEN. I live in Great St. Helen's, and at Suffolk-place, Islington. I had been round the coast, and returned to town on the 21st of August, by the Margate steam-boat - we landed about four o'clock, at St. Katharine's; Cooper, by my direction, met me there - my wife and two daughters were with me; I had nine large packages, containing the articles stated in the indictments - I had seen them packed up, and they were in the steamboat with me; Cooper was my porter - he had a truck with him to carry them in; I saw them all in the truck, and Cooper went to Great St. Helen's with them - he said to me that a person whom he had known some time, had offered, just at the dock gate, to assist him, and they both came together to Great St. Helens with the truck; Cooper there asked me if I would allow Smith, the person who was with him, to take the luggage to my residence at Islington - he said he knew him to be an honest man, and he would go part of the way with him; I allowed him so to do - I then went with my family to Islington, and reached there about half-past six or seven o'clock; I waited till nine, and, as the luggage did not arrive, I sent my servant to town to inquire if it was coming - I went to town myself, about half-past ten o'clock, but could get no account of my property; I went in the morning to Lambeth-street office, and gave information, and three or four days afterwards Lee produced some articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280085"/>trusted them to Cooper? A. Yes, and he recommended Smith at Great St. Helens - I did not say at the office that Smith met me at the wharf; I did not see him till he was at St. Helens - he went with Cooper; I gave my consent that he should take the goods - Cooper said he was an honest man, and he would take them safely: I suppose he had to go two miles and a half - they were in a common truck, not more than my own porter could conveniently take care of; Cooper said he himself wished to go away -I saw them in St. Helens, and Cooper and Smith were there together; a few articles and some wrappers were found where Smith lived - I have seen Jane Smith several times at Lambeth-street, and once or twice at the prison, where I went to ascertain where the property was; she had a shift, which was among this property, on her back - she went up stairs with the matron and my wife, and they found it on her; I was before the Grand Jury when she was examined - I did not say I would have her transported if she did not tell the facts; I said most likely she would be transported if she did not state the facts.</p>

            . I returned with my husband and two daughters to St. Katherine's-docks, in the Margate steam-boat, on the 24th of August; we had nine packages containing the articles stated, three Church of England Prayer-books, some Bibles, and other things - a shift was found on Smith, in my presence, and some towels, pocket-handkerchiefs, a double-bladed knife, a bag containing some lace, and some other little things were produced by the officer, which were a part of the property contained in our trunks and boxes.</p>

            . I am a porter in the employ of Mr, Cohen. I went to meet him on his return, on the 24th of August - I took the nine packages into a truck; this was about half-past four, or a quarter before five o'clock - I saw Smith just at the time the steam-boat came up, and he shoved behind the truck in going to St. Helen's -I then found it was so late that I was obliged to go elsewhere; Smith there took charge of the truck from my recommendation - all the things were then in it, and he was to take it to No. 3, Suffolk-place, Lower-road, Islington: I did not know where Smith lived - I went with him to Liverpool-street, and there left him; I had a pint of beer before I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What made you recommend him? A. I always took him to be an honest hard-working chap - I dare say I had known him twelve months or longer; I had not seen him before that, perhaps, for two or three months - I did not know what was in these packages; there were two hampers, two portmanteaus, two large boxes, and a bag - there were nine in all; I cannot exactly give you the description of the others - there was a white cloth over them before I saw them; there was one cloth over each of two packages - I left Smith about the middle of Liverpool-street.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Smith.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you come from? A. From Newgate - I was taken with these prisoners, and have been there ever since: I have not seen Mr. Cohen in Newgate, but I did at Clerkenwell - I saw him there a good many times; he asked me a good many questions - he asked if I knew Lyall; I said I did not - he said he would give me fourteen years if I did not tell him all about it; he did not threaten me with any thing else - he did not touch me at all; I told him at first I did not know Lyall, but after he spoke to me I told him I did - I said before the Magistrate that Mr. Cohen had threatened me, and I was frightened; I did refuse to swear to what I had said in consequence of Mr. Cohen's threats - I said nothing against the other two, and did not know the name of Lyall till it was suggested to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know what was brought to the place? A. Gowns and linen; I put some of the linen on- it was claimed by Mrs. Cohen; I told the Magistrate I was frightened - the things were at my husband's on the Tuesday before I was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Mr. Cohen did not describe the bottle till you had told him of it? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he as drunk as he could well he at night? A. Yes, and he seemed very tipsy at the watch-house - I think he did say it was a drunken frolic, and that he intended to bring it back; I never said, I thought he would have come forward with a couple of sovereigns to put me out of the way - he had given me 5s. at night.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in charge at the White Swan - he was in company with some men; he said, "I am playing a joke with a young woman, who lives opposite the Black Horse," or I should not have known any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutrix tell you she expected somebody would give her two sovereigns to prevent her giving evidence? A. She said if the party had come forward and given her two sovereigns, and sent her into the country, he would have heard no more of it.</p>

On the 6th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and pawned six tea-spoons and two salt-spoons, for 19s., in the name of Mary Roberts, No.22, Compton-street - she said she brought them from her mother; she came in again about an hour, and pawned the spectacles for 3s., and two other tea-spoons for 5s., in the same name, and said they were for her mother, who had some money to make up - Collier came in about an hour; I showed him the articles, and he claimed them - she came again the following morning with shoes and table-cloths; I detained her - Collier happened to come in, and claimed them; I sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNISS. Measom never lived in Castle-street; I cannot remember this black cloth - I believe the waistcoat to be mine; I recollect this one being in my window - I know this remnant of cloth, pawned on the 30th of September, by certain marks about it; the prisoners had no authority from me to pawn any thing - I never knew Measom live in Charles-street or Charlotte-street; these two waistcoat pieces, pawned on the 15th of October, I am positive are mine.</p>
               <p>Measom's Defence. The black cloth Taylor bought of Mr. Gurniss, and I pawned it at his request; the black waistcoat with a roll collar Taylor had made up for himself - I went to fetch it home from Maria Bliss, and pawned it for him - I can say nothing to the rest.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNISS. Taylor had a yard and a half of black cloth placed to his account four or five months ago, and this is a yard and a half; but he told me he had had it made up a long time after - I am quite certain I never sold this waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see it taken from him? A. Yes; I do not think it possible for another person to have put it up his back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three lads following the gentleman; I got before them and some person called Stop thief! - the gentleman seized another lad, but he got away; knowing I was innocent I went to clear myself, and tried to get the other - I never had the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I felt and said, "They are gone;" the prisoner had them in her hand - I went and said, "They are my pockets;" she said, "You d-d old fool, I know they are, but I will not give them to you" - when we got to the watch-house, the gentleman desired her to give them to me; there were a few little things in the basket, but in the pockets were the spoons and my money - she took up the pockets, and put them under her arm; she was in my debt.</p>

            . I was just coming home from work, and saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner - I stood a few minutes, and saw the prisoner pick up the pockets and try to conceal them to her breast; I went and asked the prosecutrix if she had lost her pockets - she said Yes; a Policeman came up and took her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you there when the Policeman came up? A. Yes - you had the pockets, and he took you; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix has some things of mine - I met her in the street; there was another woman with me, and she said, "Did you ask Mrs. Culf to give up your things?" I said No - she said, "There can be no harm in asking her;" I pulled her gown, and said, "Do you mean to give up my things?" she said, "No, you good for nothing wretch, I will not" - she struck me twice; the Policeman came up while I had one hand on the basket; I let it go - she was walking off, and said, "I will give you a night's lodging in the watch-house" - I then felt something against my feet; I did not know what it was - I stooped and picked up the pair of pockets; I gave them into the Policeman's hand - he said, "There feels something like spoons in them;" whether she heard that or not I cannot tell, but she turned back, and said, "Give me the pockets" - he said, "I shall not deliver them to any one till I get to the watch-house;" when there she said I had insulted her in the street, and mentioned five half-crowns and two spoons, as being in the pockets - the inspector asked her if these were every thing in them; she said Yes, and was going away perfectly satisfied, and made no charge against me - he said, "You had better let the woman go about her business;" I went down, and then she made a second statement, said I seized her in a violent manner, and by some means untied her pocket.</p>
               <p>MARY CULF. I have some goods of her's, but her husband begged me to keep them and the receipts, and he would come and settle with me.</p>
