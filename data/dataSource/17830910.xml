               <p>Court. Were the spurs taken from the place where they were? - Yes, they were taken from my servant's room, I went into my parlour, and there I found my beaureau open and three bank notes missing, two of twenty pounds and one of ten pounds, and there were three drawers laid on the floor, and all the papers about; I went down stairs and found the area door broke open, it had two bolts and a latch, they were forced, and then they came to the kitchen door, there was two bolts and a lock, with the key inside, and they also were forced with the iron crow, the screws were quite forced out from the wood, which crow I had the next day, and took it and fitted every particular place myself; the kitchen door was only slightly locked, which they could very easily open, then they went into my servant's room, and took three cases out of the room into the kitchen, the cases contained twenty-four table knives and forks, and twelve desert knives and twenty-four table spoons and twelve desert spoons, they also took out of the parlour, a silver caddy of tea, and a sugar bason that was plated; they locked the servant in the room.</p>
               <p>Court. It was light when you got up, I suppose? - Yes, as light as it is now, the prisoner Burton was brought back within ten minutes of the robbery.</p>

               <p>I live opposite to Mr. Symonds; on the 27th of July, in the morning between five and six o'clock, I was standing at my bed room window, and I saw Mr. Symonds's door move very gently, I took notice of it and supposed some of the servants were going out, or that they had some of their acquaintances in the house, at that instant I saw part of a person's arm that had a green coat on, I then thought it was somebody that had got into the house, knowing that Mr. Symonds had no servant in a green livery, in the space of a minute I saw the door open again a little wider, I could then see the arm and part of the body, the man held the door for some few seconds, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100004"/> saw him beckon with his fingers as if somebody was on the side of the way that I live, I did not see anybody go over, but at the instant I saw a servant of Mr. Lyde, in Bedford-square, coming up the street nearly opposite the door, and I saw the man turn his eyes to the door, and I saw the door move very gently at that time, the man was going on, and he had not got ten yards, before the prisoners at the bar came out with bundles, the tall one first and the other followed him as close as possible, I desired the servant to pursue them, and I endeavoured to alarm the neighbourhood by calling out Stop thief! the prosecutor at that instant looked out of the window and called out Stop thief! I then went down stairs, and in about ten minutes the black servant returned, he had lost sight of them, and I believe, in about ten minutes more, the tall prisoner was brought back by two men, surrounded by a number of other people.</p>
               <p>Court. What is his name? - I believe his name is Burton, there was a letter found upon him, directed to the name of Burton, which I believe the constable has, the other prisoner I did not see till the next day, I do not know how he was taken, nothing was found on the prisoner but this letter, the prisoner said, by God, if you feel further you will find a bank note, but however, he was searched and nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Out of what window did you look? - Out of the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Had they hats? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Round or cocked? - Round.</p>
               <p>Could you see their faces? - Very clearly.</p>
               <p>What time? - I believe it wanted about twenty minutes of six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure these are the two men? - I am clear these are the two men.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he a round hat on, when he was brought back? - Yes.</p>

            , Esq; in Bedford-square, about the 26th of July last, my master had ordered me to get up very early to go out of town on Sunday morning; about half after four o'clock I got up to get ready, and I bethought myself I had no clean linen, so I went to my washerwoman's to get some, and by the time I came back it was half after five o'clock; as I was walking pretty fast thro' Charlotte-street, going home, I heard a noise of a door creeking, so I made a stop all of a sudden, and I still kept my eyes upon the door and I saw it wave, I knew the house and thought some of the servants were going out for a walk, and I stood and looked at the door, and presently I saw a man come and peep his head out, and seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100005"/> me he drew back, with that I went about five steps on that they could not see me, presently, I saw the door open again, and a man just peep himself out, and when they did not see me he stood on the step, and then he saw me, as I was as near to him as I am to your Lordship; when they saw me, he held the door in his hand, and says he to the other that was in the house, come, come along, we can go there and be back time enough, I thought it was Mr. Symonds's servant by his saying so, so I did not take any notice, I had not the idea of any robbery; presently Mr. Utterton hallooed out of his bed-chamber Stop thief! directly the prisoner Duckston came out, and then I saw Duckston and Burton both run down Charlotte-street as hard as ever they could.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure they are the very two men? - Yes, I am sure they are, I pursued after them crying out, stop thief, while I was pursuing after them so close, Burton had the bundle under his arm, and he threw it over into one Dr. Lloyd's area, I still ran after him, I turned down Dyot-street, and they came into Bambridge-street, I pursued them into St. Giles's, and there was a great number of people standing at the top of St. Giles's, and I asked them if they saw two men running down, and they said they did, I said they were two house-breakers; as I was going down St. Giles's, running after them, I met with Mr. Utterton's labourer, and he went with me, he asked me if I should know them, I said I should, and we went down St. Giles's, we met a watchman, and he went with us, they took me to a publick-house in St. Giles's, there was a great many of them together there, I was rather dubious of going in for fear they should use me ill, I think it was the Green Man, I do not know the house, I never use any of the houses that way, I went in and made them all come out one by one, and neither of them were there, I suppose there were near forty of them there, then we had information that they went down New Compton-street, and I went with them part of the way along Compton-street in pursuit of them, and my time was almost out, so they told me they would go after them, and they went in pursuit of them by my description, and they caught Burton, and in about ten minutes Mr. Symonds sent for me to know whether I could swear to him, and when I came I could not help knowing that this was the man that I saw, I know him to be one of the men that was in Mr. Symonds's house, I am sure and positive that he is the man, I saw the prisoner the next day at the Rotation-office, Duckston is the very man that was with him, Duckston was not in the same cloaths when he was taken that I saw him in, but Burton was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you get that plate again? - In about ten minutes after.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Byney. Did not you doubt as to Burton? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you believed, but you could not be sure? - No, I did not, I told the Justice I could swear to Burton and Duckston.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before? - No, I never saw them in my life before, I did not see Duckston afterwards till the next day.</p>
               <p>And are you sure that you did not say before the magistrate that you believed it was Burton? - I said Burton was the very man.</p>

               <p>Grubb. My Lord, there is a man that comes here and swears he does not know any harm of this prisoner, Burton, and I took Burton out of his house some time since, for house breaking, with the implements upon him.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: This is an indictment for a burglary; the evidence does not come near enough perhaps for that, for it was day light for a considerable time before, as much as an hour and an half, or near two hours; therefore it is possible that this fact might have been committed after day-light, if so, it is not a burglary, for in order to constitute a burglary, it must be done in the night time: but however the stealing in the dwelling house is likewise a capital crime to the amount of above forty shillings, so that in point of law it amounts to an offence of equal magnitude.</p>

               <p>Court. How long might all this be about? - It was not above a minute.</p>
               <p>It was quite light? - The sun shone on one of their backs as they rode on.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - I can say very little as to his dress, any more than that he had a light coloured coat on, as he turned his back, his hair either appeared to be platted or tied behind in a club, I could not tell which.</p>
               <p>What sort of a hat had he? - I cannot tell any thing of his hat, but I think it was round hat.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing over his face? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How soon after was he taken up? - I cannot tell, I saw him in gaol.</p>
               <p>How long after? - I believe it may be three weeks or a month, I came to Justice Wright's in consequence of a purse being advertised which I thought was like mine, being green and red, I found it was not mine, I went to the pawn-brokers to see the watches that were in pawn, for they found the duplicates of two watches in the prisoner's sleeve, I went to New Prison to set the prisoner, and as soon as I saw him I had some conversation along with him, I asked if ever he had seen me, his answer was, I have seen abundance of people in the publick line, and I cannot tell whether I have seen you or not, I said, I wish I had never seen you, you are the man that robbed me, and he said, may be so.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you under any confusion at the time? - Undoubtedly, when he told me he would blow my brains out, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you pay your attention more to him than to the other? - I did, because I had nothing more to do with the other than give him my watch, I did not see him till he came up alongside of the carriage, when he took my watch away he rode upon a dark brown or bay cropt mare.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse had the prisoner? - I cannot very well tell, but I think it was a chesnut.</p>
               <p>Did you take that notice of him to induce you positively to swear to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you now positively swear to him? - I do now positively swear that was the man, I never found my watch or purse.</p>

               <p>I know nothing further of this, than I apprehended the prisoner the 23d of last month, at No. 2, York-street, Middlesex Hospital, in bed up one pair of stairs, I was with Mr. Clarke and the other officers, I took this pistol from him, it was loaded in his breeches pocket under his head.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe that to be the pistol with which he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Dixon. Mr. Clarke found another pistol in his coat pocket, which I saw him take out, I found three guineas and a half in money, he was taken up on information of another robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. Had you your spectacles on at the time you was stopped? - I do not, in general, wear them.</p>
               <p>Did not you dine that day with the Justices? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. This will depend very much upon your evidence alone, therefore I am sure you will excuse my asking you a question upon such an occasion as this is, whether you had been so long in company as to have been drinking rather more than you usually do? - Not at all my Lord, we are only allowed a pint of wine a piece at the bench of Justices, and in order to go home, I went away sooner, I did not drink my pint of wine nor any other liquor.</p>
               <p>Are you near sighted? - No, not at all, but when I am in a large company I wear spectacles occasionally, it is customary for us, who are in the commission of the peace, to attend Court business, and I had been dining at the hall on that day.</p>

               <p>I know nothing more than searching the prisoner's coat, I found a pistol loaded with ball, here is the ball, and here is one that I found in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Did he account for having these pistols? - Yes, he said, there was an execution out against him, and he took them to avoid the officer, to shoot any officer that should touch him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarke has said, that I had these pistols on purpose to shoot the officer, I did not say any such thing, I said, I had them to defend myself, not with intent to shoot any one; I have no witnesses, I was unprovided, I have several gentlemen that would have come to my character, but they did not know any thing of it, I had not time to send for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lechmore, Council for the Prisoner, informed the Court, that the prisoner was a <rs id="t17830910-3-deflabel19" type="occupation">waiter</rs>

               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. How comes it your coachman does not come to give evidence? - Because they said, if he looked back at them, they would blow his brains out, and he was a hired coachman, he does not now live with me.</p>
               <p>Jury. He must have seen them before you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jury. This is a very awful piece of business and you should have had the man here.</p>
               <p>Court. He should certainly have been here. - He said, he was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury you must take the evidence as you find it, and exercise your own discretion about it, we have nothing to say about the coachman, if you are dissatisfied with it, you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. May I speak again? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. There is one circumstance that I forgot mentioning, Mr. Fellows saw this man but for a minute on the outside, and he did not see him again till within three weeks or a month after, and he then was led to him, he did not see him among a group of other people, or pick him out as the man that robbed him, but he was led to the man as the man that had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He kept the Mermaid tap at Windsor, I knew him then, and upon recollection I recollected him as well as ever I did in my life.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he the first person that was brought to you, did you see more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100013"/> this one? - He was brought into the taproom, I know him to be the man as soon as I saw him.</p>

               <p>Was you present with Redgrave when this prisoner was taken? - I was at the house in Onslow-street, Safron-hill; when we entered the room, I observed the prisoner with two others; the prisoner at the bar immediately seized a poker, and with very bad words, said, that sooner than be taken they would lose their lives.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the others had any thing in their hands? - I did.</p>
               <p>What had they? - One had a long shovel, and the other this clasp knife open, in his left hand; as soon as ever the affray began, I saw the prisoner strike Mr. Seasons over the head with a poker; we had each a cutlass.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the indictment charges the prisoner with returning from transportation and being at large, it is therefore incumbent upon him, to shew to the Court and Jury, that he had some lawful, or reasonable cause for that purpose; now had this man been in a tempest at sea, and been obliged to come on shore, that would, I conceive, have been a reasonable and lawful excuse, in which case, he would have surrendered himself to a peace officer as soon as possible, but so far from any such colour, this man stood in opposition to the officers of Justice, armed himself, acted with violence, and said, he would rather die than be taken, so that that excludes any possible idea of a lawful cause of being at large.</p>

            ? - I remember him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Where did he come on board? - At Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the day when he came on board? - The 16th of August, I believe.</p>
               <p>When did the ship sail from Blackwall? - The next day down to the Galleons, where we received the remainder on board from the ship Censor, we left the Downs the 28th of August, and the 29th in the morning, the prisoner and the rest of them, who had been confined between decks, made what they called a rush; they came all at once into the cabbin, and secured the captain and myself, and all the ships company, and the fire arms.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner amongst them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see them come on deck? - No, I was in the cabbin, and in about a minute afterwards they rushed into the cabbin.</p>
               <p>Tell us what yourself saw? - I saw them secure the arms, I saw them with the arms in their hands, the prisoner was amongst them, and had either a musket or a blunderbuss in his hand.</p>
               <p>How long was this a doing? - It was done in a minute.</p>
               <p>How did they get their liberty? - The night before, they had sent a letter to the captain, desiring he would take their irons off, he said, he would not, they said, if he would not they would take them off themselves, he said, he would fire on them, they said, fire and be damned, and they went to work, and every one took their irons off with as much ease as if they had none on.</p>
               <p>Did you know on board the ship, that they were taking off their irons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could not you prevent it? - No.</p>
               <p>How many did your crew consist of? - Eighteen; after they had secured us, they bore away, and went a little to the east of Dunganness, between that and Rye, they let go the anchor, and hoisted the boats out, and went on shore, as many as could cleverly get into the boats got on shore, with the arms along with them; that was on the 29th the same day they made the rush, it was six o'clock in the evening that they went on shore.</p>
               <p>How many got on shore? - Forty-eight.</p>
               <p>What became of the rest? - The rest remained on board with us.</p>
               <p>When did you get your liberty? - About twelve o'clock at night, we informed them of the dangerous situation they were in, in case any wind should come, and that they would lose their lives, and then they agreed to let the sailors up, and we bore away, and about half past three as they had been drinking pretty freely, they began to grow drowsy, and went down below, and there was not above half a dozen left on deck, and we searched them and got the possession of the ship, and brought her into Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner escape? - I cannot say I saw him get into the boat, but I knew he was gone.</p>
               <p>He was not on board the ship after that time? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Were forty-eight all that the boats would hold? - The boats would have held more I believe, but they would not take any more they were so desperate; there was not one of them that was compelled to go, far from it, for there were several knocked down that wanted to go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him, how long after the captain asked me have a glass of rum, it was, that this affair happened? - He had but just begun serving them a glass of rum; he had served about two or three messes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, do you recollect him among the number that you had? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>What was his conduct? - He was one of the first, my Lord, in taking arms.</p>
               <p>What else did he do? - I had a hanger of my own which some of them had broke, I saw him put that broken part of the hanger between his coat and waistcoat, before he went on shore.</p>
               <p>You have mentioned the circumstance of his taking the arms, and being one of the first that took them, by what other circumstance did he shew himself to be a ringleader otherwise than by his taking the arms? - He was one of the first I saw, his own declaration to me was enough.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - In the cabbin.</p>
               <p>With what intent did he come into the cabbin? - With intent to secure the arms, and to secure me with the rest of them, there were, I dare say, twenty more in the cabbin.</p>
               <p>Was this one of the men that came up to you to secure you? - No, I cannot say particularly that he was one of the men that came up to me to secure me.</p>
               <p>He was among the first that came into the cabbin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the cabbin besides yourself? - The Captain.</p>
               <p>You formed some thought of what his intentions were from what he declared? - After we had been in the cabbin some time, he was telling me how when the Captain was calling them up to give them a dram, those that were sick, and he said when the Captain gave him that dram, he bid him go below, and we did not know how to avoid it, but however he turned once or twice, and with the rest that were behind him, and him together made the rush.</p>
               <p>Explain what you mean by the rush? - It was a term of theirs, what they meant by it was forcing in upon the Captain and the ship's crew.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other part that he took in this business? - None my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. With your permission I beg to ask Mr. Bradbury in what part of the ship he was, when the ship was taken? - I was in the cabbin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was in bed my Lord, he permitted us to come upon deck in a great number, and seeing so fair an opportunity many of us were desirous of taking the ship, a man stood behind me and said, says he, if you do not endeavour to secure your liberty, I will knock you down, they were saying better not to use any violence, there were many in the cabbin before me, seven or eight, some were with Mr. Bradbury in his cabbin, I took up a blunderbuss that laid by, and the keys of the bureau were there, and I threatened to shoot a man that was going to take the keys, and I immediately locked the bureau, and delivered the keys to the Captain.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. Do you recollect this particular that he now mentions? - I do not, I know that some were for robbing the Captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bradbury knows I particularly protected Mrs. Warrickshall, and insisted on her not being searched.</p>
               <p>Bradbury. That may be true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the Captain was divested of his command, I treated him with every proper mark of respect, the second mate came and said to me, if you are in possession of the vessel, do not put me down below, says I, if they act as I could wish, it will argue in our favour in case we are apprehended hereafter, that was what I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100019"/> to the second mate, and when the Captain was divested of his command he drew up a memorial in order to clear himself from any mean suspicion that might arise in the breast of his owner, I was the first man that readily signed my name to it, I expressed my sorrow to the Captain, at being at this time forced to get my liberty.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. You say some of these people were for robbing the Captain? - He might be along with those that prevented it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Bradbury. You ought to consider that this is a case of life and death.</p>
               <p>Court. He mentions that there was a Mrs. Warwickshall on board that some of the transports were going to insult, and that he protected her from the insult, was he one that did? - He was, my Lord, for they would have behaved rudely to her, if it had not been for some of them that were there.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a memorial signed by these people in favour of the Captain to the owner? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those that signed it? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was he one of the first that signed it? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other circumstance that is favorable to the prisoner? - I do not, only he behaved very well after they had possession of the ship, there was none of them that behaved amiss after they got possession of the ship.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. With respect to the memorial, my signing it first, it was blotted, the Captain requested me to draw a copy from the original, which I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. Do you recollect that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You should recollect every favourable circumstance for the prisoner? -</p>
               <p>There were two or three of these papers drawn out, the first was drawn out by the Captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was some word objected to, without altering the meaning of the original, and I wrote over another, I hope my Lord, Mr. Akerman will do me the justice to say, that I behaved very well in Newgate.</p>

               <p>How many were there delivered at that time? - I think seventy four, we had one hundred and forty three in all, men and women; on the 29th of August at ten in morning, they made what they called a rush, and secured me and the Captain, and the men.</p>

               <p>What did they do then? - They hoisted both boats out, and as many as could, got into them.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner of the number? - Yes, he was one of the number, he knocked down two or three of the other prisoners to get into the boat.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you repossessed the boats? - The boats did not return till about twelve o'clock, we told them what danger we were in, and they let the sailors up about half past three; they were many of them drunk, and went down below, and we drove the others down, and secured them there: the next morning we fell in with the Perseverance frigate, which conveyed us into Portsmouth.</p>

               <p>Court. How did this begin? - They demanded to have their irons off, the Captain said, he could not take them, they said, they would take them off themselves; the Captain said, he would fire on them, they said, fire away and be damned, and they took them off themselves with as much case as if they had not any on.</p>
               <p>How many did you trust on deck? - Sometimes three messes, containing six in a mess, they were in irons.</p>

               <p>You the several prisoners at the bar, have been convicted of returning, and being found at large, after the sentence, and within the period of your respective terms of transportation, this is an offence, which in ordinary instances the law punishes with death, and is in your cases attended with peculiar circumstances of aggravation; it is not the offence of a single person quietly endeavouring to elude the laws of his country, and to set himself at large, but the violent combination of numbers to arise on the Captain, to take possession of the ship by violence, and to set themselves at liberty; offences thus aggravated may call for an exemplary and speedy punishment, and the interval allowed you between pronouncing your sentence, and the execution of it may be very limited: You will do well, therefore, immediately to awaken in your hearts those dispositions, which are best calculated to obtain the favour of the Almighty, to turn immediately from an offended and an unforgiving world, to a Being infinitely just, and infinitely merciful, with the recollection however, that his mercy can only be obtained by a just sense of your faults, which is the surest and most sincere ground of true repentance: You will reflect that you will soon appear before one, to whom all hearts are open, and from whom no secrets are hid; at a triburnal that judges from the hidden motives of the heart, and not as human judicatures, from actions and open effects of them! Your repentence and contriction, therefore, must be sincere, with the wish that you may employ the short remains of life, that will be left you to the obtaining everlasting Salvation; the Court pronounces the dreadful sentence of the law upon you; the sentence of the law is, and this Court doth adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until: your are dead: And may God have mercy upon your souls!</p>

               <p>You, the several prisoners at the bar, have been tried and found guilty, of returning and being found at large after your sentence, and within the terms of your respective transportations; your offences have been attended with very singular, and with very aggravated circumstances, and as they may call for sudden and for speedy justice, the Court have thought it right to single you from the rest of the convicts, and not to defer pronouncing your sentence till the day of the goal delivery; but as your executions may be sudden, to give you as early and as long a time for preparation, as is within the power of this Court; the rest will depend upon his Majesty's mercy. You will consider, that the faults of some of you, are very considerably increased, from your having experienced that mercy already, as the sentence of transportation itself, to some of you, who were capitally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100030"/> convicted, was rather a condition of that mercy, than a mode of punishment: You will consider likewise, that it is not the offence of a single individual, but the offence of numbers who have violently arisen upon the Captain, taken possession of the ship, and in defiance of the laws of their country, and in elusion of its executive justice, have set themselves at liberty: Under these circumstances therefore, it is more than probable, that his Majesty's pleasure for your execution, will be very shortly notified; it behoves you therefore to improve the short interval that is left you, and having forfeited the peace of the world, to obtain the peace of the Almighty: You will remember however, that that peace is to be obtained only by sincere repentance, contrition, and prayers, and that these have no efficacy, unless they are founded upon a just, and in this instance, the deepest sense of guilt. With a recommendation to you, to awaken and confirm in yourselves those dispositions, which are most likely to obtain the pardon of an all just, and an all-merciful Deity, the Court pronounces the dreadful sentence of the law upon you. The sentence of the law is, and this Court doth adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until you are dead, and may God have mercy upon your souls!</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Morgan. Can you be positive to these ducks being your husband's property? - Yes, I have sworn to them, and they are here now.</p>

               <p>Could they by the hole you have described in the shutter, have undone those bars? - I apprehend they could, I desired my servant with all the force he could to force the shutter, and see if he could not put his arm through, he did, and undid the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did this witness ever come down into the kitchen; he says we were taken out of the kitchen? - My servant and I went by ourselves, first the watchmen were alarmed by Mrs. Gale, when we came down we found an inner kitchen door, but one hole made through; they can make four of them in a minute as the carpenter convinced me; there was one hole made through the door, and a second begun.</p>

               <p>Had these people any arms with them? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you search them? - I did not, as soon as they were gone up, I was employed in searching my master's house, to see if there was no more of them, for I thought it not proper to take their words for that; here are some flint, some tinder, a bit of candle, and somesteel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blunt. Did you see ever a one particular in the kitchen? - I saw Berryman in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does this celler door open to? - It opens into the area, they had unbolted the bolts of that door after they had got into the kitchen, that they might have a retreat.</p>
               <p>Where did you take Blunt? - He was rather on the outside of the sill of the door, rather leaning towards the area, and the other man was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, and I heard the alarm of murder, or thieves, I thought there was something the matter, and I jumped over in the area; just as I jumped over this young man came by, and he said, what was the matter, and he jumped over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blunt. I have nothing more to say than what this man has said.</p>
               <p>Berryman. I told them I would answer to any thing.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, with respect to the crime of burglary, if you suppose the evidence of Messrs. Gale and Gibson to be true, there can be no doubt but that the house was fastened over night, and that by some means or other it was forced open, the shutters in the area were forced open, and by that means people got in; if you are satisfied that these are the people who got in, you then have only to consider for what purpose they were there; if you think they broke into the house with intent to commit any felony, their crime is as compleat as if they had accomplished their design, and committed the felony.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Rothwell. Did you see me loading the cart with any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you see me first? - I saw you come into the Old Bailey, and turn underneath a gateway.</p>
               <p>What gateway? - On the opposite side from here.</p>
               <p>Did not you watch me where I went, when I went down that gateway? - No, because I too well knew, I followed you through Smithfield, and to Muswell-hill.</p>
               <p>What did you see me do there? - I saw you go into a gate.</p>
               <p>What way did I go to Muswell-hill? - You went down the Back-lane.</p>
               <p>What Back-lane? - You went up St. John-street to Islington.</p>
               <p>Did I go by the work-house, or the other road by the church? - By the work-house, through Holloway turnpike, then down Deval's-lane.</p>
               <p>In Deval's-lane there is one road turns to the right hand, the other keeps strait forward, which way did I go? - I cannot tell being in a coach, I saw you all the way along the road.</p>
               <p>Then you certainly can tell whether I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100046"/> turned to the right or kept forward, which road did I come down to Crouch-end? - You went down the left hand road from Crouch-end.</p>
               <p>Was you within one hundred yards of me? - Yes, I dare say I was.</p>
               <p>Did I ring or knock? - The coachman informed us that you turned up a place on the left hand side, and we kept our eyes behind to see where you went in.</p>
               <p>Did you see me drive the cart into that place? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>You say so upon your oath? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>By what marks can you tell it was me, which side of the coach did you sit? - I think it was on the left hand.</p>
               <p>You think, you certainly must know? - I believe it was on the left hand.</p>
               <p>You believe, is not this very extraordinary that you should not know? - I say to the best of my knowledge I sat on the left hand side.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Dinmore on the 13th of August, we saw the prisoner Rothwell in a cart in the Old Bailey, by where the lamps are, and he went down a gateway, where the flatting mills are, with the cart, we went into the Star, and he came out again with the cart, and turned his head round to see if any body observed him, then I saw the prisoner's face perfectly well, I knew him before, we then followed him to the stand at Smithfield, and took a coach, we told the coachman to follow this man in the cart at such a distance as not to be observed by him, he did so, when he came to Muswell-hill he turned out of the main road to the left hand, there was a large pair of white gates all drove with tenter hooks and spikes, which led up to the house; as soon as we saw he went up there, we went round by Highgate and returned to Islington, to the sign of the One Tun, the corner of the city road; in about two hours, the prisoner Rothwell, with another man, came back in the same cart, I knew the cart perfectly well before, I called to Dinmore, and the other man made his escape, there was a hamper in the cart, and the first thing we found, was what they call cecil, I then desired the prisoner to let me look into the seat of the chaise cart, there we found these halfpence, I apprehend there is near twenty pounds worth; he said, he took the other man up in the road, we secured the prisoner and got more assistance, and went back to the house on Muswell-hill, and there we found all the implements of coining, and more halfpence, which corresponded with those in the cart; the woman prisoner was in the house, and she cried out, do not come in, she thought it was somebody to her, but it turned out to be one of our friends: The next day they were committed; there was a cutting-out press, and a stamping press, I do not recollect we took any thing else particular, but a pocket book was found in the bureau, which is produced by Dinmore, and a paper about the age of the children, when they were born and so on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is your name, Sir? - Redgrave.</p>
               <p>Where did you see me Mr. Redgrave? - As you came down from the gateway, and passed by the Star alehouse.</p>
               <p>You did not see me load the cart? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it loaded? - Up by the Flatting mills, about three or four doors down, the informer saw you load it, and came and told us.</p>
               <p>Very well, answer the truth? - It is the truth.</p>
               <p>Where did I set off? - I can tell you every track of ground you went, I followed you to Islington down the Deval's-lane, you went down by the work-house and through Holloway turnpike, then the first turning to the right hand, you went as direct a road as ever you could go.</p>
               <p>Did I go the left hand, or the right? - You went the direct road.</p>
               <p>They are both direct roads, they both come in at Crouch-end, about four or five hundred yards? - You kept to the left hand road, if I recollect myself right.</p>
               <p>Recollect, why you can tell? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Think, you should be positive, which of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100047"/> these roads did I come in at Crouch-end? - I do not recollect, you turned but once, it is almost impossible for me to answer every such minute circumstance.</p>
               <p>If I was set to watch you, I think I could tell? - I dare say you could, I suppose you have watched me many times, I think you rather inclined to the left and went up the hill, we always kept you in sight.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell to one hundred yards? - We never lost sight of you the whole way, I do not recollect which, but one or other of us had the sight of you.</p>
               <p>Where did you sit? - I sat with my face towards the horses.</p>
               <p>Which hand? - You are so very nice in that, I cannot recollect that circumstance.</p>
               <p>The fact is this, you never was there no more than I am there now; which way did I go up to the gate, and which side was the bell on, right hand or left? - That is a question I cannot resolve, as to whether you rung the bell or whether you gave any private signal, but this I know, that the gates were opened and you went in, and they were shut directly, I believe a person opened them.</p>
               <p>You believe, you are not positive? - I am so positive that I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Did I take the cart to the house after you saw me at the gate? - You did not come back again for some time.</p>
               <p>Did you see me come back again? - No.</p>
               <p>Which of you stopped me in Islington? - I stopped you first.</p>
               <p>You was not there.</p>
               <p>Dinmore. We both stopped you first.</p>
               <p>What did you say, did not you call out? - Says I, my friend you must stop.</p>

               <p>Court. It is the wisdom of the law, that persons having once received mercy and clemency, and who afterwards betake themselves to the same course again, are no longer considered by the law as proper objects of mercy; therefore, having once had your clergy, the offence is capital, and you are liable to suffer death.</p>

            , both having been tried and convicted at this sessions, the one for counterfeiting the copper money of this realm, called an halfpenny, and the other for aiding, abetting, and assisting him. After having been convicted, they were asked by the officer why sentence should not be passed upon them, they both of them prayed for the benefit of the clergy; I, standing up here as Council for the crown, thought it my duty to object to that benefit which they pretended to claim, knowing that they had both of them before this time been tried for a felony, and a felony of the same sort, had been convicted and received punishment for that offence; the man was tried in the county of Surry, before Mr. Justice Gould and Mr. Justice Ashurst, and the woman in this Court no less time ago than twelvemonths; the Court in mercy to the woman, gave her six months instead of twelve, and the Court where the man was tried, gave him nine months instead of twelve: But so far from deterring either the man or the woman from offending in this way, no sooner are they discharged from confinement, but they are again found in the commission of the same offence. I need not state to your Lordship that under the act of parliament, of the fourth of Henry the seventh, no person is entitled to receive the benefit of the clergy more than once, excepting those persons who are in holy orders, they may receive it twice, but no layman whatever can receive that benefit more than once: That being the case, these two prisoners, if the fact can be made out, and made out to the satisfaction of the Court, are not entitled to receive the benefit of the clergy, but must suffer death as felons. It is therefore incumbent upon me to produce a plea, stating, that that man and woman have both been tried and convicted, and received the benefit of their clergy, and that they are the same persons that were so tried and convicted. My Lord, with respect to the man, I shall produce under the act of parliament, the transcript of his conviction, I could, in regard to the woman, produce not a certificate, but the record of the conviction itself. A very respectable Jury that tried both the man and the woman, thought proper to recommend that woman for mercy, and therefore as that has been the opinion of so respectable a Jury, I think it my duty to pay a deference to that opinion, and therefore, though I am enabled to prove, and could prove the fact to your Lordship's satisfaction; yet I think it is a compliment due from me to the Jury, who have recommended her, not to urge the capital part against her, trusting that she will be fore-warned by the situation of the man with whom she has cohabited many years, and see that it is through mercy that she is not included in his fate, who cannot now receive the benefit of his clergy, but under your lordship's direction, must receive the sentence of death. I will proceed by filing the plea which is drawn up, and then I will produce the transcript of the original record, and the witness to identify his person, if your lordship pleases that the plea may be filed.</p>

The legislature have very wisely provided, that the man that will not be admonished by moderate punishment, shall not have the advantage and priviledge of the law, a second time to save his life: Now here are two things for you to attend to, the one is the King's Council, in that plea have averred, that there is such a record of your conviction in the county of Surry. Now if you please you may deny that, and then they will be put upon producing a proper testimony of that record in order to prove that allegation: There is another point, and that is, there is an averment that you are the same person that was indicted, and convicted at the sessions in Surry, and had the benefit of the stature allowed you; now if you think proper to deny that you are that same person; it is in your power so to do, then it must be enquired into, by a Jury whether you are the same person or not: becomes the Court to acquaint you, what you are at liberty to do, so you will judge for yourself.</p>

            , otherwise William Rothwell, you have been tried and found guilty of felony, for the coining of copper money; you have prayed the benefit of the statute, to that prayer the prosecutors have put in a counter plea, by which they have shewn that you have been convicted for the like felonious offence before: You have admitted the truth of that plea, in consequence of which, sentence of death must now be pronounced upon you. The law is that no one can twice have the benefit of the statute: It is true indeed, that with a knowledge of former convictions, the prosecutors have not proceeded to the extent of the law, but suffered the benefit of clergy, again to be urged in relaxation of its rigout: But the confederacies that have been found are so numerous, and so closely connected, that the laws as originally executed, have been found insufficient to break through these confederacies, and the community in general especially the poorer sort of it, are so prejudiced by those offences, that your prosecutors have thought it a humanity due to the public, to insist upon the laws being carried into effect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100051"/> against you: And it will not become this Court to hold out to your expectation, the mercy of the crown, because the crown itself best knows in what particular instance, mercy to the individual would be cruelty to the community at large; you will be prudent in taking the earliest means to meet your sentence, and having lost the favour of men to awaken in your mind, those dispositions that are best calculated to obtain the favour of the Almighty; you will impress yourself with a just sense of his omnipresence, you will consider that he tries us out and knows us, and understands our thoughts long before; you will recollect, therefore, that no repentence, contrition or tears are likely to obtain his favour, but such as are founded on a just sense of your offence, and in sincerity and truth; you therefore will loose no time in cultivating in yourself those dispositions, that are most likely through his mercies, which are as infinite as his Justice to obtain his pardon. Nothing now remains for the Court, but to pronounce the dreadful sentence of the law; the sentence of the law is; and this Court doth adjudge that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and may the Lord have mercy upon your soul.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you observe the other prisoner Barker? - I cannot say positively to him, but there was another man came to the horse's head.</p>
               <p>How long might they continue with you? - A very short time, about a minute or a half a minute; when they went away I stood up in the chaise to look after them, they all three went directly together, and went up the road, I would have followed them, but the gentleman in the chaise would not, they trembled very much, I took particular notice of Glanville for his size, his face I could not see particularly, he had something over it, but I took particular notice of the size of the man, and when we took him I knew him as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Then you did not swear to him from his face? - No.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a brown coat on and a striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - On the Tuesday night, we went after them the next night to take them, and on the Tuesday following we took them at the same spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Glanville dressed the same on the Tuesday night as on the Thursday? - Yes, he was searched.</p>
               <p>What had he over his face? - It was something black.</p>
               <p>If you had happened to have met him any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100052"/> where else but upon that spot, do you think you should have known him? - I should have known him, my Lord, I think if I had seen him among fifty people.</p>
               <p>By what? - From the thickness of his hulk, and his having a prodigious round head, I thought he had? - And you positively undertake to swear to him now? - Yes, my Lord, I do.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon that night? - No, it was just the beginning of dusk, it was plain enough to see a person a hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Was any body going by at the time? - Not just then, there was a little cart came by, I called to them, but they did not mind me, then there was a chaise coming, and I wanted them to go first and me to follow them.</p>
               <p>What sort of hair had he? - He had his own hair hanging down, shortish hair and flapped hat.</p>

               <p>Had he any arms? - They all three had knives.</p>

               <p>Did they pull out their knives at the time they stopped you? - Yes, I saw all their knives very plain.</p>

               <p>I was driving the chaise, I must confirm the evidence, that Mr. Branson has already given, only with this difference, that I perceived them start from the pathway, and the man at the head of the horses stood on my side, his knife seemed to be very bright, he shewed it by way intimidation I thought, it was not so dark but what one might easily discern them, and know them again, one on each side came and mounted the foot board of the chaise, and unbuttoned the leather, and on mounting the foot board the man presented a knife to my belly, and he held it about an inch and a half, and demanded my money, the man at the horse then called out for the watches, and the prisoner Barker asked me if I had a watch, and I told him yes, and I lifted up my waistcoat pocket and was going to pull it out, he took hold of the seal, and had three pulls before he could get it out, my waistband being tight; I had not then given him my money, he was in a very great tremor, - and desired the business to be very quickly done; I told Barker I had no pocket book, but one that had some fishing tackle in, this book I gave into his hand, and he felt at it, but he saw the piece of wood, which the lines are wrapped round, and he believed me, and he gave me the pocket book again; just about the time that Barker had got my watch, Glanville not getting Mr. Branson's watch, Barker said what is that you have dropped there, and repeated it three times, the prosecutor said nothing, but Barker absolutely had the audacity to, put his hand into the middle of the chaise, and felt for it; the man at the horse's head, called out to know if the boy had any money; they all three had something black tied round their faces, but this did not cover their faces, it was only tied nigh about an inch wide all this time, I was very collected and took particular notice of all that passed with the three, but more particularly the man at the head of the horses, and Barker, the man that robbed me; after they had got their booty, Barker very civily buttoned up the chaise, and twice wished me a good night, I said, it was exceedingly ridiculous to think of going after three men armed with knives, and having nothing to defend ourselves; we hailed a cart which did not hear us, we hailed a chaise but the lady was frightened: At the turnpike I applied to several people to get a pistol for the purpose of pursuing them, I got one, and used my plumb that I used to my fishing tackle for a bullet, we went, but could not find them: We went the same road on Friday night, with some of Sir Sampson's men, and on the Tuesday evening we went out, Atkins, Mr. Branson and me, they went down the road, and I, and the other two people were to go on foot, we searched a house near the bridge, and as we returned we met Atkins and the men in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you positively swear to the face of Barker? - We were so near all the time during the transaction I am mentioning, that I really have not the least scruple or doubt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100053"/>Notwithstanding he had something over his face? - He had, but when I came in, I immediately singled out Barker, and disclaimed any notice of Glanville, I took very particular notice of Barker by his moving his hand with the knife in that manner.</p>
               <p>How long do you suppose they might stay with the chaise? - Rather more then a minute, they were very fearful and trembled very much, and wished to get away.</p>
               <p>Was Barker dressed as he is now? - Yes.</p>

I took a particular observation of the horse that came upon my left hand side, it was a dark horse with cropt ears, the right hand side horse had a very remarkable kind of a fan tail, and carried it particularly bent upon the rump, this was a lighter coloured horse.</p>

               <p>Why did not you put him up? - Going along Russel-street, just by the cross-way, about five in he morning, I met three men they were coming on the cross-way, and this prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket he struck at the first horse, which he missed, and then cut the second horse in the flank; I never spoke a word to him, nor he to me, nor to any of them; I saw him pull the knife out of his pocket and run towards the horse and cut him; it was quite light, I saw two men and I called them, and I told them of it, and one of them brought the horse back to the market, and the other went with me and took the prisoner, we took him by the corner of the piazza, there was a jack-ass boy and a lamplighter quarrelling and fighting, he run away, and we lost sight of him for a little bit, but I soon saw him again, I was sure he was the same man, I observed him before he came up to the horse, he was dressed in black cloaths, and a pair of leather breeches, we took him almost directly after the knife was found upon him, I was not lame then, the horse has got over it now, thank God, it was a black gelding, but his coat was rather turned dark brown.</p>

               <p>I was coming out of Covent-garden, the 26th of June in the morning, about a quarter before five, or five o'clock; coming along, seeing the prisoner cross the way from where the coaches were, I believe it to be Russel-street, the sun arising, I saw a knife in his hand, and glittering by the sun shine, I saw him go up to the second horse and make a push at him with a knife, the boy directly cried, he has killed my horse, he run away from the horses and went into a croud of people that were fighting, I sprung the man, I kept my eyes on him, I never lost sight of him, directly a gardener said, I shall take care of you, that you shall go before a magistrate, to give evidence against that man, says I, he is a very cruel fellow.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he appear to be drunk? - I really cannot say that he was quite sober, he was but a little in liquor, or he might be sober I cannot say, I saw him taken, he was dressed in a black coat or dark grey; I am sure it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What arose you so soon that morning? - I went to buy some herbs in the market, six bunches of peppermint and six bunches of balm to make tea of; I had them under my arm at the time.</p>
               <p>Whoever the person was, he was in black? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he had any quarrel with any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the horses obstruct his way? - He went across the way to the horses with a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>He was drunk? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did he know the owner of the horses, or the boy? - Not that I know of, he was going along quietly as I thought, and he went up to the horses and stabbed the second horse; he crossed the foot way, it was not his nearest way.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be in liquor? - I cannot say, I think he must be quite reasonable to cross the way and go up to the horse and stab him.</p>

               <p>You yourself did not see the knife in his hand? - No, I did not, I should not have taken hold of him, only Mr. Lee the grocer, the corner of King-street, said, he had like to have cut me.</p>
               <p>Did he wound any body? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether both my hands were not in my jacket pockets at that time, and as I went along they took the knives out of my pocket? - I never saw any knife taken out of his pocket, his left hand was down; I said to the prisoner, says I, you ought to be ashamed to carry a knife open as you did, and he said, damn me, I would have cut you.</p>

               <p>My Lord, on the 3d of last December, I was landed on the island of Goree, with nineteen more, the soldiers were drawn up in a circle on the parade, the Lieutenant of the island ordered us all into the middle of it, and told us we were all free men, and that we were to do the best we could, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100067"/> he had no victuals, there was a ship lay in the bay, I went on shore several times and did work for the governor, I remained there till the time I came home, which was last Saturday was three weeks, I did not chuse to go into the hands of the enemy, I got on board of this English vessel, I had engaged to go out in her again, I sent to our captain yesterday by my mother, and he is clearing out his ship, and when that was done, he sent word he would come, we laid four days in the bay before the governor would receive us, he said his troops were starving already on the island, and it was very hard that he should have a parcel of men on the island; when we came away, the island was given up to the French.</p>

               <p>What is the reason that you behaved in this outrageous manner? - I did not behave so, these people speak as false as God is true.</p>

               <p>How came you to be with the prisoner that night?-Two girls asked us to go and lay with them there that night.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner one of those girls?-Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner stole your things?-Because the other girl was in liquor and was asleep.</p>

               <p>Then you slept with her?-No, I did not, I laid with her.</p>

               <p>Where did you find these things?-In Grub-street, I found the goods on her with the constable, the last witness was with me.</p>

               <p>Did you lose sight of the prisoner from the time he left your house till you apprehended him?-Yes, once, I followed him from Ludgate-street, and he went into Newgate, but at the top of the Old Bailey he stopped to speak to a gentleman, after he was gone, I asked the gentleman if he knew that gentleman in scarlet, he said, no; I waited till he came out of Newgate, when he came out, I desired to speak with him, I asked the turnkey if we might go into the lodge, I went into the lodge, and the prisoner immediately followed me, and the turnkey immediately followed him; as soon as I got into the lodge, the prisoner had a pair of stone knee buckles in his hand which he presented to me, rather thrusting them into my hand that I might secret them, his hand was open with them, I saw them in his hand, I knew immediately that they were my property; I told him, that I knew he had been doing something that he ought not to do, that I was convinced he had robbed me, but not sufficient to challenge him before, he said, that was too true; the turnkey followed him, observing him put his hand into his pocket as he was going into the lodge, and take something out: I told <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100072"/>him though he was rascal enough to rob me, I was not fool enough to compound felony; I took the buckles as my property; some of the people belonging to Newgate and me, took the prisoner immediately before Alderman Sanderson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I do not understand what you mean by compounding a felony?-I understand by it, if you take goods back after they have been found upon a thief, you compound felony.</p>
               <p>You have not quite a right idea of it Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not necessary he should be a lawyer.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships know very well, that compounding a felony, is not taking goods back again, but taking money not to prosecute.-He meant privately to thrust the things into my hand and not openly.</p>
               <p>He came in the appearance of a gentleman?-Yes.</p>
               <p>And he is a man of good family, is not he?-Yes, I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by him, when he gave you the buckles, that he had taken the things in a mistake and meant to return them?-No.</p>
               <p>Did he speak in a low voice?-He spoke in a low voice.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing go into his pocket?-I saw his hand thrust and that gave me a suspicion.</p>
               <p>He did not say any thing to you, when he gave his hand and wanted you to take them back?-He only held them to me loose in his hand without any paper, which is generally the case when they do not buy, they carry them without paper; nothing was said till I told him, he then said it was too true.</p>
               <p>Did he not say it was not true?-I know this is a capital offence, I did not wish to make it so, I am sorry to find it is laid so, but yet I am under the necessity of speaking facts; it hurt me a good deal when I found it was capital.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these the buckles you took from the prisoner?-I know them by a ticket tied to one, which is in my own hand writing, and the other has a little  bit of one of the tongues broke which was previous to this accident.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Them were the words?-The very words.</p>
               <p>Those were all the words he said?-Yes, any thing relating to the business.</p>
               <p>Court. What did Mr. Lewis say on the occasion?-I believe Mr. Lewis made an answer to him, I do not suppose you intend to fetch the things you have paid earnest for, and gave him the shilling back again.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you recollect giving him the shilling back again?-I do, for I knew he had no opportunity of coming again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prisoner. Mr. Macnamara, I cannot say anything for you, though I have your story here in brief.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to leave it to my council only, I would beg, my Lord, to ask one question of my prosecutor, which is, whether I did not agree with him for the buckles he has in his possession?-Not those <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100073"/> buckles I had from the prisoner in Newgate, but another pair which I have in possession at home, he never asked me the price of these buckles.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. Have you any witnesses on the part of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, I understand Mr. Macnamara has not been three months in England.</p>

               <p>Who catched the bundle of cloaths out of your hand? - That man did so, they both then immediately ran away; it was not dark; I could see half way over the park, it was a very light night it was star-light, I do not remember there was any moon, I suppose in the whole they were with me five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Five minutes in presenting a pistol and taking away your bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that in that time you can recollect to distinguish the prisoner, because the other man was the man that put his pistol your to breast? - The other was a great deal bigger and lustier; he seemed to be a very fat lusty man, and the other man was nothing like so big as the other.</p>
               <p>I suppose the other man attracted your notice most? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to know this prisoner again? - I knew him directly, I saw him on the Tuesday at Bow-street, on the Saturday night; I was robbed and I saw him at the Justice's on the Sunday morning; I was robbed about ten o'clock, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100076"/> two men ran away, and Mr. Watkins who was with me, knocked the prisoner down, and some people came up and took him to the watch-house, I was left in the Park for three or four minutes by myself, I heard the cry of murder, and Mr. Watkins had him down, I said, for God's sake keep him down, he said, call for help, I did so, and there came up two men, and I thought they were going to murder me, and I ran away.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the prisoner had taken your bundle, that Mr. Watkins had knocked him down? - About five minutes, he ran after him and the man threw the bundle down; Mr. Watkins beat him very much.</p>
               <p>After the man was knocked down, what happened? - Then Mr. Watkins kept upon him, and the other man went away, I went down to the park gate, and there came some help, and took Mr. Watkins and the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the help? - Several people, I was at the watch-house, but it was an hour and an half after they were there; it was a little after eleven o'clock: After I had been there some time, they let the prisoner out of a place, and they said, was this the man that took your bundle, and I said, yes: I never had my bundle, Mr. Watkins run after the man, and the bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment; the next morning we took the prisoner before a Justice, I told the Justice how the affair happened and I recollected the prisoner again very well.</p>

               <p>Why you perceived these two men, and knocked one of them down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you did in your fright? - Yes, we were close together, she had hold of my arm, and she shrunk close to me, and we were all four together, and I believe this was the man that fastened on me, but I am not sure of that; one of them was putting his hand into my pocket, and I struck at him and said, you scoundrel, I have no money, and immediately I cried murder! and and this man took the bundle, and I ran after him and knocked him down and kept him; I cried murder very loud, and the girl came up to me in a very great fright, I sent her to get assistance, and she fell into fits, I heard the pistol fire before I knocked him down; fifty people came about us in a few minutes; we all went to the watch-house, and they went out and found the woman in the Park, we went to the Justice's the next morning, and were ordered to appear again on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure this was the man? - I am as sure of it, as that I stand in this place; he never was five yards from me all the time; the bundle was not got again.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it? - It was about ten o'clock, a very fine evening, the days were longer then, I could see at a good distance in the Park.</p>

I saw a man run before me, he had a bundle in his hand, he dropped the bundle at about ten yards distance from me, I run too, I did not know what way that man run, this man followed me and knocked me down, and after that he got upon my stomack, the blood run out of my mouth and nostrils, and he made my eyes so black, I did not see out of one of them for six weeks: I begged him for God's sake to save my life, I had neither pistols nor weapons, nor money: I was quite suffocated, and all over in a gore of blood; my head was almost as as big as three heads; with that, I was put into the inner place in the watch-house; the next morning I was taken to the Justice's in Bow-street, and committed; both my prosecutors swore full against me, that I was the man that took the bundle, but I never was; I know no more of it than the child unborn; I have one sister in London, and a mother in the country, a very old woman.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler, about ten or eleven minutes before I had shut up my house and was going to bed, a friend came in and we were talking, and I heard the watchman's rattle, my house is the corner but one of John's-hill, the prisoner was running from Torrington-street up John's-hill, I said you are in a hurry, he said, what do you want with me, I said, I do not know, there is a cry of stop thief, he said, he had hurt nobody, I said, then why did you run, he said, to meet them as he had heard the cry of stop thief, I told him he run the wrong way, I took him and gave him to the watchman, when I came down the road I found the old gentleman almost senseless, he kept crying out for God's sake do not hurt me, do not hurt me, he did not know what he was about, he begged he might go home to his wife and family; then the old man went to the watch-house, and he said that was the man, he recollected the man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, that is the man, but I would not have him hanged neither, because I have children of my own, and I do not know what they may come to; there is nothing to hard for God to do, he may make a good man of him yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said at first I was not the man, he was very much entangled in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, no, I said you was not the man that robbed me, but the man that held me down.</p>
               <p>Williams. The prosecutor did say so.</p>

               <p>I am a tide waiter in the port of Dublin; I have seen the prisoner before in Dublin; I perfectly recollect him; he was in that same coat and waistcoat, when I saw him the 24th of June last, on board a vessel from Liverpool: When I was first put on board the vessel, this young man was passenger, and his chest lay on the deck, and on the ships coming in we boarded it, it was my duty to attend, coming along I put this case round the box to save the articles that were in it as I was not to break the box, nor do any thing to it but to bring it in the manner I got it.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner landed you found this box in his possession? - In about three hours after, the Captain, his wife and child, and a woman passenger, got the Captain's boat and went on shore, and this young man was not what we call a cabbin passenger, and this chest lay on the deck, and I saw this young man packing up a little wallet, and he told me that box was his, he said there was nothing in it but his old clothes, and that he would have it to his lodgings; the box was afterwards sealed with my seal and the sheriff's.</p>
               <p>(The box deposed to by the witness, then opened and the things deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Were that back window and that back door fastened by you before you went to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you loose? - The things mentioned in the indictment: I have not found any of the things, the prisoner stood over me all the while the others were rifling the house: Three man rushed into the room, they broke four doors open, one had a pistol, one a knife, and one a cutlass: but I cannot justly say, which had which; I was so terrified.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of the three? - He stood over me all the while the others were rifling, with a pistol in his hand waving over the bed, when they came up they brought two lights, a light in each room, there was a light in our room where we were in bed, and they were there till day-light appeared; they were there an hour or an hour and a half as nigh as I can guess; the things were taken out of the other rooms; they pressed me very much and got what money we had; the money was in my husband's breeches, he had shifted his breeches being Sunday morning: The prisoner staid with with us all the time to the very last; and asked me questions for the things.</p>
               <p>Is yours an alone house? - No, not very lonely, there is another a little way off, but not adjoining.</p>
               <p>Are there any houses immediately opposite to yours? - There is one little house directly opposite.</p>
               <p>Could any body in those houses see a light in your room at that time of night? - I never heard them say that they did: We have window shutters, but they were not shut where we lay.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - I really cannot say, I was so terrified.</p>
               <p>Had he a wig on, or his own hair? - His own hair.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing over his face? - No, quite open.</p>
               <p>Had he one of the candles? - I did not see him have any candle at all, it was the others.</p>
               <p>While he stood with you waving the pistol over the bed, he had no candle with him? - There was a candle all the while, till within a little while of their going to tifle, then they took it, and then it was brought back again some time after; they sat down and read the writings that we have, which they found in a chest of drawers in the next room, and they brought them into our room to read, and sat down and read them.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that is the man? - That is the man that stood over me.</p>
               <p>You was in such a fright, how can you tell? - I was in a fright, and a very great fright, to have three villains rush into one's room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100084"/>Prisoner's Council. Was not you frightened out of your wits? - Yes, I was frightened very much.</p>
               <p>Rather afraid to look him in the face was you not? - I could not help looking him in the face because he asked me several questions.</p>
               <p>What hour of the night was it that the robbery was committed? - Between the hour of one and two or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>It was quite dark at that time? - In July the days are very long.</p>
               <p>The person that stood over you had no lanthorn in his hand? - None that I saw, there was light enough to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When did you see the person that you supposed stood over you first, after the robbery was committed? - It was a year after.</p>
               <p>And you never had seen him in the course of that year? - No, I think it is him.</p>


               <p>You only think it is him, that will not do here, are you positively sure that you can swear; remember that you were under dreadful apprehensions, and can you positively swear after not seeing that person for a twelvemonth to the identity of the person? - I really think it is the person.</p>
               <p>If you are so perfectly uncertain about his dress, that you cannot say whether he had a hat on or not, how can you be so positive that he is the person? - I really think he is the person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of July was a twelvemonth, between the hours of twelve and three, my house was broke open by the prisoner and two others, they opened the casement and broke four doors, and came over my wife and I in bed, and the prisoner stood over us with a pistol in his hand, while the others plundered the house; he demanded my money, I told him I had none, he pressed very hard, I said, I had some in my pockets: I did not see him take any thing, but he stood over us with a pistol all the time: They carried off the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might they stay in the room? - I believe an hour or more; daylight came in at the window before they went away.</p>
               <p>Had you any candle in the room? - There was a man with a candle in the room stood examining what was in a chest of drawers, and taking out things.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough for you to see the countenance of the prisoner? - Yes, there was, the light was backwards and forwards, and taken out again, I was very much frightened at first more then afterwards; I took particular notice of the man, and we had some opinion of following the man, and we heard he was in the Poultry Compter, and then in the Savoy, and after he came out my wife laid information, when he was about again, and we saw him about July.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you had seen him from the time of the robbery? - To y knowledge it was, I saw him once since, he came out of the Savoy in our neighbourhood, my wife went to see him in the Savoy, but he was out.</p>
               <p>How came you to know he was in the Savoy? - A friend in Barnet told us so.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, when he committed the robbery? - I cannot say as to that, we described him and found he was born at Kick's Inn, a little way from us, but I never knew the man, and when I saw the man again, I was very clear it was the man.</p>
               <p>When did you get his name? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How did you get his name? - By the neighbourhood, he had lived in Barnet, and was gone from the neighbourhood, I am very positive he is the same man that stood over us with the pistol, he had a short bright pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When did you first see him after the robbery? - Not a great while after.</p>
               <p>How long? - It might be six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>You said nothing to him when you saw him? - I did not, I was struck with amazement, and stood looking at him when the person came to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100085"/>Why did not you lay hold of him? - How could I an old man.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - I was at first, but I cannot say I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner a hat on? - His hat was on.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you his name first? - I cannot tell that, it was something of a cocked hat, and there is a bit of the colour of the coat he had on; I cut it off on purpose.</p>
               <p>What off his coat? - No, off my own coat to compare it; I never was in Court before in my life.</p>

               <p>Court. I look upon it, that if you have the Captain of the ship, who speaks of his own knowledge to the sailors on board, that certainly is good evidence; if it is not the best evidence if the Captain could not be here, then to be sure the ship's books should be produced.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Had this woman any knowledge of you before? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>You got in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any body in the room besides the the prisoner? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing like a clock dial? - There was something like an alarm, and other furniture, there were several files.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing like watch or clock-work? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a Marshal's man, I went to this house, Mr. Hatton went first, as I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100087"/> known, the outward door was on the latch, I lifted up the latch and went into the passage and down into the kitchen, when we got into the kitchen, we saw Mr. Moore standing by the dresser, and these three basons and that pipkin were standing much the same as they do now, upon the dresser, about three or four feet from the vice, in one of the basons I saw Mr. Dixon take out several shillings that seemed to be in pickle, I saw him put them into paper, he bid me look at them, which I did; looking a little further, we saw a woman's gown lie on the dresser, the body flat and the tail part covered over it, and lifting up the tail we found a parcel of shillings finished, fit for uttering; Mr. Dixon took them up: While Mr. Dixon was standing at the dresser, he desired Mr. Hatton and me to examine the prisoners, and see how their hands were; the man's hands seemed to be sandy, the woman's hands appeared as if she had been polishing.</p>
               <p>Court. What appearance does that give? - Rather a yellowish hue, after I had done that, I went into the vault adjoining to the kitchen, there I found a cutting press with a fly upon it, also a cutter in it, which is in now, (the press produced) Mr. Dixon found the files; there were two small quantities of filings, which I found over where the vices were fixed, and two bottles, one stood on the shelf over the dresser.</p>
               <p>Where was the man standing? - Near the dresser in the kitchen, he appeared to have been at work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you came there, you apprehended the prisoners knew your face, did you not? - I knew if they did not, the neighbours did.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing like the appearance of resistance after you appeared? - No, Sir, they behaved very decently and very well, whether the woman pushed Mr. Hatton, I cannot say, but she held the door in her hand.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the clock or watch-making branch? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more of the coining business, than you do of the watch-making business? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You found some powders in a paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of these powders, only they are powder? - Yes, I conceive they are filings from base coin.</p>
               <p>You think, but you have already declared you do not know the nature of base coin, do you know them to be so? - I say, I apprehend them to be so.</p>
               <p>Do you know the difference between the filings of base metal, and the filings of a watch and clock? - I think I do.</p>
               <p>Did you see any watch-work; or any clock-work about the dresser? - I believe there was some part of a watch upon the dresser, it appeared as if it had been brought in to be compleated, but had not been meddled with.</p>
               <p>Did you see a clock face? - There was an alarm stood upon a shelf, but it seemed to be very dirty.</p>
               <p>Respecting that instrument, do you know any thing of that instrument; you know these instruments are applied to many other purposes? - I cannot say, I have heard that they have been applied to many other purposes.</p>
               <p>Now as to these phials, they are in the same state? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing of this kind, that it was acquafortis, and that it should be acquafortis? - I said then, that if ever I saw acquafortis in my life that was acquafortis, I believe them were the express words.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any phrase to this purport, that it should be acquafortis? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been no alteration in the liquor? - None at all, I have particularly kept them in my own possession, under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you know any thing of the application of acquafortis any further than by hearsay? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the button-making business? - I never made a button in my life.</p>
               <p>Then that instrument might be applied to the purpose of cutting out shapes for buttons as well as for shillings? - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100088"/> this to say, that I am sure the shillings were cut out from that.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the appearance of button tops are like them or not? - The button tops, I believe, are not so thick as that.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did the prisoners appear to be about any watch-making work? - No.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Catchpole and the other officer, to this place in Green-harbour-court, we opened the door and went in, there was a little girl in the parlour, we went down stairs in the kitchen, we found Mrs. Moore with the door in her hand just opened, and we rushed into the kitchen and found Mr. Moore standing near the dresser, I saw the three basons stand by him, and the sand in the tin shovel, I then put my hand into the white bason, and I found some blanks that were not finished, they were quite dirty. (Produced.) I then ordered the constables to tie the man and his wife together, and put them at the further side of the room away from these things, and they sat down, and I searched further, and the first thing I found was these three shillings, on the ledge of the dresser; Catchpole saw me, I found that shilling partly rubbed, but not so much as the other; in searching further there was a gown lay on the dresser, I lifted up the tail of the gown, and there were eighty shillings, which I found finished, I believe there wants one now in the examination, I lost one somehow; those shillings all appeared just finished; and in the different basons I believe there was water, and sand and water, I do not know exactly what was in the white bason; Mr. Clarke will tell you that; I found the corks and things laying on the bench, near to where Mr. Moore stood, and the files likewise, and some filings, and corks, and scowering-paper, and weights and scales, and a crucible; I found the finished shillings in the body of the gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you know any thing of the use of that kind of press? - I have produced many in this Court.</p>
               <p>Are those presses used in any other operation, similar to that of cutting out blanks for base metal? - They may.</p>
               <p>Do you, or do you not know? - I do not, they are used in button making.</p>
               <p>Are they in watch making? - I dare say they may; that press appeared to me to have been used by some person or other at the time it was fixed, in cutting out base metal, such as these shillings, there were some little bits of the metal about, but they were in the niches of the press, that we could not get at them.</p>
               <p>Base metal is applied to other purpose? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you observe the hands, of these people? - I did, I examined them, Mr. Moor's hands appeared to be all over sand, the same sand that is in that shovel appeared to be on his hands, the sand was wet; the woman's hands were dirty, but not so dirty as her husband's, I I suppose her business was to be taking them out of the water, and putting them between the cloth and drying them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Would not the hands of persons employed in scowering of brasses or in clock work have that kind of appearance? - If they had been making use of that kind of sand it might.</p>
               <p>Is not sand used in other business besides that? - No doubt of that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been concerned about fifteen years I believe for the mint? - Pretty near Sir.</p>
               <p>You have attended I believe many times in this Court on prosecutions for coining? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell the process? - From the casting or from the time they are cut out of the cutter.</p>
               <p>Look at this and tell us? - These are all cut out and afterwards struck up with afaint dye made on purpose to strike up a faint impression; first they have the metal flatted to the size, but this is not what is used in it.</p>
               <p>(The metal shewn him.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100089"/>That is plated that cannot be it, after the metal is flatted out it is cut out with a press, and every turning round it forces out one piece, next they are made round with a file and scowered.</p>
               <p>(The filings shewn him.)</p>
               <p>I have not a doubt but these have been filed from the edges of those; if you break one of the shillings you will find it to be the same colour.</p>
               <p>Court. What are your reasons? - Where there is a body of silver and metal the silver is purged by aquae fortis, it throws out the silver on the outside on the surface; these in the bason have been thrown into the aquae fortis, but they want the scowering of sand.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any particular files made use of? - No, you may use any file or any scowering paper; they fine it with corks, all fine work of all sorts, must be either rubbed with a cork or a stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Hart. Did you ever find any instance that people in this business have had their outward door open? - I should think they would be more discreet, but it is possible for people to have it open for a deception; the last coiner that was tried here, his cellar door where the press was, was open, and he was in the garret; this in the phial is weak aquae fortis, in the basons is sand and water; the aquae fortis being a strong body it turns it black, but being rubbed with sand it takes off the blackness and leaves the white behind.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this apparatus compleat? - Yes, except wanting the dyes that strike up the impression.</p>
               <p>In the making of silver with the cutting out press in this manner, how much could they make tale in a day? - It is impossible to tell, they could make thirty or forty pounds of shillings if they had the silver, they can cut five hundred weight a day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have given your evidence with great candour as you always do; did not you attend the trial of Beeby in Surry? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>You said a good deal of the uses of the fly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you know enough of button making and other machanick arts, to know that every one of these articles are used for other purposes, are they not? - Sometimes they are and sometimes they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Distinguish? - I do not know any business where sand and water, or aquae fortis is used, without it is to add to the colour, where there is counterfeit metal used, it requires something to add to the colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You are well informed in the business; is not aquae fortis used for other purposes as well as for coining? - It is used in a number of businesses, brass founders use it very particularly, they cannot lacker their work till it is cleansed by this, it only cleanses it, it does not cover it; you cannot gild any thing without aquae fortis.</p>
               <p>Now as to that instrument it is applied to many other purposes is it not? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>It is applied in the button and watch, and clock manufactures, is it not? - I believe little in clocks; it may be in watches.</p>
               <p>But in button making it is? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sufficiently acquainted with button making to know whether that instrument is used in button making? - If a number of people were here who knew the nature of button making, I should tell them that no man (though I am bold enough to say it in this Court) knows the nature of button making better than myself.</p>
               <p>Instruments of that kind are employed in cutting out shapes for buttons? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Is not that instrument employed in six, seven, or eight, other branches of mechanism? - I should suppose it is.</p>
               <p>As far as you know there were no dies found there? - I have not seen any, or else I should have said so.</p>
               <p>Court. These blanks have been made shillings, though by another process? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. What connection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100090"/> has Beeby with these people? - None that I know of.</p>

               <p>What is your mode of buying it? - To get my livelihood by it, I buy it to cut it, and sell it as metal.</p>
               <p>What do you give per piece for those little pieces resembling shillings? - I give twopence commonly for a shilling, I always cut them to pieces, and if I have got twenty ounces, I carry them to the refiner's, and have it melted, or sell it without melting, I came about a month to-day, I came past and cried out bad shillings, and the prisoner said will you buy any bad shillings, I said two-pence a piece, he said cannot you give three-pence, he said you buy plated spurs or buckles, or plated metal, and he took me down stairs in the shop, and there hung a whole parcel of old plated buckles and spurs, then he put me down eight or nine bad shillings, and agreed with me for two-pence farthing a piece; after he agreed for them, he says there is no occasion to take them, I have got a good many more, call in the afternoon, you may have them all; I went away, and our sabbath began at six o'clock, and it was too late for me to go to the refiner's, on the Monday morning I went to the refiner's with my goods, and it was my intention to fetch the remainder, for he said he had a great many more, and plated buckles and spurs, I have gone about these eight or nine years.</p>

Gentlemen, as to the burglary, this was no dwelling house at that time, that is one reason why it is not capable of having a burglary committed in it; another reason is, this woman says she had not seen the house for a week before, therefore she cannot say any thing to the security of the house the night before, therefore there do not seem to concur any of those ingredients which constitute a burglary. - The next question is as to the stealing, and here the value may be material; you hear this man does not stretch it higher than forty shillings, which is the utmost verge that the law goes to, and perhaps that would be too much for you to go to.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you ever get your watch again? - No.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes, I charged the watch with her, and never let her go.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the woman searched at the time? - Yes, I believe she was.</p>
               <p>The written Defence of the Prisoner read.</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>Your Lordship's humanity being well known to persons under unhappy circumstances like mine, tried at this awful bar for life, and impoverished through a confinement of upwards of a month, loaded with grief and anxiety of mind, and destitute of friends to procure me the assistance of Council; emboldens me to rely on you, not only as a Judge, but an Advocate for unhappy prisoners; and as I never before was at a criminal bar, and being unfortunate, and not capable of either reading or writing, without disguise, I trouble you with my case.</p>
               <p>An unfortunate woman, to my shame, I must confess myself; the prosecutor I certainly picked up in the street, he was exceedingly in liquor, and no other woman was in company with me; we conversed together for some time, when at last he laid hold of both my hands, and said, I had robbed him of his watch; I told him, I had not, he never quitted me, I was charged with the watch and taken to the watch-house, which I was instantly, and by three men indecently examined, and searched; stript naked; but no watch was found on me.</p>
               <p>This, my Lord, is the true case, for I know nothing of the watch, nor had it; my defence I most humbly submit to your Lordship and to the judgment of the Jury, before whom I now stand, and if the evidence of the prosecution is so sufficiently strong as to pronounce me guilty; overwhelmed as I am at present, and much more so, if that awful sentence is given, having an aged father whose grief is unsupportable, I humbly pray that your Lordship will look on me as an object of mercy, and that I may live in future in the paths of piety.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Whenever the party robbed is privy to the robbery, and either sees or feels the thing taken from him, it ceases in respect to that party to be a private taking; therefore you will acquit her of taking privately.</p>

               <p>Court. What is the value of these hats? - I valued them at what we sell them for, I valued them at too much, I now value them at ten shillings.</p>

               <p>Did they offer this for sale? - Yes, they both came in together and they asked me if I would buy two pieces more, they both came together the first time and the second time, that was the second of this month, they brought me these two pieces of silk, and I asked them what they would have a yard for it, and they told me one shilling and sixpence, I suspected them, and said, I will give you fifteen pence per yard, the prisoner at the bar said, I must have twelve guineas, I asked her what this large piece measured, and she told me about one hundred yards, I measured it, and I told her on purpose, says I, why here is bu ninety odd, then says she, you must have it for ninety odd, whereas there is one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100104"/> hundred and eight yards; they said, they took them as a bad debt.</p>

               <p>What did the other piece measure? - About sixty yards within a quarter of a yard, the prisoner then went out of the shop and I followed them, and they stood talking together at the corner of Smock Alley about three minutes, one went towards Smock Alley and the other towards Widegate Alley, that was the prisoner, I followed her and she turned up Rose Alley, I missed her in Rose Alley, I met with her again, and saw her come out of Rose Alley, and go into Mr. Jouenne's house, I had some suspicion that she did live there, I thought I would not apprehend her then as she went in there, and I went to Mr. Wilmot's and told him; the next morning she was taken, and I went to the house, and I said that was the woman, and they put the question to her, and she did not deny it, she owned it directly, and she said, she had taken it of this gentlewoman as a bad debt.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to induce her to say so? - No, they had no suspicion of her, they said, it could not be her, she had lived there two years and six months as a cook, she said, she knew me and sold me some silk, she said, she had it from

               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to their being stolen out of the dwelling house, there is no circumstance to bring that home to the prisoner, but what arises from the probability of these being shop goods, and in that case that they must be stolen out of the house, unless they were purchased by somebody, which does not appear to be the case.</p>
               <p>Jury to Gregory. We wish to know whether the prisoner had access to the warehouse? - The ware-house was not locked, it communicates to the dwelling house by two doors, which are never fastened day or night, but we have a watchman sits up all night, and goes his round from the warehouse to the compting-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. She might go to it as he is often absent? - This was done on the Sunday morning, I believe she has acknowledged it.</p>

               <p>Newton. They were all three in the box drinking together, Fielding, and Palmer, and Cosgrave, and the woman during the time she was there was on the opposite side of the table; some time after they had sat drinking together, Fielding comes and sits on the other side of Cosgrave, after they had set some time, the woman went away; after the woman was gone, the prisoner got under the table, and was there some time, he then came and sat close by Cosgrave, who was then between the prisoner and Fielding; in that situation they remained when I left the house, but before that I heard Fielding say to Palmer that the sailor had more than twenty guineas in his pocket, I then left the house, and on the next day, Saturday, coming through Frying-pan-alley, I saw the prisoner and his wife fighting, he was bleeding, I heard the woman say, you rogue give me the six guineas you had of the sailor, which you gave me last night and took away again, he said she should not have them, I went to the publick-house and met the prosecutor, and he had taken Fielding who is now absent, he said he had taken one of the men, I told him he had got the wrong man, he went back with me, and the woman then was down upon the prisoner, striving to get the money out of his pocket, the prosecutor immediately went into the house, as soon as he got into the house, several of the whores and bullies, and such like people, rushed upon the prosecutor and rescued the prisoner, I took the prisoner twice myself and they rescued him; when I took him the second time he was sitting in a publick-house in Bunhill-row, I told him he should go with me, he desired me to come into the yard, he then acknowledged he had twelve guineas of the man's money, and that he had given the other man three, he then offered me two guineas and the change that was in the publick-house, if I would excuse him.</p>
               <p>What did you say to induce him to make this acknowledgment? - It was his own voluntary offer, I said nothing at all to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him it would be better for him, or that perhaps he would be excused?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100107"/> - I said nothing to him, he begged I would excuse him, I told him, I would fetch the sailor to him, and I went to Mr. Wilmot's, I neither made him promise nor threatening, the Justice sent a headborough and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you sure you had twenty-three guineas and seven shillings in your pocket, when you first went into the public house, and seated yourself in the box? - Yes, I was quite solid when I went in, I was just what you may call merry, I am positive on it, I was plundered of it before I came out.</p>

Did you take him in the act of forcing open your door? - Yes I certainly did, forcing the padlock, he had two or three files and screw drivers, and a large iron pin about fourteen inches long to operate as a crow, which he had in one hand, and a screw driver in the other.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of that key? - To replace it two shillings, or two shilshillings and six pence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, at first I thought this might have been a petty larceny, but on hearing further I think it proper to consider it strictly, he stole the key with intent to get into the house, for after he had stole the key, and the prosecutor had fastened his house with a padlock, you find the prisoner coming again, and being disappointed forcing his way into the house, for no good cause I presume, the prosecutor has sworn that the value of this key is two shillings or half a crown, that makes it a grand larceny; if you should be satisfied from the evidence that the prisoner did steal the key, I think under these circumstances, you are not required to reduce it to a petty larceny.</p>

               <p>I live at Edmonton, I am one of the church wardens.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the sale of this wood? - Yes, the sale of this wood was the 20th of February last, we had always lost a vast deal of wood every year after the sales were over, not less than one hundred pounds a year, I have been under the necessity of being under a private agreement, that if there was any proof of any wood being stolen, I would not only make good that deficiency for the purchasers, but likewise be at the expence of the prosecution; this wood was bought by one Green, we sell five stacks in a lot, and these five stacks were sold for four pounds seven shillings and six pence; out of the five we lost one stack and and an half.</p>
               <p>How do you know that this wood was taken from these five lots? - The man that saw the prisoner at the bar loading it, shewed me the very spot where the prisoner was loading it from, and by that I am very certain that it was lot 15; the man's name was

               <p>Court. Is not he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know that is the place? - The wood was forfeited again to the parish, at the time it was stolen it became the property of the parish, by not being taken away according to the conditions of the sale; it should have been taken away in two months, Edey that saw him loading the wood did not come to me first, but it was told to other people that told me of it, I heard of it by mere accident, they did not like to tell me, they knew I would prosecute if they did; when I heard of it I sent for Edey, and desired him to go with me to show me the spot where he saw him loading it from, and he went with me and shewed it me; when I came there I knew it to be lot 15, which was bought by one Green a baker at Tottenham, I then went to that Green.</p>
               <p>Court to Edey. Did you show Mr. Erwood the place where this wood was taken from? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the place where you saw the prisoner? - Yes it was, the mark of the cartwheels were there.</p>
               <p>Erwood. I went to Green and asked him if he had fetched away any of the wood, and he said he had not, I asked him why he did not fetch it away within the time, his answer was, the weather had been so bad, and he kept no teams of his own, I said I want to know whether you have lost any of your wood; accordingly he went on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100113"/> the Chace, and came to me and told me he had lost a stack and an half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. No, no, bring him here.</p>
               <p>Erwood. I told him the wood was become the property of the parish again; he said he hoped I would not take the advantage, I told him I would not, and I paid him for the wood he had lost, as I have done to many other persons, for there was not one customer but had lost, who bought at the four sales.</p>
               <p>You are employed to sell it besides being church warden? - Yes, I was chosen surveyor of the Chace at the first allotment.</p>
               <p>And you say this is one of the lots? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came Mr. Green not to be here? - He would have been here if we had desired him.</p>
               <p>Why did you not, you only know what he told you? - I know I paid him for the wood he lost.</p>
               <p>Are not your conditions that the parish will not be answerable for any wood that is lost after one day of the sale? - Yes, that is to prevent bad people coming to buy, but I am under a private agreement.</p>
               <p>You do not know of your own knowledge that Green lost any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you commence this prosecution? - The warrant was taken out the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Was not that after Hall had brought an action against you for impounding his horse? - He brought an action against me the 30th of May, which was a good many days after that.</p>
               <p>There have been some disputes and lawsuits between you and Hall? - You know very well.</p>
               <p>Did you never ask any body to assist you in finding evidence to prosecute Hall, and promise them a reward? - I did not.</p>

               <p>What do you know of this wood on the common, did you purchase any of it? - No, Sir, the wood I sold to Mr. Hall did not grow on the common, nor belong to it, it was not my property, it was the property of Mr. Warsiff, I was his bailiff, I suppose that I have sold him not less than fifty loads or more within three quarters of a year; the wood I sold was not taken off the common, he comes across the common where my allotments are, they are a tithe allotment; going round by the road is a long way out of his way.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know him drop half a load when he went across the common? - I never knew him drop any on the common, I never went with him, he might lay it down or take it up I cannot say, his way home was across the common.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does the prisoner live? - By Winchmore-hill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long have you known him? - Twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>What is his character in the neighbourhood? - I never knew he bore a dishonest character, he always behaved honest to me and paid me honestly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Edmonton; I know nothing of the wood, there was a great many sales.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any disputes between Mr. Hall and Mr. Erwood? - I do, Mr. Erwood was served with a copy of a writ in the Marshalsea Court, and he said to me, he would take up Hall and transport him, and he sent to me, to know if I would assist him.</p>
               <p>That is so? - That is the truth upon my soul; when he took up Hall it was the time of the sessions sitting, and I said, take him to town at once, but he begged for a further examination, and the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100114"/> sent to New Prison, and then he waved the felony and lodged him for a misdemeanor: Erwood suffered execution for the payment of the money, and he told me, he wanted nothing else but to punish the prisoner; I was sent for by Hall in the cage, he was taken up just before the indictment was preferred.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. When was the writ served? - I did not serve it myself.</p>
               <p>But you knew of it? - It was just before the return of the writ, I did not see it, I do not tell you I did; Erwood himself said, he was served with a copy of a writ; it is dated the 30th, the warrant was the 23d, the man was tried here once, and was honourably acquitted, and the prosecutor gave a release and spent three pounds, and asked pardon for forswearing himself: I believe the man is very poor, but he is respected: The other was a most wicked prosecution, and it was proved perjury.</p>

               <p>- BREWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I live near Winchmore-hill; I have known the prisoner twenty years; I know nothing of him but honesty, he is a very hard working man, he keeps a team and makes the best shift he can to maintain his family.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you ever hear of the Prisoner's stealing wood?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That ought not to be asked.</p>
               <p>Court. That is an improper question.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prosecution to Howison. You are a Marshalsea Court officer, are you not? - No, Sir, I have done with business these nineteen years, I was serjeant at mace after that.</p>

               <p>Court. Is not it a large paper? - Yes, it weighs about eight pounds.</p>

               <p>I pawned the coat for half a guinea, on the 17th of July; I was coming down Drury-lane, and I met one of my shipmates, he asked me to drink some hot; we went and had three pots of brandy hot and a quartern of rum, he said, he was going to sea again, I said, I was out of work, I worked for Mr. Davis, in Park-lane; he pulled out an outside jacket and put it on; he desired me to pawn his coat, and he would give me a silk handkerchief, and when he went down to enter on board a man of war he would send me the money; I said, if he would sell it I would give him a guinea and a half; Lane knew me from a child, I told him it was my coat and that I had but just bought it, I bought a gilt breast buckle the day before, with five stones in it, of the prosecutor; I happened to stop to make a little water being very much intosticated, and the prosecutor said, I know you have stole my coat; the mots arose and asked me the matter, I told them the whole affair, that I had bought a coat which had been stolen, but that I did not know it; the prosecutor said he would send me to gaol, and the people said break his windows, I did take a handful of mud and bit the window, but did not break it; the people told me to go away, I said, I was innocent; I might have walked away and gone to sea, or to America, where I have been, and nobody would have followed me:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100116"/> I did not think I should have been tried to day, or else I should have had witnesses and my Captain to appear to my character.</p>

               <p>Jury. I understood the first evidence said, that the witness had confessed this before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. The confession has been searched for, having been reduced into writing, and it cannot be found, therefore you cannot take into your consideration any confession at all.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see her concealing it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know that she was concealing it? - When I went to get the change I missed the bundle off the stool, I did not see her in the act of concealing it, Smith stood by Clarke, so that I could not see her: I immediately jumped over the compter and charged the prisoner Clarke with it; they were neither of them then out of the house: It was neither on the stool nor on the ground, when I charged her with it, but she immediately dropped it somewhere from her person; I sent for a constable and took them up.</p>
               <p>(The muslin produced and deposed to; the value 15 l. at least.)</p>
               <p>Where was the bundle when you jumped over the compter? - It was concealed upon her.</p>
               <p>The bundle is large, how could she conceal it? - She did conceal it, I cannot tell how, she had a long cloak on, I took particular notice, having a suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How did the stool stand? - On the outside of the compter, there is a partition on each side, it stands in a place which just holds it.</p>

               <p>Court. Was this a private waggon? - It was James's flying waggon of Bristol,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100120"/> the prisoner said he knew nothing at all of it, he went to look behind the hay-bag, and shewed me a bit of a cut, about a foot long, and told me somebody had been there, and cut my property out behind the waggon.</p>
               <p>Court. Could they have taken it out of that cut? - No, Sir, they could not, it was not above a foot long, and my bundle was a yard long, and there was a stick that went through it, which never could be taken out of that cut; then I followed him to Smallbury Green turnpike, there they watered their horses at the Castle, and I offered the waggoner a shilling and a pot of beer if he would let me and another man go into the waggon, and search for my property, he damned me very much, and said he would not, he said, how could I think my property was in the waggon, when he put it in the hay bag behind, I then insisted on following the waggon, I followed them over Hounslow Heath, and the guard that was with the waggon had a blunderbuss, he said, if you do not get away from the waggon I will put a pill in you, upon which I was frightened, I then walked on as far as Colebrook, by this time it might be about four o'clock in the morning, I then knocked up a constable, he asked me my business, I told him I had been defrauded of my property, and desired him to come down and take the waggoner into custody, says he, my friend, I can do nothing in it, it is in the county of Buckingham; I went to a public house and had a pint of beer, and the prisoner came up, says he, damn you, what do you charge me with taking your property, I said yes; on Saturday I came to London and told the gentlemen belonging to the Three Cups in Bread-street of it, they then told me he should go before the Justice; I took the waggoner and the guard before Alderman Boydell in the city, (the prisoner was then come back, he goes no further than Maidenhead) the Alderman examined him, and he owned that he took the property away from me, and put it into the hay-bag behind the waggon, and the Alderman told him, says he, my friend that was not a proper place, as you took this man's property from him, that was not a proper place to put it in, you ought to have put it into the waggon, and he told him to appear before him when the waggon came there again, and bring my property, or make me some restitution for it, I was then contented, thinking I might get my property again, I came up to town the Saturday following, and went before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall, the man never appeared at all, I told the Alderman the story, and they told me to go to some Justice of that county, and take out a warrant, and bring it to them and they would back it, I went to the Rotation office and got a warrant, and the Alderman backed it, I took a constable to the Three Cups in Bread-street, when we came there we shewed the warrant to the bookkeeper, I took the warrant from him and finding I could not take him, I gave it to Mr. Lowes belonging to Isleworth parish, and he took him on the Sunday night as he was watering his horses, I do not know the day of the month, I never got my things, he is the man that took my things away from me, and he has defrauded me of it I do assure you; I am a poor man, he has distressed me to the lowest degree in life.</p>

               <p>What did he do with it? - He took the bundle from under my arm to put it into the waggon.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with him and see it? - No, I did not, nor never saw what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>Was there nobody with the waggon, or about the waggon? - There was people about, there was people going in the waggons, there were people doing business about the waggon.</p>
               <p>Were there any passengers in the waggon, as you went to Smallbury Green? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>And there was a guard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At Brentford you asked for your bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you, at that time, make a demand of money of him? - No, as I hope for mercy.</p>
               <p>Did you at no time make a demand of any money from him? - Never in my life, as I hope I may see the face of Almighty God, I never did.</p>
               <p>How came you to go before Mr. Alderman Boydell? - To examine him.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>Any summons? - No.</p>
               <p>What was the reason of your going there? - I was willing to have him before the Justice to examine him.</p>
               <p>And he was willing to go with you? - Yes, he went.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing said, that if you and the guard will go before a magistrate and swear you know nothing of the bundle there should be an end of it? - Nothing at all about making an end of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100123"/>When you went before Alderman Boydell, did not you say, if you will go before a magistrate and swear that you know nothing of the bundle there shall be an end of the matter? - I do not remember it, I offered to pay for the oath if they would go.</p>
               <p>How came you to pay for it? - The man took the oath before the alderman.</p>
               <p>What were they sworn for? - I do not know, the alderman put the book in their hands and they said they would swear.</p>
               <p>Then you swore nothing? - Nothing till they swore they knew nothing at all about the property.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that if they would take their oaths before some magistrate there should be an end of the matter? - No, I never did, they insisted upon taking the oaths themselves.</p>
               <p>And you paid for that oath? - No, I did not, I offered to pay for it; I got a warrant against this man before a city magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did you take a warrant out from a magistrate in the city? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What Justice did you go before? - At the Rotation Office.</p>
               <p>What became of that warrant afterwards? - I took it down in the country, and this man served it of a Sunday night, about half past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then before that warrant was executed on the prisoner, did nothing pass between you and the prisoner with respect to any payment of money? - No, Sir, there was never any money mentioned.</p>
               <p>Not two guineas? - No, nor one guinea, nor half a guinea, he never made any proposals, I only wanted my property.</p>

               <p>Do you know the name of the guard to this flying waggon? - I do not, I saw him that night, I know him by sight, he said he would put a pill in me.</p>
               <p>Had he any gun or any thing of that kind? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>You never offered at any time if the man would pay you two guineas you would put an end to it; will you swear that? - I will swear, Sir, I never made any such agreement, nor the thing never was proposed either of his or my side since I lost my property.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not promise that if they would go before the magistrate, the prisoner and the guard, and take their oaths that they knew nothing of this bundle, that there should be an end of the matter? - As for saying that, I do not remember any thing about it, I might say such a thing, but I do not remember any thing at all about it, to the best of my knowledge I never said so.</p>

               <p>After this man served the warrant, the young man came to me to desire me to go along with him on Monday morning, accordingly I went to Smallbury turnpike, that was when he was taken up, this gentleman had got the prisoner at that time, and he took him to Twickenham before a bench of Justices; we were drinking two pots of beer and I moved a word, says I, have you got this property, yes, says he, I have, I took it from him in Piccadilly, then he was taken before the bench of Justices, and he was committed, and I was bound with this man to prosecute, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. He said he took the property from him in Piccadilly, what did you understand by that, or what do you mean should be understood by it? - He did not say where he put it, he said he had the property from this man, and he had put it into the hay bag.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say that before; have you known that man any time? - Never, I have no acquaintance with either of them.</p>
               <p>Who was the bail before the magistrate? - Mr. Lewis and this gentleman belonging to the Castle.</p>
               <p>Was any body present when this conversation passed? - This man was drinking with me, and that man was sitting on the other side of the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met with this man just by St. James's Church, he asked me what waggon it was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100124"/> and I told him it was the Bath waggon, says I, are you going to Bath, he said, no, to Brentford, says he, can you give me a lift, he asked me once or twice and I denied him, as he was at the White Horse cellar I denied him twice or three times, he said, put my bundle up for me, I said, I will have nothing to do with you nor your bundle, he said, put it any where, says I, you must mind him, I shall take no charge of him; he walked by the tail of the waggon till we came to the King's Arms at Brentford, says he, I will take my bundle out, then I said, I would take it out; I went to the tail of the waggon and he with me, says I, you have got your bundle have not you, it is not here, says he, if you have lost it you shall pay for it, I said I should not I had taken no charge of it, I asked him the worth of the bundle, says he, I have two new suits of cloaths, a silk waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a shirt; says I, you must be a very bad man to say so, your bundle was not bigger than my hat; says he, thee wilt not pay me for the bundle wont thee, I said, no; says he, thee art not the first man I have swindled, and I will swindle thee before I have done with thee; then when we came to Smallbury-green he offered to take two guineas, and on Hounslow-heath he offered to get upon the waggon.</p>

               <p>I have been guard to the waggon four years, I go constantly, I was with it on the 6th of August last, I was at the White Horse cellar when the prosecutor came, when he came there he offered the waggoner the bundle and wanted to ride to Brentford in the waggon, which he denied him, and said he had no room for him; he then said, could he put his bundle any where, says he, put it some where, and he went to the tail of the waggon, and the waggoner said, you may put it in here if you will, in the tuck, in the hay bag, behind the waggon, which he did and he skewered it up, and he asked the prisoner if it was safe there, and the prisoner said he could not tell, he might mind it himself as he was going to walk; then he asked the waggoner to have something to drink, which he denied, at last he said, if he drank any thing it should be a glass of gin; they went in and came out, and the waggon went off, the prosecutor walked sometimes behind and sometimes of the side till we came to Hide Park Corner, the other side the turnpike, then the waggoner got into the waggon, as he said he was tired, and I got upon the nagg, and I drove the waggon all the way to Brentford.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the prosecutor all this time? - He was walking behind the waggon or of one side of it, he got on the shafts sometimes, I cannot tell, there was another man walked by the side of me to Smallbury-green, when we came to the King's Arms at Brentford, he said, I will have my things out, then he said, no, I will not, I will let them abide till I come to the market house, then he said, I will have my bundle out, he said, I will take it out, it is here you put it, so then he went round, and there was a hole in the tuck, whether he took it out himself, or who took it out I cannot say, I never saw the bundle after it was put in, when we came to Brentford, he said, the waggoner should find his bundle, he said, he would make him find it, the waggoner said, he could not, then he said, he would follow him to Colebrook and have him taken up, when we came to Smallbury-green, I got into the waggon, and the waggoner drove, and when he left the waggon I do not know, but it was somewhere on the heath, he was at Colebrook when we came there; I had no conversation with the prosecutor at all after I came from Smallbury-green, I saw the prosecutor afterwards, the next Saturday he came to our inn at the Three Cups, in Bread-street, then he said, if we would go to any Justice any where and be upon our oaths, only just go and swear that we had never seen the bundle since it was put into the tuck, he would think no more of it, and we said we would.</p>
               <p>Did he make that proposal to you? - Yes, he did, and there is another witness or two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100125"/> that heard him, we went to Alderman Boydell.</p>

               <p>Did you take your oath to that purpose? - We did.</p>
               <p>Who paid for that oath? - I do not think he took any thing.</p>
               <p>That was at the prosecutor's request? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said before you went, about any money? - No, nothing, since the night he came to Smallbury-green to take the waggoner up; he came to the waggoner before he served him with the warrant, and asked him if he would make it up for two guineas, the waggoner said, no, he asked him if he would make it up for a guinea and a half, the waggoner said, no, and then he took him up directly, that hindered the waggon from going an hour and a half, and I was obliged to drive it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How big was it? - Not so big as a hat.</p>
               <p>Was there a stick in it? - There was, as if carried on a shoulder.</p>
               <p>Did you see the hole that was cut? - I do not know whether it was cut, or whether it was tore, it was large enough to be taken out, but I do think it could fall out.</p>

               <p>I missed the breeches on the 7th of August last, at half past five in the afternoon, I saw the breeches in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he live in the same house? - No, I never saw him before in my life, I overtook him by Mr. Dickinson's brewhouse.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect him? - I saw them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take them? - No, I said he had more in his pocket than was his own, he said, damn you, you old bitch, what is that to you, he run away, and I cried stop thief, he was taken in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he in your sight all the time? - Yes, he took them from under his arm, and threw them into a ditch, and stamped upon them, about two minutes before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was you present when the breeches were thrown into the ditch? - No.</p>
               <p>Who does the breeches belong to? - Me, I had just washed them, they were hanging out to dry.</p>
               <p>Who did you wash them for? - A young boy in the country.</p>
               <p>Where were they hanging? - On the pales before my door.</p>
               <p>Did you see them taken away? - I saw them in his pocket as he was going out of the Crown and Woolpack yard, I am satisfied these are the breeches I washed, there is the hole behind.</p>

You probably owe your escape from this charge to the error in the indictment, the property not being laid there as it turns out in the evidence; and you owe much to the lenity and candor of your prosecutor in giving his evidence; however, there is too much reason to suppose that you are badly connected, you will therefore take warning by your escape for the future, and not fall under any of these suspicious circumstances again.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner's Father. You owe much to the candor and humanity of your son's prosecutor, and I am afraid your son has escaped by the error in the indictment rather than the merits of the case, the proof was very strong, and it behoves you to keep your son out of these practices for the future.</p>
               <p>Court to Paul. I think you can have no doubt whose property these are, I therefore hope you will not be instrumental in preventing this man from recovering his right.</p>

               <p>Or that if he would not confess, it would be worse for him? - I told him it was incumbent on him to give an account of it.</p>
               <p>Why? - For no reason in the world.</p>
               <p>No threat or promise? - No, I do not recollect I did, he said it had been brought to him the night before by a boy whom they called Dust, he could not recollect what he gave for it, I believe by his account of it, he gave about eleven shillings for it, at first he said he had given a penny a pound which was the price he gave for old lead.</p>
               <p>What does old lead generally sell for a pound? - I do not know, I believe it is worth three halfpence.</p>

               <p>You enquired his character before the house was let to him? - He was recommended to me by the preceding tenant, who always paid his rent very regularly, and I accepted of him as a tenant.</p>
               <p>And the general character that he bore from other people was that of an honest young man? - It had been told me that he was so.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to doubt of the fairness of his account? - He hesitated about the quantity, probably it might be from ignorance, I believe he gave a fair account of it.</p>

               <p>Where did he say he had it? - I had not time to question him.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it right to question him? - Yes, but I had customers in my shop.</p>
               <p>Have your former dealings with Broderick been in buying of lead? - Only once, which was a very small quantity: having customers in my shop, I could not examine him, but as soon as I was at leisure, I went into the back place and desired: him to let me see the lead, and this gentleman came in and called me, and asked me, if I had not lead offered me, I said yes, I said here is the man, and I said at the same time, I had a suspicion it was stolen by the size of it; I asked him who he bought it off, but they came in so quick he had not time to make me an answer; the prisoner Broderick went into the shop to speak to Mr. Prescot, and said, as he was a young beginner he hoped he would not be hard with him; Mr. Prescot said he made no doubt he would not be hurt, as the gentleman would have his lead again; he then said he had it of one Dust.</p>

               <p>I was the constable that took this party up, on the 23d of August, I saw the lead at the shop, and I followed it from there to the street where it belonged to, I afterwards found Dust, and he said he was sorry for what he had done, he was called out of his bed and should get nothing for it, for the other boy had run away with all the money; I only asked him how he could be guilty of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Broderick called two Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Did they see you? - Yes, after they gave these things to the other boy, they were taking the other case out of the window; they run away the moment they saw me, I went and rang the bell, I saw the gentlewoman herself, and I told her the boys were taking the things out of the window.</p>
               <p>What became of the case? - It was dropped under the brick wall, I saw them take it away, and they lifted it over and dropped it under the brick wall; I did not see them drop it.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of August I lost a silk cloak, I was in St. Thomas's Hospital very bad of the dropsy, and I was turned out that very day incurable, and a young woman that is here fetched me in a coach, and when I came home, the prisoner and another man were at my house at dinner, when I came in I was very much fatigued, and the next witness laid my cloak on the head of my bureau bed in the kitchen, the other man went out, and the two women went out and left me, and the prisoner, and the next witness in the room. I was ready to faint, and I sent the young woman to get some milk, and she left me and the prisoner together, my cloak was gone.</p>

               <p>How long was it before the prisoner went away? - About a quarter of an hour from the time I came in.</p>
               <p>Did he go before the last witness returned? - Yes, I never saw my cloak again, he had his elbow on the cloak, I missed the cloak before she came in, which was in about five minutes, she then run to look for the man, and could not find him, I never saw the prisoner till that time, he was taken that night; he was passing by the lane, and a young woman saw him, and asked him if he did not dine with me, and he said no.</p>
               <p>Court. After one of the men and the two women were gone, can you be sure that you saw your cloak on the bureau? - Yes, Sir, as sure as I am a living woman.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Greaves, on Monday the 18th of August, about nine in the morning, the prisoner came to my master's shop to buy a pair of shoes, he was fitted, and my master assisted me; then my master quitted the shop and went down stairs, and left me and the prisoner at the bar in the shop; the prisoner said, come with me to Oxendon-street, and I will give you the money, I went with him, when he came to the Black-horse door of Oxendon-street to the public house, he asked me to drink, I said, no, he pulled a little bit of paper out of his pocket, which I understood was a bank note, and said, he must go and get change, I asked him for what, says he, go and get something to drink, and I will go and get change; he had a bit of paper in his hand, he went three doors, I had a suspicion, and went to see, when I came to the corner, he was crossed over the way, I ran after him and lost sight of him, whether he went round James-street, or New-cross-street, or into any house, I cannot say, I saw him no more till he was taken up, his excuse was, he was going to pay for the shoes, on examination he had no money, and was very much confused, and had no excuse at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But he offered you if you would gave him change to pay you? - Not to me, no, he said he would get change; on examination before the Justice, he confessed to me that it was no note, it was a piece of blank paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You told him it would be better for him to confess? - I told him it would be better for him to have paid for the shoes.</p>
               <p>Had not you seen the prisoner at the shop before? - I might have seen the man there before, I think I have seen the man once in the shop before.</p>
               <p>Did he buy any shoes before? - If he had he paid for them, he never asked for credit or trust.</p>
               <p>When you went with him he told you all along that he would pay you, and desired you to stay till he got change? - Yes.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was going about some business to Mark-lane, to enquire for some prize-money, going through Leicester-fields I had the misfortune to break my shoe, I went into Mr. Greaves's, where I had several times been with my wife and children, and had a pair, he advised me to have two pair, and I said one would do, I put them on, and the man went with me to Oxendon-street, I went in hopes to get the money to pay for them, the friend I went to ask for some was gone into the country, and I expected a remittance from Mr. Lloyd, who is an agent at Plymouth, and I went down to Charing-cross, I had no thoughts that the man, as I had frequently used that place, had any suspicion of my defrauding him; I believe two or three days after I was going to Mr. Greaves's to tell him I was going to get the money to pay for them, and he caught me in a violent passion, and would not let me go; I never had the least thoughts of defrauding any body, and I have witnesses here that I believe can prove it.</p>

Gentlemen, if you are of opinion that the prisoner really did intend in his heart to pay for the shoes, but that he did not like to subject himself to say, I have no money, I am in distress; yet if he bore about in his mind the intention of paying for the shoes, it does not amount to a felony; one circumstance speaks in his favour, which is going to a shop which it is proved he used, for if a man intended to get possession of a pair of shoes in an unlawful way, it is not likely that he should go to a shop he had known, that was a risk too dangerous for the prisoner to run.</p>

             and I saw nothing in the cabbin, we confined the people on the deck, and Mackannally, and Farren, and Knight, went down into the cabbin; I believe they might be about twenty minutes, as nigh as I can guess, I saw a couple of coats and two pounds of tea, I did not see these buckles, we were to divide the property the next day; but the firing at the Captain gave me great uneasiness, because the young man that was with me fired at the Captain directly, I never heard Mackannally mention any thing about having any buckles.</p>
               <p>Court to Christopher. Where were the buckles? - In my chest in the cabbin, the key was in the chest.</p>
               <p>How did you know it had been opened? - Only by the loss of my buckles and coat.</p>
               <p>MACKANNALLY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never was on board the ship, I never saw the evidence before, I bought the buckles coming over London Bridge, a man met me, and I had him a guinea and gave him eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to the other four there is no evidence but that of the accomplice, but as to Mackannally there is evidence against him exclusive of the accomplice sufficient to put him on his trial, for the buckles which Christopher has sworn to, were found upon him the next day, therefore, it is incumbent upon him to give some account how he came by these buckles.</p>
               <p>Jury to Manning. Who fired? - There were three that fired in all, as soon as ever the Captain came up,

             fired at the Captain, and soon after Farren came up, and he fired, and Mackannally fired.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Manning. How often have you been evidence for the Crown? - Never before.</p>
               <p>No? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Did you ever impeach your accomplices? - In any bad ways.</p>
               <p>You understand me? - I never was in a Court of Gentlemen before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mackannally. My Lord, he has been evidence twice before.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Captain. Did you make any observation of the people that fired at you? - I was asleep when the men came into the cabbin, they demanded a candle, and to over-haul and search for goods, they pretended to be Custom House Officers; then they opened the chest and took out the tea and cloaths, I got hold of two of them but they were too powerful, then they fired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100143"/> at me, and one shot me under my arm, I cannot say which it was.</p>

               <p>This coffee was in the warehouse that I take care of; it has a King's lock under the excise; the warehouse belongs to Cornish and Brown, rented by them; I am the locker of it, under the King's lock, under the excise; I saw it on Saturday the 19th of July in the warehouse, at two o'clock in the afternoon; on Monday following the King's lock was broke off, about ten o'clock in the morning: I saw the bag afterwards before Alderman Hart, I knew it to be the bag and the coffee.</p>
               <p>By what do you know the coffee? - It is a very singular case, this coffee in this bag is part of a bag of coffee out of seven hundred that we shipped about four months ago, and this fell into the Thames, and was brought back to the warehouse, and was spread abroad, and became mouldy, I have a sample of the bag, the remainder of that was left in the warehouse not being all taken away; this corresponds with the sample, I can swear to the bag, it is lot 131, I lotted it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. It is not impossible for any other coffee to be in that situation, to drop into the river? - Unless another bag had dropped into the river, and then it would not have been the same as that.</p>
               <p>Is it possible for another bag of coffee to drop into the river? - It is possible it might; this coffee was re-bagged in the warehouse where it lay, it was taken part of it away, and part of it split on the ground, and the coffee I can swear to.</p>
               <p>I believe you would be much concerned if you stood in the situation of the prisoner; now pray how many bags of coffee do you suppose go down, and come up the river Thames in the course of twelve months? - A many thousands, twenty thousand; but I never knew an instance of this kind before.</p>
               <p>And in twenty thousand bags, you suppose it impossible that any other bag should be marked in the same way? - I am very positive.</p>
               <p>You are a very positive gentleman as ever I heard of in a Court Justice? - I say, that the coffee that came into the warehouse is of such a complexion.</p>
               <p>And so in twenty thousand bags you can discriminate one bag? - I can discriminate the bag itself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100145"/>Those other people that have the care of warehouses, do they mark their bags, or are they mere blanks? - Upon my honour I do not know, I have nothing to do with other people.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether other people do or not? - I know nothing of other people's business, it is possible they may.</p>
               <p>Do you know it or not? - I do not know it, this I know, this I ascertain.</p>
               <p>You are a very positive and uninformed person? - I deny it, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. Was M'Cauley there? - No, I went to M'Cauley for a pair of shoes, and the same young man was with him the same day, and I heard him say, he sold the things for fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>What things? - Mr. Barton's things.</p>
               <p>Did he mention them as Mr. Barton's things? - Yes, he said that Thompson might lick him, and take the money from him if he would; nobody was by but the prisoner and me, and this young man.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was intimately acquainted with Thompson? - No, Sir, I was not, I got acquainted with him by using Mr. Barton's house.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd that he should make such a discovery before you who was so little acquainted with him? - He did not make it to me.</p>
               <p>But he said it loud enough for you to hear? - Yes; I told Barton; this young fellow was there, and was telling him he had been a rogue to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. Who do you work for? - I work for Mr. Rogers in Goswell-street.</p>

               <p>But have you in fact lost any? - I suspect losing it, but it is impossible for me to tell, because I have such a quantity in different states.</p>
               <p>Court. But you must say positively? - I believe the silver that was found at the place where the prisoner sold it, was my silver.</p>
               <p>I must have a direct answer to that, whether you have actually lost any silver? - The silver that was found was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. That is in other words, saying you have lost it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why cannot you say so? Now why do you suspect the prisoner? - I was informed that the prisoner was selling silver at a suspicious place; suspecting I had lost silver, I got a search warrant, and went and searched the house of Mr. Parlyman, in Brick-lane, and there was found a quantity of silver: the silver and Parlyman were brought to my house; Parlyman pointed to the prisoner as the man that sold him the silver; one piece appeared to be drawn out, and one to be cut off; the prisoner said it was my property, he was taken before a Justice, and he signed written confession; which I saw the Justice and the prisoner sign, there were no promises or threats made use of.</p>
               <p>(The Silver deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner signed that confession you say? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was any thing all said to him before he signed it, was he asked if it was his voluntary and free confession? - Mr. Triquet asked him what he had to say.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be under any tremor of mind? - I do not know, he was flustrated very much.</p>
               <p>Then he was not perfectly at ease when he signed that confession? - He certainly was in his proper senses and knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>You have a great number of men? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>And you had not positively taken any notice, that you had lost any thing to any of your men; you had not said so in your shop? - I had communicated it to my men, that I suspected that I had been robbed, because there was a quantity of silver taken from the shop and concealed in a room; I suspected the prisoner, because he was very idle, he appeared very well and had a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100152"/>Then you would discharge him I should think: did you miss any particular filings? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the silver in the paper any where else, and had no suspicion respecting this man at all, should you have known it from other silver? - Had I seen that silver and examined it as I have now, I believe I should have been able to speak to it.</p>
               <p>Why you do not swear to it now? - I desy the whole trade to produce one piece of wire like it with the threads in it.</p>
               <p>Then all the evidence you have respecting this arises from the confession? - I have evidence that he told it to, and I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Where did he make the confession first? - In my shop before a number of people.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I only asked him whose property it was.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - Not in the least.</p>

               <p>(Produces the sheets which were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>About nine o'clock in the morning of the 27th of August, the prisoner knocked at my door and asked if the mistress of the house was within, my children said I was, he said, he had something to say to me, I went to the door and the prisoner stood at the door and asked me to buy a pair of sheets; I said, young man, come in; I suspected he had stole them; when I got him in I locked the door upon him, and myself and an old gentlewoman that lives with me; I said, he should be my prisoner, and he then confessed that he had broke into a room in Dyot-street and stole a pair of sheets; they were marked with the man's name at full length; there was a man waiting at the outside of the door; I asked him whether that man was a confederate with him or not, for I would insist upon it he should come in along with him; he said, the man knew nothing of the matter nor did not know what he had got; then I asked him if he knew the consequence of these things and what it would come to by and by, and that there were eight men to be executed, and whether it would not bring him to the same; he said, he hoped not, he never would do so again; but he made his escape from me through the back door; I went next day with Dowley and we found the prisoner in a cockloft.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met a shipmate of mine, he had some sheets on his arm, and he asked me to take the sheets to this woman; he said he owed the woman some money and perhaps she might stop it; I thought at the time they were his own property, and it is very improbable that I who can both read and write should offer such sheets as them for sale, with the man's name and the street, the man was at the door till he knew I was apprehended, and then he run away: I told Briggs I was not guilty, and she said, then go along I shall not hurt you, go out the back way and make the best of your way.</p>
               <p>Jury to Briggs. Did you know the man that stood at the door? - I never saw either of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Briggs. Did I never lodge in your house a night or two? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You keep a very irregular bad house, and you know the other man.</p>

               <p>How far was the team before you? - I fancy it might be about the value of two poles or thereabouts, a very little way.</p>

               <p>I know nothing further than when my master halloos out I goes behind, and I swore an oath, and I says, gentlemen what are you at, and the prisoner Roberts stepped off and said, if you make any more noise, I will cut you down directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing from your master? - No, Sir, he kept me off, I am sure Roberts was the man that stood over me, and I do not know any thing of either of the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was the man over you! - The space of two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him long enough to know him again? - Yes, when he stood over me, the same as I may look you in the face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. My Lord, this man swore that I stopped him about twenty minutes before four, and he said it was a very dark morning, then he said he knew me by the buttons on my coat, and before he had sworn it was a very dark morning.</p>

               <p>Court to Jordan. Did you say so? - It is very false my Lord, what he says, I never mentioned four o'clock, nor no such an hour.</p>
               <p>Court to Finch. Do you remember that Jordan mentioned to the Justice that it was a very dark night? - I cannot remember that particular.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that he said he could distinguish the buttons of the prisoner's coat? - Yes, my Lord, he said he knew the buttons, he said that was the man by the buttons of the coat.</p>
               <p>Jordan. When I first watched these men, I watched to see whether they interrupted my master or not, they passed him, and I went after my horses, then I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100156"/> my master halloo out, I ran back, says I halloo, what is the matter, and this Roberts came and said, if you say another word, I will cut you down directly.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ROBERTS'S DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>My Lord, here are three men that were present that know the words he swore, that it was about twenty minutes to four, and it was a dark night, and he could swear to the buttons of my coat; I have witnesses to bring to prove that I was at another place, I have witnesses both to my character, and in regard to my being elsewhere, I have proof to bring that I was at home in my bed at the time when this robbery is said to be committed.</p>

               <p>Silence being proclaimed, the Deputy Recorder addressed the several convicts in the following words.</p>
               <p>You the several prisoners at the bar have been convicted of the offences charged in your indictments; it must give inexpressible concern to all who see or hear of so crouded a bar of criminals, to reflect that laws written in blood, and denoucing death against those who violate them, should in so many instances have lost their terror, and that after such frequent executions, and more frequent pardons, the exertions of publick justice, and of royal mercy should seem to be thrown away upon such bold offenders: The black catalogue of your crimes comprehend every species of fraud and violence, short of high treason against the King's person and government, and short of murder, which can disturb society or debase human nature: since the laws have found it necessary to place your crimes on the same footing with respect to your punishment, it would be useless to enquire how they stand with respect to your comparative guilt: you have unjustly abused the clemency of the law, and have incurred its punishment: you have not offended without notice or without example, and in defiance of the laws you have dared to draw down their vengeance upon you; whereas you ought to have reflected that opposition to the laws, instead of stopping their current serves only to increase their violence: under these circumstances I exhort you not to delay the important business of looking into yourselves, instead of into your comparative guilt, and endeavouring to obtain the pardon of the Almighty: I exhort you not to delay this business from any expectations of mercy, because it would ill become this Court to hold out to you the terms on which his Majesty thinks fit to extend his mercy, or to determine in cases peculiar to his own jurisdiction, where mercy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100158"/> to the individual would be cruelty to the community. You will remember that your death is a passage from one life to another, from a temporary to an eternal existence, miserable or happy, as God in his justice or mercy shall be pleased to make it: you will therefore lose no time in endeavouring to impress yourselves with a just sense of your guilt, and to make that the basis of your contrition and repentance; you will consider that human tribunals can judge only from actions, but that you will shortly appear before the tribunal of one, who sees into and who will try you by the hidden motives of the heart: you will reflect that it is not those who call upon his name but those who cultivate in themselves sit dispositions to perform his will, that are likely to obtain his mercy: reflect therefore on the threatenings he has denounced against impenitent sinners and the promises he holds out to those are penitent. Nothing remains to the Court but to pronounce the dreadful sentence of the law; the sentence of the law is, and this Court doth award and adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until you are dead, and may God Almighty have mercy on your souls!</p>
