On the 4th I saw a boy going by with a pair of iron hinges in his hand, I asked him where he had them; he told me he would shew me the person he bought them of; he shewed me the prisoner, and as other buildings were broke open that night in Houndsditch, we thought proper to secure him.

We asked him what he had done with them; he said he would produce some of them to me the next day, which he said he had sold to a person. We went with him to a baker in Gravel-lane; there the baker's brother produced to us three pair, which the prisoner acknowledged to be three of the same he took from the buildings. They have no particular marks on them, so as to know them from others, but they are of the same sort, and like them we missed; and though I do not chuse to swear to them, I believe them to be the same.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Artichoke at Blackwall: I was going to fetch a horse from beyond Rumford; I overtook the prisoner between the 10 and 11 mile stones betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock. I did not take an account of the day of the month, it was on a Friday about a month ago; he was bargaining with a man that had a cart to carry his portmanteau, and after he had delivered it he overtook me, he was on horseback; he asked me if I had seen the Harwich fly, saying he should be glad to get there to night, for he had got his uncle's horse that kept the, Vine inn in Vine-street, Piccadilly, and if he could get in the fly he would send the horse back. We went on to the White-hart at Rumford, there we were told the fly went by at 7 in the morning; we went to another inn, and he asked for a machine; it wanted then 5 minutes of 11 o'clock, he could get no carriage. We agreed to ride on; he said if I would go with him to Brentwood he would take a post-chaise, and he would satisfy me if I would bring the horse to his uncle. We went there to the White-hart; he ordered a post-chaise, and called for a bottle of port and something to eat, and a barber to dress his hair; after he had paid for the chaise he turned out some pieces of silver coin, and said they were of no service to him, and said I was welcome to them. (Four pieces produced, one of them a Queen Elizabeth's shilling, and deposed to by Webb as his property.) He got into the chaise, and ordered to be drove to Chelmsford, and gave me half a guinea to bring the horse to Piccadilly. When I came there to the Vine, the landlord asked me where the man was that I brought him from; I said I believed he was at Harwich. He told me that man had robbed the Earl of Dartmouth, and that it was the Earl's horse. I then went with him and the horse to the Earl's house.</p>

I live at the corner of Middle-row, St. Giles's, and am a watchmaker; I was coming from the play the same evening; there was a stop in the passage; I looked and saw a watch lie on the ground; I picked it up; the case was separated; <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090005"/> I put the watch in my left coat pocket, and the case in the other: the prisoner came and said, D - n you, you have picked up something; he took hold, of my right arm, and another on my other, and forced me into Bridges-street, I said I had picked up something, and desired them to let me go; I felt a hand in my right hand pocket, and the case was gone: then they left me. My sister knew him by his frequently passing by the door; and my father took him up the next day, and brought him to our house. We took him before Justice Welch, and charged him with assaulting me, and taking the case out of my pocket. He did admit he had the case from me.</p>

My brother said if he had, he thought it did not belong to him. Then the prisoner and another man dragged him into the street, and they took the case from him.

            . Did not the prisoner claim a part of what was found?</p>
               <p>Gilder. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gilder, sen. My son and daughter came home, and said they had picked up a watch, and how two men had collared him, and taken the case: my daughter said she knew the man. We described the prisoner to a neighbour; he said he'd be hanged if it was not Charles Fenley. He soon came by; the neighbour called and shewed me him. I stept to him, and said I wanted to speak to him: Was not you at Drury-lane playhouse last night? No, said he. Did not you take a watch-case out of a man's pocket? God forbid, said he, and denied it. I called my son down; he denied it to him. Then we got a constable; then he owned he did take it, and thought he had as much right to the watch as he, as he saw it on the ground, but could not get at it. The prisoner was committed, on suspicion for taking the case out of my son's pocket, and picking a gentleman's pocket of a gold watch. The watch was advertised by the prosecutor: then I and my son went and carried the watch; we found the case at Mr. Welch's, the Tuesday after: Fenley owned he had sent it by an attorney.</p>

               <p>I was coming out of the playhouse: I kicked something with my foot; the gentleman stooped, I said, You have got something not your property: I believe, as he had his hand in his pocket, I did shake the it out of his hand: I knew it was not his own, because he said, Gentlemen, I have picked up a watch, and I shall have it forced from me.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Saunders in a back room, the prisoner came into the shop with a parcel of paper to sell; Mr. Saunders put it into the scale, and as he turned his back the prisoner took a pair of stockings from off the counter and put them into his pocket; when he was gone I told Mr. Saunders of it. We went after him, and took him in the street and brought him back; then he took out these stockings and put them on the counter.</p>

               <p>Mr. Smith. On Tuesday evening as I was going home at the end of Trig-lane, I met the prisoner with a sack on his back; I asked him what he had got there, he told me nothing. I went and seized him by the collar, and asked him again; he said the same again, he threw the sack from his back. I got assistance and secured him; we found a red mark, E. Rawlins, Dartford, 1765; he said he picked the coals out of the mud; we found his stockings very dry, the coals very clean; he was carried before Mr. Alderman Turner, who bound me over to prosecute.</p>

            . I live at the George inn in Leather-lane, I left a little black horse with a switch tail to one Smith, I believe the prisoner to be the man, on a Friday, and he had him again the Monday following; he mounted about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning. The horse was sent home on the Tuesday; he said he wanted the horse to go to Hertford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of the Birmingham coach being robbed?</p>
               <p>Moss. I did, according to the account in the papers he had the horse the same day.</p>

            . The prisoner was at my house on the Monday morning, I think the 3d of March; I know he was taken up the Thursday after, being the 6th; I hearing he was taken up I went to see him in prison, and they detained me there all night by order of Mr. Marsden, who sent three thief-catchers.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the 6th of March was he at your house?</p>
               <p>Nash. He was at my house, as near as I can tell, about a quarter after 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Nash. I keep a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the place described where the robbery was committed, from your house?</p>
               <p>Nash. It is about three miles, he had no horse with him when at my house.</p>

            . On the 25th of February I was in bed; Mr. Howard sent for me; I went. He told me he had been robbed; (I am a constable at Brentford;) we took him before a Justice of the peace. He a long time denied knowing where the buckles were; but when we got him to the Justice's yard, then he said he would tell us where they were, if we would not let a mob be about him. I and Mr. Howard's man went with him to the place where he said they were; it was a garden near Brentford. He said they were on the other side the pales; I got over, and there found them (three pair produced;) he said he had them out of Mr. Howard's shop.</p>

After it was known that Lack's wife had lost a gown and apron, I went into the stable to the prisoner, and said, Harry, if you know any thing of the woman's things, tell her of them. I was at the searching the prisoner's house; we found several things my property, that he had taken from me. When I told him of this, he fell a crying, and said he would let her have them. Then he went along the road, and crossed some fields, and pulled the gown and apron out of a hedge, tied up in a sacking apron of his own. Then the constable took him to his house; there he owned to the fact.</p>

I said I would assist him. We made up as fast as we could; I saw 3 women; I catched hold of one of them: the woman that is dead was sitting at a door. She said, I am robbed of my cloak, and ill used: she could hardly speak. She described her cloak by a great pin on the back of it, under the cape, and one black string: I found such a one upon Jacobs. I put it on the woman's shoulders, and took the 2 prisoners to the watch-house. Jacobs said Mason took the cloak off the poor woman, and put it on her, that is, Jacob's shoulders. No, said Mason, you took it, and was stripping the woman of her apron. Then said Jacobs, I'll blow you.</p>

On Saturday the 29th of March, the prisoner was standing at our shew-glasses, about dusk: he came in, and desired me to take out a pair of silver shoe-buckles. While I was weighing them, he put a pair unperceived into his pocket. By the price he bid, I found he had no intention to buy. My partner came in, and then we missed a large pair of silver buckles, which we had weighed a little before for a customer. He ran one way, and I another: I light of the prisoner in Fenchurch-street. I took him by the collar, and said he must come back along with me. He began to struggle with me; I got assistance, and got him into my shop, and sent for a constable. Before the constable came, I desired to know what he had in his pocket: he pulled out our pair, with 2 other pairs not ours. The constable came and searched him, and found 4 silk handkerchiefs concealed in his waistcoat, all of a piece, and a pair of worsted stockings on the other side. He was taken to the Compter. I advertised the things; no body has claimed them. (The buckles produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I brought the handkerchiefs from Holland. I went into this shop, and asked the price of a pair of buckles; he asked 5 s. an ounce for them. I pulled out a pair of buckles from my pocket, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090014"/> told him I bought them cheaper than that. We could not agree. I put my buckles by my side, and mixed his among them. I went after that into another silversmith's shop and knew I had but 2 pair about me; and when I came to pull them out, I found 3 pair. I wanted to go to the gentleman's house, to deliver them back, and I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did he produced any buckles to you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he did not.</p>

Mrs. King said, there is the thief, I deliver him into your hands. Borne owned to me he had stole the tobacco; some was in a sack and some loose; he said he got into the shop of Mrs. King, under pretence of buying a pennyworth of tobacco, and saw the parcel in a sack, and he took it away, and that there were two of his companions on each side the door watching; he said he had sold it to Brown.

             came to me on the 31st of March, betwixt 10 and 11, and asked me if I would buy a watch; he produced this, (a silver watch produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) He asked me two guineas for it: I said how came you by it; he said his wife has had it in her custody this half year for money. I knew neither he nor his wife, as he called her, (which is the other prisoner) were worth a farthing; I said I must stop it and you too; I said, who had you the watch of; he said the woman was over the way, waiting for him to bring the money. I sent a messenger over to her, to tell her the watch was sold, and for her to come to have a glass of wine out of the bargain; the woman came, then I stopped her also. I carried them to the Tower goal, from thence to the bench of Justices in the morning; the prosecutor came and swore to his watch, and they were both committed. The prosecutor told me the marks of the watch before he saw it.</p>

My wife sent for a constable: I looked and missed a silver watch, a stock-buckle and knee-buckle from the inside of the window; there were found two shoes in Merchant's pockets.

I went with the officer by Jones's direction where the stock-buckle was pawned, (produced, with another of the same pattern to compare) this I verily believe to be my property.

             brought this parcel to me on the 1st of March, betwixt 10 and 11 o'clock, and desired he might leave it, and said he would fetch it in 10 minutes, for his waggon was gone before, and he should have anger if he did not take care of it; the other prisoner was with him; they were not in their soldiers cloaths, they were both dressed like countrymen. When they had been gone about half an hour, I began to be very uneasy; I found the direction was torn off, and the bottom of the letters left upon the paper: I saw they had opened a corner, to see what was in it. I sent for a neighbour, and told him of it. He said, Don't trouble yourself with it, you may have a great deal of trouble. Soon after Lamball came in, and asked for it. I said I would not part with it, till I had been before a justice of the peace. I went to secure my tankard, and How said to Lamball, Go and fetch the man that gave it you: he went out. Then I said to How, Don't you think this is stolen, by the direction being taken off? Said he, I know nothing of it. I said to him, Pray where does your waggon stand? He said, At Temple-bar. I said, You mean Holborn-bars. He said, Yes, I do. Then he said, Madam, do not part with it: for, depend upon it, it is stolen; and away he went. I went out to see for him, and they were both standing together in the middle of the road. I found afterwards, they had used to load this waggon.

            . I was concerned with the 2 prisoners at the bar, in robbing this gentleman's yard; it was in the night; I cannot tell the exact time. I and Braine were on the outside of the gate, and Haines got within side, and he put us about 300 weight of tobacco under the gates. We carried it to Rosemary-lane in bags, and sold it to a tobacconist, named Cosgrove. I was taken up first, in Houndsditch, as I was going to Haines's house, for stealing a quantity of linen; and I made a discovery of this. As soon as I got into Clerkenwell-bridewell, I sent for Mr. Clay and told him of it.</p>

On the 6th of March the prisoner came to my shop to buy something; I was serving a customer: she came to a box of ribbons: my servant, that was on the other side the counter, came and told me he saw her take two pieces of ribbon out; upon that I believe she suspected he had seen her; she took one piece from under her cloak and laid it down. I took her up stairs, my people all knew her, she had been frequently at my shop for 12 months, almost once a week; I said, I suppose you have robbed me many a time: no, said she, I never did but once before. I charged her with taking a piece; she produced it from out of her pocket, there is 11 yards of it. She went on her knees and begged I would not prosecute her, and in the mean time she put another piece of ribbon, which she had from some other person, under a chair; I did not find that till a day or two after, it had not our mark upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I am a file-cutter; I never knew her bear any bad character in my life; I took my mother home, and hired the prisoner to be my servant; I used to trust her to go to all my customers, sometimes she has brought me three or four guineas at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she servant to you?</p>
               <p>Wilson. She was six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she been since she left you? I see she has a child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Wilson. Ever since my mother died I have lived with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Wilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not marry her, as her character is so good?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was not in my power then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had a great many debts to pay away on my mother's affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it is better to live in that wicked slate, than to live in a marriage slate?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot expect protection from God's providence if you live in such an unlawful manner; this is as much forbid in the word of God as robbery or murder: how can you expect prosperity in living in this way? The best thing you can do is to go and marry her the moment the trial is over. It is very melancholy to see people no way thoughtful in distinguishing virtue from vice; you cannot expect the jury will give credit to one word you say.</p>

               <p>Sanderson. It was a grey gelding, with a bald face, the letter S in pitch on him in four places, a switch tail, and all white legs. Mr. Bolton's man, the Peterborough carner, brought him down from London, I think on the 6th of March.</p>

            . I live within four miles of Oxford, I keep a little farm and deal in horse: on the 19th or 20th of December I was in Smithfield; the prisoner shewed me a grey colt, a gelding with a bald face, a long tail, and four white legs, come three years old; he saw a black gelding of mine in the George-yard; he said he had got a pretty colt at home, he should be glad to change with me, and asked me where I lay at night; I said at the Pied-Bull at Islington; he agreed to come to me at nine in the morning: when he saw mine out he liked him very well; I agreed to go with him to Hockley in the Hole to see his, he asked me nine guineas for him; there was a man with him who said, you shall go into the house and have a pot of beer and make a bargain; in drinking, he asked two guineas and a half betwixt the horse and colt; a man along with me said, you shall give him a guinea to boot: I said I would, and no more. We were going away; he called to me and said, you shall give me half a guinea more. I said I would not: then it was agreed that I should spend a shilling. We went to Islington for the horse; he said he went down within about four miles of Oundle in Northamptonshire, and bought three or four more colts. I said, I wonder Mr. Pepper you should buy such young things as these to bring to London; he said he did not know what would suit London. After this I changed the grey colt away to one

I said, Mr. Pepper, I find this colt is a stolen one: he said, what have you to do with me: I said it is pity I should lose all my money; said he, you have no demand on me; I said, I hope you will not let me lose the money: he said he bought the colt at Higham Ferrers fair, and that he was very sorry that he, being so very lately in trouble, should be in trouble again: he gave me a guinea and a watch.

I said I should take no bail: said he, I can't say I like to go before Sir John, for I have heard he is an ill-natured man; he chose to go before Mr. Welch. I got him into a coach, and ordered the coach to drive to Sir John's; when we came there, he knew Sir John better than I did. Sir John asked Watkins where the colt was; Watkins said he is down in Buckinghamshire, within a little of Stoney Stratford, at one farmer Rand's, at Wolverton, and he knew it to be the same colt. Sir John said, I'll take care of Mr. Pepper, while you go and return again. We went down to Mr. Rand's for the colt, and Mr. Rand allowed it was the same colt he had of Mr. Watkins; Mr. Watkins gave him five guineas back, so we brought the colt to London, and delivered him at the Horseshoe inn, in order to be sent down to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am a grocer in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square: I have known Mr. Pepper between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I never heard any otherwise but that he is a very honest just man; he delivered the horse. He came to my house and brought three gentlemen with him, I believe they were horse-dealers, Mr. Watkins was one of them and Mr. King another; there was a great dispute about paying for this grey colt that had been chop'd between them, their demands were 6 l. I was to pay them 6 l. and there was to be no farther demand upon Mr. Pepper; they were all seemingly contented; after they had the money the case was altered; Mr. King said it was not 20 guineas would satisfy him, he pulled out a warrant, and insisted upon Mr. Pepper's going along with him, they went away to Justice Fielding's. I always looked upon Mr. Pepper to be a very honest man; I never heard of any imputation to the contrary before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. What no sort of imputation at all?</p>
               <p>Cooper. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you never heard any ill as to his character before this?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I am sure I never did.</p>

I looked back and said, I don't know that I have: she said, you have dropt some gold. I knew I had gold in two papers in my pocket. She said, don't hurry yourself, but look in your pocket, and see what you have dropt: I like a silly woman took my apron up, and pulled out my halfpence and silver, and the paper that I lost, with the gold in it; I said I had lost nothing, and put them in my pocket, though I have both taken and paid money. Said she, the gentleman in the shop took up a little box with a Queen Anne's half crown, a silver thimble, and a four and sixpenny piece of gold. I said it was not mine, and I thank you for calling after me: as I turned myself away to go to the Swan and Two Necks in St. John's-street, she said, O dear, somebody has dawbed your cloak, give me your handkerchief, I'll wipe it off. I said, be so kind as to wipe it off with the corner of my apron, and I'll be obliged to you; a carriage was coming by, she pulled me, and wanted me to come into the alley I (can't say whether it was a cart or a dray) and in the mean time she picked my pocket; for I had not got 20 yards from the place before I missed the paper with the gold in it, that I had just before pulled out; there was 33 l. I could safely swear that, I believe there was more, but I cannot tell till I come home to count up my bills; then I was greatly frighted, and went into a public-house that joins to the alley; I said I had had my pocket picked, and that I was ruined: I was told I might search any body without a constable. I went back to Mrs. Angier's, she sent for a constable; I went into Woolpack-alley to see for the prisoner. When I came back again, I was advised to go to Justice Fielding; I went, he was not at home, then I came back; then a Jew woman,

She left my house that day about a quarter after one in the day; I went down stairs to mind the shop; I had not been there above four minutes before she came again, crying in a very terrible manner, saying, I am ruined! I am ruined! She told me the story she has told now. We went to Justice Fielding's, but he not being at home, we came back again; the constable went to an ale-house in Houndsditch to look for the woman; she was found and brought; the Jew woman said, that was the woman that was wiping Mrs. Peircall's cloak, she being passing by at the time. Mrs. Peircall had offered her a guinea if she could find the woman. Mrs. Piercall said, she could swear she was the very woman. The prisoner had a bundle of cloaths in her hand. After Mr. Garrick had handcuffed her, he searched her pockets, and took out 21 guineas, one half guinea, a 36 s. piece, and 3 five and three-penny pieces; then we called a coach and took her to the Compter; she did not chuse to walk, so was carried in and out of the coach. When she got to the Poultry Compter she called for Mr. Ross, one of the turnkeys, and other people, as though it was her real habitation. The next day we took her before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090030"/> my Lord Mayor, there we related the same as now. My Lord asked her what she had got to say: she said her business was in selling cloaths, and could not do without large sums of money. She was asked how she came by the money found upon her; she could give no account. When the Jew was searching her, she said she had about 500 l. in Bank notes in her pocket. As we were in the coach going along, she mentioned borrowing the money at the corner of some street; she said she was as innocent as Adam; then the Jew woman said, you are Eve.</p>

            . This day se'nnight I was going to my brother in Woolpack-alley; to cut the way short, I went through Still-alley; the alley is very narrow, there is an iron bar to stop horses from going through. I saw a man go through sideways, I being pretty bulky could not get through by the prisoner; I stood still some time behind her, she was wiping the prosecutrix on her shoulder with her apron: I said, pray let me pass. The prisoner turned herself aside, and said, yes, I ask pardon for detaining you so long; then I past by. About an hour after I went to look for my husband in Houndsditch, they said a woman had lost her money. I went to see what it was, and saw the gentlewoman standing with several people round her. I said, Madam, where did you lose your money? She said at the corner of Still-alley. I said, I was passing by at the same time, I saw a woman wiping your cloak. Pray, said she, can you tell me any thing about this woman. I said, I have seen her pass and repass several times; if I meet her, pray may I have her stopped? She said pray do, and bring her to this gentlewoman's, meaning Mrs. Angier's, and I'll answer for you. I met Markas Garrick and told him of it; he happened to meet with her, and I was called to see her; I am certain the prisoner is the same woman that I saw wiping the cloak, but did not see her take any thing.</p>

               <p>Markas Garrick. On Friday last I came through Houndsditch about 5 in the afternoon; I met an acquaintance of mine, who told me a woman was robbed of 30 odd guineas: the prisoner was described to me as the person that robbed her. After that, going through Woolpack-alley, I met the prisoner; I asked her if she was not in Houndsditch that day; she said no: I said, a woman had been robbed of some money, and she was looked upon as the person that robbed her. She said she knew nothing of it. I took her to Mrs. Angier's, the prosecutrix said that was the very woman that wiped her cloak. I searched the prisoner, and took out of her pocket 17 guineas, 7 half guineas, 3 five and threepenny pieces, a 36 s. piece, and 3 s. 6 d. in silver. I brought her to the Poultry Compter, and the next morning before my Lord Mayor, and he committed her. The money was all loose in her pocket; I delivered it to Mr. Ford in this place yesterday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford produced the money, and deposed it was the same identical money be received of the last evidence.</p>
               <p>S. Angier. Here is a piece of whity brown paper which was found upon my counter after the prisoner was searched, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I think this is the same paper that my money was in when it was taken from me.</p>
               <p>S. Angier. Mr. Garrick told us, the prisoner had offered him five guineas when he took her up if he would let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. to Garrick. Do you remember her offering you any money?</p>
               <p>Garrick. I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Mr. Garrick told me the same as Mrs. Angier has mentioned, and that he said he would not touch it if she had offered him the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrick challenged me with this thing: I asked him what he meant by it; he said, come with me over the way; I said, with all my heart: he said, have you any money about you; I said I have; he took me to the gentlewoman's house and handcuffed me; he asked me where I had the money; I said, don't you know me; he said, yes, I do; he put me in a coach and drove me to the Compter, it is my own money. Here is a baker, a stranger to me, sent to me; I believe he knows more about it than any body here.</p>

Then I said, We will have it. Dyal was not come from him; we went back; the prosecutor fell down again; I did not see any body knock him down; I went to help lift him up, and fell over him, and in the mean time Harris took his watch. Then we went, and left him upon the ground; I know nothing of the half-guinea; if they took it, they never told me of it: then we went for Turnmill-street, and Dyal took a breast of mutton.

               <p>On December the 20th, I and my brother bought these 2 mares of a man that said he came from Brentwood; we agreed to give him 8 l. f or one, and 6 l. for the other: we went to Birmingham, to see an acquaintance, and got there December 23; then we set off to come to London again: I went on to Cuttle-mill, thinking my brother would come to me; there came in 6 or 7 men, and put a pair of hand-cuffs on me, and brought me to Coventry; and all the way stopped at all the alehouses, and made me fuddled, and wanted me to confess: they said, if I would confess that I was the man that stopped 'squire Digby, I should have my hand-cuffs taken off. They took me before Alderman Hewitt; he saw I was very much in liquor; he showed me a piece of paper, and said it was what my brother had said; he ordered me a pot of beer; they kept me there all the afternoon; they asked me to confess, and said the Alderman would let me free by confessing; so I being much in liquor, confessed the first thing that came into my head; the Alderman wrote it down on a piece of paper, and I signed it, in order to get my liberty. I have got a receipt here of the man's that I paid for the mares: I am a milkman by trade.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alderman Hewitt. King came to me, and said there was a person offering a mare to sell, which he thought was worth 20 l. for 5 guineas, and he thought he did not come honestly by her. I desired the man might be brought before me. He was brought; it was the prisoner; I examined him how he came by the mare. He said he bought her in Smithfield. I ordered him to be searched: they found upon him a loaded pistol and a pocket-book, containing some notes; upon which I committed him that night upon suspicion, for farther examination. The next morning an account was brought me of Mr. Digby's being stopped; and the person that stopped him being described, gave me some reason to think this was the man. I sent for a constable, in order that he should be brought again for examination. The goaler himself came to me, and said the prisoner desired to be brought to me again, that he had something to say. He was brought; I examined him; he asked me some questions, to know, if he should make any discovery of his accomplices, whether he could have favour showed him. I told him, with respect to that, I could say nothing to it; if he had any thing to say, I was ready to take an account of it: but what use could be made of it I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hewitt. He was perfectly sober; he told me his brother was at Cuttle-mill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hopes at all of being made an evidence?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hewitt. At that time I did not. He was brought before me again: then I went upon a fresh examination; he then charged one Stedman as being concerned with him in cutting off the teats of cows. I sent this information to Sir

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I used to buy and sell horses. On Friday the 20th of December, my brother and I bought these 2 mares of a country-like man; he said he came from Brentwood; we gave him 6 l. for one,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090034"/> and 3 l. for the other: I have bought many horses in Smithfield-market. After I bought him, I went home to my father's house, and laid the receipts by, and could not tell Mr. Alderman Hewitt what I had done with them; I have had them brought to me; they are here: I never was in my father's house after the day we bought the mares.</p>

About 5 weeks ago, I missed 8 guineas out of my bureau in my chamber, and the linen mentioned out of a great chest; I always had the key of the room in my pocket. I told the prisoner of it; she said, how could I suspect her, when I always had the key. I said the money and things were gone, and no body goes there but she and I. After breakfast she came running up to me (this was about the 12th of March) she went down on her knees, and said, Madam, if you'll promise to forgive me, I'll confess; saying, I stole the linen, and sold it to a Jew. I said, Have you any body concerned with you? She said, Yes, madam; I'll tell you, if you'll promise not to hurt them. Then she said she burnt my bank-note I lost some time ago. I said, What made you burn it? She answered, the d - l appeared to her over her shoulder. She confessed to the taking all my things mentioned in the indictment, but owned to taking but 50 guineas; and that she opened my bureau with false keys, and had thrown the keys down under some lighters, at the end of the street. I asked her why she did so; she said the d - l appeared to her; she said she would send for the man where she bought the keys; he was sent for: she said the same before him: I never found none of my things again.</p>

               <p>Passingham. I came home next July will be 6 years. The prisoner complained she had pawned all her cloaths, and was like to lose them; I had but 4 guineas in the house; I let her have 40 shillings of it; she went and fetched some few things out; I had agreed to go abroad again, and take her along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a wife?</p>
               <p>Passingham. I have; she washed for several people, most of the gentlemen belonging to the navy; and the prisoner was a weekly servant there, and washed for my wife; we lived at Hallifax. I sold several of my things, and let the prisoner have 3 l. more, to go and fetch the rest of her things: she went, and I heard no more of her till the Sunday morning; then I had 2 letters; I could make neither head nor tail of them, only her name and Wood-street Compter. I think the Monday after she came again, and said she had been arrested, and put in goal; she staid at my house; I was at work in Admiral Holbourn's garden, and when I came home she was gone. When she came to us in America, she came big with child; that child I have brought up and kept ever since: she said her husband was drowned. I asked that girl where the prisoner was; she said she was gone to the doctor's for my wife, who was ill: my wife said she had not seen her all the day. I wanted something out of the chest; my wife went to give me the key out of her pocket, under her head; we could not find it: I went down stairs, and found the key lying under the prisoner's old gown; I went to the chest, and missed 6 guineas and 2 half-guineas; I went to the Compter, there was the prisoner: she was searched, and my wife's silver shoe buckles and silk shoes were found upon her, and 3 s. 6 d. in money. She took away every penny I had in the world, but 2 or 3 shillings.</p>

            . I was sent for last Thursday morning to take charge of the prisoner, for stealing 7 guineas from the prosecutor. I asked her what she had done with the money; she said she had made away with some, in getting her things out of pawn, and that she had the rest in a leather bag when she came to the Compter, but did not know what was become of it. I searched her, and found 3 s. 6 d. upon her; she owned the shoes did belong to the prosecutor's wife: and when the women searched her, and the buckles were found, she said they belonged to the prosecutor's wife also: when she was before the Alderman, she said the things and money too were the prosecutor's property.</p>

We stripped him naked, and washed him at the pump; then he was locked up in a cold ward for 3 hours, quite naked, because his cloaths were all wet, not fit to be put on; when the sun shone I let him out, and he sat down on the threshold, and was brought soon to be right. The night before he died, the prisoner beat him with a bunch of keys: he was taken sick about 3 days before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he really dumb?</p>
               <p>More. We could get nothing out of him; he could say, Tottey Mom, Tottey Mom Wansey, that was all: if any body gave him a piece of bread, he would sing and dance for an hour together.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>More. He died last Monday night was se'nnight; I was with him; he lay on his face and died; he eat his allowance on the Friday before, and almost his allowance on the Saturday. He was beat with a bull's pizzle once, about a fortnight before he died, by the prisoner; he used to befoul himself so, that we had no rest in the ward; every body wondered how we could live there, the ward was in such a condition.</p>

            . I was committed to Tothil-fields-bridewell for begging; I never saw the prisoner strike the deceased, or use him worse than the rest of the prisoners, while I was there; the prisoner was foolish; the deceased had his allowance the same as the rest had; there was a tub in the place to do our occasions in, but the deceased had not sense to make use of it. We desired Mr. Stevens to take him out of the place, but he would not; he was very bad on a Sunday night, and on the Monday night he died.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Sutherland. That I cannot tell; he had a violent purging upon him, and the weather was very cold.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him to be such a fool, as not to know how to discharge nature?</p>
               <p>Sutherland. It seemed so to me, because we had a tub to go to, and he would not use it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to be such a fool, as not to know where to go on that account?</p>

            . I was a prisoner in Tothil-fields-bridewell; when I came in the prisoner had nothing but a shirt on, neither shoes or other cloathing; I saw the prisoner strike the deceased with a bunch of keys on the Sunday night, the day before he died; it was only one blow upon the back. I begged of the prisoner to put me into another ward, because the deceased smelt so; he used to foul himself; the prisoner said, he wished he was dead and gone; when he sat in the kitchen, his ordure would run from him: he once flung a bone over the wall, into the garden, and the prisoner beat him for everlasting.</p>
               <p>Darby Matthews. I am going on 15 years of age: the deceased was brought into Bridewell about 10 at night, about 7 weeks ago; he grew very dry in the night, and called out for a pot of water, and made a noise; the prisoner opened the chamber-window, and said, You rascal, hold your tongue; he was still a little while, then he called out again; then Mr. Stevens said he thought the fellow was mad; he went and locked him into the Black-hole; then the deceased began to make a great noise: Mr. Stevens brought a chain about 3 yards long, and put a bezel round the deceased's leg, and put a pair of hand-cuffs on, and put the chain to his leg; he found he could reach to the side, then he put the chain shorter; but then the deceased halloo'd out, Water: then Mr. Stevens sent down a bull's pizzle, to have him licked by

            , and Cole would not lick him. Then the other keeper begged he might be let out; No, said Mr. Stevens, I will not let him out, my wife shall not be frighted; but, with great persuasion, he let him out. The deceased was so ignorant he used to lie in his own dung, and his breeches all dirty; the rest of the prisoners washed him naked, and they washed his cloaths for him; after that, I saw Mr. Stevens beat him with a cat-o'nine-tails, but there were but 6 tails upon it. I saw Mr. Stevens strike him with a bunch of keys, one blow over his back, the day before he died; the deceased cried out, O dear.</p>

               <p>Matthews. They said it was for stealing a pair of old shoes; but there was no bill found against me, and I am now discharged.</p>

            . I am a seaman; I was in Bridewell for a bastard child; I have been there almost 6 months; the deceased was brave and hearty when he came in: he used to run about the place, and make a great noise like a mad man; he could speak but a few words; Mr. Stevens's wife being big with child, he locked him up in the Blackhole, where he remained 2 days and 2 nights; that is a place they put those in who do not behave well: when he came out he was noisy again; and Mr. Stevens ordered a bezel to be put on his leg, and a small chain put through it, about a foot in length, and he was chained in the Black-hole; when he came out, he was about the yard all day; he had a great purging on him; having neither shoes, nor stockings, or breeches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090038"/> on, his legs were very sore; when he first came into the place, his right leg had one sore on the shin, and the other upon the knee; the other leg seemed to be burnt by setting by the fire, they were both swelled.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bezel upon the wound?</p>
               <p>Cole. No, it was below the wound. After the last confinement he ran about the yard and made a great noise: Mr. Stevens came out and said, you rascal, get down into the ward, or I'll lick you; you frighten my wife. She was big with child. He did not offer to move; Mr. Stevens fetched a bull's pizzle, but I went away and did not see him strike him. He had a cat with six tails, with two knots on each; I once saw him strike him with that, but do not recollect the day. He was very ignorant; he had a violent purging came upon him; on the Sunday he could not eat his allowance; he died the next day as he lay on his face.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I was sent for to view the deceased's body in Bridewell, I found the surgeon of the Westminster hospital there at the request of the prisoner; we found a mortification on the deceased from his toe to his hip, on the left leg, and upon various parts of both legs. I saw nothing of any marks of violence upon the body, neither back nor belly. I inspected the legs to see if there were any marks of irons, which we understood had been put on him; I found no such marks at all; there was no appearance of any injury of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the iron be the cause of the mortification?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; we enquired to know how this mortification arose; we found he was an unruly fellow; they had put breeches on him, and he pulled them off. We looked upon it as he had these sores on his legs before he came in; it was the severity of the weather that brought on the mortification; there was a great inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Harris. Upon my oath I think he died a natural death, so far as it was owing to a mortification.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrys. I examined the deceased's body. I never in all my life saw a body so free from marks of violence in my life; the mortification, no doubt, was the occasion of his death; the blows by no means could not cause it, nor the cat o'nine-tails, nor the putting the iron on. I apprehend the cold weather brought on the mortification.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never injured the deceased in the least, I should be very unhappy in myself if I was conscious that I did.</p>
