                  </hi>. I am the second clerk at the Marylebone police court—I produce six summonses taken out on December 20th and returnable on December 27th against Charles Levy Wolmark, for that he, having the care and management of certain, premises at 177, Portobello Road, Notting Hill, used them for the purposes of betting on November 29th and 30th, and December 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th—on December 27th the prisoner appeared in answer to those summonses—Mr. Curtis Bennett was the sitting Magistrate—the prosecution was conducted by a repre<lb/>sentative of Messrs. Wontner on behalf of the Chief Commissioner of Police—I was the acting clerk, and took down the evidence—Sergeant William Roy lance was the first witness, P.C. James Howes the second, and Inspector Turrell the third—the case for the prosecution being con<lb/>cluded, the defendant tendered himself as a witness on his own behalf—he was represented by a solicitor—he was sworn, and I took down his evidence (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I live at 138, Walmer Road. I manage 177, Porto<lb/>bello Road, for my brother, Caesar Wolmark. We have been in business there 18 months. Up to November 23rd I took money on commission of 5 per cent, for a man who is a bookmaker. I am not a bookmaker. Since November 23rd I haven't done anything. Since the flat racing season my governor, having lost heavily on it, determined to give it up. It ended on November 23rd. On none of the days referred to by the officers did I receive slips of paper of any sort; that is, November 29th and 30th and December 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th. I haven't taken any money since November 23rd. The man for whom I acted on commission was Arthur Hewison, 213, Westbourne Grove. He is the only man I have done com<lb/>mission or made bets for. I never took a slip relating to betting in the shop either before or after November 23rd. I took them in the street in the Portobello Road, and from one or two tradesmen on whom I used to call. In taking them I walked past my shop. I did not know my premises were being watched. A genuine business is done in the shop. As a rule, a purchase taken at a jeweller's takes some time, five or ten minutes. I have done no betting at all since November 23rd. I can't say who was the man who the police say took slips outside my shop on December 6th. Nothing of the kind was carried on outside or inside the premises. I did not tell the Inspector I managed the shop for my brother Mark. I said I managed it for my brother Caesar and lived with my brother Mark. I swear I mentioned my brother Caesar's name. Mybrother Caesar is the owner of the shop. He pays me 25s. weekly for managing it. Every word the constables have stated is false. <hi rend="italic">Per Court.</hi> I began managing the shop for my brother Caesar about 14 months ago. I have been always there for the last three years. During the last 14 months I have been there every day. While working for the bookmaker I was out daily from 12.30 to 2 p.m. That ceased on November 23rd. Since November 23rd,</p>

               <p>from 9 a.m. till 9.45 or 10 p.m., I have been in the shop, except when I went to dinner or to the City. I produce invoices showing that on December 2nd I went to the City, also on November 29th. I can't exactly say at what hour. It was the afternoon, before dinner. I swear I said my brother Cesar, not Mark, was the owner. He asked who I worked for. I said my brother Caesar, and that I lived with my brother Mark. I swear 13 men did not come into the shop that day, simply no one but a customer, perhaps, who wanted to buy something"—a witness named David Jacobson was called on his behalf—the prisoner was fined on the summonses—the total amount was between £50 and £60.</p>

"Wolmark"—he said, "I cannot account for that at all, I do not know"—I was not present when the summonses were served—I was present at the hearing on December 27th and gave my evidence—I heard the prisoner examined upon his oath—on December 18th, when I went to the shop, the prisoner did not make any statement about his brother Caesar being the owner of the premises or carrying on business there—he made no reference to Caesar at all.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was unable to call, but had discounted the bill for</hi>£30 10s. <hi rend="italic">to a gentleman in Queen's Road, Peckham, who would probably call next week, and had left the agreement and landlord's consent with the bill</hi>)—the gentleman from Peckham called on February 18th, when the bill was due—he turned out to be John Davies—he asked me if I was prepared to settle the bill—I told him I wanted to see David Davies first, as I was not satisfied with the business—I said, "You must know where David Davies is, you are his brother," and he said "No," and that he believed he was in the country; he had not seen him since he gave him £25 for the bill—he went away, and soon after I was served with a summons to attend at the Westminster County Court on April 11th—I instructed my solicitor, Mr. Morley, to defend—John Davies gave evidence, and was asked if he knew where his brother David was, and he replied that he had not seen him for five weeks, and that he was in Northampton—judgment was given against me, and I paid.</p>

I am employed by William Donaldson, a master carman, of Crutched Friars—I am in custody on another charge—on February 5th, I was driving a van of Mr. Donaldson's along Great Prescott Street, containing eleven chests and four half chests of tea—in Mansell Street, in consequence of a woman speaking to me, I examined my van—the tailboard was let down, and a whole case of tea was missing—I ran up Great Prescott Street, and saw a light van draw from a gateway—the prisoner Avey was driving—I pulled the flaps apart and saw my chest of tea—I caught hold of the pony's head—Avey</p>

I am a gatekeeper, employed by the London and North-Western Railway in Mansell Street, at the entrance to the goods station—on February 5th I was on duty at 4.55 p.m., and my attention was drawn to three men sitting in front of a light pony van going down Mansell Street towards Great Prescott Street—there was a stoppage in the traffic, as the road is narrow—Avey was driving; Murray was sitting by his side; and a man not in custody by the side of him, all sitting in front—the van was about 70 yards from Great Prescott Street—Murray and the other man got out opposite my gate, and walked to the corner of Great Prescott Street, and Avey drove the van in the same direction—it stopped a minute or two in Mansell Street before it turned into Great Prescott Street, when I lost sight of them—I went into a little shop and saw Murray coming towards me from Prescott Street—I purchased a pennyworth of tea, and I saw him jump on to Donaldson's van—the horses' heads were towards me, and I saw the name of Donaldson on the front of the van—it was loaded with chests of tea—no one was attending it—Murray turned the horse round and drove towards Chamber Street at a rapid pace—he was about 40 yards from the corner—I had seen Donaldson's van draw up at the corner of Swan Street, and the driver, Keith, jump off his van and go in the opposite direction towards Great Prescott Street—about 10 minutes after that I saw the three men in the light van—I could not leave my post, so I sent for the police immediately and gave them a full description of the men—I saw Keith come back with a chest of tea—on February 10th I was sent for to Leman Street Police Station, and immediately identified Murray from 12 or 13 men, as the man who drove Donaldson's van a different way—on February 13th I identified Avey as the man driving the pony van—I have not the slightest doubt.</p>

I was unable to keep up the payments, and on October 24th the child was returned to me. She first was laid on the couch to sleep; we found the couch became verminous, as also did I and my baby. My husband said she was not to lay there any more, but I was to lay her on the floor, and she has been laying there, and not been dressed since Christmas, or just after Christmas, as she has no stockings, and I have not been able to buy her any"—I said, "What about her thin condition?"—she said, "Well, I have been sending her food in by my husband's little boy, and a fortnight ago the boy told me he had eaten the food himself instead of giving it to the child"—she meant sending the food in from the kitchen where they lived—the male prisoner came in then—he was very well dressed in working clothes—I said to him, "What do you say about the condition of this child?"—he said, "Well you know, I did not know anything about this child's existence when I married, so you</p>

Meyers' premises last night"—I said, "Be careful what you say, as what you say I shall take down in writing, and it will be used in evidence against you"—he then made this statement, which I wrote down, and read over to him; he put his mark to it, and I witnessed it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"I have been in the employ of Messrs. Meyers &amp; Co., horse hair manufacturers, 752, High Road, Tottenham, for the past eighteen months, and on Friday last (the 14th inst.) I was discharged without a moment's notice. I was employed as a hair-drawer. I after<lb/>wards tried to get work elsewhere, and was unable to do so, and on Saturday night, the 15th inst., I took it into my head to set light to the premises. I went to an oil shop in High Cross, Tottenham, and purchased a pint of paraffin oil; this was about 9.30 p.m. I then went to Messrs. Meyers premises. I gained access from Paxton Road to the premises. I was unable to enter the workshop, and I spilt the oil underneath the door, and then set light to it. I then went to a lodging house, off White Hart Lane, and slept there for the night. I have been treated badly, and have done it out of spite."</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">F.R.C.S.</hi> I reside at 13, Wimpole Street—I examined the deceased's body on March 5th—a post-mortem had already been made—the body was that of a well-nourished, muscular woman, not very stout, but healthy—there was no disease of the internal organs—the lungs were extended and congested—that would be from the mode of dying—they were gorged with blood—there was an injury to the left side of the lower jaw—the first part was simply an abrasion on the lower margin of the jaw—it was seven-eighths of an inch long, and continuous with it was a lacerated wound, half an inch long, which went through the lip into the mouth at a higher level, and it was slightly curved—the jaw was not broken and the teeth were not loosened—I found that the blood vessels of the brain and the brain substance were healthy—there had been marked hemorrhage into the cavities of the brain, and on the surface and under<lb/>neath the brain—the hemorrhage was from hundreds of thousands of small vessels—it was a swamp, the patient would become immediately unconscious, and probably be dead in two or three minutes—I believe the wound on the jaw was due to some blunt substance striking the jaw in an oblique direction—in my opinion, the body was flat on its back when that injury was caused—I have no doubt that the laceration of the vessels in the brain was due to the impact of the head with great fore against the floor—there was blood smeared on the floor in the middle, where the back of the head would lie—the patch was 11 inches across, and about 11 inches from the fender, which had a sharpish edge, and very sharp at the angle—the corners projected from the margin of the fender, and were quite sharp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the blow was delivered whilst the woman was on the floor—the wound was not directly opposite the jaw, and it was in a slanting direction—if a man got a black eye or was hit with a hammer, I could not say if he was sitting in a chair or standing up—I have never seen a wound like this which could be caused in any position except in a flat one.</p>

I live at Oldfield House, Acton Vale, and am the owner of a shop at 5, Beaconsfield Road, Kensington—in January those premises were empty—they were fitted up as a coffee shop—David Davies called upon me the day after I advertised them, and I agreed to let them if his references were satisfactory—I think the previous tenant used them as a coffee shop, or restaurant—they had been empty about six months—one of the references was Mr. Thomas, Strasleigh, St. Kildare Road, Harrow; and one, Mr. Jones, Harlesden—David said he was a tenant of Mr. Thomas, 27, Cloth Fair, Smithfield—I wrote to both and got answers, but Mr. Jones' answer I cannot find—they were both satisfactory, or I should not have let the shop—I got the cote produced from David Davies—on February 8th this agreement was executed at my house—I executed a counterpart of it, which David took away—the rent was £65 a year, payable monthly, on a three years agreement—at the end of the first month David called on me, and said he was unable to open the place, and I waived the month's rent, and charged him a week's rent, for which I gave him a receipt, dated March 13th—the next month's rent was paid, but none after that—I called at the premises, and found nobody there—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190203100041"/>
               <p>afterwards I found Mr. Hill in possession—I cannot say the date—I wrote numerous letters to David Davies, at Cloth Fair, but got no reply—I believe my clerk called there—I could not trace David, and I forcibly took possession—the rent due was not paid, three or four months, I think—I could not get it from the tenant who took the premises from David, because he was not my tenant.</p>

I keep the shop 27, Cloth Fair, which I took on January 14th, 1901, from David Davies—this is the agreement (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he told me he was a farmer living in Northamptonshire, and the shop was doing about £17 a week, and that he used to charge 6d. for dinner, but I found it was 4d., and that the takings on the average were about £12 a week—I paid £85 for the business—I am there still, and have managed to work up a better business—I paid the rent every month to David Davies—he asked me to allow him to have letters addressed there, and he had three or four, and sometimes more, a week—that lasted till last October—I did not know his real address at the time—I never knew Robert Davies.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190203100042"/>
               <p>I got a letter from David Davies, but it is in Robert's writing, and dated from 67, Upper Ground Street, Blackfriars—after receiving it, David called upon me, and said that he was looking out for a shop, that he had other coffee shops in the city, one at Upper Ground Street, which he had had for six months, and paid a couple of hundred pounds rent, and another at Cloth Fair, which he had had two or three years, paying £45or £50 rent; he wished to remove to a better locality with his wife and family, and that this place suited him—I asked for references, and he gave me two or three—this is a note I sent him—he told me Charles Thomas was the landlord of some premises he had had for a number of years at Willesden—the references were written to, and I got three replies, one from Charles Thomas, Strasleigh, St. Kildare Road, Harrow; one from R. Davies, 91, Princess Road, Notting Hill; and one from Mr. Jones, of 1, Hosier Lane—in consequence of those, I let the premises to him under the agreement dated June 3rd, at a rental of £55—I had many other people applying for the premises, who offered a premium, but I chose him in consequence of those references, because I thought him a most desirable tenant, and the premium was waived—I afterwards called at the premises and found David Davies there—and a couple of females attending one or two people—he stayed there under three months—after that I found a servant there, or some one he had sub-let it to—in September I accepted another tenant, Mr. Dyer—I saw Dyer pay him some money—I did not see the money counted, but I understood it was £95—Dyer paid the rent then due, and that was the only rent I got up to the time Dyer went in, so that I had no rent from Davies—I do not remember at this moment who actually paid, they were both there, and the money was handled between them—it came out of Dyer's pocket.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the goods were being manufactured at a loss, and had been an absolute failure from the beginning, even with small salaries, and tendering his resignation, and giving two months' notice.</hi>)—I enclosed the notice—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I then received this letter of August 30th: "Dear Morgan, can you make it convenient to come over here for a chat?"—I went and saw them both, but Mr. Barrow had to leave—I then received this letter: "Dear Mr. Morgan. We accept your resignation, and will take up the salary in a week or two. Wo will send you the salary. We are appointing another messenger. <hi rend="largeCaps">C. F.

If you have any belongings, please remove them to-morrow"—I then went to the factory, and removed my belongings, and waited for the expiration of the notice—I was paid my £2 10s. a week for two months—I never got my money back—I wrote, and receiving no answer, I placed the matter in the hands of a solicitor, issued a writ, and got judgment.</p>

               <p>"Way, and Hall, on July 6th—Barrow spoke; they said that they had been in business some time, and were going to make it a limited liability company, and if I would pay £100 I should receive 200 paid-up shares and a seat on the board, that it was a prospering business, and they were paying their way now, and with the capital they should get they should carry on a very large business—Mr. Barrow gave me an introduc<lb/>tion to Mr. Harvey, a solicitor—I paid the £100 and got this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that it was for the preliminary expenses of floating the company.</hi>)—I afterwards went there once or twice, and it was said that the business would begin in about six weeks—I was never shown any books of the projected company—I went to the factory, but saw no books, I saw some stock—the first meeting of the directors was on October 7th; the prospectus was produced; Way and Barrow were there; I pointed out the valuation, £4,500, and they agreed to have it valued, and to make it agree, by arranging some of the shares to the vendor—on that understand<lb/>ing I agreed to go to allotment—neither Way nor Barrow gave me any information how the £4,5000 was arrived at—no books were produced—the allotment took place of 1,500 vendors'shares to various persons—they were given, but to save the trouble of transfer we arranged to issue the shares straight to those persons—I do not know what was done with the remaining 5,000 shares—the public subscription at that time was just £100—some figures were produced at the meeting, but I never got any balance sheet—I think it was at the special meeting of October 25th that I found that no books were being kept; they were not open—I found that the managing directors were drawing £7 a week between them—I was not a managing director.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">E. N. PETERS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) May I enlarge my answer with regard to the interview of July 5th and 6th, I think I said they had a good business and were hoping to pay their way; I do not think anything more was said with regard to the specialities, the Prince Edward sauce and new business, and that by the £50 shares they hoped to have a double interest in the company—I saw no balance sheet or statement of account—at the meeting we enquired if regular books were kept—before I became a director I had read the new Companies Act of 1900—after the company was formed there was a cash book—I saw nothing but this cash book—it was dated about October 25th—looking at it I find the wages for the week ending October 5th, £20 4s. 4d.; 12th, £29 13s.; 19th, £35 10s. 10d.; 26th, £20 5s.; £9 6s. 8d. and £4, totalling £33 11s. 8d.—those are the outgoings for wages during that month—the receipts for sales total £21 5s. 7 1/2 d. up to October 31st—I do not think I saw this book, which purports to be a ledger—the goods purchased are stated here to total up to £73 19s. 10d. from October to November 6th; the latest date, and the only goods which appear in the ledger as purchased during the existence of the limited company—of that there appears to be paid on November 25th £9 13s. 9d. as cash for stores—on November 5th a question arose at the offices, after the meeting, as to raising £49 for stamping the agreement—Darrell told us there was about £5 in the bank, and the rest was agreed to be made up by the directors,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190203100054"/>
               <p>somehow—Way was there—four directors besides Bower and Way subscribed £8 5s. each after some demur, as we thought the vendors ought to have paid all the preliminary expenses—there was a meeting about November 18th, and I remember there was a discussion with regard to the prospectus, which we disapproved of, as misleading—after the meeting I wrote a letter, of which this is a draft, to Barrow and Way (<hi rend="italic">Stating that unless by Saturday, November</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd, satisfactory statements of account were received, the shareholders' attention would be called to the total absence of available funds, the small amount of business, and the heavy liabilities, suggesting the calling of an extraordinary meeting to consider the necessity of immediate liquidation.</hi>)—Mr. Drewitt, another director, acted in conjunction with me—this is the reply of Barrow and Way, in Way's writing, and with both their signatures (<hi rend="italic">Suggesting that as it was impossible the business could be done properly and the company developed in the face of continual expressions of disapproval, that Colonel Peters and Mr. Drewitt should resign.</hi>)—I was not present at the meeting at which my resignation was accepted (<hi rend="italic">The minutes of the meeting of November</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1901, <hi rend="italic">accepting the resignation of these two directors, and that they should be repaid</hi>£8 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was read.</hi>)—the £8 5s. was money that we had advanced—I was not paid—if the company was a success, we were to receive our fees up to the time our services ceased—I never got them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the Royal Engineers about 38 years—Barrow's reports to me were a few days after the first meeting—we expected the company to be formed, but had to wait till it was formed before we could see any books—I advanced £100 towards the expenses of promotion, and I was to have received 200 fully paid up shares, had the company floated, to represent the amount I advanced, and the profit—Barrow was the principal spokesman at the offices—they consisted of a front and back office and a room upstairs—Way and Barrow were together mostly—Barrow said they were doing a good business, and wanted more capital to extend it, and that they were going to turn it into a limited company—Hall said he had invested £500 in the business, that he had been connected with it four or five months, and had taken a factory for them—I agreed to become a director, paid £100 on July 8th, and took this receipt, signed by Way and Barrow—that was for prelim<lb/>inary expenses before the first meeting, on October 4th or 7th—Drewitt and I queried other items besides the £4,500 valuation—I thought the lease of the Holborn premises very cheap—I saw the premises in Blackfriars—the rent was £120 and the option 7,14, and 21 years—I thought that was an advantageous bargain—John Thompson's total valuation was £2,199 10s. 9d.—all the directors were present when the prospectus was discussed, Barrow and Way being invited in after the meeting began—a resolution was passed that there should be an independent valuation and that the vendors' shares should be increased or decreased according to the result of that valuation, and that vendors' shares should be issued for the difference—£,5000 was to be paid in shares—the vendors were called upon to refund, but that was never done—the vendors' shares were not issued—the preliminary prospectus was withdrawn—I would not have become a director and advanced £100 if, instead of £2,190, £5,000 appeared in the prospectus—the capital was not reduced at the Board itself to</p>

               <p>represent the difference between the £5,000 and £2,190—the whole 15,000 shares were already issued to Barrow and Way, or their nominees, and no alteration was made in consequence of that second valuation—the shares were not returned—when I advanced my £100 I believed the business was carried on at a profit, I would not have advanced it if I had not—we afterwards proceeded to issue a prospectus and allot shares—it was represented to us that it was very important to go on with the company as fast as possible, and we thought we had provided for all contingencies by the promise of the vendors to make good the difference—the prospectus was registered at Somerset House—my interview with the defendant at Margate was subsequent to the issue of the shares—we discussed the valuation and the adjustment necessary upon it—I did not know the defendant was subject to a month's notice and a payment of a month in advance for the Holborn premises—Smith, the secretary, kept some books—I spoke to him about them—he said he had not got the figures from Barrow or Way for the amounts—I objected to a whole week's expenses being excluded—books should have been opened immedi<lb/>ately after the formation of the company—there were no regular books—I knew salaries were being paid—I did not hear that 200 travellers had been appointed by Lidiard—I understood there were a small number—I saw five or six girls and women and three or four men in the factory mixing and packing—I did not see the van—that was before the forma<lb/>tion of the company—I was called upon to ratify the engagement of employees, at, I think, the first meeting—I pointed out the large amount of weekly wages, and asked for the cash book—the amount for the week ending October 26th was £33 11s. 8d—Barrow's wages were £4 and Way's £3—Hall said that we should be increasing our business very largely, and then be able to pay our way, and with capital coming in, he hoped to be successful—at the meeting on November 4th the valuation was discussed, but there was no resolution on that, but there was a resolution come to that shares representing the difference between the £2,500 valuation which bad been accepted and the £4,400 should be issued to the vendors—at the meeting of November 18th I drew attention to the valuation of the stock again—by that time we had received an explanation from the auctioneer, Mr. Thompson—I said that the quantities were not given, and we could not tell whether the prices given were of selling or purchasing prices—at my suggestion Hall wrote for an explanation—this is Thompson's reply. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th November</hi> 1900, <hi rend="italic">and stating that he had to consider both sides, the vendors and the directors of the Limited Company, they only having received paper for their consideration; that he reckoned a</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">per cent margin, and the value of the valuation being</hi> 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent., no sensible man could expect it to be made for</hi>£10, <hi rend="italic">but about</hi>£48; <hi rend="italic">that he had spent two evenings at the factory and three hours in the day time, and that a business man would consider the valuation a fair one and would be glad to receive the cheque.</hi>)—I saw a copy of that letter—on November 27th there is a resolution accepting my resignation, and on the 29th Hall was taken into custody, and it was out of our power to do anything with regard to the liquidation—I thought that a high-handed proceeding—the goods were removed—I have not seen Barrow since—at a shareholders' meeting in December Mr. Mountain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190203100056"/>
               <p>made a speech, the tenor of which was that something might be made of the business—they were buying and selling goods—if they sold according to the price list they must have realised a large profit—if the goods were not sold at a net profit the business might be genuine in view of ultimately becoming a paying concern—I consider it proper to convert a business into a company in which the whole of the goods are sold at a net loss if" the establishment charges are too large for the business then carried on, in the hope of doing more business—there are many cases where there might be no business carried on until the public subscribed—we do not know what profits were made anterior to the formation of the company, there were no books, and we accepted the statement of Barrow that they were paying their way and covering expenses—a great many private businesses are turned into public companies and become developed after<lb/>wards—Barrow has absconded—Barrow and Way's word was a factor in the evidence shewing good business—another was the fact that goods were being made and packed—one is not in the habit of thinking everyone a swindler who is engaged in promoting a company—Hall appeared to me to have thorough confidence in the business—he was on nearly all occasions with Way and Barrow when conversations took place—I did not hear him say, "This is a chance of a lifetime," but he was a very sanguine man, and always said it was very good business, and he appeared to have great confidence in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If he had said to the contrary, of course I should not have invested in it, and should not have become a director—Barrow expressed great confidence in it—I depended upon those expressions to a great extent—I saw no books at all till October 25th, 1901, yet there were five filed, and my signature attached to the prospectus of October 18th, 1901—that prospectus contained a statement of the profits of the company and the manufactures are stated to be very large—that I under<lb/>stood from Barrow and Way was perfectly clear, and that the profits were large—they told me what the goods cost, and what they sold for—I took no exception to that statement—it was no part of my duty to enquire, or examine into books, before the company was launched—I did not subscribe to the company—as directors we expected not to see details of the accounts, but some general statement, and I asked for it, when I was informed that no regular books had been kept—I did not ask for bank accounts and for auditors' certificates, nor for verification of the accounts of the business, which was to be converted into a company, by an accountant of repute—I was impressed by the fact that there were a number of employees at the factory—if I had known that those employees had been obtained by reason of a premium obtained from them, that would have put a very different complexion on the matter—if I had known that the banking accounts of Barrow &amp; Way had been entirely fed by premiums they had obtained from people, that would have prevented my joining, but you will remember I had subscribed £100.</p>

I am a coal merchant, of Purley Oak, Addiscombe Road, Watford—on October 23rd I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a traveller for a company, at a good salary, commission and expenses, and that the qualification was an investment of £50 in the company's shares, in consequence of which I went to 190, High Holborn,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190203100057"/>
               <p>on that day—I saw Barrow and Way, and enquired the nature of the business, which they told me was a drysalter's; and Barrow, who was the spokesman, told me the names of some of the goods that were being sold, and that the business had been established about a year, and that the limited company had been formed for about a month—I asked to look at the prospectus of the company, which was shewn me, with this valuation—I read it, and noticed that the profits were good—I looked at the list of directors, and was informed that Mr. Joseph Hall, the chairman, had been with W. H. Smith &amp; Sons forty years, and that, in a measure, influenced me; and I thought from the names of the other directors on the prospectus that those gentlemen would be sure to thoroughly in<lb/>vestigate the matter, and see that it was quite right—among them I saw the names of Barrow and Way—I told them I would consider the matter—I believed the prospectus correctly represented the condition of affairs—on October 28th I returned and paid £50 to, I think, Way, in nine £5 notes, and £5 in gold—I started on October 31st as a canvasser and traveller for orders—I was not very successful—on November 22nd I received this letter from the defendants (<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness to become a director, and to invest a further</hi>£50 <hi rend="italic">as a qualification.</hi>)—I called at the office in Holborn next day, and saw Hall, Barrow, and Way—I asked to see the list of shareholders—I was shewn them—then I asked what the remuneration of the directors would be—I was told it would be £100 a. year—I asked how often the meetings of the directors would be held, and was told they would be arranged by the directors themselves—I wrote this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) when I got home the same night, deducting £3 a week for two weeks' salary and 9s. travelling expenses—I arranged in the morning when I saw the directors that I was to qualify as a director, and I sent the cheque by post on Saturday from Watford—it was returned to my bankers paid—I believed the statements made to me, and upon that belief parted with my £46 11s.—between October 28th and November 23rd no statement had been made to me that the prospectus was in any sense unreliable—I was told that two directors had been called upon to resign; I believed that—I was not told that they had resigned because they dis<lb/>covered that there was great discrepancy in the valuation—Barrow told me he could not get on with them, that they were continually writing him letters and asking him a lot of questions, and that be could not agree with them—I quite believed that—if I had been told that at the first meeting of directors, on October 7th, the intention was to withdraw that particular valuation, I would not have had anything to do with it—I continued in the business till about December 6th, the day before I received notice, which was on the Sunday morning—the total orders I got were between £3 and £4.</p>

               <p>Holborn—I saw Barrow and Way—Barrow said they had been in business 30 years and were doing very well out of it, and the thing had got into a large way and grown so much that they were turning it into a limited liability company, that they were making about £30 a week profit, which was about 50 to 70 per cent, on the articles sold, and that they had received orders for £60 worth—Way was present—I believed those statements, and paid first £60, and on September 5th £90, and took this receipt—they offered me the post of manager of the factory or assistant secretary—I selected the position of assistant secretary, and took up my duties on September 16th—I did not see any books—Way started me drafting a prospectus out, supplying me with the materials; to be issued in connection with the formation of the company—I was to receive 50s. a week to commence with, and on becoming foreman of the company, £3 a week—I received 50s. till October 2nd, the date of the registration—Way and I wrote the correspondence—after the formation of the company I became secretary at £2 10s., and prepared to open the books by obtain<lb/>ing, with Mr. Alltree, my assistant, information from Way and two of the clerks, Jackson and Phillips, downstairs, and we commenced writing in the books towards the end of October—I first knew that the prospectus was disputed at the first meeting of the directors towards the end of November—I was present as secretary—I knew of Colonel Peters' com<lb/>plaint, and of his subsequent resignation—I was paid up to the middle of November, but not afterwards, from September 16th to November 16th, two months, at £2 10s. a week—that was all I received of my £150—I gave my services at first—I saw the banking account and endeavoured to make up the books—I told Way that things were not what they were represented to be, and that the business was very poor—he said he was aware they were rather in a poor way, but Mr. Couch, a director, was coming forward to relieve them with about £300—the book was there for Way to see the figures—this is the summary I prepared, showing the outgoings and incomings—the outgoings in October were £148 4s. 2 1/2 d., including wages, and for November £194 13s. 4 1/2 d., making a total of £342 17s. 7d. for the two months—on the other side there is the directors' qualification, including sums of £50 from Mr. Easam, £50 from Mr. Baldwin, and £50 from Mr. Powell, who were employees—Mr. Easam was a traveller—Mr. Powell paid in another £50 in November—that left a deficit of £52 3s. 5 1/2 d.—Wallis, who paid £25, was a traveller—there was a deficit of about £227 for the two months during which the company was in existence.</p>

Downton, 190, Bow Road, for a suit of clothes, pawned on January 6th, 1902, for 10s., in the name of Phillips; the other, No. 2552, pawned with the same pawnbroker on December 10th for 3s.—that one has nothing to do with the case—she took them from behind a picture which was hanging on the kitchen wall—she is 18 years of age—when she gave me the tickets she said, "These are all there are now, I gave the others to a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named George, about 10 of them, you know, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, who you saw me with that night"—she referred to a night some six weeks previously when I had seen her with Biscoe—"He got me to pawn the stuff and asked me to mind the tickets for him I wish I had never seen him now"—I took her to the police station—on the way I saw Police Constable Carpenter with the other prisoner—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> female prisoner said "O God, here is <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, they have soon got him"—in answer to the charge she commenced to make a statement—she said,—"I," and then left off.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">From Mr. Wells, the prisoner's solicitor, dated February</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th, advising the prisoner to give the police particulars of goods he had purchased from Silvester Collins.</hi>)—as soon as I read that letter I said, "Have you any other property here, as I am going to search your place?"—he said, "Yes, I will let you have it" and "I have had no sleep since I have been home, expecting to see some of you gentlemen here every night"—he then went into 15, Mansell Street, his place of business, and produced this clock from the front room, which was not in his occupation—he said, "I got this at the same time from Silvester Collins"—I said, "Whose room is this 1"—he said, "Mrs. Connor's," and after a pause, "I have been advised by my solicitor to say nothing, and he will pull me through"—the room was poorly furnished and the clock was <hi rend="italic">inconsistent</hi> with any of the furniture there—the police have not been able to trace Silvester Collins—there is a large family of Collinses.</p>

Mansell Street, but I am forgetful in locking the door, and I said: 'Until we have a better place it will be best to take them round to your mother's," and we took them there—the clock came from Silvester, and I gave it to Mrs. Connor, who lives in the next room, as I heard the other things were probably stolen—up to then I had no such idea, and I had never known the prisoner's family nor my family do wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> I did not tell the Magistrate that he said that he was paid at intervals by the Great Western Railway, or that I gave him back the scrip, because he might want them before I came back—I was not asked—I am 27 years old—I am not an engineer—I never had anything to do with railways—it did not come into my mind that a man surveying land would not want to pay men—I do not know that the Great Western Railway is the most wealthy Company in Great Britain—I do not think they would send their men out without money—I made no enquiries of him, I trusted him—I thought he was a bosom friend—I did not tell my partner about this because the prisoner told me not to tell anyone—he first told me that he was a surveyor in June, he was going to buy an estate of mine at Whitton—I did not ask him to find a purchaser for it—I did not say that I could not get my money out of the partnership, and that was the reason—he said that he was going to get the money back with his salary—I gave him the money to pay the men—I have never said that I gave it to him because I trusted him as a friend—I thought I had security, and that he was going to do a lot for me—I trusted him as a friend—he went to my wedding, and he paid my fare up for my wedding, and back, and my wife's fare—I have goods belong<lb/>ing to him, and he gave me a blue satin dress, a dress piece, a necklace, two dozen knives a dozen dessert knives, a garden roller, and some choice trees and plants—I had lent him £30, and those things would not amount to that—he paid my fare to Carlisle and back three times, and my wife's sister's fare from Euston—he gave me two bottles of whiskey, and lots of chickens and ducks—I have got two guns of his, a rug, and a fox boa—I did not ask him for a note of hand for any of this money—I got sus<lb/>picious in October or November, and asked him for the money, but the letters came back through the dead letter office—I never said that there was no necessity for any security—I lost sight of him at the end of October, and had to write to him at the Richmond post office, but the letters never reached him—I heard where he was, and got a warrant, and he was arrested at Torquay about three weeks ago—I could not find him between October and February—I did not have the documents in my hand, he was standing by my side, and showed them to me in his hand—I only got a glimpse of them—I saw the figures £3,005—he gave them to me in the envelope, and I put them in the safe.</p>
