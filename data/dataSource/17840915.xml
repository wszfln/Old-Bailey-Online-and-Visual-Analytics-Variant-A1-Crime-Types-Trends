               <p>May it please your Lordships, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury; this is an indictment, in which the prisoner at the bar is charged with the crime of murder; I shall shortly state to you how the matter happened, and what evidence will be produced to affect the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, on the 8th of July last, about two in the morning, a Mr. Linton was met in <placeName id="t17840915-1-crimeloc3">New-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17840915-1-crimeloc3" type="placeName" value="New-street"/>

                        targets="t17840915-1-off1 t17840915-1-crimeloc3"/> by two men, who came up to him and demanded his money; and after he had given them two guineas and a half they left him; they came back and demanded his watch, and some scuffle ensued, and during this time the prisoner at the bar struck a knife into this poor man's side; the man called out to the watchman for assistance, who came up to him, and took him, as you will hear, to a surgeon; and, in short, notwithstanding every means was used, in less than half an hour the poor man died. Gentlemen, as soon as this murder was known at Bow-street, from the circumstances which were recited, and from the general story, the officers of justice had a man of the name of Dixon taken up, and committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell: when this man of the name of Dixon was there, the prisoner

                  Henry

             was observed to come to him, and some suspicions arose in the mind of the keeper, that this man, Morgan, known to be an acquaintance of Dixon's, might likewise be a partaker of the guilt; upon which he desired a prisoner that was there, of the name of Davis, to attend to the conversation that should pass between them; Davis did so, and from that conversation he was soon too well convinced that this prisoner was a perperrator of that fact; and therefore, when he went to go out, the officer immediately stopped him, and said he was his prisoner, and charged him with the murder; he was then taken before a magistrate, and made an ample confession of the whole. Gentlemen, as I never wish in any case, but more especially in a case of blood, to misrepresent facts, or to bias your minds, I will forbear stating that confession, because it is reduced into writing, and it will be produced: if it is taken as I am instructed it was, freely, voluntarily, and under a compunction of mind, you will then be obliged to find the prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any thing particular happening on Thursday the 8th of July? - Yes, I fancy that was the day of the month; Gentlemen, about a quarter before two, to the best of my knowledge, I heard a rattle sprung, I ran to the found of it in order to assist, and as I was running, I heard a person say, stop thief! stop! I saw at the end of Bedfordbury a man cross New-street, I ran and caught hold of the deceased, it was dark, we had no lanthorns allowed us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150004"/> at that time, there had been a shower of rain just before, I caught hold of the man I saw coming across, I saw no other man, and that man turned out to be the deceased; when I caught hold of him, I said, come, I have you; he said, no, watchman, I am robbed, I am stabbed, I am a dead man, do support me! and he put his left arm round my neck across my shoulders, he then pulled up his white waistcoat, to let me see he was stabbed, with his right hand, and there appeared very flush of blood; then another watchman came with three or four persons altogether, and with the assistance of these persons I got him to the corner of Bedfordbury, there I was obliged to let him sit down, he was so far spent with the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he sit down on a bench or any thing? - No, upon the ground; then with further assistance we carried him to Mr. Jarvis's, a surgeon, in May's-buildings; I continued there with him, he died with his head on my breast, and my arm round his shoulder.</p>
               <p>How long was that? - I believe it was half an hour; Mr. Jarvis was called up, he dressed him, but it was without effect.</p>
               <p>On which side was his wound? - On the right side; he spoke at Mr. Jarvis's, and said, O my God! O my wife and children, my wife and children! then he went off: when I first laid hold on him he had a bit of his watch chain wrapped round the fore singer of his right hand.</p>
               <p>Were there any seals to it? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any account of that? - No, I did not think to ask him, I was so confused, and he was so spent; his wound was on his right side, I had my thumb on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. This witness, Mr. Taylor, has not said any thing to affect you at present, do you chuse to ask him any questions? - No, please you my Lord.</p>

               <p>I live in May's-buildings, I am a surgeon; a man of the name of Linton was brought to my house about three-quarters after one, I was awake before, and all of a sudden I heard the cry of murder! I was rather alarmed at first, and I jumped out of bed, and I opened the window, I still heard the cry, and hallooed out to know where the voice was; I dressed myself, and I went down stairs to see where it was, and I heard some people bringing a person along, it was the watchman brought the deceased into my house, I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>In what situation was Mr. Linton? - He was bleeding very much on the right side, I took him into my surgery, I asked him what was the matter, he said do not ask me what is the matter, pray dress my wound; and he then kept working up his shirt in order to shew me the place where the wound was, for the orifice was so exceedingly small, it was hardly perceptible; I asked him to sit down, he said no, do not let me sit down, let me lay on my back, pray let me lay on my back; I said, Sir, pray can you inform me who has hurt you, who has done this business; he replied, do not talk to me, I am dying, do not talk to me, give me something to comfort me.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of this wound? - The consequence was, it was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>How soon did he die afterwards? - In about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you probe the orifice and see the direction how the wound went? - I opened the body afterwards by the direction of the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Which direction did the knife appear to have gone, upwards or downwards? - The knife went in and turned rather upwards, and went right through the liver.</p>
               <p>Court. How deep might the penetration be do you think? - I tried it with a large clasp knife, and I dare say it might go six inches or more.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Would you ask any questions of Mr. Jarvis? - No, please your Lordship, none at all.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner at your prison? - Yes, on Saturday the 10th of July.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he come there? - He came to see Dixon.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I let him in, he went to Dixon, he did not ask for any one, the mother of Dixon followed, and asked me if I had let in Morgan, and she said Mr. Wright, Morgan is come to let my son know who did the murder, then I said to Mr. Davis, says I, Davis, you go in and listen if you can hear any thing, for if I go, they will not speak any thing.</p>
               <p>What was Davis? - He was a prisoner there at that time.</p>
               <p>For what? - He was to give evidence against Nowland, for a forgery on the Bank, Davis went and came to me, and in consequence of what he said to me, I detained Morgan when he came to go away; he said you will let me out Mr. Wright, no says I, I shall keep you, you have either done the murder or know of it.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing particular in your hearing? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>You afterwards attended at the office in Bow-street? - Yes, on the next day, and the prisoner desired us to send for his sister, and she being a very decent body, I said to Mrs. Wright, you had better go up with his sister, he cried, and his sister cried most shockingly, and I said to Davis, you and I will go down: I went on Monday to the public office in Bow-street, there he was examined, and his examination taken in writing by Mr. Bond, before Mr. Justice Gilbert and Mr. Justice Addington; I heard the examination read over, I saw him put his name to it, and saw the Magistrate sign it.</p>
               <p>Did he make that confession voluntarily, or was he threatened or coaxed into it? - Not the least in the world, he signed it on the Monday, I went up with him on the Wednesday again, it was read over to him again, and on Saturday again, and he always said that is the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it on Monday or Sunday I signed that confession? - On Sunday, my master, the Governor, Mr. Smith, took the confession from him in the afternoon, there I saw him sign it, and I signed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150007"/> it; but this I speak of was taken on Monday.</p>

               <p>Court. What are you, Mr. Bond? - Clerk to the Magistrates in Bow-street, I have the minutes which Mr. Wright spoke of before, which Mr. Smith took of his confession, it was read over to him by Mr. Addington, he signed it before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Was there any threat whatever made use of? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise of favour? - Not the least, a free, voluntary act; I read it to him on the Wednesday again by the Magistrate's direction.</p>
               <p>Did you again on another time? - I do not remember reading of it on Saturday, it was read over deliberately before Justice Addington and Justice Gilbert, and he signed it in the presence of the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. What induced you to read it over again to him when he went? - By the direction of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did he make any sort of hesitation at that time to any thing contained in it? - Not the least, he avowed it to be the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Justice Addington say, that if I did not make some confession or other I should be sent to prison, and locked up, and loaded with irons, and nobody should see me; and if I would make any confession I should have every thing done that could be, and should be pardoned?</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. You hear what is said?</p>
               <p>Bond. In the first place I do not recollect one syllable of what he says to be true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Justice Addington took me into a room by himself, and spoke to me, and there he told me, that if I did not make a confession I should go to prison, and have the liberty of seeing nobody, and if I did, I should be pardoned, and nobody should hurt me at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. When was it that you took his confession from those minutes you had from Mr. Smith? - On the Monday morning, I began the examination before the Magistrate came.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you reduced that confession which he afterwards signed into writing before the Justices came? - I had not finished it.</p>
               <p>How much had you done of it? - About three parts through.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner retreat with Mr. Addington before the confession was made? - O dear! he never stirred out of the room till the confession was made.</p>
               <p>Court to Wright. What do you say? - He stood facing the Magistrate while he finished it, then Justices Addington and Gilbert ordered Mr. Bond to read it very distinctly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was on the Saturday, and Mr. Wright did not go with me on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond. On the Monday I speak of The prisoner was up on the Saturday; what passed then I know nov, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was on the Saturday this happened.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Was any thing of this sort suggested by the prisoner on Monday? - Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Sunday I was taken and put into a room by myself, and nobody but one of the keepers with me, and they brought me tea, and they brought me spirits.</p>

             and this examinant then walked up Holborn, along the Queen-streets, and into Covent-garden, it being then between one and two o'clock on Thursday morning; when Dixon said,</p>
               <p>'let us go towards St. Martin's-lane.' That the said Dixon and this examinant accordingly walked New-street, and in King-street, nearly opposite Bedford-street, they observed a man walking alone towards St. Martin's-lane, who appeared rather tall, lusty made, dressed in a dark coloured coat, with his hair tied behind, and a cocked hat, as this examinant believes. That this examinant went up to the said man, swore at him, and demanded his money, at which time the said

               <p>'are you alone?' this examinant replied,</p>
               <p>'no, others are close by.' That the said man then gave this examinant two guineas, one half guinea, and one shilling, and appeared to be disguised with liquor. That the said man then bid this examinant and the said Dixon good night, and walked on; when the said Dixon swore and said to this examinant,</p>
               <p>'he has got a watch, let us go back;' that the said Dixon and this examinant accordingly followed the said man, overtook him near the end of Rose-street, where this examinant went up to him again, and bid him stop; that the said Dixon demanded his watch, at which time the said man had his watch in his hand, and the chain hanging over his fingers; that Dixon laid hold of the said man's hand, in which his watch was, and said, 'give me your watch, or I shall put an end to your life,' and swore many oaths: that the said man kept fast hold of his watch chain, when this examinant took a clasp knife out of his pocket, the blade of which was about six inches long, and which this examinant had opened when he first stopped the said man, with his right hand, and stabbed the said man in his side, and, as he believes, the left side; that the knife remained in the said man's side a short space of time: that this examinant drew out the knife, when the said man exclaimed,</p>
               <p>'O my watch!' That Dixon ran towards Bedfordbury, and this examinant towards Covent-garden, leaving the said man standing. That this examinant threw away the knife opposite the end of James-street. That this examinant went to the Fish alehouse, in Strand-lane, where he had some salop, and remained till about four o'clock, then went into the fields behind Bedford-square, where he remained till about ten o'clock, and then went to Dixon's mother's house aforesaid, where he found the said Dixon upon a bed, with his clothes on. That this examinant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150009"/> asked Dixon to get up, when Dixon replied, that</p>
         
               <p>'he was sleepy' that nothing else passed between the said Dixon and this examinant at this time; two young women being within hearing, That this Examinant left the said Dixon on the bed and returned into the before mentioned fields again, and dined at a public house near them, and after returned into the fields again, where he continued till the evening. The about eight o'clock the same evening as this examinant was going towards Dixon's lodgings, he heard the people in the streets say that Dixon was committed, which prevented this examinant from going there. That a brown waistcoat, which this examinant wore at the time he stabbed the said man, he threw into a vault, at a public house near Primrose-hill, it having some of the man's blood on it. That Dixon was dressed in an olive coloured lappelled coat, with while buttons. That no other person whatsoever was concerned with the said

            . What have you to say in your defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Saturday I was taken up to Bow-street, and Mr. Addington said to me, if you do not tell us now you are the person that has done this robbery, you shall be locked up, and nobody admitted to see you; and if you do, you shall be pardoned, and nobody hurt you; upon that I would not say any thing at all that night; I was sent down, and they gave me some drink on the sunday morning, I was taken and put into a room, and one of the keepers and one person one Steward and they gave me some tea, and there was spirits in it, and he brought me spirits several times; I was in liquor and it is very well known when I was in Clerkenwell that I was desirous and so it is very well known in Newgate. On the Sunday I wanted to see my sister, and they would make me say I was the person; I am as innocent as a child that is just come into the world.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to call? - No, I have no witnesses; I have nobody to come high me at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the confession says, the man had his watch in his hand, with the chain hanging over his fingers, that corresponds with Taylor's evidence, who says, that when he went up to the man, he had part of his chain in his hand; and it is impossible to conceive, or suppose that a Magistrate could act in such a manner as the prisoner represents, and it is certainly incumbent on the prisoner to lay something of the sort before you; his confession therefore seems to me, to come before you perfectly proper; the confession on Sunday before Mrs. Wright, was after this supposed promise and threat on Saturday, and if in full consciousness of what he had done, you believe he made that confesssion to her, that would have been a clear and sufficient testimony to convict him of the murder; but, if what he has suggested at the bar was true, and that it was in consequence of that impression upon his mind, that he was induced to make the confession, that would alter the case, but of that you will judge: The connexion between the prisoner and

             is strongly supported, for you find the prisoner called at Dixon's house to enquire after him, and the day before according to the evidence of the woman, they had been together for three or four hours; it must therefore be submitted to you on this evidence, whether you are satisfied that the confession the prisoner has made, has been free and voluntary, and not extorted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150010"/> from him, if you believe it is, there is no sort of doubt in the world, but you will find him guilty: but to be sure on the other hand, if you think he was entrapped, and ensnared into this confession, it is certainly against the spirit of the law, that it should be taken against him.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury; my duty obliges me to call on you for a few minutes of your attention, in order to open to you one of those cases, that are now become of the last importance: this is an indictment found against the three prisoners at the bar, for rescuing goods by force and violence, and with arms, after they were seized by the revenue officers; Gentlemen, several years ago the legislature found it necessary to enact - That if any number of persons to the number of three or more, armed with fire arms or other offensive weapons, should rescue or take away from any Excise-officer, any goods which had been seized by them, that they should be punished to the last extremity; and it becomes more necessary to advert to this regulation now, than it has ever been: Gentlemen, it would not become me to enlarge on that matter further, and I merely throw out these hints to you, that it is thus necessary for the public officers to bring before you those offenders against the laws, in order, if possible to suppress a practice, which, if not suppressed, will put an end absolutely to the fair trade of this country: In that spirit it is, that this prosecution is brought forward; and Gentlemen, the facts on which this prosecution is founded, and which will be laid before you in evidence, are shortly these: On the 13th of November last, one

            , an Excise-officer with me: they told me that Hutchinson was not at home; I saw a man, and a woman that I thought was his wife; I told the person that I wanted to examine Hutchinson's premises, and I immediately went down Hutchinson's yard, into a small field joining to his house; and in the corner of the field behind a shed, adjoining to Hutchinson's house, where I suspected the goods were, there I perceived a couple of furze bushes, which rather made me suspect the goods were about that place. Before we could get to the place, Hutchinson came into the field, and in rather a violent and hasty manmer, told us we had no business there; Stangroom was stepping forward to the concealment, and Hutchinson laid hold of him, and a scuffle ensued, and I think they were both on the ground together; I immediately interfered, and took hold of Hutchinson, and held him by the collar while Stangroom went to the place were the furze bushes were.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him? - Yes, I told him to be quiet, that I came there to search for some smuggled things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did he know you? - I do not know whether he did; I am pretty sure he knew Stangrove.</p>
               <p>Court. What makes you pretty sure he knew him? - He was the Excise-officer who used to survey Thornham formerly; he is an Excise-officer now.</p>
               <p>That is all your reason for supposing that he knew Stangroom? - Yes. Upon Stangroom's going to the place where I suspected the goods were, during which time they held a pistol, and pulling the furze bushes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150013"/> away, I thought he said, they are here, or something to that purpose: from Hutchinson's behaviour, who rather seemed violent and riotous, I desired Stangroom to go for a constable; he immediately mounted his horse, and rode out of the field into Hutchinson's yard, towards the high road; Hutchinson followed into the road with a large hoe or bill, or something of that kind, he was very violent and passionate, striking his horse with his hand, and told him to get off the premises; indead he drove him off, but he was going off at the same time, and said he would soon have somebody there. Soon after this, I went through Hutchinson's yard into the high road myself, and I saw one Rennett, a Custom-house-officer; I desired Rennet to assist me to open the vault; he came with me into the field, and opened the vault, and Rennett brought up one half anchor of geneva: I then went into the high road a second time, in order to see if Stangroom and the constable were coming; at this time one Brown and Excise-officer came in; on my returning into Hutchinson's yard with Brown, Hutchinson put himself against the gate which shuts from the high road, and with the same thing he had in his hand when Stangroom went out of the yard, he stood and said I should not enter into his premises any more: 
               <persName id="t17840915-2-person105">
                  Brown

             I think took hold of his arm, and the hand that he had up with the hoe, and I rushed out of the gate, and forced myself by. I then went down again into the field with Brown, and desired Brown to go into the vault; Brown went and handed up, I think, about twenty half anchors.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What appearance had those anchors? - They were four gallon casks, with small sling cords round them; they are put round them to convey them on horses backs, as the smugglers convey them. At this time there came into the field about ten men with sticks or bludgeons, or largish sticks in their hands.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean? - They were not walking sticks, they were a kind of a stick or bludgeon: they came into the field and stood at the tubs; I moved myself from the vault towards them; when they came in they said nothing at all at first; I said, my lads, you better let them alone, you will not attempt to take them away I hope.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - They made very little answer; one of them immediately said, come, come, lay hold, and eight of them took two half anchors each of them, and threw them across their shoulders: Brown came out of the vault a little fatigued; I desired Rennet to go in, he went in, and handed out about twenty half anchors, I think. At this time Stangroom was returned, and was standing in the field, very near the half anchors that I had handed from the vault farther from the concealment; at this time a man came up to Stangroom, and said have at them, and with a very large stone or brick immediately knocked Stangroom down; at the same time there was a kind of outcry, rather a confusion in the yard, making use of oaths, and so on; a stone was thrown towards me, but it did not strike me. Stangroom being knocked down,

             the Excise-officer went over the hedge, close to where he stood, and retreated into the field, rather some distance from the concealment; I stood there for four or five minutes; there was a still an outcry of at them, and rather confusion or riot; there were twenty, thirty, or forty of all sorts; there were many inhabitants of the place; there were not a great many in the field at that time: my horse was tied in the field, I mounted and rode into the next field; I came round towards Hutchinson's house by the high road; when I came to that place, Stangroom was there, and bleeding very much from the blow he received; also Rennett stood there, and finding that the smugglers had rather caused confusion, and that the goods were carrying away, I desired Rennett to go down with me a second time into the vault, to bring some of the goods away; I rode on towards Hutchinson's yard, and Rennett followed me, I went to the vault and desired Rennett to take out one of the half anchors, which he did; I took it up with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150014"/> me on horseback, I rode out of Hutchinson's yard into the high road again. Finding that Stangroom was wounded, and that our strength was but little, and that it was getting on towards the evening, and that the smugglers increased, I rode away with she half anchor, and Stangroom with me to a public house in the town; I examined it and found it to be geneva; after that I did not return to Hutchinson's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you know either of the persons that were there, either carrying away the geneva, or armed, or assisting in taking it away? - I know one of the eight, his name was Lewis.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how these men were armed? - I cannot particularly recollect how he was armed, but they were mostly armed with sticks; I cannot pretend to say that every man was.</p>
               <p>Were they any other way armed than with sticks? - I saw no other, the situation I was in at the time the tubs were handing out, did not afford me an opportunity of seeing what I otherwise should have done; I only saw the sticks, and the stone thrown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan, Prisoner Lewis's Council. When was this offence committed? - The 13th of November last.</p>
               <p>At what place? - At Thornham, in Norfolk.</p>
               <p>How many miles distance may it be from this place? - One hundred and twenty miles, I believe; the distance from

             I suppose to be exactly one hundred.</p>
               <p>You knew Lewis before? - I had seen him before, I never had any particular conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Do you reside at Thornham? - No, I live at Lynn.</p>
               <p>Have you been at Thornham since this transaction happened within the space of a month? - I have more than once.</p>
               <p>Did you at either of those times see Lewis there? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry after him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know when he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - I do not recollect exactly the day of the month.</p>
               <p>In what month? - In July I think, I did not make a memorandom of the day he was taken, I think it was the latter end of July, I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have been at Thornham between the committing the offence and the time of Lewis's being taken up? - I think I have been there twice.</p>
               <p>Did you assist in taking him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you come up to town with him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Now give me leave to ask you, if in coming along you did not say something to him to this purpose; that he might make himself easy, for that you could not say any thing to affect him, for he had no weapon? - I do not recollect that I said those words, he was very uneasy coming up to town; I desired him to make himself easy: I do not recollect I told him he had no weapon, nor can I positively swear now that he in particular had a weapon.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him, coming along, that he need not be uneasy, for that you could say nothing to affect him? - I do not recollect I said exactly those words.</p>
               <p>Was it to that purpose; did you assign that as a reason? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that you might have said something of this kind, that you could not say any thing to affect him? - No, I did not say exactly that, because he carried two half anchors; I can say this, that he made use of no bad language, he was not violent, he made use of no threats, he behaved quietly, except carrying away the two half anchors.</p>
               <p>Did not he recommend peace to you and to them, to come to some terms? - Yes, Lewis mentioned, just at the time the half anchors were taken on the men's shoulders, he said will you take a part, and I answered I should not come into that proposal.</p>
               <p>What reason did he assign to you for making<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150015"/> such proposal, was it or was it not for the sake of preserving peace, and preventing mischief? - I do not recollect he said any thing of that kind.</p>

               <p>How did you happen to be in his company? - Mr. Turner and I, in consequence of having an information, went on the 13th of November to Hutchinson's house, after we had been on a survey; Turner was supervisor of that district: I went with him to the house of

            , I at Thornham, about three, on the 13th of November; upon enquiring whether he was at home, we were answered by his wife that he was not at home, another person said he was not at home, and wanted to know our business; we told her we had information of smuggled goods, and in consequence of that wanted to search the premises; she told us we had no business on the premises; immediately Hutchinson came out of his house and swore we should not go upon the premises; Hutchinson laid hold of something, I believe it was a pick bill, such as they pick up stones with, that was immediately dropped, and he came to me as I was going towards the vault, he laid hold of me, I desired him to be quiet; I laid hold of him, and he fell to the ground, I was upon him; I said, Hutchinson, be quiet, get up, and behave well, we are doing nothing more than we are obliged to do.</p>
               <p>Court. Where were you at the time he laid hold of you? - I was in the enclosure, just by the vault; I went to the place, and said, Mr. Turner, this is certainly the place, but we could not open it; after I was disengaged from Hutchinson, he was coming to me again, Turner prevented him; I went and said to Turner, here they are, I have found them; when we were down Hutchinson kept abusing me, swearing he would knock me down.</p>
               <p>How did you get from him so as to get into the vault? - I went round the vault to get a constable and Hutchinson followed me out of the yard with a hoe, he beat my horse with the hoe several times, and said he would send for the smugglers; whilst he was beating me, Mr. Turner desired me to look behind, and I found it was a hoe upon a handle; I went to the constable, and I met Rennett, and desired him to assist, this was in my way to the constable; but before that I saw one Mr. Brown; I also saw Mr. Benton, a farmer and merchant at Thornham, and I desired them to come, and they said they would. In my way to the constable I saw Brown, I brought him back as far as the gate; after I had got to the gate I then went to the constable, which is the third time I set off for him, he came, and I desired him to bring the cart. When I came to Hutchinson's gate with the constable, Hutchinson swore he would knock me down if I entered the gate; I pushed by him, went through the yard, and went into the enclosure, where the tubs were taken out; the smugglers just before I had entered the gate were then gone out with the tubs already taken out, I saw eight of them with tubs coming out of the gate, just before I got to the gateway, and the last was just as I came to the gateway; there were some of them in the road when I saw them, and some of them coming out of the yard; then I entered the gateway and went into the enclosure. I said to Turner, they have carried away the tubs; he said they had carried away sixteen: Brown was in the vault getting out more tubs; Lewis said will you compound, will you have half; I said no, we cannot do anything of that kind, you had better be quiet and let us alone: the smugglers then gave us abusive l anguage, which Lewis desired them to desist from; the smugglers were then very numerous.</p>
               <p>What do you call very numerous? - Upon the whole I suppose there were near twenty, but the exact number I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150016"/> tell: I then went to see if the cart was come, but I was told by the constable he could not get in, and I saw that they could not; the cart was there, and the horses in it, and they swore it should not enter the gateway; the prisoner Wilkinson, Conk, or Crocky, was there.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the premises was he upon? - He was upon the enclosure, where the tubs lay that were just taken out of the vault; he took up a tub, I begged of him to set it down; I asked him by what authority he took it; I followed him into the yard, and I laid my hand upon the tub, he let it down, and he immediately struck me several blows on each side my jaws with his fist, and I immediately fell backwards into a little puddle of water; I then went into the field, and took my stand by Mr. Benton. Sometime after that a pistol was presented by Wilkinson to me, that was near the vault, in the enclosure where the vault was; Mr. Benton called out, there is a pistol! there is a pistol! and it presently disappeared.</p>
               <p>Court. In what manner was the pistol presented? - It was presented thus, with his right-hand.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - As far as I am to Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said something, but I could not exactly tell what; after that he retired, I did not see him; after that some time elapsed, I cannot tell how long, when there was a cry, have at them, damn them, kill them! kill them! and immediately I was knocked down, either with a stone or brickbat, but which I cannot tell: I got up, and got out of the enclosure; I found myself in the road, but I do not know which way, I was very much stunned and very dizzy; I then saw

             the constable, and he told me I bled very much, I should be very faint; I told him I was faint, and afterwards, I found it was blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Did you observe any thing afterwards respecting this geneva? - Yes, I observed they kept carrying it away, and there was general confusion, and the brickbats were flying; when the constable desired me to go, as I bled very much; I said I would not till I knew where Mr. Turner was, and presently Mr. Turner came, and called, how are you; how is it with you? Says I, I am very much bruised, my head is broke very much; I said to Mr. Rennett, we will have one tub; Turner said the same; Rennett said I dare not; Turner said I will go with you, and they went, and they got a tub out of the vault.</p>
               <p>What became of this tub? - I have had it in my house ever since, it was examined in my presence, and it contained geneva.</p>
               <p>Had these twenty persons any thing in their hands? - They had bludgeons, those that I saw carry away the liquor.</p>
               <p>What sort of bludgeons? - As near as I can guess; about two feet long, and very thick.</p>
               <p>Did you know Hutchinson before this time? - I did.</p>
               <p>How came you acquainted with him? - I was officer, and Thornham was under my survey.</p>
               <p>Then you was acquainted with him? - With respect to acquaintance, I had seen him very frequently, he knew me, he called me immediately by my name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Macnally, one of the Council for Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Have you been at Thornham since the seizure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Lewis there from November, the time when the seizure was made, till July, when he was apprehended? - I have seen him there.</p>
               <p>Did you assist in apprehending him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any conversation between him and the last witness, respecting his safety after he was apprehended? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Turner telling him he might be easy? - No, I cannot recollect any thing of that; I have heard Turner say, he imagined Lewis was not so bad as the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150017"/>You did not hear any such conversation? - I do not recollect any.</p>
               <p>When Lewis came up, the smugglers, as you have called all these people, were all on the ground, did not Lewis come up alone? - He spoke to me by myself.</p>
               <p>Then he did not appear to you to be one of the party that you termed smugglers? - He appeared to me to be a smuggler, because he carried away two tubs.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be a mediator and peace-maker? - He appeared to me to be a mediator, because he desired that the others should behave well, and not behave riotous to the officers; I saw several of the smugglers with bludgeons.</p>
               <p>How did they carry the tubs? - On their shoulders.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Council for the two other Prisoners. What kind of close is this where the vault is? - A little grass close, covered with grass, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner Hutchinson's wife at all during this business? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What passed between her and you? - As soon as I was extricated from her husband -</p>
               <p>Court. What does that lead to?</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I understand that there was a quarrel between this witness and the prisoner Hutchinson's wife, and that the prisoner interposed on the behalf of his wife.</p>
               <p>There was something passed between you and the wife? - There was, but Hutchinson and I were engaged first.</p>
               <p>Did you see any weapon in Hutchinson's hand before the quarrel took place between you and his wife? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about your doing damage to his premises? - He said I had no business or right on his premises.</p>
               <p>Did not he complain of your doing damages to the premises, to the grass; how did you enter them? - By a gateway, and within a very few yards there was the vault.</p>
               <p>Why did you tear the woman's ear-ring out of her ear? - I never touched her ears.</p>
               <p>Will you say that he did not say that you should not use his wife in that manner, or words to that effect? - I do not recollect that; he complained of a parcel of stuff that I knew was absolutely false.</p>
               <p>Court. What was that stuff? - Why, that I had pulled out her ear-rings out of her ears, and that I meant to be familiar with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Would not that enrage you if a man was familiar with your wife?</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that this report was propagated, that you should take such liberties with this woman? - Afterwards.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards? - About a week or ten days when I heard of it.</p>
               <p>At this time did nothing pass about your damaging the things? - I never heard a word of it.</p>
               <p>How many people were there that you saw? - I saw eight people carry away goods, how many people there might be in the whole I cannot say, the mixed number was very great.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was not there a good many of the size of Wilkinson? - There were a good many, I never saw any body like him, I knew him; and the language he made use of I could not help observing.</p>
               <p>How did you stand when the pistol was presented? - I stood rather obliquely.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say that the pistol was presented to you in particular? - I can, I saw the pistol.</p>
               <p>Your fears might make you think it was at your nose, when it was a mile distant; can you say it was pointed at you? - It was pointed straight forward.</p>
               <p>Was he doing any thing else at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was not he busy about other things? - Not at all, he stood thus, and presented the pistol thus.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prisoner Lewis. I believe when you went there you saw Mr. Bentum the farmer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not there at the commencement of the search? - I was not.</p>
               <p>When you came there then you saw Mr. Bentum the farmer there, and many other inhabitants of the town? - I saw Mr. Bentum and Lewis there then.</p>
               <p>You saw Lewis moving a tub? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not he looking at it? - Yes, I apprehend he was looking to see if they were marked.</p>
               <p>Is not it your practice, as soon as you have seized any goods of this sort, to mark them as things seized for his Majesty's use? - I have seized goods with marks, and I have seized goods without marks.</p>
               <p>You do not understand me; I ask you whether you do not mark them after you have seized them? - I very often do that myself.</p>
               <p>Were those in truth so marked? - I cannot say, I handed them out of the vault, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the that is at Stangroom's? - I have.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it had any mark when it was carried to Stangroom's? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Mr. Lewis hold any conversation with Stangroom, or interfere to prevent mischief? - I heard a voice which I verily believe was Lewis's, but I cannot swear it was him.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you hear? - It signified as if he wanted no mischief to happen; it seemed to be his voice, signifying to molify matters; and asked the officers if they would take half and leave half.</p>
               <p>Are you the surveyor of Thornham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Lewis lodges, and has lodged for two years past? - He lodges at one Johnson's.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen him since? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Living under no concealment? - I have seen him frequently.</p>
               <p>Were not these poor men indicted in January last? - I was not present when they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with Lewis about his making himself easy, that there was nothing that would affect him?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150019"/> - I cannot say that, I told him it would depend on the evidence against him; I said to him I did not see him take any thing away, but I cannot say what other people said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. When you came up to Hutchinson, you say he dropped the weapon immediately? - Yes, when I took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>He did not attempt to do you any injury of any kind? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing that passed between Hutchinson's wife, and the last witness Stangroom? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>Did not Hutchinson complain very heavily of the mischief that had been done to him? - I heard him make a complaint, I heard him say that he misused his wife.</p>
               <p>The voice that you heard speak some conciliatory words, and advise the smugglers to be quiet, you cannot say who that was? - I cannot swear to a man's voice, I rather believe it to be Lewis's voice.</p>
               <p>It might be Hutchinson's voice, you saw Wilkinson there? - I did.</p>
               <p>But you did not see him in the act of taking away these tubs? - I cannot say I did.</p>

               <p>At what distance from Hutchinson's door, or from his premises? - I do not know, it was just by the gate, Mr. Turner then desired me to go into a green field just by his house, I did, and the woman Mrs. Hutchinson came to me, and shewed me where the goods were, she said there Mr. Rennet, make you the seizure, accordingly I pulled the stone off the vault, and discovered the goods laying in the vault.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was Hutchinson at this time? - He was then keeping Mr. Stangroom off his premises.</p>
               <p>He did not hear then what passed between you and the woman? - I believe not, I asked a labouring man that was there, to get a tub out of the vault, he did, I told him I wanted a gimblet to prove the seizure, he fetched me one, I pierced the cask and found it to be gin; Mr. Turner came to me, and says, what have you got, I told him it was gin; he immediately alighted off his horse and tasted it, and Mr. Brown came up at the same time, Brown went into the vault and handed up the tubs, I took them to the amount of eighteen or twenty; Brown being fatigued in the vault, I went in and handed out about eighteen or twenty more, I came out of the vault seeing Brown run away, I went into the street and saw Stangroom bleeding; as soon as I came out of the vault, I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Court. By whom? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>With what? - With a fist, by hands, and I believe Wilkinson the prisoner picked me up, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>What became of those casks that were handed out by you and Brown? - The smugglers carried them away, I saw them.</p>
               <p>Court. How deep was the vault? - About my height, I was not in the vault when I saw them taken away a part of the goods, about sixteen casks, Brown was in the vault then.</p>
               <p>How many smugglers might there be among them? - I cannot say, there might be a dozen of them.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing in their hands? - I never saw any thing in the hands of any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150020"/>Did you return back again to this field, where the vault was? - By the desire of Mr. Turner.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I went into the vault, and fetched out a tub which Mr. Turner took away, Lewis took up a tub, whether he took it away I cannot say, there were several taken up, but who took them up I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were the heads of any of these casks knocked in? - One of them was.</p>
               <p>By whom? - By Hutchinson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How far was Hutchinson from his wife, at the time the wife undertook to conduct you to the vault? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was he within hearing, think you? - I cannot tell, he made no opposition, he sent for me to my house, for me to make the seizure, and his wife conducted me to the place.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hutchinson take any of the tubs away, or assist the parties? - No, I saw him knock in the head of one tub.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson behaved very kindly to you, when you was knocked down? - Yes, he took and picked me up.</p>
               <p>You saw no weapons? - No, I never saw a pistol, stone, or any thing at all, Wilkinson behaved very quiet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. I think you said, that Hutchinson's wife sent for you to make the seizure? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>You are acquainted too with him? - Only I live in his neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Did he send to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that the girl came to you, to make the seizure? - When Mr. Stangroom and Mr. Turner were there, when he found they were and would make the seizure, he me to make it.</p>

               <p>Court. You must give your evidence, we cannot make any bargains with you in a criminal case? - I was riding home, it happened very near my house, I heard a great confusion and noise, curiosity led me to see what was the matter, first Hutchinson's wife told me that Mr. Stangroom had taken her by the throat, and would have pulled her life out; I said, you are under no apprehension, I am sure Mr. Stangroom never intended any hurt; then Stangroom came to me, and asked me to stop, he said, we have made a seizure, perhaps your presence and influence will prevent its being taken from us; I stopped, and went down to the vault where they had taken out the liquors, and used what arguments I could, they seemed every well reconciled, but before the cart came, there came a party drunk I suppose from the alehouse eight or ten of them, and carried away a tub or two; one of them, I suppose one of the prisoners, seemed to me take one of the tubs in a very sly manner, I heard afterwards his name was Wilkinson, that is the man; Stangroom returned and met him in the yard, with the tub under his arm; he asked him what authority he had for taking that away, and he took some thing out of his bosom, which I took at that time to be a pistol, for I immediately called to Stangroom, a pistol, a pistol, not that I can pretend to say that it was one, for it was a little duskish, and the man returned it sooner than I could speak almost, and I saw no more of it; he did not say any thing only hid it; I cannot tell what they did with the casks, they carried them out of my sight, but the gable end of the house projected; directly after Stangroom stood by me, and he fell just like a dead man, I saw his face all over blood, somebody struck him, I did not see who it was.</p>

               <p>Did you observe those men that came, whether they had any things in their hands? - I cannot say positively, I was a little matter confused, I stood from the beginning to the ending, I received a blow on my leg with a stone, or brickbat, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Hutchinson's wife complained very loudly to you? - Yes, but she only complained once to me.</p>
               <p>You do not know what it was in Wilkinson's hands? - I believe it to be a pistol.</p>
               <p>You did not see any offensive weapons to your certain knowledge? - Nothing except that was.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you on the part of the prisoners any witnesses to fact? - No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Solicitor General. There are three counts; the first is for persons being armed, assembling themselves in order to assist in the rescuing of goods: the second count is, that these people, being armed, assembled themselves, and that they assaulted the officers in the execution of their office: the third count is, that they did forcibly obstruct, assault, oppose, and resist the officers in the securing of this geneva. On the first of these counts, I doubt whether on the whole of the evidence there is evidence to fix these persons with having deliberately assembled themselves, for that express purpose: the second of these counts I do not myself see any branch of the act of Parliament to which it applies; I wish, therefore, to know on what branch of the act of parliament that second count has been drawn; with respect to the third count, undoubtedly there is evidence to prove the fact: but I suppose it has not escaped you, that by a subsequent act of parliament, the same specific offence that is described in this act, the mere forcibly obstructing, is made an offence, for which the party may proceed at the quarter sessions, and be corporally punished: now, if upon consideration you should be of opinion that you can sustain upon the construction of this act of parliament on the third count, I shall have no objection, with the concurrence of my brothers, to take a special verdict on that; but as a question of discretion I put it to you for your consideration, whether you press that in a cause so circumstanced, where there is, by a subsequent act of parliament, an express provision that the offence should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150023"/> punished in so very inferior a degree and course by the quarter sessions of the county, and by corporal punishment, whether you would press that to be brought here in the county of Middlesex, to prosecute the parties under those disadvantages as they must be under; undoubtedly it is a very fit thing, where an atrocious case does arise, that the law should be executed in the manner here chalked out; and there are certain cases may arise, in which it is extremely proper that case should be taken; but on this case I doubt extremely whether this is one of those cases which you would wish to see so prosecuted. I do not think that the circumstances were so fully understood by those who conducted the prosecution, as they are now understood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. There was a case were there was an indictment for killing a deer in some park in the county of Herts, and it was an indictment under the black act; it came on before me, and it happened to occur to my recollection, that I had a few years before that taken down an observation in Mr. Justice Blackstone's fourth volume of his Commentaires, whether that part of the act of parliament was not virtually repealed by a subsequent statute, and after a good deal of search, we found out the act of parliament, which nobody there had heard of; upon which I would not try the man, but reserved it for the opinion of the Judges; and all the Judges were unanimously of opinion, that it was a virtual repeal of that statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t17840915-2-person123">

            . A number of persons assembling is out of the case; this act of Parliament provides, that if a number of persons, being armed, shall assemble themselves for the purpose of aiding and rescuing smuggled goods, &amp;c. it then goes on to another branch, that if any number of people shall assist, that is felony; there is a third substantive offence, if any person going in disguise; and the fourth is, if any persons armed or not armed shall forcibly resist or obstruct the officers in rescuing goods; upon that the third count is founded, that has no regard to the number of persons, nor to their being armed; the words are,</p>
               <p>"or if any person shall, from and after the 24th day of July, have his face blacked, or wear any vizard mask, when passing with such goods;" an individual therefore, with his face blacked, passing with such goods, would, in all probability, be deemed to be within this act: the next clause is,</p>
               <p>"or shall forcibly assist," &amp;c. that word or, being coupled with the proceeding sentence, seems also to be a clause which would reach any individual who shall obstruct; now that particular offence is, as I have particularly observed, by the 19th of

             the Third reduced to a misdemeanor, punished by corporal punishment; therefore, if you still exercise your own judgment on the case, I for one have no objection to your having a special verdict on the point; but take it under all the circumstances, knowing my opinion to be, that this is not a case which calls for any such prosecution. With respect to the second count, if I am wrong, I shall be very glad to hear you as to the fact of this being a deliberate assembly of these people, armed for this purpose; you see a great part of it turns out to be the reverse; a parcel of drunken fellows come from an alehouse, and hastily set themselves, whether with arms or not, is not proved, or whether one man had a pistol or not does not appear. The act says,</p>
               <p>"shall be assembled, in order to aid and assist;" now this in fact is not the case, but it is the case of persons rushing and seizing these goods: the object of the act did not go to this particular case, which is the case of seizing goods which are found in concealment, which that part of the act manifestly alludes to, to a great number of persons coming down to the beach for the purpose of escorting goods. I think the officers of the Crown never can do better, than to exercise their judgment in favour of a prisoner, wherever there is any opening for it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I caught hold of his coat on the inside, and when he wreached it away, a bit of something came off in my hand, which I took to be shalloon, and I threw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his coat searched at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does that leave you any reason to doubt of his being the man? - Not in the least, he positively was the man.</p>

I saw the prisoner with that parcel in his hand, and I saw him drop it at the corner, and I believe he himself cried out stop thief! I saw him taken, he was stopped by a man whom we cannot find; I saw the boy pursuing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to the Boy. What became of the knot? - I had it with me.</p>

I turned round and stopped; the boy said I had his bundle; I said I had not, I was willing to be searched, that gentleman came up at the time and said, that he dared to say I dropped it, and I asked whether he saw me drop it, and he said no, and when he came to the Justice's, he swore he saw me drop it.</p>
               <p>Harwood. I did see you with the parcel, and saw you drop it, and saw you run.</p>
               <p>Court to Harwood Have you the least doubt in your mind? - No, my Lord, he had it more particular in his right arm, he dropped it down in the middle of the pavement out of his right-hand; in less than ten yards afterwards he was taken.</p>
               <p>Was any body near him at the time you saw him drop it? - Nobody at all, the nearest person I saw to him was the little boy.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoners came to my house on Saturday evening, the 4th of this month, it was about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did they come together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed after they came in? - They asked to look at some ribbon, I was speaking to a Gentleman, I desired the young chap that stood near me to shew them some, which he did.</p>
               <p>What did you observe after that? - As soon as he had taken the drawer before them, I went to the opposite side of the counter to speak to some other women, I served them with something, and they went away.</p>
               <p>How many were there of them? - There were two.</p>
               <p>Were they at the same counter? - No, they were at the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Then these two women went away? - Yes, Sir, I went round to my man, and he told me the prisoner had stolen something.</p>
               <p>What did you do? - I stood and chatted a little bit, then I went and stood with them, they asked to look at something that was up stairs, and I sent a man for it, and I went to speak to the man, and I observed Williams going up to the window and extricating something from her cloak, and putting it under a hat that lay in the window, and put the hat over it again; as soon as I came up I looked about me, and I saw a piece of lace laying upon the ground, near Williams's feet, I took it up, and told her it was pretty clear to me what she had been at, and that I should send for a constable; she assumed a great deal of innocence, and told me I must be mistaken, as if I knew her or her connections, I could have no suspicion of any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Did you send for a constable? - I did.</p>
               <p>Were both or either of the prisoners searched after the constable came? - They were, and a piece of ribbon was found on Wilson, and nothing upon Williams, they were taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. Mr. Pearson, I believe you can explain to us a little, the history of this very extraordinary indictment, I understand it was prepared by your express desire, so as to be sure of these people? - To be sure, I wished to punish, I was to lay the indictment as strong as I could.</p>
               <p>I must have an answer; was it by your express desire, and with a view that these people might be capitally convicted? - I do not know that it was, I did not know the nature of laying an indictment.</p>

               <p>I advise you now; I know you out of this Court to be a very honest man; was it not by your express desire, for the purpose of catching these women, by hooks or by crook? - Only in general terms, I desired it to be laid as strong as it could.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, whether you did not desire this might be laid capitally, in order that there might be a capital conviction? - No, Sir, but in general terms, that the indictment might be laid strong.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say, that you did not expressly desire it might be laid capital? - I did not; only in general terms that it might be laid as strong as it could.</p>
               <p>I believe that was an after thought, after the commitment? - No.</p>
               <p>They were not committed for a capital offence? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you was before the Alderman, whether you did not say, that you could say nothing about the fact?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150032"/> - Nothing more than what I have said at present.</p>
               <p>Whether you did not expressly say so before the Alderman? - I stated just as I have stated it at present, before the Alderman, I only said this, what I had to say would not materially affect them.</p>
               <p>I am instructed, you said before the Alderman you knew nothing of the fact, except by the information of the boy? - I said before the Alderman, I considered my evidence would not have a sufficient effect.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, say before Alderman Hart, that you knew nothing of the fact, only by the information of the boy? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you did not? - What I understood to be the fact, was that of seeing them absolutely stealing.</p>
               <p>Then, Mr. Pearson, will you say that you was examined to these facts, which you have now deposed to? - Exactly so, as I believe, I have no doubt at all, I believe it mounted to the same it does now.</p>
               <p>You are sure you gave the same account before the Alderman you give now? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Then this cannot be true, that upon your telling the Alderman that you knew nothing of the fact, you walked aside, and that your boy succeeded to your place, and gave an account? - I do not recollect any thing about it, it was exactly as I have stated it now, and I was examined and sworn upon it, it amounted exactly to the same thing I have said.</p>
               <p>I believe that Gentleman was present? - I believe he went away before I was examined.</p>
               <p>Then you was examined after your boy, and the constable, and every body else? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>After the prisoners were taken from the her perhaps? - They were taken from the bar, the Alderman had left the chair, and went into another room; and the prisoners were taken from the bar.</p>
               <p>Were you twice examined? - Not upon oath.</p>
               <p>Was not you once examined before your boy? - No, I was not, something might be said.</p>
               <p>That is the something I am enquiring after? - It did not exclude my knowing any thing of the fact.</p>
               <p>Now as to the ribbon, where was that found? - I saw it taken up, whether it had ever been in the possession of Wilson or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>But you have proved it, and my Lord has taken it down; now finding something on the ground, is not precisely finding something on a person I should guess? - I do not mean to prove that.</p>
               <p>Now this business of extricating; I believe at that moment there was nobody in the shop; how many people might be in the shop? - I believe there might have been three besides these two women.</p>
               <p>How lately did you see that lace before the prisoners came into the shop? - Not for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Then it might have lain on the floor, or on the window? - I am sure it did not, I am sure it was not in the window under the hats, nor on the ground.</p>
               <p>How are you sure that lace was not in the window, nor under the hats? - I do not absolutely know it.</p>
               <p>Nor could you swear but it had been under the hats before they came in; I believe you at that time got into a humour to suspect every thing; if they tied their garters you would have suspected they were stealing something, should not you? - I should.</p>
               <p>FRIAR TODD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Pearson, I saw the two prisoners come into Mr. Pearson's shop on Saturday the 4th of September, between the hours of seven and eight, I served them; they asked to see some ribbons, which I shewed them from a drawer on the counter; Wilson fixed on one, I cut her off a yard and a half of mazarine blue ribbon; she paid for it; while I was cutting it off I perceived Wilson take off a length of ribbon from the drawer, and convey it into some secret place about her person.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where she concealed it?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150033"/> - Somewhere under her cloak: they then asked to see childrens caps, which I shewed them, and Williams in particular seemed to wish to engage my attention from the drawer of caps, a few of which she had misplaced on the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. What she wished you cannot tell, you only know she had misplaced them? - By her talk she wished -</p>
               <p>You cannot tell what she wished, she alone can tell that; tell us what she said or did? - They then bought a cap, they then asked to see edgings, I shewed her some, and I told her the price of them; she thought I could take less for them, and she went to the other side of the counter to Mr. Pearson with intent to cheat me.</p>
               <p>Do not speak of intent, how can you speak of intent? the Jury are to judge of that; what did she do? - As Wilson went across to Mr. Pearson, (the prisoners changed places at the bar) she acquainted me that Mr. Pearson could not take any less than I had asked her, she said I might cut her two yards and a half of the piece; I sold her two different lengths of edging after that, besides the two yards and a half, one yard and a quarter at the same price, and six yards at one shilling; then they did not want any thing else: I made them a bill for the goods they had bought, which amounted to one pound one shilling and sixpence, I then wrapped up the things, and they paid for them.</p>
               <p>Which of them did you give them to? - I believe it was to Wilson; they were all put up together, when this was done I communicated my suspicions to Mr. Pearson, I whispered to him.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing more after that? - After that they wished to see a hat, I then sent one of our young men up stairs to fetch one, and Mr. Pearson went out of the shop to call him down, and he staid longer than he might do, and Wilson and Williams would have departed from the shop, but I leaped over the compter, and told them they should not go till he came in; Wilson went to one of the hats at the window, and said it might do, and I saw Williams convey three cards of edging under a hat.</p>
               <p>Where did she convey them from? - From under her cloak or her person.</p>
               <p>Did you see that? - Yes, I saw her take the three cards of edging from under her cloak, and convey them under the hat, and which hat I took up immediately and shewed to Mr. Pearson and the prisoner, telling the prisoner at the same time that they were Mr. Pearson's property, and that they were stole from him; they seemed surprized, and wondered what I could mean by it.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take the edging from under her cloak and put it under the hat; can you swear positively you saw that? - Yes, my Lord, I did, three cards of edging.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish while they were in her hand how many there were of them? - I could not distinguish them in her hand, but there were none there before she put them there.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - The box of edgings never was removed from the place where I served them that day.</p>
               <p>How far was that from where the hats lay? - It might be a couple of yards.</p>
               <p>You say they tossed the things about a good deal, and carried some edgings to Mr. Pearson; did not they spread the other things that they looked at? - They never took out any of the rest of the cards, only those that I found they had stole.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, is it not very common to take out a number and tumble them about? - We never allow that, they would not be worth a penny.</p>
               <p>Why you cannot help it, Sir, if people like it? - We prevent them from tossing them about the counter.</p>
               <p>Aye, tossing them so as to spoil them. - We take them up again as soon as ever we can.</p>
               <p>In what manner did she put them under the hat? - She conveyed them in her hand, the hat was laying in the window.</p>
               <p>Did she lift the hat up with one hand? - I saw her take the hat up, and put the edgings under.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150034"/>What did you actually see with your eyes? - I saw her take the edgings and put them under the hat, but I cannot tell with which hand.</p>
               <p>She shifted the hat to put them down? - Yes, of course.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take up the hat to look what was under it? - Immediately, I did not hardly give her time to lay down the hat; when Mr. Pearson came in they were making towards the door.</p>
               <p>How near the door did they go before you stopped them? - About a yard and a half, or two yards from the door.</p>
               <p>How far is your counter from the door? - A very little way from the door.</p>
               <p>Then they moved from one part of the counter to the other side? - Yes, and they said they did not mind particularly for that cap that present time, they would have one another time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, another of Prisoner's Council. You know when you are upon your oath you are to tell us facts, and not the mind of any man, because it is impossible for you to know the mind of any man, or to know that the intent of one was this, and another was this; first you say you saw it conveyed under her cloak, and then at another, part of the body; and then you say it was under her cloak, which do you mean to stick to? - She took the edgings from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Now it is the cloak, what did you mean by saying from other parts of the body? - Because when she had her cloak on, she might convey it from other parts of the body, I could not see it.</p>
               <p>What kind of hat was it? - A straw hat.</p>
               <p>Could that lift up? - Yes, it could.</p>
               <p>You saw it lift up? - She lifted it up.</p>
               <p>Then you saw her lift it up with one hand and put it under the hat with the other; why do not you answer, you are not before ladies now: you said she lifted it up? - She must lift it up, the hat could not lift itself up.</p>
               <p>Thank you for that, good Mr. Friar Todd: why, to be sure you are as pretty a coxcomb as ever came into a Court; did you see her lift it up with her hand, Sir? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see her lift up the hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said two minutes ago she did not lift up the hat, but you supposed it, and now you swear positively that she did; what are the Jury to believe? - She did lift up the hat.</p>
               <p>How came you to say she did not just now? - I did not say so, I said she lifted it up, but with which hand I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Now the ladies never tumble these edgings about? - No.</p>
               <p>But they do not put them down exactly in the same place? - They generally put them into the box, considerate ladies always do.</p>
               <p>But if an inconsiderate gentleman now was to go to the box, perhaps he would throw it down carelessly. - Perhaps he would, and we should take it up as carelessly; but that does not relate to the subject at all.</p>
               <p>Is it not common when people come into your shop, to take up goods and put them down promiscuously; upon your oath, Sir, whether considerate or inconsiderate, upon your oath? - I wish to hear the question.</p>
               <p>O, you shall hear it again, Sir; Is it not common for people that come into your shop, whether considerate or inconsiderate, to take things up and throw them down carelessly? - Am I obliged to answer that question, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, Sir, there is nothing improper in the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Why, do you expect credit from the Jury; you may give yourself airs at home, but not in a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Why should you have any unwillingness to answer it? - I have no unwillingness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Well, I will give it up: had you been in your shop all that day? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150035"/> No, I had been out of the shop, this was in the evening.</p>
               <p>When had you been out of the shop, how many hours? - Not many.</p>
               <p>How many? - I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Can you guess within an hour? - I cannot particularly remember.</p>
               <p>It might be three hours then? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know you was not? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>But you could not remember just now particularly; had you been out that day? - A few times.</p>
               <p>How many times? - Perhaps twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Who remained in the shop during your absence? - Mr. Pearson to be sure.</p>
               <p>Nobody else? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many domestics are there? - Two besides Mr. Pearson.</p>
               <p>Why Mr. Pearson is not a domestic you know, he is master? - Two servants besides myself, they were sometimes in the shop; I left them all in the shop.</p>
               <p>What the three different times? - I do not say three different times, I say twice or three times.</p>
               <p>Did not they serve as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They serve edgings too, did not they? - No, Sir, we served very few customers that day, our house is a wholesale house.</p>
               <p>How do you know what was done when you was out? - I could know what money was taken when I came back again; there was no edgings sold that day, I asked them all, I knew it by what they said.</p>
               <p>Then you had some doubt in your mind about edgings being sold or disposed of, or else you would not have asked the question? - There was none sold.</p>
               <p>You did not ask about hats, cloaks, or petticoats? - No.</p>
               <p>You had a doubt in your mind, had not you? - No, Sir, but I asked them; I had no doubt, but I might ask the question.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask the question to that one article more than any one article in the shop? - ( No answer.)</p>
               <p>You ought to know that this frippery does not serve the prosecution. Stand down, Sir.</p>

               <p>I know no more than that a piece of ribbon, which I have in my pocket, was found under that tall lady, on the stool where she sat by the counter, but not that counter where she was served.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You do not know that? - I searched her, she was standing; when I came in she got up, and when she got up I saw the ribbon, she made a snatch of her band, she was all of a flurry, and I laid hold of her hands, and there was the ribbon by the side of her on the stool. (The ribbon produced.) It was not measured.</p>
               <p>Court to Todd. Do you know this? - No, not for a certainty.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of this? - Sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>How much may there be of it? - Sixteen or seventeen yards.</p>
               <p>Marsh. This is all lace, Todd gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Todd. I had three of the cards from under the hat, and the other was taken from the ground, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Is there any shop mark you know the piece of ribbon by? - Yes, my Lord, I know it, it is my own, there is No. 2 in the corner of it, and there is 18, which is done by the manufacturer; I have no doubt but it is my master's; I know these cards of lace.</p>
               <p>Court to Todd. What is the value of these cards of lace? - The value of this is two shillings and eight-pence per yard, the first cost; this is two shillings and sixpence; this two shillings and nine-pence; this one and twenty-pence.</p>
               <p>You do not know the quantities of them, do you? - Here may be about thirty-eight yards of this, about twenty one yards of this -</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you measure it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150036"/> No, it was measured, I never measured ever a one of them; these are the things that were found.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Pearson. These were all the things that were found; you gave instructions for the indictment? - Yes, I called at Mr. Reynolds's office, and gave the instructions.</p>
               <p>I see there are two childrens caps in the indictment, how came them there? - They were picked up at the feet of one of these women at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you picked up every thing that was dropped in the shop?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Todd. So, young man, you know this piece of ribbon to be your master's do you? - Yes, I know it, because there is a figure of mine in the corner, No. 2.</p>
               <p>What does that figure of 2 import; what does it tend to, or note, or signify? - It signifies that Tibbets, Belchier, and Bullock we bought it of? - That is a good notification for a figure of 2; then every piece of ribbon so bought has the number of 2 upon it? - It has.</p>
               <p>That is all that you know it by; now how many pieces of grass green in the course of last week do you think you sold, or in the course of the last six weeks? - None, for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, will you venture to swear you have not sold a great many of them? - I will swear that I have not sold any of such a length as that.</p>
               <p>Why do you know the length of that? - I know the bulk of it.</p>
               <p>Now what is there in the bulk of that, that distinguishes it from another piece of green ribbon you have sold; are not you a wholesale dealer? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you more frequently sell a whole piece than half a piece? - Yes, we do.</p>
               <p>Then those that are whole are larger in bulk than those that are not? - Yes, Sir, but -</p>
               <p>Well! now for a reason! you was going on. What! are you dumb founded! then I will try again: how many pieces with a figure of 2 have you sold? - None.</p>
               <p>And you will swear that neither Mr. Pearson nor you had parted with a piece of ribbon with a figure of 2 upon it? - I have not, not grass green.</p>
               <p>O, you mean to confine it to grass green, do you, young gentlemen, ha? answer me, Sir? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you affect, Sir, before a Jury of your country, to say that your recollection goes to the colour of your ribbons that you have sold in your shop? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>How many pieces have you sold in the last six weeks? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Have either of you any thing to say, in answer to the charge that is laid against you?</p>
               <p>Prisoners. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in respect to that card of lace that was fallen upon the ground, it would be too much to convict the prisoners of that; we all know that when people look at a number of these small articles, they are frequently tossed about carelessly; and I think you should be satisfied that she put them down to avoid being detected, as well as that she took it with a felonious intent.</p>

               <p>Did you find his name on, or put it on? - No, I put it on; on the 8th of July, in the morning, Harvey brought a fifty pound note, which I gave change for, and put Barugh's name to it as before: I believe in a day or two afterwards, or it might be three days, the first forty pound note was paid to Mr. Bickerstaff, of the Three Tons, in Smithfield, and the fifty pound note was paid in the course of the week to Mr. Bickerstaff; I paid the forty pound note, I cannot tell whether I paid the fifty pound, or whether Mr. Rock paid it.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the porter of the Windmill, his name was Rock, was it not? - So I have been informed since this affair happened, but I know nothing at all of him.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Fuller; on the 12th of March 1784, among other notes I received, there appears to be these two, fifty pounds and forty pounds which are indorsed, which I gathered in for Mr. Fuller; I received them of Mr. Drummond, and on the 13th of March it appears by our books, that these notes were paid to Mr. Pilgrim on the 13th, with others to the value of two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Are your books here? - No, but I have upon a paper a list of those notes I received.</p>
               <p>Have you the marks and numbers of these two notes that you received on the 12th of March? - Yes, the fifty pound, O, No. 111, and forty pound, O, 103.</p>
               <p>Is that the whole that you took? - That is all the account that we take of them, any farther than writing the name of the person we take them of, and the date on the front of the note on the right-hand corner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am in the service of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England; these are the two notes Mr. Pilgrim put a stop to at our office, they were brought in; O, 103, was brought into the Bank, 5th July, it was brought in by one Mr. Bridale, taken at Drummonds by one of the out-door clerks of the Bank; the other was brought into the Bank the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>Court to White. Lok at these two notes, and tell me whether these two notes are the same you received at Drummond's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of these notes? - They appear to answer the same numbers and sums, I cannot swear to the identity of the dates, because I did not take them.</p>
               <p>Court to Castle. This O, 103, forty pounds, is that a sufficient description of a bank note, that it cannot be mistaken; are there never two notes of the same sum and number? - Not on the same day.</p>
               <p>But none of these people can speak to the day, they did not take the dates. - These notes have been traced back to the office from the indorsements.</p>
               <p>But independant of that, I suppose you had forty pound notes of the letter O, and No. 103, in other months and dates besides these? - Undoubtedly we may.</p>
               <p>You never saw, I understand, on the same day two notes of the same number and letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you the same month? - Yes, it may happen the same month.</p>
               <p>Then unless you have the date, the number and letter are not sufficient alone to identify the note? who traced them by the indorsement? - Mr. Pilgrim first gave the intimation at the office, and enquired if these notes were out-standing; he then gave a check.</p>
               <p>How did Mr. Pilgrim get at the dates?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I applied to my banker for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150039"/> them, and when the notes came in, I found their dates answered exactly to those I had from my banker.</p>
               <p>There appears several names upon the back of the notes, but Mr. Bickerstaff, Mr. Rock, and Mr. Barugh seem to be the names which approach nearest.</p>
               <p>Court to Laws. Look at these two notes, have they the name of Barugh on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that your writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are these the notes you received, one from Harvey, and the other from Dare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Pilgrim. Is Bickerstaff here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. The difficulty is to be satisfied that these notes that were paid to Rock by Barugh, were the notes that you lost; now unless had gone to Fuller's, and taken the dates, you would not have known them? - No, only by the numbers and sum.</p>
               <p>That is common to all notes that are issued at different days, though not the same day? - They are, but there is the circumstance of Mr. Vaughan giving me the account of the dates of them.</p>
               <p>Court. But you should have brought the persons here, which took down in Fuller's books, the numbers from the receiving clerk? - I did not know that was necessary.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never made any personal application to Mr. Barugh, nor should I have brought this matter before a Court, but I thought it very extraordinary, that these two notes should center in one person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Counsel. You know these same circumstances would have convicted Bickerstaff, because they were in his hands? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>You know it is possible that they both might be in any honest man's hands? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. Would you wish for Mr. Barugh to go further? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, unless we can clearly fix the identity of the notes, that is, that the very notes that Barugh paid into the hands of Mr. Rock's servants, were the very notes Mr. Pilgrim lost, all this evidence goes for nothing: now as it seems to me, the proof fails in this respect, Mr. Pilgrim has no means of fixing that these are the very notes which he lost, but from the information which he has collected at the house of Fuller and Co. his bankers; for the letters, and numbers which he does know, is no proof that these are his notes, the date is the thing that is to fix; where the date, and the letter, and the number all correspond, certainly that is a proof of the identity, for they never issue two notes on the same day, of the same number and letter, but they do issue notes of the same numbers and letters on different days; there being that chasm in the evidence, which I see no means of supplying, I do not think it is material to call on the prisoner to make his defence, therefore, I think the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is the request of the Gentlemen to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Court. You may withdraw, I can have no objection to your withdrawing, but I wish you to understand me first, Mr. Pilgrim has lost two Bank notes, Mr. Barugh has circulated two Bank-notes, then Mr. Barugh should be called to account for them, because then he is found to have circulated those notes which Mr. Pilgrim has lost; but unless it is proved that they are those notes that Mr. Pilgrim has lost, there is no charge against him; now that is the point in this case; and if after this which I have told you in the face of your country; you think it a point to be doubted, whether a man is to be convicted when there is no evidence against him, you may withdraw if you please, it is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>The Jury then gave a verdict.</p>

               <p>What did they do after they got you into the ditch? - They took my money out of my pocket, the prisoner was behind the other men, and one of them that was on me says, damn your eyes come on, and quiet that child or kill her.</p>
               <p>Do you believe he spoke to the prisoner? - Yes, and they did so, they took from me ten shillings and sixpence in silver, a frock, and my linen waistcoat, a hat, a pair of copper shoe buckles, and my shoes, these were the things I had on.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing from the child? - The prisoner came up, and he could not quiet her with his hand, and he stuffed the child's mouth full of hay, then he run away towards Stepney.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the person? - I am sure that was the person, I went and apprehended the prisoner, who lived in my neighbourhood; Levy and Earle took him.</p>
               <p>Court. It was half past nine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - A bright moon-light night.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - I imagine about five or ten minutes, not above.</p>
               <p>The first thing was one of them pulled your hat over your eyes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your hat continue to be pulled over your eyes all the time? - No, when they threw me into the ditch my hat was off.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the faces of the other two men? - I did observe the first very well, but he is not to be found.</p>
               <p>Should you know the other men? - I should know one of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner you described standing behind the others, so that he was farther from you than the other two? - Yes, but when he stopped the child's mouth he was before me, I could see him very plain, he was then four or five yards off.</p>
               <p>Which way did the moon shine, in your face? - No, it shone in his face.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - I cannot tell what his dress was, but it was a brownish loose great coat.</p>
               <p>Had he any hat over his eyes? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a hat had he? - It was an oldish cocked up hat.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When you were thrown down, did he stand behind you or in front of you? - I was thrown upon my back, but then when the other man pulled my clothes off, they pulled me up.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes, as sober as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking at all? - I had a pint of beer at Poplar, and that was all.</p>

               <p>Do you know what will become of you if you tell a lie? - Yes, then I shall go to hell when I die, and the devil will burn me.</p>

               <p>Court. Let her be sworn by all means.</p>
               <p>(Sworn.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now tell all that you know, and tell the truth; where was you? - I was coming home, and my daddy thought it was the highest way to come over the fields, so he did; and as he was coming over the fields, three men stopped him, so one of them came up, says he what's o'clock; says my daddy I do not know, I have no watch, but it is about half after nine; then the man said, says he, O, says he, I am going to Whitechapel; says my daddy, says he, so am I, I came from the Isle of Dogs: so they knocked him down, and one of the men said to the other, come up, Joe, for, says he, here is a man, a dog, came over from the Isle of Dogs; so then they knocked him down, and pulled my daddy's hat over his eyes, and knocked him down; I stood and I screamed out, and then one of the men that was along with my daddy said, says he, blast your eyes, come up and stop that girl's mouth, and kill her, or else I will, and then he got some hay, and stuffed my mouth full of hay.</p>
               <p>Who did? - This here man.</p>
               <p>Which man do you mean? - That man there, and he took away my bonnet.</p>
               <p>What were they doing to your father? - They were taking his money away and robbing him.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you, think you? - He did not stay longer with me than he did with my daddy; then they all ran away towards Stepney; then my daddy and I came home towards Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Had your father got all his clothes on? - No, Sir, he had but a shirt, and a pair of breeches, and his stockings on, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150043"/> he came to the Two Bells at Whitechapel, he called for a pint of beer, and borrowed a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before, had you ever seen him? - Yes, he lives down the court next to us.</p>
               <p>Then you had seen him before this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell anybody so, soon after the robbery? - Yes, I said, says I, daddy, I know that man that stopped my mouth full of hay and took my bonnet away; I told him it was the man that lived down the court next us.</p>
               <p>When you got home, did you tell the same story to any body? - Yes, I told it to my mammy.</p>
               <p>When did they take the boy up? - Not till the next morning; I saw him the next morning. I saw him go up the court before he was taken; he came up the court where he lives, and came into our court, he and another man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell anybody that you had seen him? - My mammy and I was standing at the door, so then I said, Mammy, I know that man, for I am sure that is him that took my bonnet away, and stopped my mouth full of hay; and I am sure that is the man that stopped my mouth full of hay; and took my bonnet away.</p>
               <p>You are sure? - Yes, Sir, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of the other men? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. My girl, what led you to know him? - I had seen him come up and down the court.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived there? - I cannot say, because I do not know.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen him? - Ever so many times.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of his business? - No, that I do not.</p>
               <p>Can you tell where he got the hay? - No, I did not look, I believe it came from the hay-stack that was just by us.</p>
               <p>Was there a hay-stack just by you? - Yes, Sir, there was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there a haystack? - There was hay in the field.</p>
               <p>Court to the Child. Do you mean fresh cut hay, a hay-cock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What is your occupation, Mr. Cole? - I belong to Mr. Bullock's brewhouse; my daughter told me she knew the prisoner, and that he lived in their back court.</p>

               <p>I and Mr. Earl went to take the prisoner; I asked where he was, they said he was not at home; we found him at a house in George-yard; we took him to the Magistrate, and I suppose the Justice sent for fifty folks in the office, and ordered the girl out and the father; and the father took the man by the wrist, and then the child was ordered in, and she picked him out.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they separate, or both together? - The father first, and then the child was brought in, and she picked him out likewise.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the house, they have been there about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Who had you lodged with you? - The prisoner and his brothers, and his mother, and they were all at home in the afternoon, and I was at the door; the room that I supped at was about a yard from the stairs foot; they were all at home, the prisoner was at home, and I went to a little garden which I have, that is about a yard from the door, I went to the garden gate, I did not go farther, and Mr. Duckett went along with me; then I bid him a good night, and he bid me a good night, then I went in and bolted the door, then they were at home, all of them; and about half an hour eight, the servant maid came there for the pots, and the eldest brother came and brought down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150044"/> the pots, and he bolted the door and she went away.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know in point of fact that the prisoner was at home? - I saw him at home at nine o'clock, looking over his eldest brother's shoulder; his eldest brother is taller than him; this was on Sunday night the first of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>What trade are you? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>You are pretty much at home? - Yes, the prisoner and his brothers are never out of evenings, they are very quiet good sort of people, I do not know that they are ever out of a Sunday in the day time, much more at night.</p>
               <p>Did they never stir out that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what sort of evening it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was a very dark night? - Yes, it was darkish.</p>
               <p>If I recollect it rained hard that night? - I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>But it was particularly dark? - I cannot tell, I lighted a candle when I went to bed, it was nine o'clock exactly.</p>
               <p>Until that time you were all assembled in the neighbourhood, was the door open? - No, the door was bolted at nine.</p>
               <p>How happened it then that it was necessary to unbolt it at half past eight; when was it that one of the brothers got up to unbolt the door, to give the pots to the pot girl? - That was at nine, she came presently after I was in bed.</p>
               <p>You said at half past eight? - It was half past eight; what did I say before?</p>
               <p>Never mind what you did say.</p>
               <p>Court. Attend very much to what you say, because your story at present is totally inconsistent with what you said before? - I might mistake, but my meaning is this; the girl brought the beer at half after eight, then I went into the yard, then I went to bed at nine o'clock, then the girl came for the pot, and the eldest brother came down with it: I do not know that I did say half past eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now a word or two more? - Sir, I have no more to say about it.</p>
               <p>No, but I have; what day of the month was this? - The 1st of August.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - Why, it was the month before the last; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>But you can tell how many weeks it was ago? - It may be five or six weeks ago; it was the 1st of August, on a Sunday night.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember the day so particularly? - Because he was taken up the day after.</p>
               <p>You attended at the Justice's and told all this story? - No, I did not, I attended at the Justice's, but I did not say any thing; I told them there were five or six that would contradict the evidence of the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>But you did not tell the Justice you was one? - No; but he was abed, I saw him over his brother's shoulders.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, is not the other brother taller than this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then explain to us how you saw the shortest over the shoulders of the tallest? - I saw him lean over his shoulders, as it may be so, peeping out of the window.</p>
               <p>Court to Rider. Stand there, let one of the officers look to him.</p>

               <p>I was at home all day, and my wife with me; I was standing from eight to nine in the court, talking to the man that keeps the next house, and between eight and nine, I saw the prisoner looking out of window; then I wished the landlord a good night at nine, and I heard him bolt his door; then I left him and went to bed.</p>
               <p>On what occasion did you see the prisoner looking out of window? - Looking out after he had got his supper, he was talking in the court.</p>
               <p>Did anybody come to the house? - Only a girl with some beer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a weaver.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the prisoner? - No otherwise than seeing him come backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>You recollect perfectly this was the 1st of August, do you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what token and circumstance do you recollect this was the 1st of August and not the 8th? - I am sure that was the day.</p>
               <p>But I want to know how you are sure; was your wife brought to bed that day, or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, nothing of that sort, no otherwise than knowing the day of the month.</p>
               <p>What day of the month is to day now? - I do not know, Sir, I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>But you perfectly recollect it was the 1st of August? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now cannot you help us to a reason, or something like a reason? - No.</p>
               <p>Had Rider had his supper before you left him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he sup? - In the garden.</p>
               <p>Who supped with him? - His wife.</p>
               <p>Any body else; one of these lads, did not he, was it this boy or the brother, which of the two was it? - I believe it was the other.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect whether it was not this boy? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>
               <p>So then after you had supped in the garden, I suppose Rider went into his house quietly, and shut it up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never saw either of the Gregory's out of door, as you remember, before nine? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did the other boy go up, about nine or before? - Rather before nine.</p>
               <p>Did he pay any thing towards the beer? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you sup by candle-light? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it, a very dark one? - There were a few stars in the sky.</p>
               <p>Nothing like a moon I take it for granted? - No, not that I could perceive.</p>
               <p>Court. It was full moon that same day, I have just looked at the almanack.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. I do not wish to curtail you in your defence, it is a very serious thing to make a bad case worse by a false defence; these two witnesses that you have brought contradict themselves: anybody you choose to call, do so; but for God's sake do not call people to perjure themselves, they can do you no good.</p>
               <p>NANNY COCKRAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Rider's house about a quarter past eight, with a pot of beer; I cannot recollect the day of the month, I gave the beer to the prisoner at the bar,</p>
               <p>Where did you give it him? - At the door on the last stair but one, and he took it of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now, prisoner, do you think you can do yourself any good by calling these witnesses to contradict themselves in this shocking manner.</p>
               <p>Was the beer paid for? - It was paid for, he took the beer into the room, and put it atop of the table.</p>
               <p>What room was it? - A two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>How did you see that? - I saw him put it on the table, the table was near the window, I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room? - There was another young woman there, and the mother, and two more sons.</p>
               <p>Did he go down stairs again with you when you went out? - No, Sir, I latched the door, and about nine I went again and had the pot away.</p>
               <p>Did you find the pot up two pair of stairs when you went again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it still upon the table? - No, Sir, they brought it down stairs and gave it me at the street door, because the door was bolted, it was one of the lads gave it me, I do not know which it was, but the other two was looking out of window.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150046"/>Was it the prisoner that gave it you? - No, Sir, he was looking out of window.</p>

               <p>Is that in sight of your house? - No.</p>

               <p>He is a very honest lad, he lived in my house about five months, he has left me seven or eight months.</p>

               <p>Court to Levi. What day was it you went to the house? - On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Pray what account did you find there given, had you any conversation with Rider? - Yes, he said, he was in bed that night, that he fastened the door, and the mother came down and opened the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, upon the whole of this case, you will decide the fate of this young man; the circumstances upon which he must be convicted, are chiefly the positive evidence of that child, she swears very positively to him, and she seems to do it with great innocence, and great ingenuity; but at the same time, to be sure, you will make great allowances where a man's life is concerned, for a mistake or misapprehension of a child of that age; however, she tells you she had seen him often go down the court, that he lived in the next court to her, and the father says, the moment after when they quitted him, she told him she knew him, and then told her mother; and Levi says, when she was before the Justice, she singled him out among fifty; the father also speaks very positively to him, but not with such a degree of certainty as the girl, because he does not pretend that he ever saw him before; therefore, all that enables him to swear to the prisoner, is from the view he had of him while the robbery was committed; if it rested merely upon that, to be sure you would hesitate a little: I think it rather difficult for a man thrown down as he was, and this man standing some yards from him, to have so clear and distinct a view of him: however, this circumstance you will take with you, that though the child told him that was the man, that lived in the court just behind their house, that could not lead him to single him out before the justice, because he did not know him: if you believe the prisoner's witnesses, that the girl and the father are mistaken, of course you will acquit him these people contradict themselves very much in the account they have given, and where alibi's are set up, it is only in little circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150048"/> that witnesses can be detected, for they are led to suppose they shall be examined to one particular fact only; it is therefore in the little circumstances of this story, that they do contradict themselves, whether this one or the other, supped in a garden or room, or below or above stairs: in the grand and main point to be sure, that he was at home during that night, they all have spoken very positively: I therefore say no more about it, but that if you think they spoke the truth as to the fact of his being at home during that night, perhaps you will forgive the inaccuracies and little contradictions you have observed; but if you think from those contradictions the whole is a made up story, that they have met together, and concerted such a plan to enable them to say, he was at home during the whole of that afternoon, of course then it will throw discredit upon the whole of their testimony: but if you think that though they forgot those little circumstances, though they have not observed them, yet still in point of fact they are right, and they are not mistaken, of course then you will acquit him. As to character, they have given him that sort of character, that a lad of his age will have before he takes to bad courses; if you find yourselves embarrassed from all these circumstances, and think very possibly it may be true, notwithstanding this little girl and the father do so positively believe he robbed them, that he was at home that night; in short, if any doubt at all hangs upon your minds, if you feel the least suspicions, any balance at all, you know it is much the safest way, and it must be most pleasant to you, to lean to the merciful side and acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did you see the prisoner after the robbery was committed, till you saw him at the Justices? - The first time I saw him was when he robbed me, and the second time was when we took him up.</p>

            . - Yes, your honour.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mr. Milne? - Yes, I saw him at my house.</p>
               <p>When was it? - To the best of my knowledge it was the 15th or 16th of July, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Did he own any horse that was then in your possession? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Of whom did you buy that horse? - I bought it of that man there.</p>
               <p>How long before you saw Milne? - I believe four or five days, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What did you give for it? - Twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>It was a good bargain, was not it? - No, I do not think it, not as the horse was; I do not call myself a proper judge of horses, and I got several people to look at it, and they told me it was not worth any more; it was several hours before I bought him.</p>
               <p>I suppose it was low in flesh? - It was a glandered horse, and ran at the nose, I thought it such.</p>
               <p>I hope you have no other horses, have you? - I have one more, but they told me not to let that horse go with the other in the stable, which I did not.</p>
               <p>Now, friend, when Mr. Milne came to your house and challenged this horse, was the prisoner brought to your house? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Was the horse produced there before him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the same horse you bought of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where did you buy him, Master Webb? - I bought him at home in our yard, he asked me to let him be put in the stable, I was so busy I could not look at him.</p>
               <p>You put him in along with your own Jockey, did you? - No, mine was out at grass.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept horses? - How long?</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, would you give twenty-five shillings for a glandered horse? - At this time I would, because they fetch more money, dog horses do, than they do in winter. I told the man that I should just fetch up a little rubbish from the marshes, then I would sell him for the dogs.</p>
               <p>But you would work him to the bone first, and leave nothing but the bone for the dogs; now, upon your oath, do not you know that the horse was worth five or six pounds? - No, he was not, nor I would not give a halfpenny more for it.</p>
               <p>You only wanted to melt him down; you keep a slaughter-house? - No, Sir, I never sold but ten or twenty in my life, and never bought but this one horse in my life.</p>
               <p>You are a middle man, between the thief and the boiler, are not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was you to sell this to, was you to take him to Smithfield? - Yes, Sir, and twenty-eight shillings is often given for a horse there.</p>
               <p>Court. I presume you had no doubt at all when Mr. Milne claimed it, it was his property? - Yes, because I heard the prisoner had sold some others, a horse, or a cow.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You put this horse on the common the night before you missed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it glandered? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had the horse a cold? - The horse very lately had a cold; I look upon it he was rode hard the night before, and being off the grass.</p>
               <p>What should you have thought would have been the value of the horse? - I gave seven guineas for him in April; and I should be loth to take less for him at this very time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150052"/>Has the horse the glanders now? - I am not a judge, but I do not think he has.</p>

               <p>What did he say? - He desired me to deliver my money.</p>
               <p>What were his words? - Your money or your life! I made answer and told him I had no money, I was a poor working man; the other made answer and said, if you have no money we will murder you! then they knocked me down on my face, and mauled me on my head and shoulders; I had nobody to assist me.</p>
               <p>Was you sensible after you was knocked down? - No; then one of them put their hand in my pocket, and took five shillings and one penny from me.</p>
               <p>What else was done to you? - They ordered me to make the best of my way home, and if I followed them, or made any noise, they would blow my brains out; I then made the best of my way home; and on the Wednesday following I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150054"/> Rellions before Mr. Green, at his office; he was taken up on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you now swear to him positively? - That is the person that had the pistol, and beat it about me, and broke all the stock of it; my arms were all beat to a jelly.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you remember this man's life depends on your recollection of him? - I am very positive that was the man.</p>
               <p>Now then as to the other man? - He was taken the latter part of August; I went to the office after I heard he was taken, and as soon as I saw him I had no doubt but he was the person that assisted in the robbery; I am very positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before the robbery, did you? - Not to my knowledge; it was a quarter past ten, and quite moonlight.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the dress of the people? - One of them had a longish brownish loose coat, and the other had on a brown short jacket.</p>
               <p>Which had the short jacket? - The tallest of the two.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, I had only a pint of ale all day.</p>
               <p>Where had you been? - I had been taking a walk out in the afternoon, and in the evening I called at the Ship in Stepney Church-yard, and had one pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Court. Only one pint? - No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Why, what pleasure can there be in sitting upon a stile? - When a person has nothing else to do. In the mean time a person came out of the lane, who had picked up a piece of copper coin about the size of a farthing, he remarked it to me; he left me, and I directly quitted the stile; I was going to Mr. Clark's to get a pint of beer, and passed these two women, I was then in sight of the prisoner; I saw a knife in his hand, he was cutting a bit of hedge stake.</p>
               <p>Was he in company with these women? - No, Sir; I could perceive another person behind him a little taller than himself; I was rather timidated, thinking something might happen, though I did not think he would at that time of day: I still walked on, and the prisoner with the knife in his hand said, stop! the one laid hold of me by my collar, the other held a knife to my breast, the hedge stake that he was cutting was in his hand, and as he walked on he dropped the stake, and bid me stop; I looked in the prisoner's face, and the other seeing that, said, blast your bloody eyes, who are you staring at? he then pulled my hat over my eyes, and bid me hold it there in that manner myself; I then laid hold of my hat with my left-hand, and put my right-hand in my pocket and gave him all the silver I had, I believe it was four or five shillings, I do not rightly know which, I only swear to three; he then said, give us the gold; I told him I had none; I put my hand in my left-hand pocket and gave him a pair of silver studs, I then told him that was all I had about me: the person who had hold of my collar desired the prisoner to take the silver buckles out of my shoes; I told him indeed they were not silver, nevertheless they took them; in the mean time the other person swore at him, and bid him make haste, for that somebody would come; he then swore at him again, and asked him what he was fumbling about, the prisoner then said he should go the shortest way to work, and he then took the knife and cut the knee buckles out of my breeches knees, (the breeches produced) the other man bid me go about my business, pointing to Old-ford, and not to look back, for he would follow me to the end of the lane; I then walked on very slowly, with my hat over my eyes; I did not hear anybody, I saw nobody behind me, but only the glimpse of the last person's shoulder; I then ran down to Mr. Clark's and told him; I described the persons, and went in search of them, but did not find them that night; I went to Mr. Wilmot's and gave information, and the prisoner was taken up the next day; I saw the prisoner in company with another person walking.</p>
               <p>Was it the same person he was with the day before? - I am not sure, I told him I believed the shortest of the men was the man; he then desired me to be very positive and to look him in the face; the prisoner stooped, I looked him in the face, I passed him and the other, and we took him into custody.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a blue jacket, and a pair of dirty canvas trowsers, an a round hat; he began to hustle in his pocket, and there was a knife in his pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150056"/>What became of the other man? - The other man was acquitted, he was taken at the same time.</p>
               <p>You say the hat was pulled over your face? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you observed the prisoner very particularly before, so as to know him? - I had looked at him stedfastly for half a minute.</p>
               <p>Can you positively undertake to say you have no doubt? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe him before? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long might they stay with you? - I suppose five minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of the two women? - They were in the lane backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Were they in sight when you was robbed? - No.</p>

             is a lodger of ours, in the one pair of stairs; he had a wife that was ill, that was a little way out of town.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing of his giving the key of this room to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - I had the key only the day before.</p>
               <p>Did you go into that room? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver the key to any one? - No, not till Mr. Bailey requested it of me again, the door continued locked.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was taken from under the bed? - I was, the alarm was given about two or a little after, before the prisoner was taken, because he had been in the room sometime.</p>
               <p>How long after might it be? - It might be half an hour.</p>
               <p>When you came into the room, were the windows open? - One was, that I am clear in, and I do not know of the other.</p>
               <p>Were the sashes fastened before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing broke? - No.</p>
               <p>How could they get in then? - I don't know, the fastenings were not very stout, but they were fast; some thing had been put through the sash, which seemed to be pushed through. (The rug and blanket produced.) They are Mr. Bailey's property, I sold them to him when he took the room. On the 11th of August, I was alarmed with a great rapping at my door, I thought it was some disorderly person.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - Two, or rather turned of two, that was after the watchman passed, all was fast then.</p>
               <p>(Bailey deposed to the rug and blanket.)</p>

               <p>On the first of June, I believe it was about eleven at night, I was robbed in <placeName id="t17840915-21-crimeloc103">Pall-Mall</placeName>

               <p>Court. Had your Lordship any opportunity of taking notice of the persons of any of these robbers? - I had of one.</p>
               <p>Please to look at the prisoner, do you know any thing of him? - Yes, my Lord, I am very confident that is the man that robbed me of my watch.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery had you an opportunity of seeing them? - I called after them, the opera was not over, and some of the chairman knowing me, as I turned the corner of that lane said, do not go down that lane, if you do you will be murdered; they all got through the chairmen and escaped; I then thought it was a very proper step to go immediately and write a description of the robbers to Sir Sampson Wright, which I did immediately after being robbed, as he had something very remarkable about him, this particular man had, that was the only man that I knew; he was apprehended, I had a letter from Sir Sampson Wright, telling me he was confident that the man that robbed me was in custody by my description of him, and begging that I would attend the next morning in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did your Lordship attend the next morning? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - I did.</p>
               <p>When you saw him, had you any recollection of him? - I had.</p>
               <p>Please to look at him, and see whether you are confident or not he is the man? - I am very confident, it was a full moon, or within a day of it; and, added to that, it was immediately under a lamp, and having been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150059"/> robbed before, within a short time, of another watch, I particularly remarked the man; I marked his hair very particularly.</p>
               <p>Does your Lordship take this man to be one of them that passed you, or that came up behind you? - No, my Lord, I think he was not one of the first, he was, I believe, on my right-hand.</p>
               <p>In that manner, what opportunity had your Lordship to look at him, or to see him? - It was, as I say, either a full moon, or within a day of it, the clearest night I ever saw, and there was a lamp or two immediately over him.</p>
               <p>Did they run off before you, or behind you? - They ran off before me, and I turned down Market-lane.</p>
               <p>Have you found your watch? - No, I was informed that if I applied in a particular manner I should obtain it; but as for the watch it is very immaterial to me, what I want to have is to have the people convicted if possible, therefore I was determined to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Was it explained to you what that particular manner was? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. This was not one of the people that passed you at first, my Lord? - No, I think not, I am pretty sure it was not, they were lower.</p>
               <p>They rushed by you at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did that surprise or alarm your Lordship? - No.</p>
               <p>These two men turned back on your Lordship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was a little alarmed? - Yes, they came very quick behind me, there were a great many coaches, a whole line of them.</p>
               <p>Nothing was said to your Lordship? - I do not recollect one word.</p>
               <p>The person, whoever he was, that snatched the watch from your Lordship's person, you did not see him perhaps before the watch was gone? - He came up to me quite to my breast, he turned round upon me, the other was stooping, he put his hand to my watch and snatched it.</p>
               <p>It was gone in an instant I suppose? - Yes, and the two men.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship's description I believe chiefly was, that he was a tall young man? - Yes, and his hair I described particularly.</p>
               <p>I believe Sir Sampson's assurances that he had got the right person, made your Lordship more positive, thinking Sir Sampson had a knowledge of the man? - I cannot say; I should not have sworn to him if I had not been very confident of recollecting his person, and the description I have given in my letter of his being tall.</p>
               <p>This was about eleven, and the opera was not over, five people were concerned in it, you, my Lord, must have been under some little surprise? - I was under a surprise when they all ran upon me and squeezed me; I think he is a very remarkable figure, and his hair, his heighth, and looks, are remarkable.</p>
               <p>Yes, he is remarkably tall; Sir Sampson Wright's letter had a little effect upon your Lordship? - Only as to my going to him.</p>
               <p>Court. There were two seals, my Lord, were not there? - There were two, one white and one red, set in gold, one was a post-office seal, I was Post-master General of Ireland then; it was a repeating watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You are the father of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Give the Court an account where he was on the evening of the 1st of June? - On Tuesday evening, on the 1st of June, I came home, and my servant maid let me in, about thirty-four or thirty-five minutes after ten in the evening; as soon as I came in, which is my usual method to see that my family are regularly in bed, I asked the maid if my two sons Andrew and George were in bed, she answered me in the affirmative; I took the candle off the table, and opened the closet door, and I saw them both in bed, on the evening of the first of June, on Tuesday evening; then I went up stairs and went to bed, as I am here upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear of his being taken up? - On the 3d, in the evening.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening? - About eight.</p>
               <p>Did you go before the Justice? - I went to Bow-street to see to extricate him from being taken up, and he was in Covent-garden watch-house in bed.</p>
               <p>Did you attend the examination before the Justice? - I did not, they did not give me liberty to be there; I was there, but it was after Lord Clermont had deposed that he was the person; I came in and spoke to his Lordship; his Lordship recollects me at the examination.</p>
               <p>What way of life have you bred up this young man to? - I kept him constantly employed in one thing or another, reading or writing, and doing any thing that was necessary about the house; I intended him to have been a soldier, to bring him up to the army; I have a great family.</p>
               <p>Did you think of no other employment for him? - I should have done it.</p>
               <p>Did you in fact put him in any way of life except that? - No, my Lord, not at any time as yet.</p>
               <p>What age is he now? - My Lord, he is seventeen, he was born at

               <p>And he has been employed in no other way? - No, my Lord, in no other way; I have another son alive who is a soldier.</p>
               <p>Have you any other that lived to be ten, twelve, or fourteen years old? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever think of putting either of your sons to the business of a plaisterer? - I had an inclination, and he was along with a master, but the master was bed-ridden, and he was not able to take him.</p>
               <p>What was that master's name? - Horax.</p>
               <p>Where did he live? - He lived in St. Martin's-court, I think it is called, by St. Martin's-lane, it goes through the churchyard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150064"/>Was he there upon trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - Till his master fell sick.</p>
               <p>How long might that be? - About three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Was he so long at Mr. Horax's as three quarters of a year? - Yes, backwards and forwards, he boarded with me during that time, washed and every thing.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention that when I asked you; I asked you very particularly? - Really it is foreign to my idea at present, because it is some time since he quitted it.</p>
               <p>How long is it since? - Better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>How much better? - About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>His master was ill, you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, there is a very material piece of evidence, which I think proper first to mention to your Lordship; there was a young man that very much resembled the prisoner at the bar, that was lately executed for a highway robbery, and he communicated something to Mr. Villette, the Ordinary, concerning this robbery; his name was Edwards, he was lately executed, and it was in his last moments he communicated this, and he died with very great contrition, and with great marks of penitence; he told Mr. Villette he could not die in peace until he had communicated something to him, relative to this very robbery; if your Lordship will please to examine Mr. Villette as to that matter.</p>
               <p>Court. To examine a witness to the declarations of a man attainted, and in the moment of suffering execution, cannot be permitted; that would be carrying it farther than if the man was alive, for he could not give evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. It is the declaration of a dying person.</p>
               <p>Court. But the declaration of a dying person that was not attainted has never been held better than the evidence of the man himself upon oath, although what a man declares under such very solemn circumstances, is presumed to be tantamount to speaking by a solemn appeal to God upon oath: however, the Court incline to go thus far for you; if you have any witnesses to show that a man, nearly resembling in person this prisoner, was executed, within the time, that may make it in any degree probable that he may be the man, you may examine to that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. My notion of law is this; as to the dying declarations of an innocent person, where a man says, I know such a thing, for my father in his last moments declared so, that seems to be equivalent to the living witness; but not in the case of a man that would be incompetent to give evidence if alive: I am, therefore, clearly of opinion with my brother Eyre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, a pardon would have restored him to his former competency.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard the whole of this evidence; and with respect to the proposal of the prisoner's Counsel, to examine some witnesses to prove that a young man, very nearly resembling the prisoner in figure, stature and so on, had suffered very lately for crimes of this nature, and that he had acknowledged that he was guilty of this particular fact, it could not, consistent with the rules of evidence, which are rules of justice, be permitted to examine to the declarations of a person under such circumstances: but, they were told, that they might examine witnesses to prove that a person, nearly resembling the prisoner in figure and stature, had suffered for crimes of this nature, and which might be a circumstance in a doubtful case, in favour of the prisoner, to meet the positive testimony of Lord Clermont; but they have not ventured to examine any witnesses to establish that fact, of the similitude of the persons; therefore, that must be all laid out of the case: and it seems by their not calling any witnesses to that matter, as if it was to have rested not upon the similitude, but upon the declaration itself; and we have had experience enough to know, that not much credit is due to the declarations, that have been lately made at least, even under those circumstances. This case stands merely upon the recollection of the witness the Earl of Clermont, and in a recollection of that kind, to be sure the honest man may possibly be deceived, because there may be two persons which nearly resemble each other, and one may be accused of a fact, which the other has committed; and I wish upon the evidence of the alibi, you had been relieved from any other consideration, but whether you believed that evidence or not; but in this particular case it so happens, that they run the time so near to the time of the robbery, that if it should be clear that the young man was in bed, then it will depend upon the circumstance, whether Lord Clermont is right in his idea of the time, the fact was committed before the Opera broke up, my Lord Clermont supposes about eleven: now when the watchman went half past ten, is not a thing quite certain, or whether the father's watch went right, who says, he came in at thirty-four minutes past ten, (and by the way, it is a singular circumstance for him to note at the time) one thing you have to consider, is in the first place, whether you believe the fact of his being at home, notwithstanding the contradictions of the witnesses; if you think the contradictions may be accounted for, without imputing them to bad motives, and a design to come here to speak that which is not true; and if you in consequence give credit to these witnesses, on the part of the prisoner, that the fact was as they have sworn, then one difficulty is got over: or if you think it is a matter seriously doubtful, if you think in your own minds, that Lord Clermont may be mistaken, in that case you will acquit the prisoner: the whole case is before you, and you will judge of it as favourably as you can, remembering on the one hand, that these kind of street robberies should not go unpunished, and on the other, that an innocent man should not suffer, because the party who is robbed, thinks he is quite sure of the person of the prisoner; as that is certainly a fact, that is liable to be mistaken by the honestest and best intentioned men in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope for the mercy of the Court, I am a young man of seventeen.</p>

               <p>Who gave you that intelligence? - A window woman said, a person called on such a kind of horse, and had a glass of gin; I then had very strong intelligence from the turnpike men, I went on the road from Reading to Oxford, I heard of her at Hounslow, I got a man to assist me and examine the town, and we came on and got intelligence at several different places; when we came to Smallborough-green, we heard the mare was sold, and the man that sold her was gone back to Hounslow, and inquired for a place to buy him some clothes; upon that we found the prisoner at a little private house at Hounslow, it was in the afternoon, I cannot say the time, he was laying upon the bed, some of his clothes were off and some on; I knew the prisoner before, he worked for me the day before, he had worked for me on and off, for about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>How do you know? - I paid him, he denied knowing anything about it, but afterwards as we went along in the post-chaise, I asked him for what reason he did it, and he confessed it.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I asked him the price for what he sold it, I said, I heard he sold it for three guineas, he said it was only two; he said, he took it out of the field, and put the bridle and saddle upon it and rode it away; he owned it, before that I asked him, if he did it for real want or no.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be of service to him? - No, I do not recollect I did, but I believe the other men said the best he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150068"/> could do, would be to own it, if he had sold it, and upon that he said, he had sold it for two guineas; we then came on for town, and we found the mare on Snow-hill, I did not go myself for her, we found her in the possession of one

Did you, before he acknowledged the taking the mare, bridle, and saddle, say any thing to him, to induce him to make that confession? - Not at all, he told me, that as he was coming over the heath, the man that purchased it, asked him if it was to sell, and he said yes, it was, for ten pounds, and that Malone said, let me try her, and if she is a good one, I will give you six guineas for her, and when he came to Hounslow, he said, I will give you but four guineas, you have stole this mare, and when he came to Smallborough-green, he would give him but two guineas, or else he would take him up on suspicion of stealing the mare; he told me all this in the chaise, as we were coming from Hounslow to London; I have been hunting after Malone, but I cannot find him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had one pound four shillings taken away from me, which was my own property, I never took the mare at all, nor know nothing about it, I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 24th of July, Mr. Macmanus and I were coming along Sutton-street, just before one at noon, and I saw the prisoner Lee stand at a public house door with the landlady, and as soon as ever he saw me walking down the street, both the landlady and he turned in sharp immediately, I followed him very close, he ran through into a back parlour, where the other prisoner was; I got hold of him, and I felt the outside of his pockets, and I thought he had some pistols; I searched his pockets, and found these four table spoons and marrow spoon, I secured him, and Macmanus searched the other; I looked at the clock, and it wanted a quarter of one, as soon as I got down to the office, a gentleman brought a spoon to match them with. Lee said a man gave him the spoons to carry: his turning back so sharp gave me a suspicion.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer belonging to the East India Company, on the 3d of this month the prisoner was at work in the cellars, and he came up and told us it was time to come to work; we told him we would go down by and by, then he went away towards a vault, the vault is two yards off; going before we observed he had a vast great lump here behind, his breeches were out so that he could scarce walk; he stood in the vault about three minutes, and we watched him if he came out with this lump behind, and he did, and he went down Cree Church Lane; I followed him just behind him, and at the bottom of Cree Church Lane, I lost sight of him; I turned short round the corner, I went under an arch, and there were a couple of women standing, and I went three doors beyond the arch, and there I saw the prisoner in a chandler's shop, then I retreated back, and I saw him go by with the lump gone out of his breeches; the other witnesses and I ran immediately to the chandler's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150072"/> shop, and I went to the man and said, says I, do you buy pepper? no, says the man, I cannot say I do; I saw it lay in the scale, and the woman threw it down off the counter, and she pulled and I pulled; the master ran away immediately, and never said a word; we did not stop the prisoner then, but when the constable seized him, he said I know of no offence, and when he came to the India-house he said it was his property, and he sold it to a Jew for one shilling a pound; he said he bought it at Blackwall the day before, which was a red letter day, and gave one shilling a pound for it; then he was ordered in before the Committee; I was not there: then he was ordered in before the Solicitor, and the Solicitor said, undo your breeches, and he did, and there came out five pepper corns.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose pepper it was? - It is black pepper.</p>
               <p>I know that, but who does it belong to? - I cannot say whether he did not buy it at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>What quantity is there generally in a package? - Sometimes two hundred and three quarters, or three hundred.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any of those packages cut open or broke? - We should never have looked in that hole unless we had cleared the hole out; it is very hard to swear to pepper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I believe all black pepper is pretty much alike.</p>
               <p>Court. What were you in the pepper warehouse? - I was employed in sifting, and putting it forward for sale.</p>
               <p>That was your employment and his at the time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is it at all common to have some of the pepper corns about your person when you go home at night? - I will not disannul that, you do not hear me say he stole pepper; he may have pepper come out of his knees, and his stockings and shoes too.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not he say, when he was examined, that he bought it as smuggled pepper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he ever deny having sold it? - No; he said he sold it to a Jew over night; as soon as he saw the bag going from Billiter-lane he said it was his property, for he bought it yesterday, and sold it to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not he superintend you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Gentlemen, here is no evidence at all against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Has the man any family? - He has a wife, but I do not know whether they live together.</p>

               <p>Court to Jones. Your attention is very laudable, but I would recommend to you never to take that method again, by leaving temptation in people's way; a drawer open with money in it, is a temptation, and especially where you yourself have told us, that the prisoner was in a state that made him want money.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver, I live in Nicholls-street, Bethnal-green; I received a quantity of unwrought silk from Mr. Berry, but I cannot tell when, for we never keep any memorandum; I received about eighty yards if it had all been made out in one, which it was to do; I made about fifty-five yards, I left it, as usual, on Sunday the 25th of July in the loom, at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it silk or sattin? - It was sattin, it is all silk.</p>
               <p>What became of it after you left it? - I was out the 25th of July, and being informed about five in the afternoon that my work was lost, I saw it afterwards with Mr. Wood, I know it is the same; the silk is here. (The silk produced.) There are some threads out, and the other part answers to it; at the beginning of it there are a few shoots of pale pink.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that mark so clearly your own, as to enable you to know it if you had seen it any where else? - I believe I could.</p>
               <p>Is the pale pink the usual mark? - They mark with different colours, but I cannot swear to it from that; I swear to it positively from its sitting the remnant that is left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Council. Where does the prisoner live? - In the same house, and worked for me in the loom.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose house was it? - Mine; the loom was in my part of the house.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that half of the house you rented? - Yes; there was one room and a shop to work in; the shop was two pair of stairs higher than the room.</p>
               <p>Who occupied the intermediate rooms? - A person that is at the door, one Mrs. Larden.</p>

               <p>What did you do in consequence of that? - He told me it was some sattin; and Mr. Stillwell went up into the shop, and missed the work.</p>

               <p>Was it wrapped round him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was he sober? - I do not know that he was right sober, and I cannot say he was drunk, he had been drinking part of a pint of beer or so, but he was in his senses, I rode with him to Clerkenwell.</p>

               <p>The prisoner offered a horse for sale, I told him I knew a man that wanted such a horse as that, I went with him three miles, and the horse was too little for that Gentleman, the boy said he would sell him for any money he could get for him; he said three guineas, I told him I would have him; coming back I asked him how he came by the horse, he said his master bought it for him, that it was wages he had saved, I told him I would not buy it, without he would go with me to his master, he refused that, I suspected him, and took him into custody, he told us coming along, it was Mr. Tarlin's horse, and that he lived with Mr. Tarlin, and had stolen it from him.</p>
               <p>Court. What means did you use to prevail upon him? - I told him coming along that in case he would tell the truth, whether he had stole it or not, that we should not take him before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you recollect whether that window was shut or not? - No, I do not; I had a black boy, and I took him into custody on suspicion, and upon something I heard respecting this prisoner, I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him at your house with the black boy? - Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - The same afternoon; I took him right facing my door, at the eating house; he had the watch and shoes upon him: he said before the Magistrate that this black boy conveyed them out of the window to him; he owned to fourteen guineas; he had changed my buckles and bought a new pair, and a new chain to my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I suppose your first suspicion was, that the boy had robbed you, and thrown up the window by way of trick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the boy tell you any thing about it? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>You did not find any part of your house broke at all? - No, I cannot tell whether the back window was broke open or not.</p>
               <p>Before this poor fellow had been before the Magistrate, had not he been told that he should be hanged? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you, or somebody else in your hearing, say to the prisoner over and over again, that if he would tell all he knew, it would be better for him? - I never heard anything of the kind.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is an act made long since for the protection of labouring people especially, who are necessitated to leave their dwellings in the day time, and it makes it capital for any person to break into a dwelling house in the day time, no person being therein, and to steal therein to the value of five shillings; but as this act of Parliament was made a century ago, that which a century ago was of the value of five shillings, should rather be considered in a case like this, and in favour of life, than what we value at five shillings now: and if you are of that opinion, you may find this prisoner guilty of stealing to the value of 4 s. 10 d. which will acquit him of the capital part of the indictment.</p>

            ; after being in bed some time the prisoner came to my room door and wakened me, I let him in, and he went through my room into the next room, which was his room; my brother came up stairs afterwards, and awakened me again, and asked me if my watch was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150084"/> safe; I put my hand over my head, where I usually hung it, and my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the night was that? - That was about half past twelve; I got out of bed, and went to search for my breeches, which were under the bolster, and they were gone; then I searched about the room, and went down and got a light; then I looked at my chest, and it was open, and all my things were gone, and we went down directly, and got two more men, and we saw the prisoner stand within less than twenty yards of my brother's house, which is at the neat-houses; I ran and caught hold of him, he was walking away when I came up to him; I told him you are my prisoner, you have robbed me; he seemed not to know any thing of it; we took him to the watch-house: the things were hid just by, under some weeds on the bank, and my pocket book was found upon him; the things have been ever since in my own possession, all but the pocket book, which is in the hands of Mr. Brown, the officer of the night; the fourteen shillings I never had, and I could not swear to money. (The things produced.) Here is the coat, waistcoat, and breeches I had on, I am sure they were mine; here is my watch, with my name upon it: this coat was not taken out of the room, but taken out of the chest; the key of the chest was in my breeches pocket: here are two more coats which were in the bundle I found; this coat and a pair of breeches belonged to my younger brother, who is at home, and another coat and a pair of breeches were in my care: here are a nankeen and a linen waistcoat, mine; this coat I have on, and that coat were found also; and a silver hat buckle, and a silver sleeve button were in the pocket book that was found in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of these things that were your own property? - The watch twenty shillings; the coat, waistcoat, and breeches I have on ten shillings; the nankeen and linen waistcoats four shillings; the leather breeches five shillings, the neck handkerchief sixpence.</p>
               <p>When you took the prisoner to the watch-house, what did he say? - He still denied it: when he was searched there were fourteen shillings found in one pocket, without any other money; there were one shilling and three pence found in another pocket, and my pocket book.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the pocket book; - Sixpence; the silver hat buckle sixpence; the sleeve buttons sixpence.</p>

               <p>How long had he been out then? - But a very little while, about half an hour; he made no resistance, but denied every thing; and after we took him to the watch-house, and found the pocket book on him, we went back and looked for the rest of the things, and we found them within five yards of the place where we saw him stand.</p>
               <p>How were they concealed? - They were under a burdock; and there was some dirt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150085"/> or stuff put over the watch in the neck handkerchief, and the corner hung out, or else we should not have found the watch.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your pocket book? - Yes, here is the buckle and button which were in the book when I lost it, without any paper round them.</p>

               <p>Was you on horseback? - No, I was upon the foot board behind the carriage, there was another man behind with me, I cannot say whether the prisoner was the person, it was too dark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The person that robbed the carriage, rode away pretty fast, did not he? - Yes, very fast.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol, on the 5th of August we were on our duty on the King's road, till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150087"/> we came to the road that leads to the Fulham road, on the right-hand, and there we parted, the other two men went on to the King's road till they heard of this robbery, then they came and informed me of it, and I said, there is the man, and they told what sort of a man he was, and his horse and every thing, and a hat lapped over his eyes; I said he had just passed.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was that? - It was about ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>How far from Bloody-bridge? - Not half a mile, he went into the pond that is by the side of Chelsea-common, by that time we came up level with the pond, and he came out of the pond, and one of the men came up and we took him, he was going to put his hand in his pocket, and Carr took his hand away, and put his hand into his pocket, and he found a pistol, and I took him off his horse and searched him, and found a metal watch in his left-hand waistcoat pocket, and a medal and one half-penny, with some holes in it: we went to the Admiral

               <p>What sort of a horse? - A dark mare.</p>
               <p>About what size? - I am not acquainted with what they call the hands; it was a middle size horse, rather of the smallish kind, we secured him; when I took him off the horse, he clapped his hands together, and said, O Gentlemen, if you knew my distress you would pity me! I told him we were only doing our duty, and we would by no means use him ill at all; this is the watch that was taken from him.</p>
               <p>(Produced with the glass and hour hand broken.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I cannot depose to the watch, it was such a sort of one, a green shagreen one, the glass was not broke, I never knew the number of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. When you took the watch out of his pocket, was the glass broke? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the glass in his pocket? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the watch Mrs. Popham? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. Has the watch been in your custody ever since? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your watch, I think you say, Madam, had neither the glass nor hour hand broken? - No, I am very sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Creedland. I believe when you came up not knowing you or having a good opinion of you, he was so mistaken as to take you for highway men. he told you, you should have every thing he had, or something of that sort? - He said, for God's sake, Gentlemen, do not use me ill, any thing I have is at your service, when I took him off his horse, he was trembling in such a manner, he said, O Gentlemen, if you knew my distress, you would pity me!</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Just what I should have said, on the like occasion; now in what situation was his horse, like one that had been gallopped vehemently? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen upon this evidence, it is unnecessary to put the prisoner upon his defence, nobody can swear to the man, and the only circumstance that could have fixed him at all with this robbery, would have been that of the watch, then perhaps it might have been evidence to have been left to you, to have given it the construction you pleased: but, you see the watch cannot be identified.</p>

               <p>I was binding hay on Mr. Harrison's premises; I saw the prisoner Jones go to Mr. Meecham's garden hedge, and look over it, between twelve and one at noon; I never saw him before; then I saw him come out of the garden, and go back to prisoner King, who was in one part of the field, and bring a table cloth in his hand; King got up immediately, and they both went over the fence together into the next field.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was King to the garden when Jones went in or came out of it? - He was about one hundred and fifty yards off, he was within sight of him: I followed the prisoners, and about ten yards before I got up to them Jones dropped the table cloth, which I picked up; I took notice then of the marks, I know it again now: King dropped down in a ditch, pretending to case himself, and Jones ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. I know nothing of King, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner King called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to King. What was you doing in the fields? - I was going to Hampstead, a man owed me twenty pence for some tatoes, and I saw this boy running, and I turned back, I thought the man was going to lick him for being in the fields.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. What age are you? - I am fifteen, my friends cannot come.</p>

               <p>Had you any consideration with him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue with you in that capacity before he went away for any time? - I think till the 10th of May last, I disliked him much, and I parted with him, he came to me again the 19th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take him again? - His friends called upon me, and promised that his behaviour should be better in future; he continued with me then till the 26th of July; I parted with him then, his bad behaviour was the cause of his leaving me.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Did he come to you again? - No.</p>
               <p>During the time that he was with you as your apprentice, where did he lay? - In the shop under the counter.</p>
               <p>Had he, in the capscity of your apprentice, an access to your property? - Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any property from your shop about that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can the amount of that property, and the sort of property that it was? - I cannot speak with any certainty to the time that they were lost, but they were all lost: on the 8th of September in the evening, a gentleman came to pay the interest of a watch, a gold repeater, which had been two years; I searched for it, and could not find it; the same gentleman happened to have a number of things, I looked over the whole belonging to that gentleman, and missed about one hundred and twenty pounds-worth; the next morning about eight o'clock, the prisoner Hewlett called for his breakfast, he did not lay in my house that night, he had not laid in my house from the 26th of July, when I parted with him; when he came on the 9th in the morning, I called him up stairs and taxed him about these, mentioning the different articles; he said he did not know any thing of them: I had a constable in the next room, and I charged him with him; upon searching him, we found a metal watch and some other things.</p>
               <p>Was that metal watch your property? - I cannot say, he told me at that time it was pawned with me in the name of Leard, for two guineas; I believe nothing else was found upon him.</p>
               <p>(The metal watch produced by the constable.)</p>

               <p>Court. Before he gave you that account, had any conversation passed between you and him, in which you gave him reason to believe he would escape punishment if he made a full discovery? - Not the least; we went before Sir

               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Council. Did Sir Robert make any promises? - No.</p>
               <p>You had a constable in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. What account did the prisoner give of the property? - The prisoner sent a man named M'Donald to tell me he could give me an account; he told me he had sold two rings and a locket to Mr. Shelley, silversmith, in the Strand, for forty-nine pounds, and a gold watch he had sold to Mr. Heather, for twelve guineas; at the same time he told me, says he, you do not know where my lodgings are, they are the corner of Orange-court, Leiceister-fields, mentioning that there was some chain, or something of that kind in that lodging; I do not recollect that he metioned any thing else; I went to Mr. Shelley's, and there I found one of the rings, a large cluster diamond ring.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that ring in your opinion? - I think between thirty and forty pounds is about the value.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other property of your's at Mr. Shelley's? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go to any other place in search of your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any other circumstance respecting the prisoner Hewlett? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. That ring which you found at Mr. Shelley's, have you any knowledge of it? - Yes, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>It was a ring that had been pledged with you? - I can swear to the major part of the the things, and that in particular.</p>
               <p>- SHELLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Is that the same ring that was pledged with you? - It was sold to me by the young man in the red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>What did he say his name was? - Upon my word I did not ask his name; but I think it necessary to convince this Court, that I gave a full price for it; I shewed it to Mr. Blank, in Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street, at least my workman did; he asked him forty guineas for it, and he said, to oblige him, as he had been a customer, he would give him thirty guineas; now you will find, Sir, I gave thirty-five pounds for it.</p>
               <p>What did he represent himself to be? - The person that called cut an elegant appearance; I cannot say who he was, he was not in my shop three minutes; he was elegantly dressed, with a number of superfluous ornaments: the servant appeared in the afternoon, and called for the money, which servant was the prisoner Stockdale.</p>
               <p>(The ring deposed to by Mr. Priestman.)</p>
               <p>To Priestman. Do you know the prisoner Stockdale? - I have seen him two or three times in my shop about a twelve month ago, he was pledging some things, and said he was going to the north of England.</p>
               <p>Did he pledge any thing at your shop? - Yes, I think he did, I had a good deal of conversation with him about the north of England, I have seen him twice since in my shop.</p>
               <p>What was he doing at those other times? - One time I remember I was behind the counter,

               <p>Did he stay to bargain for it? - No, he went out immediately, and was sorry he had given trouble.</p>
               <p>What appearance did he then make? - A very genteel one; I believe I asked the boy by remembering his face: I went to one of Stockdale's lodgings, Mrs. Rix's, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150091"/> Oxford-street, that was after Hewlett was apprehended; I found there this gold watch, with chain, seals, and trinkets, I found it in a box up stairs, and this locket, and these silver buckles, and these knee buckles, they are paste; I can swear to the gold watch, I sold it once for thirty pounds, and it was pledged with me since: it was the watch alone, the whole together is worth that at a low valuation.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to any of the other articles? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>How did you know this lodging that you speak of to be Stockdale's lodging? - From the information of another person.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - One of the witnesses in this business.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Perry.</p>
               <p>In what capacity was Stockdale the first time you saw him? - He told me he was going down as a servant with Colonel Lowther, to Lowther Hall in Westmoreland.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the prisoner Stockdale at your house in company with Hewlett? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>April twelve months I think you say was the time you took this lad as an apprentice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he bound for? - Four years.</p>
               <p>He is very young, is not he? - They told me he was eighteen.</p>
               <p>You parted with him once and took him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people do you keep in your shop? - I have one boy.</p>
               <p>He was frequently left with the controul of the business of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To transact all your business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To take in pledges? - No, he was too young.</p>
               <p>You never suffered him to take anything in? - No, I did not, he migh t a shilling article, but things of value I took in myself.</p>
               <p>Suppose a person came to your shop to redeem an article that had been pledged, was not it his business to deliver that article? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that was his business while he was with you in your absence? - I have hardly been out of the shop since the 10th of May.</p>
               <p>What kind of books do you keep in the shop? - Day books and cash books.</p>
               <p>This fell to his lot, I suppose, when you was out to manage and settle these books? - From the 10th of May I do not think I ever was out, except on a Sunday; I suspected him, and looked very sharp after him; but I took him again upon his friends telling me he should behave better: I sent to the Rotation-office for a constable.</p>
               <p>Where did you take the lad to when you spoke to him of your losses having been discovered, you first of all spoke to him in your own house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you threaten him? - I asked him what was become of those things, and he said he knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>What did you reply? - I charged him with the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you hold no further conversation with him? - No, I did not; I asked him about these things, he sent for me and told me.</p>
               <p>Did nothing more pass between you and him in your house? - I was not four minutes with him, but I was present during the whole time between him and the constable.</p>
               <p>And nothing more passed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you, upon your oath, tell him it would be better for him if he would discover where the property was? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was considerably agitated, I take it for granted, at these losses? -</p>
               <p>Court. Were those memorandums that you have in your hand taken at or near the time; I see you have occasionally referred to them? - These have been taken by myself since.</p>
               <p>When the recollection was perfect in your mind, how near the time? - Within a day or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150092"/>Court. Then it is very right you should refresh your memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have no objection to it. Then you say you have a perfect recollection of the matter, and do not recollect anything of that kind said to the poor lad at the bar? - No.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards he sent for you himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What struck you then, did not his penitence induce you to make him some promises? - No conversation passed.</p>
               <p>What did you say, answer the question, either you have or you have not a recollection; if you have not I will not ask you: did no other conversation pass, did you give him no promises or assurances of favour? - I never gave him any promise, not the least, I believe I hardly ever opened my mouth; I took a pencil and paper, and he gave me an account immediately.</p>
               <p>Then you say, in the capacity in which he served you, it was frequently his duty to receive money and restore the pledges? - Yes, I was always present, I suppose.</p>
               <p>But when you was not there: when did you examine your stock? - Since the commitment.</p>
               <p>Then when the property was taken from your shop you do not know at all? - No; I looked over the book before, and missed these articles.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the amount of what you missed in the whole, nearly? - About eight hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What, altogether, now casting up your account you find you are eight hundred pounds short? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion, that where it is uncertain at what time the things were taken, it is necessary to prove the value of forty shillings in some one article, in order to make the offence capital.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Court. There is no necessity for any justification of your conduct, Mr. Heather, you were deceived by appearances that might have deceived any body, and I know no man that is more careful than you; what did he sell the ring to you for? - Fifteen guineas two days afterwards, here is a receipt for this too; Mr. Priestman knew nothing of the ring till I took it to him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known him about eight years, his general character as to honesty is a very good one.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to Mr. Heather, who was going to justify his conduct in buying articles of this value from a stranger, and was prevented by me, I thought it was unnecessary; for it is very evident he was deceived by appearances which might deceive any man whatever; and it is but justice to the character of Mr. Heather for me to say, that he has often appeared in this Court, in a light which puts him above all suspicion; he has appeared on all occasions to have been as circumspect and fair, and to have transacted his business as properly as any man in the trade. Gentlemen, with respect more particularly to the case before you, you ought to separate the evidence respecting the prisoners, for it is very different: and first, with respect to the prisoner Hewlet, he is in the situation of a servant in the prosecutor's house, with access to every thing that is there; he is proved by several different persons to have pledged several different articles to a considerable amount, with different people, which articles were missed and lost from Mr. Priestman, while he was in his service; added to this, there is proved a direct acknowledgment on his part, that he stole the things which he sold to Mr. Shelley, so that with respect to the prisoner Hewlet, if you believe the evidence, I am affraid it does not leave any room to doubt of the truth of this charge, or any latitude with respect to the value, for the things separately taken are worth more than forty shillings; I say separately taken, for there must be to the value required by law, which is forty shillings, stolen at one particular time, to make it a capital charge under this indictment, which is for stealing goods in a dwelling house; for if one hundred pounds worth of goods were stolen at an hundred different times, and included in one sum, they would not amount to a capital offence, inasmuch as an hundred distinct felonies all together will not make one capital felony: but in this case, the value of the things produced does not leave much room to doubt; so much therefore for the state of the evidence for Hewlett. With respect to Stockdale, the case is different, and you are to consider whether the evidence against him does not rather prove him, in this case, the receiver of these goods, than the person who actually stole them: the finding the property on a person when it does not appear how they came by it, is common evidence in every day's practice, that they are the persons who stole it; such is certainly the presumption of law: if therefore this property had been found at Stockdale's, without their being any other visible person standing forth as the thief, it would have been evidence undoubtedly to shew that Stockdale was the thief: in like manner, if property is found at the lodging of two persons, who lodged together, it is evidence to be left to the Jury that they were both concerned: so if parties are proved to be together, or very near the place at the time a robbery is committed, and the stolen property is found in the possession of one, that is evidence against the whole. But in this case there is a visible person, who is brought forward to you, by evidence, as the person who stole the property of Mr. Priestman; and though they endeavour to prove a connection between him and Stockdale, that is as well accounted for on the footing of his being a receiver as a thief; and though they prove him to have been there early in the morning, and all night, yet you must be clearly satisfied that he was actually present, and assisting and co-operating with Hewlett at some of the times when he stole property; that is necessary to make him a principal: for whatever connection and confederacy, whatever knowledge of his felonious intention, and whatever part he might have taken, yet if not actually present and assisting, he is not a principal but an accessary; and the times he slept there, there was another person with them, so when he was in the shop, there were other persons with him in the shop. However, if you think he was present and assisting at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150096"/> any time when the value of forty shillings was stolen, he is equally guilty with Hewlett; but if you think that Hewlett availed himself of his access to the property of his master, and disposed of it to the hands of Stockdale, in that case he is a receiver, and upon this indictment he must be acquitted, liable to such other prosecution as may be commenced against him.</p>

               <p>Did you ever find your things again? - Yes, I got my handkerchief, he had pawned it; he said if I would not hurt him, he would send for his mother and get it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Did you promise not to prosecute him if he would give it you? - I never mentioned no such a word.</p>

               <p>About half after eight on the 21st of July, I was coming through the new alley near St. George's Church, and I heard some people say that them two chaps before had offered that sail cloth to sell; I followed them, and came up with one, and asked him if he would sell it, he said yes; he asked eighteen shillings, says I, that is too much, I will give you fourteen shillings, they seemed agreeable to take it; the other had it on his shoulder: says I, can you give me change for a guinea, no says they, then come into the public house: when we came in there, says I to one of them, why you have stole this sail cloth; yes, says he, you know that, or else the price would not be so: I stopped them, they endeavoured to get away; I went for an officer. This is the canvas.</p>

               <p>I found the canvas in a narrow alley.</p>

               <p>I met this boy with a bolt of canvas, which I saw him pick up at the corner of Foul-lane in the Borough, I spoke to him, and he said he was going to sell it, and says I, you will be taken up and put into Newgate; no, says he, I will not, for you saw me find it; so we went and met this man, and he asked us to sell it, he brought us into an alehouse, and called for a pot of beer, and then he wanted to turn us out of the house, and we would not go without our property.</p>

               <p>The indictment was opened by Mr. Reeves, and the case by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Counsel for the Prisoner, objected that there was no such offence under the act of parliament, as that mentioned in the indictment, and that it must be the true will of a seaman, to which the party offending takes a false oath; and that the indictment charged this not to be the true will of the seaman, but a forged will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester replied, that the indictment did not charge at all that this was the true will of

            , but the prisoner did then and there produce, and exhibit, a certain paper writing purporting to be the last will, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t17840915-50-person619">

            . The affirmance is, that the paper did not contain the true last will and testament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The act of parliament says, if any person shall take a false oath, to obtain the probate of any will or wills, in order to receive the payment of any wages; now this man goes to the proper officer, and there he takes a false oath, for the purpose of obtaining probate, which when obtained, is to enable him to receive the money due to the heirs of the deceased; whether therefore the true will or not is not material, the only question is, whether the oath was a false one, and taken for the purpose of obtaining probate; your Lordship recollects the case of Kimber, in Foster, where there was no such person as the Testator that ever had existence; and the Judges determined, that it was an aggravation of the offence, forging the person as well as the thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves said a few words on the same side; and Mr. Garrow replied, and contended, that this is not a will, but a paper, partly written and partly printed, purporting to be a will.</p>
               <p>The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

               <p>Lucy. He at that time appeared to be under a great deal of anxiety, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, and wished to know if it could be settled; I told him I would serve him as consistently as I could with my duty as an officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you say any thing more, did you give him reason to hope, or suppose, that if he told you any thing, you would befriend him? - No, my Lord, not at all, I was very sorry for his unhappy situation when, I saw that paper he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and desired to know if it could be settled; I told him I was not empowered, and I would mention it to Mr. Murphy, which I did, upon which he wrote a letter to a person, and signed his name Kyrin Ryen: here are two papers that were found. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, as he had represented himself to be a man of property: I think the letter was to a person at Walworth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you got the letter here? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us any thing about it. How much did Mr. Murphy's bill amount to in this business? - I know of no bill.</p>
               <p>You was to consult Mr. Murphy about the propriety of settling of it? - No, Sir, I spoke to Mr. Murphy whether such a thing could be done to serve the man.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Quirk present at that time? - No; I know him.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time with Mr. Quirk, or do you know of any offer being made by Mr. Murphy, that on payment of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150103"/> this bill of fifty pounds, he should be discharged? - No.</p>

I told them to keep clear of the woman, they would not leave her, so I took all to the watch-house; the watchman searched the prisoner in another room, but I was not there.</p>

Did you see no alehouse boy? - I never saw the boy at all, I did not know any more of the place where I was, than a fool, I think in my own mind, that I staid more than an hour in the place after he was robbing me, my husband met me in the fields, coming from the other public house, I did not tell my husband how he had served me, till three or four days after, till I was very bad, I was so frightened, I am sure this is the man, he left this bundle behind him, there is nothing in the bundle but some old wood, and hellebore.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not worth your three half-guineas, and half-crown? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First and foremost, it is too long a story, and I am not willing to give the Court and Jury any trouble; ask her whether she swore a robbery at Litchfield-street? - No, I did not, I swore that he threatened my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did you tell this story exactly at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. After having stated the evidence short, it does not become me to press any thing further to you, it is for your discretion, but it is my duty to say to you, this is the usual course of evidence, in cases of this sort, at the same time it is totally in your breasts, to say you are satisfied or not; and you are not bound to give your verdict, because numberless other Juries have given their verdict upon evidence of the same kind; for my own part, I never feel any difficulty when in a capital case, where a man's life is concerned, and a Jury pauses so considerably as you do, in such a case I never hesitate to recommend it to them to acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Did you lose a great coat last July? - I did, on the 31st of July, it was my coachman's great coat, I was returning to my house in Charlotte-street, in a chariot that was not my own, my own being out of repair, and it was one that my coachman had got for that day, there was a particular injury done to the carriage, I was going along <placeName id="t17840915-55-crimeloc274">Hart-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you see the prisoner taken? - No; I found the coat on the pavement, some distance from the carriage; I did not see the prisoner about the carriage.</p>

               <p>What became of the husband? - I do not know, I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Is he run away? - The Justice did not commit him, he was discharged before the Magistrate: I found some of my things in East Smithfield, and some in the Minories, the pair of sheets were with Thomas Green.</p>
               <p>Is that pawn-broker here from East Smithfield? - No, the sheet is here.</p>
               <p>What way of life were this man and his wife? - They told me they were American Loyalists, and were waiting for money, and they promised us week after week to pay us, so I went into the room to see if my property was there, it was marked A. D.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Had these poor people paid you any rent? - Yes, they paid me five shillings, out of which I lent her half a crown and a shilling.</p>
               <p>In what way did the husband take it, from week to week, or for any considerable time? - It was not him that took it, he was not present.</p>
               <p>Court. Supposing the husband to be a party, and privy to this, the wife cannot be guilty; and it is impossible that the sheet could be missing from the bed without the husband's knowing it.</p>

               <p>Court. Were not there other people running on the cry of stop thief? - A good many, but he was a great way before them all: the prisoner told me an acquaintance of his lodged there, and he mentioned that before the Justice, that he went to see for him; he said he did not know how he came into the room, the door was open: I felt his clothes, he had two coats on, and in the inside lining of his under coat I found a false key, which I have in my pocket, that would not open the door, but one more was found upon him at the Justice's, which opened the door the same as the right key did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You spoke of the box being moved, where was it moved to? - As it may be from the corner of the side of the bed; it has stood in a corner of the room for many years.</p>

            , for the crime of murder! you have heard the charge read to you from the indictment, and I shall stare to you the principal circumstances that led to the unhappy fact, which is the subject of the present enquiry, in order that you may form a judgment of the matter with more ease and facility. Gentlemen, on the 1st of August, about six in the evening, there was some disturbance in the prison of <placeName id="t17840915-66-crimeloc330">Clerkenwell</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17840915-66-crimeloc330" type="placeName" value="Clerkenwell"/>

                        targets="t17840915-66-off327 t17840915-66-crimeloc330"/> by the prisoners, concerning the distribution of their provisions, which were either detained longer, or not given at the usual place; the deceased was a prisoner, committed I think for six months, about half of which was expired, and was standing at a wicket gate within a partition wall of the prison. It is very material for you, Gentlemen, to consider the situation of the prison itself: there is a partition wall that separates the men from the women; there is a gate that differs very materially from the outer gate, and I mention this, because it is very natural to suppose the defence will be, that the prisoners were endeavouring to get out; but whatever this noise or disturbance might be, it was not likely to affect the safety of the prison, when it was not made in an apartment contiguous to the outward gate; so the fact is stated to me, that it happened in a gate in this partition: Gentlemen, there were soldiers in the prison, how they came there I know not, and they refused, at the instance of a Mr. Forsyth, whether he is the keeper or no I cannot tell, they refused to fire; but the prisoner at the bar, who is a watchman, snatched a blunderbuss out of the hands of one of the soldiers, and levelled it at this woman, and instantly shot her dead: the deceased, as I understand, has two children, and was gone seven months with child; but this I mention as a circumstance rather to be lamented, than as a matter for your consideration. These, Gentlemen, are the outlines of the case, as stated to me in my instructions; the law undoubtedly will afford every kind of support to the ministers of Justice, and persons employed as their assistants, let them be of what description they may, provided they exercise that power with moderation and humanity; on the other hand, we all very well know that prisoners are committed to the care of persons who are uninformed men, and in the habits of ferocity and coertion; an English Jury, therefore, will certainly examine into the conduct of such men. Gentlemen, what the real complection of the business may be, I know not, the facts will be before you, and the law that attaches to those facts will be explained to you by the learned Judge; you will then be in possession of the true means to enable you to form a verdict, consonant to your oath and to public justice.</p>

               <p>What happened then in your presence? - I went up to the gate, and knocked at the gate, one of the turnkeys opened the gate and said, soldier, come in.</p>
               <p>Court. How many were there of you? - Me and two more, when I got in I went to the lodge, there was one

             at the lodge, very much disguised in liquor, they were ironing her, Brown was assisting them; the woman was used very ill, they were pushing her down.</p>
               <p>Court. What business had the soldiers there? - I went to see a comrade's wife there, one Mrs. Harding.</p>
               <p>Then you was not sent for as a party of soldiers? - No, my Lord, not at all; then Brown, the turnkey, unlocked the place where the fire arms lay, and gave me and my two comrades a blunderbuss each; he says, soldier, go backwards, in the mean time, as I was going out of the lodge, the prisoner Stevenson catched the blunderbuss out of my hand, and immediately I took my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150118"/> bayonet up and went backwards with them, I went first, and Stevenson the prisoner followed me, and my two comrades followed him, we went to the women's gate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Where is the women's gate situated? - At the upper part of the yard, beyond the men's.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the outward gate? - As nigh as I can guess it is four or five roods, but to say the truth, I cannot resolve the question.</p>
               <p>Is it the length of this Court? - About the length of the boards before the bench to the door of this Court.</p>
               <p>Is that gate in a partitioned wall? - Yes, it divides the partition wall between the gate and the passage that goes to and fro to the prisoners, the women's gate is at one part of the yard, and the men's at the other, there is a free passage between them.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the women's gate is on one side the passage, and the men's on the other? - It is a common yard, the same as you may go up any other yard, the doors are both on one side: we went up to the gate, there was some women knocking with their hands at the wicket of the women's gate, the wicket was shut.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean a woman prisoner that was knocking? - I believe there was nobody but the women prisoners there, but I cannot resolve the question for certain.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - Some person opened the wicket, I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Some persons within? - No, my Lord, without-side, it was some person belonging to the party that was with us; when the wicket was open, some person said, soldier, why do not you fire; I cannot say who said so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did it appear to you that there was any danger of the walls being beat down, or any thing of that sort? - No, only women talking together, like a couple of companies talking in a tap-room, gathered together, not as any ways riotous at that time, in the mean time the person, after he had said, soldier, why do not you fire, made an uncommon expression to mention before the Court, he said, if we would not fire he would; he repeated them words twice, and I said, for God sake do not fire on them; he made the expression, with the same oath, that be would fire immediately up the women's yard, and immediately turned it round, and presented it right at the body of

            , she stood by herself; when I saw his intent, I caught hold of the blunderbuss, to draw it from the wall as far as I could, to prevent his firing and doing any mischief.</p>
               <p>Did you succeed? - I did not, he immediately at the same time pulled the trigger; I had the blunderbuss in my hand at the same time, and after he pulled the trigger, the body of the deceased stood but a very trifling time, and fell, and a couple of girls caught her, she was all over a gore of blood, as if you had poured water; she leaned her head on two women near her, I said to him you have killed the woman; he said, I do not care; immediately he returned to the lodge, and the other two soldiers; I gave the bayonet to the turnkey at the women's gate, and asked him to let me go in among the women, he let me in, and I went and saw the body lay all over a gore of blood on the ground, she was soon after moved up the yard; I saw as much blood and brains lay after they had removed her, as would fill the crown of my hat, it lay in such quantities.</p>
               <p>Did any thing material happen after that? - Nothing at all that I saw, the prisoners were very quiet at the time, and as far as ever I saw afterwards: the woman was with child, I saw her the day before.</p>

               <p>You say Stevenson ordered you to fire? - No, Sir, I beg your pardon, I said somebody ordered me to fire, somebody said soldier, why do not you fire? we made answer, we will not fire.</p>
               <p>What did they say fire at? - They did not mention at any thing at all, they said, soldier, why do not you fire; the door was shut, but the wicket was open.</p>
               <p>How came it open? - Some person on the outside belonging to the party we were with opened it.</p>
               <p>Did you see them open it? - I saw some person open it, who it was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he open the gate? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you upon your oath say it was not forced open by the prisoners on the inside? - Yes, if required I would at that time, what happened before we came in I do not know, and as to asking me questions I cannot answer, is of no use, for I think I have a just God to answer to when I go into another world.</p>

               <p>You know many of the gentlemen that reside in that prison? - No, Sir, only by sight.</p>
               <p>You did not see them that day? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Were they in the women's apartments? - I believe Mr. Hopkins was, but who else was I cannot say; I do not say clearly that there was not, or that there was; I saw some man, but whether he was a prisoner or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was he in irons? - No, Sir, there was no man in irons as I saw.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us how many men were there? - I cannot; there were people to see their acquaintance as well as me; I saw the men prisoners walking to and fro in their yard, their wicket was open.</p>
               <p>Then this blunderbuss did not go off till you had got hold of it? - I had hold of it up to the muzzle, in order to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Not to list it up? - No.</p>
               <p>How could you see him pulling up the trigger so easily? - Because the man had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he pulled the trigger? - No, Sir, I swear that he had the blunderbuss in his hand; I tried to pull it back, but I could not, at that instant it went off.</p>
               <p>You never saw any thing of a stick poked through the wicket? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you the man that washed your hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150120"/> in the blood; or who did? - Upon my soul, I cannot resolve the question; I never saw any thing of the kind acted.</p>
               <p>Gently, gently, soldier, was you there when the justice came? - That is the gentleman that came in and looked at the body.</p>
               <p>Aye, was Hopkins or any of the witnesses there then? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see any man run his hands into the blood of this poor woman, and say, this is delightful work, I will sleep in these hands? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you say it never did happen? - I never saw it happen, and more than that, that gentleman said it was too partial to fire on them as soon as they did, he said, they need not be so hasty as they were.</p>
               <p>How came you not to knock it up in the air? - I know the nature of a blunderbuss and firelock too well, I tried as far as my endeavours lay to prevent it, I tried to pull it back but I could not; those fire arms will not go off with a shake.</p>

            , who is a very bad woman indeed, she was taken before Mr. Forsyth and Mr. Woodward, he is turnkey, she was taken out of the woman side, and I heard her irons rattle, then there were three soldiers came in, to see acquaintances as I heard them express, I did not know it otherwise, then there was a blunderbuss delivered to each of their hands, by Mr. Brown, one of the turnkeys, then they were ordered to go down the yard to quell the disturbance, for the women did make a good deal of noise, and calling the turnkeys names; afterwards, this Stevenson the prisoner, snatched the blunderbuss out of one of the soldiers hands.</p>
               <p>What is this Stevenson? - He is a watchman at the outer gate, as I was informed; I never saw the man before to my knowledge, and he snatched the blunderbuss out of Rickwater's hands, a soldier; when the soldiers came in first, the gate was opened and Rickwater came down the yard, he had something in his hands, but whether it was a stick or a bayonet, I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. What gate was open? - The second gate from the street, the lodge is between the outer and inner gate, then Rickwater and the prisoner, and two soldiers went down the yard near to the women's gate, then I saw the prisoner point a blunderbuss up to the women's yard; Mr. Forsyth ordered him to fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Forsyth is the person that takes care of the people to hard labour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were those women kept to hard labour? - Yes, some of them; then I heard the prisoner say, that he would fire, then I heard a woman's voice say, well if you will fire you must fire, just after that, the piece went off in about a minute after.</p>
               <p>Who fired the piece? - Stevenson.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What happened then? - Then Mr. Forsyth said, now, soldier, point up one to the men's gate.</p>
               <p>What direction had the piece that was fired? - To the place.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Was it levelled at any person or thing? - He held it strait before him till I heard a woman in speak, it pointed to the left, at the woman's gate through the wicket.</p>
               <p>Was the wicket open at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came the wicket open? - I believe the women beat it open with their fists.</p>
               <p>Did you see it when it flew open? - Yes, I saw it fly open, there was a little staple that only confined it.</p>
               <p>Was any body near it on the other side next to you? - No, Sir, not near me.</p>
               <p>Near the wicket, I ask you, when it flew open? - Not that I recollect; after Mr. Forsyth ordered the soldier to fire up the men's yard, Mr. Barnett that was there a prisoner, said, for God's sake, do not fire among the men, for they are all as quiet as lambs.</p>
               <p>What happened then? - Then this Mr. Stevenson run away to the gate, and called out for more ammunition, he said, he had done one, and he would do another, after that I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoner's Council. How long have you had the misfortune to be in prison? - I went in the 2d day of July.</p>
               <p>You was a debtor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you had permission to come into the lobby? - Into the lobby, I was between the common and the inner gate, that takes into the lodge.</p>
               <p>You was not in the lodge? - No, Charnock was in the lodge.</p>
               <p>Then you looked over the wicket? - No, Sir, I looked through the holes, there are holes you may put a pint pot through.</p>
               <p>You was one of the Coroners Jury? - I was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mr. Rickwater when the prisoner called for more ammunition? - No, I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>At the same time he pointed his blunderbuss near the wicket, you were none of you near enough to prevent his firing? - Rickwater was close to him, I could not hear what he said, he was on the left of him, so I could not see.</p>
               <p>Could not you see him at all? - Not to see him go to do any thing, I could see his coat.</p>
               <p>If he had done any thing, do you think he was in such a situation to see him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150123"/>You say the women were very riotous at this time? - Yes, they did make a great noise.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this Charnock was ironed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That did not appease them, I take it for granted, that made them still more riotous? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In consequence of which they abused the turnkeys, and used them extremely ill? - They did call them very bad names.</p>
               <p>Did you see any stones thrown? - I never saw but one piece of stone or brickbat, but whether from the men's side or women's side I cannot tell, that fell just by the water tub, which is almost before the governor's window.</p>
               <p>Did it fall near the turnkeys? - No, not near them.</p>
               <p>What was the purpose of throwing it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did they throw it at one another? - That I cannot tell, I was not on their side.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether it was thrown at the turnkeys or not? - I do not know, the order that was given, was to arm and to go down the yard and quell the riot, and after the soldiers had been desired to fire, the prisoner said, he would fire if they forced him to it, he said, he would fire, I heard one woman say, if you will fire you must.</p>
               <p>During the minute, from the time he said he would fire to the time he fired, they were perfectly peaceable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no riot in the gaol at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>When was it they first broke through the wall? - That I believe was on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>That had furnished them a tolerable quantity of materials to batter with? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was all the materials and rubbish moved? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How often had you seen Rickwater there before? - Never, to my knowledge, he came with some of the soldiers to visit some of the prisoners, and they were not called in by the turnkeys originally.</p>
               <p>They were the persons to whom the turnkeys thought proper to give fire arms, to quiet them? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was a watchman at the outer gate, and he was ordered to fire by the turnkey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether Stevenson was called in by the turnkeys or either of them? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>You have never seen him before? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long have you been there? - Ever since the second of July.</p>

               <p>What is he in prison for? - I cannot justly say, he was a fine.</p>
               <p>You can I fancy give us a little account of his crime? - I cannot, I was in the country the time he was put there, I returned to town only on Saturday night, and this was on the Sunday I went to see him, it was the first time I had been to see him, I was with him and Mr. Woodward, and Mr. Woodward went down to the gate to serve the sines, and I was in the first yard among the men prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. Have not you heard that this man was committed as a rogue, and for having pistols about him? - My Lord, I did not hear what it was for, I was in the country when he was committed.</p>
               <p>What happened further? - The fines would not take their victuals at that gate, but they would have it at the gate they used to have it.</p>
               <p>Who said so? - All the women, Mr. Woodward took the victuals back, and said, they should have none; they came out again and knocked against the wicket, and said, they would have it at the usual place, and the other said, they should not.</p>
               <p>Court. Which did they say was the usual place? - At the lodge gate.</p>
               <p>Then they were to be let out from the wicket gate I presume to that gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150124"/>How far is that from the wicket gate? - A dozen yards; as they were kicking and shaking the gate, in came three soldiers, and to each of these three soldiers they gave a blunderbuss, they desired them to go forwards into the yard, the prisoner came and took a blunderbuss from one of the soldiers by force, the soldier drew his bayonet and went to the women's gate, and the prisoner followed him, and the two soldiers followed him.</p>
               <p>What did he draw his bayonet for for? - In case any thing should be wanting, but he did not know what the disturbance was till he came up to the gate; the prisoner went up to the gate, and put the blunderbuss up to the grate, and said, he would fire, the soldier with the bayonet laid hold of the blunderbuss, and hindered him from firing.</p>
               <p>How do you mean hindered him? - He took hold of it, and said there was no need of firing.</p>
               <p>Was there no firing? - Yes, I saw him fire, he pointed up the yard, afterwards he saw the deceased's left hand, and he pointed round to her, and killed the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Pray Mr. Ash what are you? - A glazier and painter, in St. John's-street, I work for Mr. Sanders in Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Where did you live about a month ago? - In the same place I do now, No. 70, St. John's-street, I lodged there for a twelvemonth, I lodge there now.</p>
               <p>Where was your other lodgings? - Down at Northfleet, near Gravesend, I have been there three months, I kept my town lodgings on then.</p>
               <p>When did you go into the country? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it in June or July? - The beginning of June, before my friend was committed to gaol.</p>
               <p>What might be your employment there? - Painting a house, near Northfleet town at Esquire Watman's, I did not know Thorpe was committed till I came to town, we were pretty intimate, I was apprentice to his father, I did not ask him what he was there for, I had not an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Then you think it was a secret in the gaol? - No.</p>
               <p>I should have thought the first question would have been, how came you here George? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not, nor do not now know what he is there for.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that all the time he was in gaol you never knew what he was in gaol for? - I did not know, I heard he was taken upon the road.</p>
               <p>Why Mr. Ash you seem to be so well acquainted with the technical terms, you have been there yourself? - I never was in there.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by a fine? - He was in for six months, I do not know that he committed a robbery of any sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider with yourself how far that is credible, that you should not have had the curiosity to ask, what are you here for, old acquaintance? because you was apprentice to his father? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>It's a strange thing you should have so little curiosity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you ever hear the word dubbs; I can talk with you in the technical way? - What do you mean by dubbs?</p>
               <p>Things for house-breaking; you know that he had not got the darbies on though? - I do not know what you mean by darbies.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear whether they were not little bits of iron that they put round a man's legs? - He had no irons on.</p>
               <p>There was a disturbance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the soldier drew his bayonet to defend himself, then he was afraid? - He might do that, there was not much noise, there was a knocking and kicking at the gate.</p>
               <p>Were no stones thrown? - I saw no stones, I could not see in at the wicket, I was very near him, I could see him turn his face, the women were at the upper end of the yard.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the stones? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor they were not found there afterwards? - Not any that I saw, I went up along with my friend, I went up by myself, no other friends of mine were in that gaol.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150125"/>Why, what prison were they in? - I have no other friends to see in a prison.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, if I did not mistake you, that the prisoner went to the gate, and put the blunderbuss through the gate? - Yes, through the hole of the gate.</p>
               <p>Then he took it out again and came back? - He did not come quite from the gate.</p>
               <p>So he fired that blunderbuss in at that hole? - He did.</p>
               <p>How far was you distant at that time? - About three yards.</p>
               <p>When he put the blunderbuss in the hole of the gate, was there any noise made? - A very great screaming with the women, who ran out of the way as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Was there any man in the women's apartments? - I saw two men come out, one is in the prison, the other came in to see some of the women, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>When he put the blunderbuss into the gate, was there any great disturbance then? - There was knocking and kicking against the gate, and calling the keeper, and using a great deal of bad language a little while.</p>
               <p>Did not the man call out to them to be quiet? - Not that I heard, he shut the gate and left them directly.</p>
               <p>If they had come out to this gate to take their victuals they would have had an opportunity of making more disturbance? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>If all these people had come out, I suppose the prison would have been in a good deal of danger? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What do you think of that? - They had nothing to defend themselves with.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Peatt.</p>
               <p>Where was you on the 1st of August? - In Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was you there? - All the whole day.</p>
               <p>Was you there about six in the evening? - Yes, I was a prisoner there for an assault, the women were not served their fines at the usual place; Mr. Woodward, the head turnkey, whether he was out of humour, or what, I cannot say, but he would insist on their not having their fines at the usual place; they thought their privileges were abridged, and it caused a little disturbance, and the consequence of this was, he took the fines back.</p>

               <p>Do they call their allowance fines? - Yes, they were taken back from their own wicket, where they have their beer and other necessaries, in consequence of that, there were some pieces of tubs thrown over the wall by the women, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Over what wall? - Over the women's wall: in consequence of that, there was one Rickwater, a soldier, came to see a friend, and two more soldiers, the first with a drawn bayonet in his hand, that was Rickwater, the prisoner at the bar, and two soldiers, I do not know who they were, went down to the wicket, and I saw the prisoner at the bar present the piece up the yard, and there was an altereation took place between Rickwater and the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner take the blunderbuss and point it up the yard, when he had pointed it, he was desired not to fire by the soldiers, he uttered an oath, and said he would, and that instant, Sir, he fired.</p>
               <p>What direction had the piece when he fired? - Oblique, towards his left hand.</p>
               <p>Was it pointed at any particular object? - I cannot tell, it was between the gates, I saw the flash of the pan, and heard the report of the piece, and I heard a sudden shriek, and I heard the woman was shot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Jones, pray of what profession are you? - I am a watch-maker by trade.</p>
               <p>That is when you are out of gaol? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How then? - I get my livelyhood as honestly as I can.</p>
               <p>That is exactly what I thought; honestly if you can, but if not? - Dishonestly you may suppose, but I do not say that.</p>
               <p>You was in for no harm? - No.</p>
               <p>What unrighteous set of men was it that sent you there for no harm? - My wife.</p>
               <p>It is not the first unrighteous woman that has sent her husband there; by whose help did she send you there? - I cannot tell you, you must ask her that; I was sent from Hick's-hall; they would not let me speak there, here I am before an honourable Court, she could produce no marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150126"/>You half murdered her, and they convicted you? - The sentence was one month's imprisonment and two ball in ten pounds each, and myself in twenty pounds for my good behaviour for twelve months; I laid there eight weeks, I was in three prisons in three weeks time.</p>
               <p>Now I recommend to you to take care you do not get into Newgate? - I have escaped that.</p>
               <p>You have, have you, why that is a pretty strong prison too? - I am an honest man.</p>
               <p>I believe in the third prison you was so bad a fellow, that the keeper himself got some of his own people to bail you, to get rid of you, and in order that you might not corrupt the whole gaol? - Right, Sir! very right, Sir! very right, Sir!</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Peatt.</p>
               <p>You are a prisoner in Clerkenwell Bridewell? - I am.</p>
               <p>What was you committed there for? - A misdemeanor, for breaking out of that gaol.</p>
               <p>Court. For breaking out of that very gaol! What do you know of this matter? - About five or six o'clock I had occasion to go to the women's side; there was an interruption at the women's gate, they did not choose to receive their fines at that place; I came back to the gate again, there was a parcel of people there, I got about twelve yards up the yard on the inside, a woman told me to take care, for God's sake, for they were going to fire, I cannot tell what woman it was; I replied to her, what can they fire at? I had not gone above three yards further before I heard a piece discharged.</p>
               <p>Was your face towards the noise or from it? - From it.</p>
               <p>Then you only heard the noise of the piece? - I did, upon which I turned my face and saw a woman lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>Do you know the woman? - I have seen her before.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to you to be with child? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What more do you know? - I went and found some slugs and a ball had entered her left eye, at which the brain issued; she was dead.</p>
               <p>Did the prison appear to be in such a state as threatened disturbance? - Not at all, I have seen a great deal more disturbance when the people wanted beer or any other article.</p>
               <p>Was there any other noise? - They kept beating at the wicket about half an inch thick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have told us all, I suppose? - As far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Nothing more that is particular or any ways remarkable passed as you can recollect? - I will repeat it, if you please.</p>
               <p>No, but I should be glad to have a little of your history too, Mr. Hopkins? - You may relate it, if you know better than me; I was convicted first for a misdemeanor, they told me they found implements upon me.</p>
               <p>Then they convicted you upon that? - Possibly they might.</p>
               <p>You will not be positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Implements of what kind? - They tell me they were implements of house-breaking, may be you may be a better judge than me.</p>
               <p>Name some of them. - I cannot take upon me to name them all now, I recollect two or three, there might be two or three pick-lock keys.</p>
               <p>No such things as pistol, powder, or ball? - No.</p>
               <p>And no crow? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you drop it at the time; was that all? - There was a dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>And a little flint and steel. - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>A few matches? - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Come tell us all man? - I have no occasion to tell you what you do not ask me.</p>
               <p>You remember your making your appearance in this Court? - Yes, I have on such a cause as this.</p>
               <p>That was for murder? - Yes, once, the other time was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150127"/>How often in your life have you been here? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Cannot you, why I can recollect three or four times. - Very likely, it is more than I can.</p>
               <p>Why three times I remember; now for instance, in the year 1776. - Very possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not here? - I will not swear either one or the other.</p>
               <p>In the year 1777, you was here again. - I cannot tell that I was or was not, it is not possible for me to tell, I do not remember so many years back.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being convicted and sent to the Thames? - Yes, I do recollect that.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Peatt. You would do well not to bring such witnesses as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. My Lord, I know nothing of the case nor of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are the man that washed your hands in the woman's blood? - No, Sir, I did not wash my hands.</p>
               <p>Did not you foul your hands in it, did not you poke your finger in her eye? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>When you was told, for God's sake to be more solemn, you said, no, I rejoice in such hands as these. - He begged me not to paw him, I told him I only wished to see justice done.</p>
               <p>There were no men on the wall? - Yes, there was a person upon the wall.</p>
               <p>What was he doing? - Nothing, I believe his name was M'Carty.</p>
               <p>How high was the wall? - I cannot say how high the wall was.</p>
               <p>Cannot you guess? - I should imagine it is ten feet.</p>
               <p>It is about eighteen feet high. - I thought about twelve.</p>
               <p>Is that the wall that you got over? - That I got over is a considerable deal higher.</p>
               <p>Was the wall as high as that gallery? - No.</p>
               <p>What was he doing? - Only looking over as a spectator.</p>
               <p>What was there to see? - A parcel of women making a noise.</p>
               <p>Were not they throwing stones? - Not as I observed, I saw none thrown; there was a wall broke.</p>
               <p>Who broke the wall? - I do not know, I was not there.</p>
               <p>You say positively you did not rejoice at this? - Far from rejoicing.</p>
               <p>You was one of the Jury? - No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Who were? - One Wagstaffe, he is a prisoner for a misdemeanor, it is for receiving goods belonging to other people, goods that have been taken in pledge, work unfinished, not receiving them knowing them to be stolen; there is one Young, he was for a bastard child; Mr. Vincent was one, he is a publican; there were six gaol birds, and six of the outsides: Mr. Penrose was one, he is in on an execution for debt.</p>

               <p>How can you to take upon you to say, that you thought the prison was in danger from the clamour of the women? - Upon my word, I cannot tell what to say.</p>
               <p>Had you any serious apprehensions arising from the clamours of the women about the victuals? - I could not tell what their intentions were, people that are of a riotous disposition, I do not know what they might have done, if they had burst that door open.</p>
               <p>Was there any man upon the wall? - I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Would you have conceived it justisiable to commit so cruel an act, as firing at any one of the women in consequence of the clamours of the women? - Undoubtedly I should not, if I could have quelled it any other ways.</p>
               <p>Should you have thought such a situation demanded such coercive measures or acts? - I cannot tell what another man would have done.</p>
               <p>Whether under all the circumstances of the state of the prison, you think, upon your oath, there was any serious danger? - God knows what would have been the consequence if that had not happened; but to be sure it stopped it immediately: if this firing had not been, I make no doubt but the door would have been burst open immediately.</p>

               <p>That is, in plain English, making a very great riot? - Yes, Woodward was serving their provisions to them, and after he had served the men he served the women at their own gate, without letting them down into the yard; they did not like that, they would come down as usual: Mr. Woodward let one

               <p>Can you take upon you to say that these were some of the things that was thrown at the gate? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Had there been any mischief done to the wall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - They had made such a hole, that there was room enough for a man to get through; they had repaired that on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the men out of their proper place? - I cannot recollect that I did, either upon the wall or elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Whether from the situation of the prison at that time, as to the state of the gaol to security, you believe it was necessary to resist them by the force that was used, in order to prevent their escape? - It was; they were kicking and knocking, and they said they would set my master's house on fire; there was great danger that they would escape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Which side of the gate was you when the noise happened? - On the opposite side to the women.</p>
               <p>Did you see the stones thrown? - Yes, and more than that, one of the stones hit me over the head, I cannot say who threw them, but I saw them thrown.</p>
               <p>Did you open the wicket of the women's apartment? - No, Sir, I tried to keep it shut; I saw no otherwise than the wicket was broke open by main force: the men were all quiet.</p>
               <p>You conceived yourself to be in very great danger from these clamorous women? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>You say it was usual to bring down the fines? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you conceive the prison was in danger from the scolding of these women? - Exceedingly in danger, in great danger, when they were heaving stones fit to knock our brains out.</p>
               <p>I thought there were two outward gates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you think these scolding women, who had not their food in the manner they were accustomed to have it, endangered the gaol? - They said they would set the house and prison on fire, and break the gates and the prison down, if they did not let them out.</p>
               <p>Did not they say that to receive the provisions? - No.</p>
               <p>Would you yourself have shot one of these unhappy devils, or thought it necessary to do so on such an occasion? - I would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe your prison is not stronger than Newgate was before it was burnt? - No, Sir; nor near so strong.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is the Governor's house from the women's gate? - About nine or ten yards.</p>
               <p>They had but a little way to go then if they could have had fire? - No, Sir, they had not.</p>

            . The moment they are out of the women's yard they are upon the house directly.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Is there any partition between the gate and the Governor's house? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Your Lordship and all the world knows, that women's tongues will say every thing when they mean to do nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that, but I know that stones in women's hands, and firebrands in women's hands, will do as much as in the hands of men.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The rule of law is, as in the case of Huggins and Bambridge; the Courts are very properly watchful over the conduct of the gaolers and the persons employed under them: to their prisoners they are not to behave with the least degree of unnecessary cruelty, that is clear; and they are responsible to the public for the lives of those that are under their care: that doctrine which common humanity speaks, is most fully and clearly explained in those authorities; but there is a maxim of law for the interest of the commonwealth, that the prisons should be in safety, and in order to preserve them so, the law invests the gaoler with all necessary power, to be conducted as prudence, necessary prudence, requires;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150130"/> then here are abundundance of women sitting up a law for themselves, who are under the proper control of their keeper, the master of the gaol, and insist upon it, notwithstanding the reason that has been given, that they will have their provisions at such a place; the Governor of this gaol, for the safety of that prison over which he presided, thought it imprudent and improper to let these women out in the usual course of indulgence that had been observed to them before, and he had two objects in view, the one safety, the other reformation; he might think, that by a strict and rigid confinement, he might bring these women to a state of conduct and regularity: why against this prudent and wise measure of the gaoler do these women rebel? by force they broke open the wicket, then they insist on breaking open the gate, they threw their missile weapons, the stones, in great abundance, and one of them struck one of the people over the head; they threatened to commit an actual felony, they said they would burn the prison and the Governor's house, which is nine yards from the gate: now under these circumstances, supposing them to be the facts, I for one am of opinion, in point of law, that they had a right to resort to this extremity: I never had a doubt of it in my life; if, that were an actual felony is committed, or upon the point of being committed, persons are authorized by law to repress that by every possible means; I wish that had been understood a little earlier in those terrible riots, I believe a great deal of the riots would have been prevented: this is my idea of the law; I am sure I am quite open to have any mistake I may have fallen in corrected. It seems to me there is no grounds for proceeding further.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. In consequence of what your Lordship has said on the law of the subject, with respect to these persons that are committed for safe custody, it is certain discretionary power resides with the keeper to repel force by force; but should the meanest and lowest of his servants exercise the discretion of taking away the life of an individual, when there is any noise in the gaol, tha does not amount to such a riot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. You are right, I have watched very closely to this evidence, I did not hear of this felony and riot being threatened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. I have no wish about it, but the common interest of humanity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have the happiness to be assisted by the learned and worthy Recorder of the City of London, I should be glad to know whether he concurs with me in opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am clearly of opinion, that all persons, not confining it to those in custody, with a special authority have a right to resist and oppose, even if it is indispensibly necessary to the endangering the lives of those that are attempting to commit, or in the act of committing a felony; and I am clearly of opinion, that a gaoler having in his care and custody numbers of prisoners of a dangerous description, has a right, not only for the security of the public, to repress tumults and disorders in that gaol, by every degree of force that may appear to be indispensibly necessary; I intirely concur in the law laid down by the learned Judge; and here it is a question of fact, whether the degree of force used was in that case necessary, as the only probable means of quelling the riot, if so, I conceive that the law admits no possible doubt in the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justic Gould. Gentlemen, you have heard the opinion of my learned brother and myself as to the law, the fact is for you to decide upon; if you please I will sum it up to you, but if you are satisfied from your recollection of the evidence that has been given, perhaps that will be unnecessary; you will please therefore to tell me whether you wish me to recapitulate the evidence to you?</p>
               <p>Jury. We are sufficiently informed, my Lord.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 24th of July last, I saw the two prisoners, while they were in Mr. Gray's shop being served with some fans, I observed one of them, while she was serving, put something under her cloak, as if in her pocket, I was immediately opposite to the house; I saw her hand moving towards her pocket, and I saw them walking carelessly down Ludgate-hill; they were about a quarter of an hour in the shop. I suspected they had stole something; they went up into a house in Chancery-lane, a private door into a passage up two pair of stairs; I went to the house, and and went up into the room, with a constable and the gentleman that traced them, and they were sitting at a table; there was another woman in the room with the two prisoners, they had got three fans on the table, lying open; on our entering the room they looked at us, one of them took one fan on the side of the table where she sat, and the other took two fans and threw them down on the side where she sat, and threw their clothes over them; we took the prisoners in custody, and searched their apartments, and brought them to Mr. Gray's house, they then acknowledged the fact, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made use of? - None in the least, but a promise to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Who are you? - I am well known in this Court, I live in Ludgate-street, I am a comb-maker and a hardware-man.</p>
               <p>I believe you have some reason to know some of the rules of evidence? - Why, Sir?</p>
               <p>I believe you have been here pretty often in the character of prosecutor and witness? - Frequently, and if I have an opportunity I may appear against more; but I never came without a safe conscience to this Court.</p>
               <p>You have a good deal of leisure time upon your hands I take it for granted? - I could perhaps fill up my time sometimes better than I do.</p>
               <p>Answer my question, Sir, you have heard it? - I have sometimes leisure time upon my hands.</p>
               <p>It so happened you had a good deal of leisure at this time? - I was attending these women in my shop the day before.</p>
               <p>What is the distance, what is the width of that part of Ludgate-hill that faces Mr. Gray's shop? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Guess at it? - You can guess as well as I can.</p>
               <p>I am not a witness upon oath, I choose to have it from you. - It is directly opposite the Bell Savage.</p>
               <p>In the course of the quarter of an hour that you stood watching these people, how many carriages passed? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>A great number of people and carriages were passing between you and Mr. Gray's shop? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>You told us, with a great deal of accuracy and minuteness, that these people went to a certain court in Chancery-lane; now you do not know that? - Not of my own knowledge, I saw them a part of the way, and after I came there I saw them at the window.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, be so good as to tell us what it is of all the evidence that you have given,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150132"/> that you do know: how far did you follow them? - Into Shoe-lane, I saw them through the courts; I missed them in the narrow alleys by the King's printing-office.</p>
               <p>Now you have told us, that when they were carried back to Mr. Gray's shop, they put their hands together and asked for mercy and acknowledged the fact; I wish you to state the very expression? - I do not know that I can immediately state the expression; the fans were produced that they threw down, Mr. Gray's daughter declared in their presence, that those were the fans that she had been shewing them; they sat very patient till they heard the charge against them fully, the fans and their persons identified by the young lady, and they then got up and wrung their hands, and hoped for mercy.</p>
               <p>Was that all they said? - I cannot recollect every word.</p>
               <p>Then that is what you meant when you said they acknowledged the fact? - I consider that as an acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>Then when you told my Lord, that these women had acknowledged the fact, you meant to refer to their having said that they desired mercy? - They begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>That is what you call acknowledging the fact, Sir, is it? that is a little extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it through the window, or by the door being open, that you saw them? - The door was open, and they were standing by the counter.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am daughter to Mr. Gray; I recollect the two prisoners coming into our shop the 24th of July, between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>What did they come in for? - They came in and asked to see some fans, I shewed them some fans, and they staid a good while in the shop, at last they fixed on one, and said they had not money enough to purchase it, but would come in an hour's time, if I would lay it by for them; they bought a little doll's fan, and paid sixpence for it; then they went out of the shop, they were in the shop about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I saw there was a fan lay under their cloak, I did not suspect any thing, and I took it.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive either of them taking those that were lost? - No, I did not at all.</p>
               <p>Then you had no particular suspicion of them? - Not the least; Mr. Lambert came over, and said he was afraid they were shoplifters; they were taken into the parlour, and I saw them three fans, which were produced by the constable; they only cried and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Did you know them to be the same women? - Yes, one of them had changed her dress, but notwithstanding that, I am sure she was the same; my father was at home when they were brought back again, but not when they came into the shop the first time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have the three fans, which I got out of the lodgings of these two women in Chancery-lane; as soon as I went into the room, Jones was sitting on the left-hand side of the table, and Smith on the right-hand, the moment I went into the room these two fans dropped from Jones.</p>
               <p>Were they on the table or in her hand? - They were either on the table or in her hand, I do not know which; the other two gentlemen being rather more active than I, got to the prisoner before me, but I went into the room first.</p>
               <p>- GRAY sworn.</p>
               <p>(Looks at the fans.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Point out the mark.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure of them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of them all at the lowest valuation? - Fourteen shillings, that is the price.</p>
               <p>Whose hand writing is it? - My daughter's.</p>
               <p>Being only the price mark, in course any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150133"/> other shop will put the price on their's? - I am sure they are mine; this one I marked, I am positive to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Gray. Is it by the writing of the mark that you knew it? - Yes, by the writing.</p>
               <p>You took them at first to be your daughter's writing, did not you? - I thought they were.</p>
               <p>I observe it is made by a pencil on bone; now from the little experience we all have of writing on ivory, it is the very worst species of writing, our pencil slips, so that the figure or word written, is not so plain as if written on paper; now, independent of the writing, you would not know this: you do not manufacture them; there are many of the same pattern; for instance, if there was a balloon fan now? - We have them now.</p>
               <p>So I guessed; now I will ask you, whether you rub out the mark universally when you sell fans? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose these marks entirely obliterated, could you in that case have sworn to the particulars of these fans? - I cannot say, I did not serve the fans myself; my daughter and my wife served there fans themselves.</p>
               <p>Court to Miss Gray. I think you said, when the three fans were brought back, you only missed one? - No, but when I saw them I recollected shewing them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses to their characters.</p>

               <p>Did they come in together? - Yes; they asked to look at some striped silk stockings that lay in the window, I reached them down, they asked me the price, I told them half a guinea a pair, then they asked to look at some white silk, I then took another pair of the same price from the window, and George Green asked me to shew him some that were lower priced, I never saw him before to my knowledge, I reached him some out of the paper, there were seven pair in the paper when we reached them down, we always mark on the outside how many there are; he told me they were too large a size, he would be glad if I would shew him some smaller, I then reached a dozen of women's silk, them I asked him nine shillings for, he then said, he did not understand silk, he would look at some cotton, I did not offer to reach him any more, the other prisoner said, he wondered he could give the gentleman so much trouble, the other man went out after he had said them words, and this Green was going to follow him, and said, he would call in the morning, and bring somebody that understood them, and he was going out, and I missed a pair of striped silk.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner Coleman's Council. You seem to swear pretty hardly, Sir, you tell us Sir, that the other person took the striped silk stockings, did you see him take them? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you give the same account before the Magistrate? - Yes, Sir, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did not the Magistrate tell you, that if you described there to be the value of five shillings, that the indictment would affect the prisoners lives? - He did not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Then a little after that, you said, you would lose your life or hang these fellows? - I did not.</p>
               <p>In what package were those stockings? - The stripe silk were taken out of the window.</p>
               <p>For ought you know, the prisoner you laid hold of might have secreted these blue silk stockings as well as the others? - I dare say, he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he could not possibly have done it? - He was searched in our parlour by the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it before the constable came? - Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing on Coleman when you apprehended him? - Nothing of my property.</p>
               <p>Have not you lost a great many things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I conceive you was irritated, and angry? - I cannot say I was, I should be glad to apprehend those kind of people.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the price you have mentioned, the reasonable selling price? - It is laid less than they cost me.</p>
               <p>So that they were of the full value of eight shillings? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>You never saw any of the prisoners before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>What was his name? - Mr. Grimes; we asked the prisoner how he came by it, he said he found it at the corner of a place where he had just been, and saw nobody; I observed there was a paper marked upon it, but what it was I cannot say, as I cannot write, the other man made his escape; this is about two hundred yards from Mr. Preston's warehouse.</p>

               <p>I never saw the gentleman in my life; I picked up the handkerchief coming through Temple-bar, I did not know but the gentleman might be ill natured enough to swear against me, therefore I put it into my breeches, which I did at the house, and I believe the gentleman saw me; I think it is a very unlikely thing, that if I had picked his pocket ten minutes before, that I should pick it again.</p>

               <p>Then she had left her window open before she went out? - She had left her window a-jar; I did not see the prisoner go out, I saw her in the room, she appeared to me to be looking over clothes; I looked at her a good while, I had my little girl with me, and I said to her, Mrs. Phillips is very busy looking over her things, and presently I saw the prisoner come down with the property: I should have had no mistrust, but she dropped a pair of morone coloured breeches and an old sheet in the passage, I then thought she had been robbing the house, she had a large bundle, almost as much as a porter could stand under, with a quantity of false keys; and all that she had about her.</p>
               <p>Did she turn back to pick them up? - No, she went on, I pursued after her as quick as possible, she went with the things to the Three Kings, where she had left her child while she committed the robbery.</p>

               <p>Please you, my Lord, I stopped this woman, she had the things with her, I saw the constable take charge of her, they are the same things.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the constable here with the things? - He was not bound over; the things were left in my care, because there was some things in them, which his wife could not do without in her lying-in.</p>
               <p>When were those things given to you? - There were thirty-four picklock keys found in her pocket and a particular knife.</p>
               <p>When did the constable deliver them up to you? - It was the 15th of July, the next day after the robbery; the same night she was taken the things were sealed up, and left at my next door neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Who took charge of the things at the Three Kings? - The constable sealed them up, and left them with a next door neighbour of mine in my presence; I saw them again the next day at Guildhall, they were brought there in the same state; they were opened by Alderman Plomer, and they were looked over, and the Alderman asked me what I would value them at; I told him I would leave it to him, and he valued them at three pounds; they were then committed over to my care, and have been in my possession ever since, and are here now, the same things that were sealed up in the bundle.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. What may your coat and waistcoat be worth? - Ten shillings, the velvet breeches five shillings.</p>
               <p>What are your two gowns worth? - Ten shillings, they are charged in the indictment at eight shillings.</p>
               <p>What is your white petticoat worth? - Four shillings; the black petticoat, four shillings; and the sopha cover, four shillings.</p>
               <p>Are there any sheets? - Here are three old sheets, value three shillings; three shifts, three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any neckcloths? - I cannot find any here.</p>

               <p>I deal in clothes, a woman asked me to buy them, and I bought them, and that gentlewoman charged me with an officer: I have two poor children.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this indictment is founded upon a particular act of parliament, which was made for the protection of poor people, who are obliged to leave their houses in the day time to go to their labour, and which makes it a capital offence to break into a house by day time, and to steal therein to the amount of five shillings; if there is a deficiency in the proof of breaking and entering, that makes an alteration in the charge, for unless the house is broke and entered, stealing therein to the value of five shillings in the day time is not a capital offence; but if she did not break and enter the dwelling house, still, if she stole to the value of forty shillings, she is guilty of a capital offence.</p>

               <p>Then you only conclude that you know Pearman by observing a person rather taller? - His cutting me three times in one place, it went to my very soul, I caught at the hanger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have told us, it was the tallest man that struck you with the hanger? - Yes, but the other laid upon me.</p>

               <p>You recollect, that before you did see them you had application from their friends to know if you could identify them? - Not to me, I was kept in a dark room because the surgeon said, that I was in such a state that I must be kept close.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoners? - I have seen Pearman before, but I did not know Nash, and then Thomas Defee came up, and said halloo, he said, he knew them, and he lived but three doors off, and I let them go, I heard of this the next morning, and I mentioned this circumstance, and one Mr. Yardley went and fetched one Mr. May to me, and on the Sunday evening these young fellows heating there was a scandal upon them about the neighbourhood came to resign themselves; they went to the Bladebone, but what passed I do not know, I met them both coming back not in custody, and on the Monday young Pearman drank two pints of beer with me at May's house, I know them to be born in the street, and to be hard-working industrious people.</p>

               <p>Durant. Yes, your honour, I was in liquor, I did not know the prisoners when I stopped them, I was so drunk; there was a hat produced as one of the prisoners, but I never saw them in such a hat, and they both had hats on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have fifty people to the character of these men, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150148"/> Mr. Knowles thinks it is too much to press it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, I wore a round hat my round hat was taken from me, and this was a round hat which they took.</p>
               <p>Defee. When Mr. May came to me, he said, one had a round hat, the other a cocked hat on; one in a blue jacket, the other in long clothes, he said one of them must certainly have a bruise at the side of his head, and they were stripped, and I never saw any bruises about them, they was stripped to be searched.</p>
               <p>Durant. There were two people run up just before.</p>
               <p>Court. You know you told us you was drunk before.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of September, I went to the prosecutrix's house and sat there some time, I went to see what it was o'clock by the watch, and Mrs. Scraggs thought the young woman might be jesting; she suspected the prisoner, who was there very much in liquor; I was fearful of being blamed for the watch; we found the prisoner at about ten, still in liquor, there was no money found about him, but three halfpence farthing: he said he did not take the watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. Was the man in liquor, or sober? - He was not in liquor at that time.</p>

               <p>All that I have to say is, I went out three times for three pots of beer, my shopmate called me aside, and asked me to take a walk to Chelsea, we went to a public house, he pulled the watch out of his pocket, and asked me to go and pawn it, I thought it was his own, I did not know any further.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have only to say discreditable of him, being an old soldier and I an old soldier's widow, I had not the least suspicion that his conscience would allow him to wrong me; he was a discharged soldier for being infirm in mind, and when he is in liquor he is distracted.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury, I wish that had come out before, but since that is the case, you may reasonably suppose he has not a full exercise of his understanding.</p>

               <p>On the 10th of August, at seven in the morning, the prisoner came into my apartment, I was in the room, he took the watch and gown out of the room, I was in bed and saw him before he went out of the room, I did not see him come in, I called out Charles, I thought it was my husband, but I saw it was not him, and I was rather terrified: the prisoner went out, he was stopped and taken directly to the watch-house; I know the prisoner is the same person that was brought back, but I did not see his face in my room, his coat was the same colour, the watch and gown were found upon him, the gown was concealed in his foot-bag.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When you come to hear me speak, you will find it to the contrary; first you will observe, that such as watchmen, and thief-takers, and such sort of people as those, never come to swear for their King and country in this Court, but also for the money that is allowed by this government: also, the night before this happened, my brother came and told me, that another brother was very bad; in the morning about a quarter before six I arose, when I had dressed myself the clock had struck six; I set out to go to Knight's-bridge, and coming along Piccadilly, on this side the Haymarket, I heard the alarm of stop thief, and one man five feet high, and one man six feet high, one in a light coloured coat, and one in a drab coloured coat, one man took something from under his coat, but I cannot say what it was; he threw down a sack and immediately crossed to the other side of the way, I went over and took up the sack, I turned back and came towards Hare-street, and saw the prosecutrix stand there, in a smock and flannel petticoat, and I thought it was a horrid thing, and she said to me, I believe you are one of the thieves; and I was taken up, they all searched my coat pocket, and my breeches, and a man says to me (begging your pardon my Lord) damn me I will do for you now; he cried come along, follow me, and there were seven or eight more people, and they were all amazed, says one man, I will be on my oath, I put my hand in his coat pocket, and there was nothing; I pulled them inside out, but they are welcome to say what they please, I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Foster. Is there any truth in this? - None.</p>

               <p>Court. What marks had you on these by which you know them? - The dog collar has my father's mark on, and the spurs had each a little bit of the plate off, I have seen them very frequently; the spur leathers I cannot speak to, this is a black regimental stock, we were cleaning the shop, and I was rather in a hurry, I did not take time, and pulled down the stock and tore it, I marked it at the time, and broke a pain of glass also; I am sure it is our stock, here is a pair of girths, which I know from the paleness of the yellow, we have our girths paler than any body else in town, there is no other mark that I can swear to them by but that, but there is also the name of the maker which is Birch, who makes for us, here is a bit I cannot speak to, we work for all the regiments in England and abroad, nobody else cuts that kind of leather; this is a nose-plate of a Lady's bridle, I found it upon the neck of a girl who is daughter to the prisoner, that which belonged to it was secreted in a drawer; here is a piece of red Morocco I can swear to, there is an A and C on it, here is a bridle, part of it is mine and part is not, here are two girths which I know it by, I found these several things part in the window exposed to sale, and part in Mrs. Wintersgill's drawers, the drawers were not locked up, in consequence of finding these things the two prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the younger prisoner? - He was servant to my father about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>In what employ? - A journeyman sadler.</p>
               <p>Did you know his father carried on this sort of business? - I know he kept a shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Your father is a very large sadler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You must have a very large quantity of goods in your house? - Not so much but we can swear to them.</p>
               <p>There is a distinction between sadlers and bridle cutters, is not there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you manufacture the whole of these things? - We have people out of doors that do it, we have some from the country, and some from town.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150165"/>Which are the articles that are manufactured in the country? - The spurs, and the snaffle bits.</p>
               <p>Those persons that manufacture for you in the country, work for a great many other people? - They may for what I know, I dare say they do.</p>
               <p>You have already said, that you can recollect every article in your shop, notwithstanding you manufacture for the whole army, these are plated spurs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is very usual to have a bit off the plateing? - They are very remarkable.</p>

               <p>Did you never see spurs defective before? - I never kept them in my shop.</p>
               <p>Who puts on the shop marks upon the things you speak of? - My father to some, and I to others, all the things have not marks.</p>
               <p>Did not you mark all your dog collars? - No, that is my father's writing.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I first of all apprise you, Mr. Gibson, I have not the smallest notion that you will say what is wrong, but I think it is very probable you may mistake, can you say that is your father's writing? - I can, Sir.</p>
               <p>You pulled this stock from a nail it seems? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think no man who has had those kind of stocks in their hands, but must know they have been jagged; now your memory is so very tenacious, that you can take upon you to say, that you remember those marks when you bought that skin of leather? - I do.</p>
               <p>What is the mark on this? - It is a very particular plate that we use to ladies nose-bits, and our workmen know them.</p>
               <p>You think it is impossible you should mistake? - No, that I have not said; I am sure to some things, some I am not sure of; I am very sure my father's hand writing cannot be upon other people's goods.</p>
               <p>Now about this pale yellow, that is more singular than any thing else, do the men in the country work for your father only? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure he manufactures no others, that vary a single shade from these? - Not pale, if you can find me the fellow of it in London, I shall be willing to forfeit any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prosecutor. I believe from the several circumstances you have mentioned, you have a reasonable belief these are your goods, and stolen from your shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember that rent in the stock? - Yes, I remember its being pulled down, as to the girths I know them by their particular yellow, we had a piece of plush we wished to correspond with the girths, and we sent down a piece in a letter in order to get it dyed on purpose, I believe this to be my master's property, and just the same as to the regimental leather, the mark in the dog collar is master's own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Go round to the Jury, and shew that Morocco leather which you swear to? - I cannot speak to the Morocco leather.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long ago is it you sent down that piece of plush? - Perhaps four months, or less, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively that this is like the plush that you sent down? - To the best of my belief, I am pretty sure it is my master's, the leather of the reins is a stronger kind of leather than is used for reins in general.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you missed any articles before? - Yes, some tips and buckles, here is one of the buttons.</p>

               <p>How get it? - Why to steal it.</p>
               <p>To steal it, from whom? - From my master, and I did so, and young Wintersgill asked me to get him three remnants of ribbon, some of it was scarlet.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his taking any thing of himself? - Yes, he took two whole heads and reins, and a plated snaffle, I saw him take them.</p>
               <p>What occasion had he to employ you? - Because I lived in the house, and he did not, and he could not get the bit in the day time, the men would see him; he was cleaning the garret out, and he cut off the snaffle reins at one time, and the other at another, he said, he would carry them home to his father.</p>
               <p>Had you any part of the profit of any of these things? - One time he gave me sixpence, and at other time a penny, he told me I should never want for money, or any thing else; there were some tips I took for him.</p>
               <p>Are there any of the things that you have seen here, that he took himself? - Yes, the heads and reins, these he took himself, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Well my honest little gentleman, do not you know yourself by that name, look this way, how do you know those things, by the marks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know them by their colour? - I suppose he had no other of his own, these are the six tips I gave him.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Court. In respect to the things that this boy stole and gave to the prisoner, it clearly cannot support this indictment, because this boy is the thief, and young Wintersgill is the receiver.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. One night as I was going home, two or three nights before I had these things, this boy came and asked me to buy them, an acquaintance of his had some to sell; two or three nights after, he came and brought them to me, and desired me to sell them, I took them and put them in my box and drawers, unknown to my father; the boy teazed me for the money, and I gave him sixpence, my father was out of town, in the mean time I hung these things up in the window for sale, I did not know they were stolen, I left word what the price was, as to this regimental rein, which my young master says is his own, he has some doubt about it, for it was at one Mr. Hiton's, a bridle cutter, I asked him if he ever had any old second hand heads and reins, he said he had, I gave him half a crown for them, my father knows nothing of these things.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.)</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. In high treason and petty arcency there can be no accessary, the crime of receiving stolen goods, is in the nature of an accessary after the fact; if the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150167"/> charge of either of the prisoners is true, the crime of the receiver is certainly greater than the thief, it is particularly so in this case, where the father is the receiver, and the thief is the son: if you confine your verdict merely to the two articles which Sinclair saw the boy take, they are both of the value of twelve-pence.</p>

               <p>I never saw the sight of that man's money, this was money sent me out of the country; I never wronged man nor mortal since I was created.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'DANIEL'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw any thing of the money, the good man gave me the money to take care of till the morning, seven guineas and a half, two half crowns, and a shilling, when the woman saw it, she would not undress to go to bed; the man asked me to give him the money again, which I did; I locked the woman in, and in about an hour and a half the woman knocked and said, mistress! mistress! be so kind as to give me a drink of water; the woman was dressed, and she whipped over the stairs; the man said, she had got his money, I said to the man, do not let us be too positive, let us shake the clothes. I go out a charing very hard for my bread.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be quarrelling with Thompson about the two guineas? - We happened to get a little drop of liquor in our heads, it is natural, Sir. My husband and son were killed in America.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I do not think that the rule of law extends to the case of the prisoner's own dwelling house, it is the dwelling house of other persons in which a man is assaulted and robbed, and not the parties dwelling houses; therefore I shall not recommend to you to find them guilty of robbing in the dwelling house.</p>

            , at the Horse-shoe and Magpye, in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Court. This is not a conviction to be countenanced, for a man to go for the purpose to lead a man to commit a felony, and then to bring evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Court. With what intention did you go to enquire for Anderson? - The shopman told me them people could sell me some bad pieces, and he said if you have a mind to buy some bad gold, you may; I said I would, for I could pass them: he sent me to the Horse-shoe and Magpye.</p>

               <p>Then you went to buy it on purpose to pass it? - No, my Lord, on purpose to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Is this the first time you have employed yourself that way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let us hear the conversation? - The conversation was to apprehend such people, to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>What did you go to the Horse-shoe and Magpye for? - For Anderson.</p>
               <p>For what? - On purpose to buy half a guinea of him.</p>
               <p>What did you intend to do with the half guinea? - I intended to deliver no money for it till I went to the runners; when I saw him he produced half a guinea; I had only three shillings in my pocket; he said he would take five shillings, which I agreed to give him; he told me he would take half a crown in part of payment; I told him if he would come with me I would give him the five shillings; I told him I lived in Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150170"/>Where did you give him the money? - No, he took the half guinea back in his pocket: then he came up with me to Turnstile, Holborn, but he would not go with me for the money; I told him I did not like to run in trust, but I was going to take him to another house; then I turned up into High-street, Bloomsbury, there I met Umpage, I told him about it, then Umpage told me to go and buy it; I went for it, and gave him half a crown, and I promised him the remainder; when I went back for the bad silver, he gave me the half guinea, and I gave him the half crown; he said he would trust me till the next day.</p>
               <p>What excuse did you make him for not bring the whole money? - I made no excuse at all, he took the half crown very contentedly; I was to bring the half crown at night, Mr. Umpage, and I, and one or two, went down to look for him, and did not find him: about eleven on the Saturday I met with the prisoner at the Horse-shoe and Magpye; I asked him why he did not come at night; he said he could not get what he was to bring. He was taken up that morning; I gave the half guinea to Mr. Umpage.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the same you bought of the prisoner? - I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>From what circumstance do you know it? - By the making.</p>
               <p>Is it gold or false metal? - False metal.</p>
               <p>I immagine that cannot be told without it is assayed? - The missing is not like the Tower milling, I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Umpage. When did this happen? - Pritchard came to me on the 13th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the prosecutor what money he gave me; I leave myself entirely to the Court to plead for me: He offered half price for it; I would not take half a crown for it; he came to me on Saturday morning, and brought a crown piece and half a crown piece, here, says he, I have got money enough, you must bring the half guinea. I never had a half guinea but that in my life; I never saw a bad half guinea before.</p>
               <p>Court. If you supposed this to be a good half guinea, why did you sell it? - I am partner in a news-walk, I received a little money, and this amongst it, and I suspected a man, and he said if I would go and take my oath before a Justice of peace, he would take it of me: you must think me a madman to fell this to strangers I never saw before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a very good character; and one witness, who said he believed the Prosecutor would swear false, if he could get any thing by it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This is a felony, by the act of King William, without any specific punishment; here is a very great difference between the means used to obtain evidence of a felony already committed, and drawing a man into the commission of a crime; it is just the same, as if anybody hearing that a man had the character of a thief, was to leave property in his way, in order that he might steal it, and then prosecute him for the felony: it is extremely different from making use even of indirect means to obtain proof of a felony already committed. Here the felony was committed at the instigation of the witness; he does not stand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150171"/> directly in the light of an accomplice, in which case, there being no evidence but his, the law would not admit you to convict the prisoner on his testimony alone; yet he does not appear more deserving of credit, and the whole rests on his single testimony; for all that any other witness can prove is, that he himself produced a bad half guinea; but the prosecutor has fully proved the charge against the prisoner, if you think him intitled to credit, however you may disapprove the manner in which he acted.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am head waiter at the Swan and Two Necks, in Lad-lane; I went to her house to buy some money, for the purpose of apprehending her; she called me into her yard, I said I was informed she dealt in bad money, and I could be a customer to her; she told me I could get more by dealing with her, than I did from the perquisires of my place; she called to her maid, and desired her to hand a brown paper that she had in her pocket, the maid did, in which was a quantity of bad silver, which she wanted me to purchase; I said I had no money then, but must defer it to another time; the prisoner Mackenzie was in the yard at this time, he stood neuter all the time; he saw her shew me the money. I were in about two or three days again, Palmer desired me to get a guinea's worth of this silver, for the purpose of apprehending her, and when I went there he stood at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street; one Isaac was with Palmer, and I then saw both the prisoners in the kitchen; I said I was come after a guinea's-worth of silver, that I had alked about the day before; the prisoner called to the maid, and desired her to bring another paper, wherein was this money, there were twenty-four shillings and twelve sixpences contained in this paper: after I had received them, this Mr. Mackenzie called to this maid, and desired her to hand a shilling from off the shelf, which she did, and he put a shilling into the paper; I then came out, and one of the officers took them into custody. I gave a guinea to this woman.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your bargain? - I had thirty-one shillings with the one he had put in.</p>
               <p>(An objection was here made, that the indictment was laid that the money given was twenty-four shillings and twelve sixpences, and it appeared by this, that twenty five shillings and twelve sixpences were given.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shilling was given after I had received the thirty shillings and paid the guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. Had you never been at her house before? - I never was there but twice in my, she went by the name of Mackenzie, otherwise Black Bess, I never spoke to her afterwards: I told her I heard she dealt in it, and would be glad she would let me have some.</p>
               <p>Did you know at that time you was committing a felony? - No, Sir,</p>
               <p>Did you mean to buy when you went first? - No, Sir, only to see if the fell; I meant to put a stopt the circulation of it at the house where I lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150172"/>What did you in your evidence before the Magistrate swear that you received in exchange for a guinea? - My memory will not allow me positively to give an answer to that question.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, positively swear there, that you received twenty-five shillings and twelve sixpences? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you say you did not swear that? - No, I will not say one way or the other; I know the Justice asked me if I had received that money from the woman, and I recollect the was committed on account of delivering the thirty shillings to me, and he was committed for aiding and assisting in ordering the maid to deliver the shilling off the shelf.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the woman committed upon your oath for puting off twenty-five shillings and twelve sixpences? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Shaw went by the name of Mackenzie? - I took her to be the wife of Mackenzie, but I cannot say; they both lived together, and kept this little girl as servant; they live in a court opposite the Castle and Falcon in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether they are man and wife or not? - I heard the little girl call them master and mistress.</p>
               <p>And they live as such? - I suppose so, my Lord, but I do not know.</p>

               <p>The man was not committed at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was he discharged? - I believe the next day, when they were examined, Shaw was committed.</p>

               <p>How came you to carry the prisoners before Mr. Blackborow, and not before a Magistrate? - There was no Magistrate to be found when we took them, Sir.</p>

Gentlemen, in a case like this, I think it my duty to open every circumstance against or for the prisoner; it is not my wish, or your wish, I am sure, to strain the law against this young woman: you will, under my Lord's direction, first enquire, whether the child was born alive, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150174"/> whether it was not; and if it was, whether violent hands were laid upon it: she also said, that she meant to bury it privately, that it might not be known.

               <p>You are a married woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had children? - Four dead ones.</p>
               <p>Did her pains excite any suspicions in you that they were labour pains? - Yes, I told her I thought she was in labour.</p>
               <p>Do you think she understood what you said to her, and what she said to you? - I believe she did: I went down stairs, and returned in about five minutes, she was on the side of the bed then; I went down to get my own breakfast, thinking it was gone off: I sent for a gentlewoman to go up, and in about half an hour I went up; she was got into bed, and said she was much better by what I gave her; I then imagined there was a child born, and between three and four I saw a child laying in a white apron by the side of the bed; it was dead, I could not take it up.</p>

               <p>Did you examine her drawer? - Yes, I did for another account, to look for the child, and there I saw a shirt and cap.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The poor woman has no Council, I will ask you what character she had? - I have had her six weeks, and I had a good character with her, and she deserved no other from me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. THOMLINSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Soy and me went up with her, and asked her if she was not with child; she said she was not, and her mistress left me; I sat some time with her, and she said she was not with child, then I went away and was fetched again, and she would not own it; I saw the child in the apron in a chair; I asked her how that accident could happen, and she said she was sorry she did not own it.</p>
               <p>Did she say why she did not own it? - She said she was ashamed to own it, as she denied it so long.</p>
               <p>Court. What she said cannot be given in evidence for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon and man-midwife; I was called upon to see the woman and child on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
               <p>You found the woman had been recently delivered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the child at its full time? - Yes; I questioned the woman, and I could not by her account learn if the child was born alive; I asked her if the child cried, she said not; I asked her if she felt the child move, she said no; I asked her if she did not use a knife to cut the navel string, she said she did not, she said she tore it. I should not suppose it was born alive; my opinion is, that the child died in the birth for want of assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the conscientious fair opinion that you form? - That is my opinion.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon the child? - Not sufficient to kill it; there was a mark on the cheek, as if she had tore it; there were two marks on the side of the neck which I observed, which were taken notice of by the Jury: I considered it fully, and I think it might happen in the efforts of delivering herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150175"/>In the delivery the head of course appears first? - In the usual course of births.</p>
               <p>Then about the neck and head must necessarily be the place that the woman must lay hold of to assist herself? - I did not see the child for some hours after she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this being a trial upon the Coroner's Inquisition at common law, not under any indictment on the statute, it is necessary that there should be some evidence to satisfy you, that the mother by violence and wilfully was the cause of the child's death; for either on the Coroner's Inquisition, or on an indictment, similar circumstances of proof are required to those and other cases of murder, and the case only differs in this, that where the act of killing the child is wilful and intentional, it must in all cases amount to murder, because there can be no provocation, it cannot be manslaughter; that is the only difference: the single question is, whether the child was wilfully and intentionally killed or not? But it is necessary that there should be clear proof of the child's being born alive, and having appearances of violence, and that the Jury should be clearly satisfied that the mother intentionally killed the child: to be sure you have not such proof in the present case. I cannot blame the Grand Jury with not finding the bill. You see the young woman had provided some things for the child, she had wrapped it up in a cloth, and laid it by her bedside in a situation which she knew it must be found. To be sure in this case, there is no evidence to charge her with the crime of wilful murder.</p>
