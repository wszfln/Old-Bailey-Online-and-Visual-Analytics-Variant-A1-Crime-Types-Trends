                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 72, Mark Lane—I had business relations with the prisoner before May, 1893—I received these letters from him of 8th and 12th of May. (<hi rend="italic">The first asked Ackerman if he could match the enclosed sample of Indian red exactly, and requested him to send a counter sample and the lowest price per ton; the second letter asked Ackerman to let Zumbeck know whether he could offer the red as per sample, as the matter was being kept open for his reply</hi>)—after that I pro<lb/>cured a sample of red, which I sent on 16th May, with this-letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could do the enclosed sample to match the sample sent him at</hi> £13 10s. <hi rend="italic">per ton, less</hi> 2 1/2; <hi rend="italic">per cent., cash on delivery</hi>)—I received this letter from the prisoner on May 17th, 1893. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged receipt of the letter and sample, asked for</hi> 28 <hi rend="italic">lbs. to be sent to try, and stated that it was of the utmost importance that the colour should be exactly like Zutmbeck's sample, both dry and in oil; that it was to be exact and finer, and if satisfactory, he would take a ton. A postscript added</hi>, "Please be careful both with regard to shade and fineness. We send you a large sample herewith.") (<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR EDWARD CLARKE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called attention tothe fact that in the original letter the words</hi>, "It is of the utmost importance that the colour is like our sample," and" Take care that it is exact," <hi rend="italic">were under<lb/>lined</hi>)—I received these two letters of 9th June. (<hi rend="italic">The first stated that the sample sent by Ackerman did not answer Zumbeck's buyer's purpose; the second enclosed a further sample of what was required, and requested a further twenty-eight pounds to try and match the sample as to shade, strength softness, and covering power, and added that it must be exact, to get the order</hi>)—on 17th June I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">The enclosed a sample, and stated that if he could match it exactly in every respect lie could have</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">the order for a ton</hi>)—after that I procured a sample, which I think I took myself to the prisoner as the nearest I could do to match his sample; that would be two or three days after the last letter, about the 19th or 20th—perhaps two days afterwards I called at the prisoner's office—it was before the 20th, but about that date—I can say the date when I see the letter; it was in the morning, before half-past eleven—I saw the prisoner in his inner office—I asked him if my sample suited—he had samples rubbed out in oil, on glass—he said, "This is what I want to match; which do you think is the nearer?"—I said, "I don't know"—I looked at the samples, pointed to one, and said, "I think that is"—he said, "So do I; send me 24 cwt."—20 cwt. of this material goes to a ton—the sample I picked out was ours—he said, "This is yours"; there were other samples from other people—I said, "Have you tested this for strength? because I have not; the colour seems right; I have not the means of testing that in my office; you have; here, shall we do it?" Pointing to his test scales—he said, "No; send me 24 cwt."—I then left—in conse<lb/>quence of that conversation I ordered the stuff from our principals that same morning before lunch time—lunch time is from half-past twelve to half-past one—I have no recollection what time I left my business premises that day—I came next morning about my usual time, I suppose about half-past nine; I saw my clerk or office boy, who gave me this letter from the prisoner: "Referring to the ton of red ordered this mor<lb/>ning, please mark the cask ✗ without any other mark or label appearing The red must be an exact match to our sample in every respect, or it will be rejected"—I think it was in an envelope, which was destroyed—the envelope had no postmark on it—I may have stayed at my office the previous afternoon till my usual time for leaving, from half-past four to half-past five—I see now, by the date of this letter, that my interview with the prisoner would have been on the 20th—I read the letter, and made a remark about it to the boy—I don't think I know the prisoner's writing—I did not answer that letter either verbally or by writing—the order I gave to my principals on the 20th was verbal, and I confirmed it afterwards in writing—I am not sure whether this letter was posted or not; it was sent on the 21st, I believe; it was after I had seen this letter of 20th. (<hi rend="italic">This ordered 20 to 25 cwt. of red as per sample in confirmation of the conversation of yesterday.</hi>)—I afterwards learned that the goods had been sent—I sent in this invoice to the prisoner, with a delivery order; it shows £16 0s. 7 1/2 d., less discount—on 6th July I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had heard from his customers that the 24 cwt. of red delivered was not the same as the last sample, and they were unable to use it, and desired the right quality to be delivered immediately.</hi>)—I also received these letters of July 13th and 20th. (<hi rend="italic">The letter of the 13th stated that Zumbeck's customers objected not only to the colour, but to the quality; that of the 20th stated that his customers could not use it, as it was not at all like the sample, and that Zumbeck would have to buy it elsewhere and debit Ackerman with any difference in price, unless he could supply the proper quality; that as the customers were in immediate want of it, Zumbeck had ordered a cask, for which he had to pay £20 a ton</hi>)—I wrote on 5th September, asking for a cheque, and I received this letter of the same date from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Expressing surprise at Acker<lb/>man's letter, as the six casks were rejected because of not being of the proper</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">quality; stating that Zumbeck had had to buy a ton against Ackerman, and had sent a debit note, and as soon as that was paid Ackerman would receive back the six casks, which meantime were held as security.</hi>)—I replied on 5th September.

A letter of 6th September was also read, returning the debit statement, and asserting that Zumbeck examined Ackerman's sample, on which he sold.</hi>)—during the progress of that correspondence I had several interviews with the prisoner; the first was when I knew that his customers had rejected it—he then asked me if I would try still to match the original sample—I told him that what I had sent was the nearest I Could do—I am not certain whether at that interview he said he would try his people again—I saw him again afterwards, and he said his people did not approve of it, and I said, "Very well, I will take the stuff back, Mr. Zumbeck; we will not have any bother about it; I will take it back"—he said, "Oh, no, you won't; that stuff I want to match costs £20 per ton" (This was before that letter of September 5th)" You pay me the differ<lb/>ence between your price, £13 10s. per ton, and £20, which is £6 10s., then you shall have your stuff back"—I replied, "Never, I will not pay 1d."—I think I walked out then—I do not think I had any interviews with him after that—I don't remember this document of 20th June being mentioned at any interview—there is a door between the prisoner's two rooms; it was open, I think, during the interview when I received the order, because I pointed to the test scales which stood in the outer office—I don't know if it is a glass door which you can see through—the prisoner employs three clerks, I think—I think there were two in the outer office on that occasion; I don't know their names—before the action was commenced there was no other attempt to compromise—I then began an faction for the payment of the amount on my invoice—the prisoner counter-claimed, and we went to trial before the Assistant Judge in the Mayor's Court, on the 22nd and 25th January—on the first day my evidence was taken—the prisoner gave evidence on 25th January.

               <p>when I went to the prisoner's office on 20th—I came to my office that morning about 9.30; I do not remember exactly the time—I went to my office before I went to the prisoner's—I saw Mr. Cartwright himself on Tuesday, 20th, at their place in Fenchurch Street, and gave the order verbally; I gave no memorandum then; I got no memorandum from them—I told them the order should be confirmed, and my marks and particulars should follow—I don't know that I said anything about the marks, that I said the order should be confirmed—I told them the order should be con<lb/>firmed with my marks—I had said nothing to the prisoner about marks; I mentioned it to Mr. Cartwright, because I should want my own mark put on—I did not give the marks then; I had not time then to go back to my office and write; I wanted to write my marks—my mark is "J. R.A." in a zigzag—I wanted to write that and the order altogether—the prisoner was anxious to have this stuff at once, and I went at once and ordered it; and next morning I confirmed the order; I was going to give an order in the regular way in writing, and the order in a regular way in writing I gave next morning, after I had read the document of 20th June, before I put the prisoner's mark on the casks instead of my own—when I gave the regular order for the goods I acted on this memorandum of 20th June; the casks were marked as per that order—when I read this document of 20th June, I did not consider it altered the bargain which had been made between me and the prisoner, because I read it after his having selected that sample—no mention was made of this document from 20th June up to September, and no mention would have been made of it if the prisoner had not made this out as a contract in the Court—I attached no importance to it at the time—I do not know the names of the prisoner's clerks—I have seen them from time to time.</p>

On April 12th I was called to Mr. Epps' shop, and Bennett charged the prisoner with attempting to pass a bad half-crown there—he said he did not do it intentionally, and must have taken it by mistake—I searched him in the shop, and found a florin, two shillings, and a sixpence—he made no answer—I found a box of choco<lb/>late on him, in consequence of which I went to Miss James—the prisoner gave me his address at Highgate, but I could not find it—he was charged, and made no reply.</p>

I am a clerk in the secretary's office at the General Post Office—I am principally employed in confidential in<lb/>quiries—this book is a copy of the rules—on 24th April I saw the prisoner at the General Post Office—I said to him, "I am investigating the loss of a registered letter, posted on the 18th April, addressed to Mr. W. T. Walters, of 25, Cornford Road, Peckham, containing £1 19s. 7d.; this letter was handed to you for delivery on the night of the 18th, and you signed for it. What did you do with that letter?"—he said, "I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300016"/>
               <p>delivered it. I was going up Cornford Road, and a man came up to me and asked if I had anything for No. 25—I said, 'Yes,' but I could not give it up in the street; 'I will take it to the house.' I went up to the house; the man was standing inside the gate; the man took the letter and signed for it; he held it up against the wall and signed for it"—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you knock at the door?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Had you ever seen the man before?"—he said, "No, I don't know that I had seen him before"—I said, "The receipt is signed in pencil"—he said, "Yes, sir, I handed the man my pencil"—I said, "What time did you deliver the letter?"—he said, "About half-past nine"—I said, "That receipt appears to be signed in your handwriting"—he said, "It is not my writing"—I then produced this form, which he filled up on entering the service—I said, "Is this your writing?"—he examined it and said, "Yes"—it is my special duty to compare handwriting—I have been examined as an expert in this Court and others—in my opinion this writing on the receipt is the prisoner's—there is a peculiar capital T and a capital W just above; that T is exactly like the prisoner's capital T, but it is in a different inclination; there is a resemblance between the two W's—there is a distance between the capital W and the letters following—that is a peculiarity in the prisoner's writing—he also invariably writes above the line, never on the line—that is a peculiarity of his throughout the form of application, and there is the same on the receipt; those are the similarities upon which I rely—in my opinion the handwriting on the receipt for the registered letters is in the prisoner's writing—considering the thinness of the paper on which it is written, I should say it was impossible it could have been written against the wall without showing the marks—I did not examine the wall at the time; it is a concrete wall, indented by the grain; it is a kind of sandy material—it would have been dark at half-past nine, and it would be difficult for a man to write in a direct line—the prisoner may have had a lamp, but as a rule he did not carry one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor—I live at Bedford Mansions, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden—at 12.30 a.m. on Friday, 20th April, I was coming from Leicester Square to Henrietta Street—I noticed the prisoner following me, and as I was turning from a small court into Cran<lb/>bourne Street, goinghome, he asked me for a shilling—I motioned him away, and walked very quickly—he followed me through the court into St. Martin's Lane; I crossed the road rapidly, and went into a public-house to dodge and get rid of him—as I went in at the door he said, "If you will give me a drink I will go away"—I gave him a glass of beer, which be drank, and I drank some whisky—he went out first, and, as I thought, he went one way and I went the other, but within a minute or so he came up again—I was, wearing this pin, set with turquoises and pearls—he repeated his request for a shilling, but not in so many words—I cannot recollect</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300022"/>
               <p>exactly his words—I walked rapidly on, and he followed and snatched my pin out of my scarf—I took hold of him, and said I would give him in charge—he begged very hard of me not to do so—he said, "Oh, do not give me in charge; I will give you back your pin if you will give me some money"—he entreated very much—I had only a few pence—I was then within a few steps of my own door, and I said, "I have no money with me"—I have never given anyone in charge before, and I said if he would take a few shillings I would give it to him, and would not give him in charge if he would give me back my pin—he said, "Very well"—I opened the street door of Bedford Mansions, and the prisoner stepped within—my chambers are on the third floor—the porter lives in the basement—he closes at eleven—the prisoner said, "I will remain here"—I ran up to my flat—after I returned from going into one of my rooms, I found he was in the entrance—I had left the door of my flat open, and he was in the hall—that was almost imme<lb/>diately afterwards—he said, "Now I am here, I do not want any of your silver; I will have some gold"—he said he wanted £1, and gradually increased it to £5—he said, "If you don't give me £5, I won't stir," and that he would accuse me of an awful offence, that he would not stick at anything—there was an altercation—he said, "If you don't give me £5 I will accuse you of taking liberties with me"—that he would swear anything—I said a good deal to per<lb/>suade him—I said if he kept to his original plan, and would give me my pin, I would give him what he demanded, and would withdraw what he said he would accuse me of—I was quite sober—I was dumbfounded, and did not know whether to call my two maid-servants—I finally called the porter, Watkins, whom I told in the prisoner's presence that the prisoner had taken my pin, and that I had said I would pay him for it (I meant, give him the few shillings he asked for), and that he had demanded £5 from me, and threatened unless I did that he would accuse me—I told the porter to fetch a constable, which he did—I gave the prisoner into custody on the charge of stealing my pin—I went to the Police-station, and told the officer in charge what I have now stated in the prisoner's hearing—he said that he knew nothing about it—I went to the Police-court the same morning, gave my evidence, and the prisoner was com<lb/>mitted for trial—on my return from the City in the evening I found my servant, Ada Todd, had placed my pin in my bedroom—it is not true that in Leicester Square I said "Good evening" to the prisoner, or walked with him, or asked him what regiment he belonged to, or if he would like a drink; or that at my chambers I said, "I live here; come in here, but don't make a noise"; or that he sat there, and talked with me half-an-hour, and that all at once I accused him of stealing my scarf<lb/>pin; or that he said he did not know I had a pin—I believe it is true the porter caught him by the throat, and said, "What is this?" that a minute or two afterwards the constable came, and asked him for the pin—not that I said, "You have my pin," and that he said, "Nothing of the kind"—he was searched at the station, and the pin was not found there—from the time I left Leicester Square till I reached my lodgings in Henrietta Street I saw no policeman.</p>

As I was coming out through Leicester Square the prosecutor passed by I thought I knew him, and looked at him. He stopped and said 'Good evening.' We walked along, and he asked me what regiment I was in, and as we were passing a public-house in St. Martin's Lane he asked me if I would like to have a drink. I went and had a drink. We came out, and walked by some back streets to Covent Garden till all at once he stopped me near some chambers, and said, 'I live in here; would you like to come up? Do not make, a noise.' We went to the third floor, We sat talking together. All at once he turned round and accused me of stealing his pin. I said 'I did not know you had a pin,' He said, 'Very well.' He walked downstairs, and fetched the porter up. The porter clutched me by the throat, and said, 'What is this?' and he went straight downstairs, and a minute or two afterwards came up with a policeman. The policeman asked me if I had the pin. The prosecutor said, 'Give me the pin, and I will say, no more about it.' I said, 'I have not got it; you may search me if you think I have got it.' I came to the</p>

               <p>on the charge of highway robbery with violence, and stealing 3l. 2d.—Goddard said, "I don't know anything about it; what time did it happen?"—before I could answer he said, "I left work at half-past five"—I said, "About twelve"—I have not got on my note what I said—Upjohn was in Dougall's custody—I arrested Husband at his house, 29, Raphael Street—I told him the charge—he said, "I saw the row, and the men running away"—I said, "What men?"—he said, "I don't know; I don't know anything about the affair."</p>

How much do you want for it?"—he said, "A sovereign"—I said, "I haven't the money"—he said, "Take the watch and pay me when you can"—I said, "I have one watch; that's quite sufficient"—he said, "Show me your watch"—I showed it—he said, "Will you give me 10s. and this watch for it?"—I said, "Yes"—he gave me the watch produced; it was better than mine, and I gave him the half-sovereign and my watch—I took it to the pawnbroker's to pledge; they detained it and called a police-constable while I was there; I said how I got it, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Cohen, who carries on the business of an engineer at 240, Blackfriars Road—on Friday, 30th of March last, I saw the prisoner Polti at our shop—he had with him a companion, who I identified at Bow Street as Farnara—Polti spoke—he asked whether he could have a piece of iron piping off the stack in our yard—I went with them to the heap of iron that was in the yard—one of them, I am not sure which, picked up a piece of iron piping—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the piece, and this other piece they picked out afterwards; they put the first piece back again—this bent one was the first piece, and afterwards the smaller piece, the straight piece—while they were picking out the pieces they were talking together in a foreign language I did not understand—when they had picked out the straight piece Polti said he would pay half-a-crown deposit on the two pieces of piping, and on Monday he would fetch them away and pay the rest—they wanted me cut a piece off the larger piece, the bent piece—they pointed with their fingers to about eight or ten inches off the straight part of it—I said we cud not do that kind of work—Farnara handed half-a-crown to Polti, and Polti gave it to me, and I gave a receipt for it—Polti was the only one</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Cohen, of 240, Blackfriars Road—on Thursday, 5th April, I saw Polti at our shop—he said he called about a socket and a piece of pipe that he had bought and paid a deposit on—the socket is the bend—he did not wish to take them away, but to pay a further deposit of eighteen pence—he asked if we could cut the pipe and socket for him—I said, "No; we do no work of that kind"—I gave him the address of an engineer who worked for us, Mr. Norm, of Barron's Place, Waterloo Road—he then paid me eighteen pence and left; I entered that on the receipt—he called again on the following Monday, the 9th—he then said he could not get the pipe cut, it was too expensive, and he again asked me if I could not cut it for him—I told him "No," and said, "What do you want?"—he said, "A piece of pipe with the ends closed"—I said, "I suppose you want it to open?"—I then told him I could suggest something that would answer his pur<lb/>pose well, and I then made a rough sketch of what I suggested—I asked him what it was wanted for—he said it was not for himself, but for the other man, who was very poor—I then sent him down to the cellar to look for some steel sockets, and one of our men returned with him to the office, bringing a socket as a specimen—a socket is a thing with a screw or thread inside; it is a short piece of pipe screwed on the inside, joining two pieces of pipe together—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an ordinary socket—I ex<lb/>plained to him that by closing up the end of the socket it would form a cap, and two of those caps with a socket and a thread outside would answer his purpose—I imagined what his purpose was; I had an idea what it was for; I had a suspicion; I expected that he wanted it for a purpose of this kind, for a bomb—I suggested two caps—this is one cap; it becomes a cap when you close the end of it—this is the other cap; this is what I call the nipple—I showed him a sketch of the things,' not these articles; it was torn up; it was merely a casual sketch, as I should show to any customer., to see what it was—this is one cap with the end stopped—this nipple screws inside, and this other cap will go over that—the nipple connects them—nothing else was wanted but the two caps and the nipple—he asked me if I would get them for him—I said I would, and they would cost two shillings or three shillings more than the four shillings I already had—when I showed him the sketch and the things he said that it would do very nicely; just the thing he wanted—he said he would call again, and he came on the following Wednesday evening, that would be the 11th, about a quarter to eight—that was after the place wan closed—we closed at seven—I opened the door to him; I live on the premises—he asked if I had got these fittings for him—I said, "No, are you quite sure that is what you want?"—he said, "Yes, just the thing"—he then said he would like it five inches across, meaning the diameter—I said, "That is very large; would not four or four and a half do?"—he said he wanted it five—I said that would cost him more money, and I should think four and a half would be quite</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300032"/>
               <p>big enough—he said he would call again the next day—the next day, Thursday, I gave information to the police at Stones End Police-station—on my way to the Police-station I purchased the nipple, and one of the caps now produced—that same day Inspector Quinn and another officer, Detective Riley, came to our premises, and remained there—I did not see the prisoner that day; I learnt that he called while I was out—I next saw him on the following Friday, the 13th, about half-past five or six—Inspector Quinn was then on the premises—I showed the prisoner the cap and the nipple which I had purchased—he said he was sorry I had not got the other cap, but that was just the thing he wanted—he paid another shilling—he asked if he could have the thing complete on Sunday—I said, "No"; I did not do business on Sunday, but he could have it any time on Saturday—he said it would be very inconvenient to call on Saturday, and after a little pressing I told him he could have it on Sunday, between seven and eight—as he was leaving I asked him his name, as I had not got it—he then gave me this card—on it is "Francis Polti, Representative of the Anglo-Italian Agency, 23, Warner Street, Farringdon Road, E. C."—I gave it to the police—at that interview, as we were talking, he said, "Miller is making me one"—Miller is an engineer of Lancaster Street, Borough Road—I was surprised, and said, "How is that?" he said "He was so long"—I said, "What is it like?" he said, "Yours is better and stronger"—he called next day, Saturday the 14th, between five and six—the shop was then closed, and the police were watching outside—my daughter opened the door to him—I had given her instructions—after she Had spoken to him he went away—I left the premises for a short time to see that the police were there, and when I came back I found the prisoner in the shop—t said I was surprised to see him, as he was coming on Sunday—he said as he was in the neighbour<lb/>hood he thought it would do to see if we had got it ready—I took him to the back of the shop, and showed him the thing together, complete, the two caps fitted on the nipple—he examined it, and was very pleased with it—he said it was just the thing—he unscrewed it, and in doing so he said it went rather hard, he wanted it to go easy—I cleaned it, and oiled it, to make it go easy—he then paid me another half-crown, and I gave him this receipt for the whole of the money, 7s. 6d. "April 14th, Polti, bought of J. Cohen, machinery dealer, 240, Blackfriars Road, three three-and-a-half steam fittings, 7s. 6d. settled by cash, Cohen and Co., by T. Smith"—I wrapped them up in paper, and he took them away—as we were passing by the cellar door he asked me if I would let him have one of these old fittings—I took him out this one, and I permitted him to have it without any extra payment—I call it a socket—as he was going I asked him what kind of business he was connected with—he said he travelled on commission all over London, and called only on Frenchmen and Italians—I, said if any of his friends he called on wanted any steam power I would allow him a commission for any orders he could procure for me—I said, "What about your friend? What is he doing?"—he said that he travelled on the Continent, and that he might be in France or Italy any day that week—he asked fox a shilling commission on this one—I said if he wanted any more I would sell him at a shilling less—he said he might want five or six more, and might, see me again about the following Thursday—that was all the con<lb/>versation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300033"/>
               <p>—from my experience in the trade there is no lawful purpose that I know of for which such a thing as this could be used—I don't know it as being used in trade for any purpose—I suspected from the first, and I was acting throughout on that suspicion, and under the direction of the police.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not ask Polti who the other man was—only one man came with him on the first occasion—it was on the Monday evening I first had suspicion—I don't think that "suspicion" is rather a weak word to use under the circumstances—when I asked whether he would require any more objects of this kind, I then believed it was for a bomb—as soon as I formed a suspicion I communicated with the police—he had no opportunity of obtaining the things from any of my assistants without the police being aware of it; it was impossible because I had not got them for him—I did not say anything to the persons in the shop about the possibility of his calling for these thing—I spoke to my wife about it on the Wednesday evening—I said nothing to the prisoner about approving of the manufacture of articles of this kind—I did not at any time intend to convey to the prisoner that I knew what these things were for—I did not give him any ground for my suspicion; I kept him in the dark.</p>

I have bought a piece of pipe, but he cannot do the fitting"—I said, "Oh, yes; come in"—he came into the office first, and explained that he had bought a piece of pipe of Cohen, and he wanted a piece cut out of it, and these plates put on, but it must; not be expensive—I took him round to the shop—I picked up a piece of old pipe about three inches diameter from the scrap box, and also an old socket—the-pipe had a screw at one end, and I screwed, the socket on to the screw part of the pipe—I said, "If I stop these ends up, is that what you want?"—he said "That is just what I want, How much will it be?"—I said, "Five shillings"—he said "Very well" then went together back to the office—I said, "You had a better let me have 2s. or 3s.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner with this paper in his hand; that was after he had the red paper, after Easter—I did not read it when he showed it to me, I only looked at the engraving; I did not see the con<lb/>tents—I think he had not the education to compose, but, only sufficient education to copy from other documents—I see in this manuscript book "The opinion of a young man of eighteen years of age"—I think the prisoner is nearly nineteen now—I see the same expression further on—I also find here in Italian, "Dear companions, I am young, but from what I know we must take example from the young, and not from the old such examples as Pallas, Salvador, Vaillant, Emile Henri, etc., so that it may go a little better. Don't let the vale bourgeoisie live any longer. This young man was born on the shores of the Lake of Como, on 2nd December, 1875, son of one of the most respected families residing in the Commune of Vernana, in the District of Gravedonna, in the Province of Como"—the prisoner comes from the neighbourhood of Como—"on the 16th May he came to London because his parents were so ignorant, and attached to religion, so he had to leave his native country. He had always been a young man of good conduct, capable of serving generally in alt trades, professions; callings. On 16th March, 1893, he was engaged to one of the most beautiful young ladies in London, whose name was Maria Anna Elizabeth Margaret Leach"—he married Miss Leach last year—"and on 30th October in the same year she gave birth to two boys, who died, and she is still ill"—that was the fact—"She is still ill this day, March 31s. 1894 Thus, dear friends, I tell you, and all of you to act according to your ideas, and all of us, women and men, must join in action in order to revenge all, and obtain liberty"—that is fairly correctly translated—I see further on, "Down with the bourgeoisie, down with time proletarians. Vaillant is dead, but F. A. P. is learning to revenge him. Already one has commenced to revenge him; he died for liberty; so much for Paris.</p>

               <p>No, we will go to London and begin there"—I don't know what "F. A. P." means; the prisoner's initials are "F. J. P.," Francesco Johanni Polti—the initials on the prisoner's box are "F. A. P"—I see a little further on in the book: "My dear companions, my heart throbs at hearing that our companion was arrested the other day by that vile infamous thief Melville. What we have to do is to threaten him with action, that villain who has made so many arrests. The fault is not entirely hid own; it is also that of the great villains of the Republic. Dear companions, recently I sent a letter to the villain Melville, informing him that I would attempt his life during the month of April for having arrested one of our companions, Meunier; and I also sent a letter to the Queen at Florence to let her know how poor working men were treated in this country; that they were treated like slaves, and not like working men. Melville has also become rich through the many spies, and now he acts as a proletarian and a go-between for the bourgeoisie. The time for action and revenge has now arrived, also for liberty"—that letter, commencing "Dear companions," is signed "Yours, F. A. P."—before that signature is: "I want to do something to revenge myself, and then I will gladly die. I cannot live any longer to see this infamous bourgeoisie. I have seen enough of them in these eighteen years, and now I am tired to live under the proletarians. I will die to avenge myself, and leave my dear companions to avenge me with the most terrible bombs and daggers against these villains and traitors against the poor working men"—after that there is this: "My dear parents, it must grieve you as well to hear of my end. I am at last tired of living to see so many barbarities committed by the bourgeoisie. I am tired to race all these iniquities, and now I finally will avenge myself I must die in the flower of my youth, it is true, but I will avenge myself the cause of my 
death. All my companions will avenge me by deeds, and all of you, my dear parents and relations, who witness how much I have suffered for the cause, I hope you will lend a helping hand to assist my dear companions: that is to say, that you will give your bodies to Anarchy, and threaten the bour<lb/>geoisie, which was the cause of my 
death. When you receive this book I shall be dead, but I shall leave my companions behind to avenge me, and their vengeance will be terrible. For this reason I must leave all of you who are so dear to me, and whom I and my wife desired so much to see before dying, and yet I must die without even seeing my dear mother, without seeing my dear brothers, whom I loved so much, and not even my dear sisters, nephews, and brothers and sisters-in-law. I die, but I leave you to avenge me. I must really conclude with last kisses to all my dear relations, and the last cry, 'Down with the bourgeoisie, long live Anarchy.' I am always your faithful son, F. A. P., London, 16th May, 1894. The date 'the sixteenth' has always been fatal to me. I left my native country on the 16th May, 1889. I became engaged to my wife on the 16th March, 1893. I married on the 16th July, 1893, and I took my wife to the infirmary on the 16th. December, 1893. I was taken ill on the 16th April, 1890, and I have calculated to die on the 16th May, the same day on which I left my native country."</p>

About 5.30 p.m. on 14th April I was outside and near Mr. Cohen's shop, 240, Blackfriars Road, in consequence of instructions I received—about 5.30 I saw the prisoner, who rang the bell there—the door was opened by a woman—he left, and returned in about ten minutes and rang the bell a second time and the door was opened, and he entered, and remained about ten minutes inside, and then came out, carrying a brown paper parcel partially hidden under his coat—in company with Maguire and other officers, I followed him, and saw him get on to an omnibus in the Blackfriars Road; he rode to Farringdon Road, I and three other officers getting on to the omnibus at the same time as he did—we went on to the Farringdon Road, and I saw him alight from the omnibus there, and we all alighted—he walked in the direction of Ray Street; I was following with the other officers—in Ray Street he looked back two or three times; we were close by him, within a few yards—looking very suspiciously, he stopped suddenly, looked into a window and took the brown paper parcel from under his coat—then he turned his back to the window, holding the parcel between his hands as if to throw it away—I and Maguire caught hold of him, and I said, "We are police officers; I want to know what you have in that parcel"—he said, "It is iron; it is a boiler; I will show you where I bought it. I am honest, I am not a thief"—I said, "I am not satisfied with your explana<lb/>tion; you will have to come with me to the station"—I called a cab, and got in with the other officers, and took the prisoner to New Scotland Yard—on our way in the cab the prisoner said, "This is not for myself, although I paid the money for it. It is for a friend abroad. I met a man in the street who went with me when I ordered it at Mr. Cohen's shop in Blackfriars Road. He was an Italian, and could speak French, but no English.

I gave the name of Carnot when I ordered it; Carnot is the man who went with me to order this one at Mr. Cohen's shop. I first met him in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, about three months ago.

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, familiar with the Italian and English languages—I and M. Albert made this translation from Italian into English of the contents of the black manuscript book—it is correct to the best of my skill and knowledge—I have also had before me the newspaper, <hi rend="italic">n Grado dela Oppressi</hi>—I have translated this recipe, found on Polti on his arrest—the last words are, "For the polenta"—as well as I can make out it runs, "To make the B take" (<hi rend="italic">giving the names and quanti<lb/>ties of the ingredients</hi>)" and then the box for putting them all in, together with the bullets of lead. Then take a bottle empty, of our make, and in order to draw it out see it is well turned. Fill and close it up, then carry it in the pocket. When one wants to throw it away, take up the empty and make it full, and now close it, and then throw it away and escape"—that is apparently written in the dialect of Como, the district between Como and Milan—I have compared the writing beside the pencil sketch with that in the manuscript and that of the recipe—so far as I can make out they are the same—there are the same initial letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Practically I made the translation; I am responsible for it; I did not actually write it—the grammar and spelling in the manuscript book were decidedly defective—I should say it is written by a man more or less illiterate—in the translation of the recipe I have queried "our," in "of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> make"—the word in the original was <hi rend="italic">nost</hi>, which can only be a shortening of <hi rend="italic">nostro</hi>, which would mean <hi rend="italic">our; nost</hi> would be the dialect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of chemistry, and chemical advise, to the Explosives department of the Home Office—on 19th April I received from Inspector Quinn a bottle labelled "sulphuric acid"—I ex<lb/>amined it, and found it contained a little over two pounds of concentrated sulphuric acid—at the same time I received from Quinn a packet con<lb/>taining about two ounces of a white powder, which I discovered on examination to be chlorate of potassium, and a picket of yellow powder, which I examined, and as to the ingredients of which I formed a con<lb/>clusion; chlorate of potassium was one of its ingredients—I examined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300042"/>
               <p>the recipe for polenta—the contents of the yellow powder corresponded with the ingredients upon the recipe both as to description and quantity as closely as I should have expected an unskilled person to do it—it had evidently been mixed by a person unskilled in mixing—the yellow powder is in very powerful explosive, of considerably greater power than gun<lb/>powder—it could be ignited by means of the sulphuric acid from this bottle—it is very sensitive to explosion by percussion and friction—there were 14 1-5th ounces of the yellow powder—when loose it occupied a space of eighteen ounces—the smaller of these machines would have held it with a little compression; the larger one would have held it easily—I don't think that so much compression would be dangerous; it could be done with the hand—the powder, placed in either of those machines, would have formed a very powerful bomb, which would be particularly dangerous to persons about; it would not do much destruction to buildings—it would be injurious to property under certain conditions; it would depend on the kind of property and the kind of building—the powder is so sensitive to friction that it would be dangerous to any person screwing the machine together if it did not work smoothly, and therefore it was necessary for the machine to move easily—there would be danger to the person using it—in my experience I know of no lawful purpose for which these machines and the powder could be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Concentrated sulphuric acid is easily to be got—it is sold in druggists' shops; I don't think that ordinary chemists would sell it—I do not think that the manner in which the powder was mixed by an unskilful person would make it more dangerous to the person attempt<lb/>ing to use it; on the contrary, I think it would perhaps make it rather safer—undoubtedly it had been mixed by an unskilful person—this sulphuric acid bottle would not go inside the machine; it was never intended to go inside—the bottle should have a glass stopper, but this cork would he put in by the druggist—the cork would be destroyed in a certain length of time; it has been already partially destroyed—if this machine with the powder in it were exploded in a picture gallery it might do an immense amount of damage; if it were put against a small building it might blow it down—if it were put against a big building it might do no harm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of Explo<lb/>sives to the Government—I have heard the evidence given by Dr. Dupre, and, speaking generally, I agree with the evidence he has given—the yellow powder spoken of is an explosive of a highly dangerous character, and is highly sensitive to percussion and friction, and might be exploded by the application of sulphuric acid—I have examined the machines; either of them would contain the quantity of yellow powder found—there is more than one way in which the bomb with the powder inside it might be exploded—such an explosion would be most disastrous to human beings if a number were in the neighbourhood; as regards property, it would, as Dr. Dupre explained, have been conditional upon the character of the property and the position the bomb occupied with regard to it—the weight of the larger bomb, empty, is rather over 10 lbs.—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">polenta</hi> recipe—many infernal machines have been fitted with bullets of lead—it is within my experience that bottles of a special make are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300043"/>
               <p>sometimes placed inside these infernal machines, and such bottles are of special construction; in fact, it is almost indispensable for that mode of ignition that they should be of a special construction—it is not an authorised operation in this country—my attention has been called to a pencil sketch in the printed report on dynamite—the sketch, with the description at the side, is a very fair re<lb/>presentation of the large bomb, incomplete, but fair so far as it goes; it does not go into details—at the side of the sketch are some details of certain dimensions in English, and they correspond on the whole, as far as I can understand them, very accurately with the dimensions of the larger bomb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> So far as I know, there was no bottle suitable for placing in the bomb among the articles which have been discovered and submitted to me—I have not seen one—there is no means of producing an explosion, unless a bottle is provided.</p>

               <p>duty in Hendon Lane, Finchley, and heard a gate shut seventy of eighty yards off; shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner about half a dozen yards rom the gate running towards me—I stopped him, and said, "What's up?"—he said, "I am going for the doctor; don't stop me; let me go for the doctor"—I said, "That tale won't do for me"—he put his hand inside his coat—I seized his wrist; he struggled violently, but I got him to the station—he said, "You can only charge me on suspicion; you should have waited till I had done something"—I saw him searched; eight keys, one a skeleton, and two knives were found on him; one is a butcher's pig-killing knife—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> up his back, and this lantern and candle in his pocket, and three yards of wire, which is used to put across a lawn or a gate to throw anyone down if they are pursuing; also some silent matches, a bradawl, some gingerbread, and a fig, which are used to put on a window when the glass is broken to deaden the sound—the station sergeant had got the pointed knife, and the prisoner pointed to me and said, "He ought to have had that; I was unable to get any work; what was I to do?"—on the same morning I went to Mr. Berkeley's house, which was, as far as I can guess, where I heard the gate abut—I found the front parlour window open, and marks on the window-ledge, as if some person had been standing there, and marks at the catch where it had been forced back, and marks on the window where the jemmy had been used, and paint on the jemmy—the window had been raised seven inches—there were foot-marks on a flower bed, which I compared with the prisoner's boots by making another mark by the side, and they corresponded—there were some marks on this knife, which were very bright at the time; it had apparently been used to force the catch back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and one of the firm of Panmure Gordon and Hill, of Copthall Court, Thread-needle Street—I met the prisoner at Harrogate, and on January 4th be came to my office and asked me what I thought was going to be the future of Brighton "A"—I said I thought they were going to rise—he said "I don't think so, I bought some sometime ago and there has been a rise; will you be good enough to sell for me £5,000 Brighton 'A'"—I said, "As we don't do speculative business, are you sure you have got the stock, and does it stand in your name?"—he said, "It does"—I then called my partner, and said, "This gentleman wishes to sell some Brighton 'A' stock. He holds the stock, and tells me the certificate is in his name"—the prisoner repeated in Mr. Hill's presence that he held the stock, and that the certi<lb/>ficate was in his name—I acted on the belief that his statements were true—he gave his address in the office somewhere at Brixton—one of my partners afterwards sold for him £5,000 Brighton "A" in the market—this is the sold note of the transaction, showing that the £5,000 stock sold for £4,700 10s., brokerage at 1/4 £18 11s. 7d., and 1s. the stamp—on 12th January we sent this letter to the prisoner: "As the Settle<lb/>ment commences on Monday next we should be obliged by your sending us the certificate of the £5,000 Brighton 'A' sold on your behalf, so as to enable us to prepare the transfer. P. S.—The dividend was declared to<lb/>day, and was better than was expected, viz., nine Allsopp's Ordinary close to night 54 3/4 to 55 1/4 "—we received no answer, and telegraphed to the hotel where we knew he was staying, and heard ho was there, and then telegrams were sent—on January 15th we received thin telegram: "Detained here. Postpone delivery Brighton Deferred for a fortnight. Buy 100 Allsopps for next account. "I telegraphed to him at Manchester the same day, "Cannot buy Allsopps, unless you remit £1,000, viz., 10 per cent, margin, being usual custom for speculative accounts. Are continuing Brightons to next account"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300047"/>
               <p>we sent another telegram, "Postponement of delivery costs you about 3/8 per cent, backwardation"—after that we continued the stock in the market, and paid the difference—we sent a letter enclosing the account, and after continuing we wrote: "Dear Sir,—We duly received your telegram, asking us to postpone delivery of £5,000 Brighton 'A'; please remit balance by return. We clearly understood you this was not a specu<lb/>lative account. Please let us know the name the stock stands in in the company's books, etc. We wired you and received no reply." For the purpose of transferring stock it is necessary to know the Christian name of the person in whose name it stands, and we only knew the prisoner as J. B.—this is the note: "Bought for 17th instant, £5,000 Brighton Deferred Stock at 151 3/4 "—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) shows a balance due to us of £193 11s. 7d., being a difference of £175—in answer to, that letter I think we got a telegram, and we sent a telegram on the 16th—at the time we continued the stock we still believed the statement of his having it in his possession—we sent this telegram to the prisoner at the hotel at Manchester: "No reply from you; please tele<lb/>graph"—we received no answer to that, and telegraphed to the manager of the hotel and then to the prisoner: "We hear you are still at the hotel, but have had no reply, unless we have a satisfactory letter to-morrow morning we shall close the stock, holding you liable"—on January 17th I received this telegram: "Ill in bed. Better to-day. Hope to reach London to-morrow or next day, to arrange. Don't close"—we then sent this: "Received your telegram. You must send us cheque for difference, or give satisfactory evidence that you can deliver stock, or we shall close stock and put matters in solicitor's Hands. Please reply by wire, or at latest by letter to-morrow morning"—on the same day we wrote this letter, and paid this cheque for £170, for the amount of the difference, to P. Ricardo and Co., and then sent this tele<lb/>gram: "Not hearing from you, have closed your stock"—we also wrote this letter: "As we received no reply from you this morning, in accordance with our telegram yesterday we have bought back the £5,000 Brighton 'A' stock, sold by your order, and shall be obliged by your sending us a cheque for balance, £213 8s. 4d."—in that letter we enclosed the bought note and the statement of account, showing a balance of £213 8s. 4d.—the backwardation was £17 3s. 9d.—we afterwards received this telegram, of January 19th, from the prisoner: "I repudiate closing. I advise you to re-open to prevent yourselves losses"—we then received this, across which is written by the prisoner: "I decline to accept this contract, and maintain that my contract given you, dated 15th January, holds good till January 31st"—there was, I believe, a further charge of £2 10s. for closing the account—all those payments were made by us in the belief that his statements were true—we consulted our solicitor, and afterwards applied for a summons at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The total amount in dispute between us and the prisoner is £213, of which £18 odd is commission, which brings it something under £200—I made his acquaintance at Harrogate in September, 1893—I heard that he has been in the employ of Smith and Co. twenty years in a very responsible position—he is connected with journalism, and had been writing an article which I wished him, to get published—I said at the Police-court, "We had no conversation, about Stock Exchange</p>

               <p>matters; our conversation was about financial matters"—he had once called at my office and talked to me about financial matters—Brighton "A's" are sometimes called Berthas—that is one of the most speculative securities—he did not say that in his belief Brighton 'A's' were going to fall, but I suggested to him that they were going to rise—he did not suggest selling a less quantity—he said, ** I bought Brighton 'A' some time ago; there is a profit on it which I wish to take"—I cannot make a mistake about his saying that he had the certificate in his own name—I have the best of memories—I said at the Police-court, "I have not the best of memories"—it was put to me, "Have you a good memory in business matters?" and I said, "Not in quotations," meaning quotations out of some book, not Stock Exchange quotations—we do very little speculative business, only for certain persona, not for comparative strangers—there had been a great dearth of business for some time on the Stock Exchange—brokers were not keener than usual—the less business we do the more careful we are—£18 is always worth earning; it is 1/2 commission—we charged him a 1/4 commission on this transaction—the maximum regulation on the Stock Exchange is 1/2 per cent.—there is no rule in speculative transactions; a broker may put what commission he chooses, or he can do it for nothing—he cannot go above 1/2 per cent.—I made no arrangement with the prisoner what the commission was to be. I had nothing to do with it; it was arranged with my partner—we charge a West-end man more than a professional man; we term one on orchid, and the other a turnip—Mr. Hill was at the Police-court ready to give evidence, but I heard it said that his evidence would not be pressed for in order that the case might be sent for trial, and come on lost Session—Mr. Hill has never given evidence—I believe he swore his own information—I sent for Mr. Hill—I had no suspicion that what the prisoner said was untrue, but I used business prudence—if I had asked him for the certificate, it would have been equivalent to calling him a liar—there had been an unprecedented rise in Allsopps' stock, and on January 12th it was over par—it is true that he asked me to carry out a transaction in Allsopps after I sent him that letter—if I had entered into the transaction there would have been a large sum of money coming to him, but they were different operations—I swear that he mode those statements; we should not have done the business if he' had not—I had no conversation with him about Allsopps' stock on January 12th—I was asked at the Police-court why I put in the telegram that we wanted a margin, and I said I thought that would choke him off—I think January 17th was the date that we learnt from the Brighton Railway that there was no stock in his name, but not necessarily that we had been defrauded, it might have been in some relation's name—he had told me that it was in his name—if we had been paid the difference which we asked for we should have carried on the stock to the next account; that was not all we wanted, we wanted the stock—I did not think that by turning this into a criminal proceeding some of his friends might come forward, with the consent of the Alder<lb/>man—the man was well known on the Stock Exchange, and I did it in the interests of my brother brokers, who had been robbed—it never entered my mind that if the friends came forward the prosecution might be with-drawn—I can name thirty or forty persons who hold £5,000' Brighton'</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The fact of it being a speculative stock would be a sufficient reason for my ascertaining that he had got it before I sold it—I heard that he had been twenty years in Messrs.

I am one of the firm of Panmure Gordon, Hill and Co. on January 4th Mr. Gordon introduced the prisoner to me, and said that he wished to sell £5,000 Brighton "A"—Mr. Gordon said, "You have this stock?"—he said "Yes," and that it stood in his name, and he held the certificate—upon that I went to the Stock Exchange and sold the stock, believing he held it—I returned to the office and handed the sold note to him, showing the amount of the brokerage, and said we should charge him 1/4 per cent, on the money—in speculative business commission is charged on the stock, but this was charged on the money—he said he should like to invest the money in other securities, he did not wish very high class stock, to pay him 3 or 4 per cent.; but he liked something that fluctuated, as he had plenty of time at his disposal—I mentioned various stocks, and among others Allsopps—I believe I wrote and signed the letter of January 12th, asking him to send the certificate of the Brighton "A's," and saying, "Allsopps close to-night at 54 3/4 "—the £17 3s. 9d. backwarda<lb/>tion was paid to two firms, Laing, and Fletcher, and the difference of £175 on the stock would be paid to Messrs. Ricardo—the £2 10s. was to be paid to Early, Smith and Co.—that was a further difference in the price.</p>

The credit must be the direct and necessary consequence of the false pretences, for if it should happen that the stock was not delivered, the broker carried it over, and if it had gone down there would have been money to be handed over by the broker, who was bound by the rules of the Stock Exchange to pay the difference, and therefore the credit which arose did not necessarily and directly arise from the false pretences, and further, credit could not be obtained for anything which was in its nature unliquidated; the broker had to cover a loss, but it was not a debt, as there was no con<lb/>tract to pay a fixed sum, it was a contract to indemnify: and though the broker had suffered damage, for which he could sue the prisoner on indemnity implied by law, there was no debt due to the broker, because no credit had been obtained. The rules of the Stock Exchange, not the false pretences, compelled him to pay the money. As to the second Count, unless there was evidence of an agreed commission, the broker was only entitled to what was fair and reasonable, and until the broker's charge for commission had been ascertained, no credit for, commission had been obtained. As to the rest of the Counts</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KISCH</hi>

The rules of the Stock Exchange compelled Mr. Gordon to pay these sums, and they were therefore paid on his own account, though the prisoner, under an implied indemnity, was bound in law to indemnify the broker. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi> contended as to the second Count that the amount to be paid was actually assessed, because there was evidence that the commission stated upon the sold notes was agreed, and that there was evidence on all the Counts. It was decided in Reg. v. Peters, Crown Cases Reserved, that a man does obtain credit, even though there is no stipulation at the time of the contract that he shall have credit.</hi>

                  </hi>.1 am metropolitan stage conductor, 945—on April 30th I was the conductor of an omnibus which went from London Bridge to Cheapside—the prosecutrix got in at London Bridge; the prisoner sat on her right side, and another man on her left—one or two passengers got out, and then the prisoner went and sat between the lady and a young fellow who was pretending to be asleep, with his hands behind him—the lady sat on the near side, and the prisoner on the opposite side at first, but he afterwards crossed over—the man pretending to be asleep, put his hands behind the prisoner, who had his hands on his knees, and was leaning forward, and my suspicions were aroused—the other man got out first, and the prisoner at the same time as the lady, a few yards further on—he got out before her—I spoke to her, and pointed the prisoner out to her, and went on with my omnibus—she paid with a florin, and I gave her 1s. 11d. change—the other man paid the fare, and I gave him two tickets—later in the day Outram came to me, and I went to Black Lion Street Station and picked the prisoner out from a number of men—I am sure he is the man who was sitting opposite the lady and crossed over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a conductor five years, and have given evidence in such cases before—the omnibus was pretty full; an old lady got out, and then the prisoner crossed over and took the seat—no search was made in the omnibus—a purse might be dropped and picked up without my seeing it, but I never saw such a thing happen before—I did not lose sight of the prisoner when I spoke to the lady.</p>

I am road collector to the King's Cross and Barnsbury Omnibus Company; the prisoner has been in their employ since March 9th, 1893, and during the whole of that time his conduct has been wholly satisfactory; we never had any complaint against him—I have known persons give a half-crown for a sixpence or for a penny, and the money put in the purse, and the next passenger has discovered it—I have found also that conductors have taken a half-sovereign and had it in their possession to the end of the journey, where they turn it out in the presence, perhaps, of a constable, but if they looked at it on the journey they might over-balance and perhaps lose the lot—when the prisoner's license was given back to him, I took him back next morning on the same omnibus, which passes Police-constable Gardner sixteen times a day, if he is there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Ash and Co., artificial teeth manufac<lb/>turers, of Angler's Lane, Kentish Town—platinum is extensively used for artificial teeth, and the price of it is 39s. 10d. per oz.; it is cut into pins, varying with the thickness of the teeth through which they have to pass—great care is taken that all the sweepings and pieces of platinum which have been cut off are collected, and taken to a room, and kept there; people are employed to collect them—no one has any right to take away a small piece of it—Smith has been employed there as electrical engineer for some years—his engine was in the next room, and some portions of it ran into the room where the platinum was kept, and he had to go in to oil the engine—he and the stoker arrived at 6.30, and the workpeople at eight; the ordinary people left at six, and the others at nine—we missed platinum last year, and in January we found a deficiency of 163 oz., value about £1,500—a man naned Pruse was there as caretaker in August, 1893, and he remained till his death in March—he had no right to take any of this metal—Dickens was employed as carpenter eighteen months or two years ago, and not since—I have seen him with Smith near the premises from time to time, and I have seen Harris with Dickens—I have seen Smith and Dickens go to a public-house, from time to time, down to within a day or two of Smith's arrest in February, I think—in March this year I received a communication, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Perriman's, in Barbican, and there saw a man named Perritz, who made a statement to me, in consequence of which I went with Inspector Conquest to the prisoner Smith, and in consequence of a conversation between them Smith was arrested—I then got further information, in consequence of which the other two prisoners</p>

               <p>were arrested—Mr. Morton, of the Sheffield Smelting Company, produced to me this sample of platinum, which is Messrs. Ash's—I can only see these private marks on one pin, but I am perfectly familiar with it—there is almost half an ounce here—it has been flattened in a very bad mill or hammered, to hide its identity—Dickens helped me to put up the machine through which the platinum is sifted, and I spoke to him about the value of it repeatedly, because we had a machine to prevent any possible waste, and under my direction he made a number of experiments for the recovery of the platinum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Messrs. J. W. Robertson and Co., refiners and jewellers, 100, Aldersgate Street—I have known Harris since 1888 in the name of Henry Wyatt—he described himself to me as manager of a manufacturing firm of dentists, the French Dental Institute at South Hackney—when he first came in he brought scrap platinum, and offered it to us for sale—I believed the statement he made with regard to himself and his occupation—I wrote several letters to the address he gave, the Dental Institute, and he answered them in person, and acknowledged haying received them—he did not write—there were some transactions prior to 1893—our first transaction was at 20s. per ounce—in 1893 the transactions increased greatly both in number and value—I made no inquiry about the French Dental Institute beyond addressing letters to him there—from January, 1893, to November, 1893, he was pretty often at our place of business, something like twice a month—I keep our books in conjunction with my brother, who is here—I saw them as they were made up—we purchased from Harris on January 4th, 20 oz. 14 dwt. at 22s. an oz., £22 15s. 6d.; on January 13th, 20 1/2 oz. at 22s., £22 11s.; on January 30th, 20 oz. 3 dwt. at 26s. per oz., £26 3s. 9d., and similar purchases down to the 25th November, the aggregate being 577 1/2 oz., and the amount paid to Harris, £758 2s. 2d.—on 3rd December he came again and offered some more—I asked him to give me a more satisfactory account of how he became possessed of it, and I said he should get me a letter from the firm he represented, and he said he would do so—I never saw him after that—I next saw him in custody, when I went and identified him in Con<lb/>quest's presence—I paid him generally by these cheques, which my brother drew—some of the transactions were cash—the cheques were payable to order, and not crossed, at the prisoner's request, as he said the French Dental Institute had no banking account—we thought at the time it was rather curious, but the man seemed very satisfactory—we traced in the Post Office Directory a French Institute at South Hackney, but not a French Dental Institute; we thought it was the same place—our letters were not returned, and we presumed the prisoner must have had them—the first time we wrote to him was to prove whether there was such an address, and then we wrote to offer him a better price, as platinum, the market value of which fluctuates, had gone up—the prices paid to Harris were between 22s. per oz. at the lowest, and 30s. per oz. at the highest, but the price 398. 10d. per oz. at which platinum was quoted in 1893 was for the manufactured article, which would be higher in value than scrap platinum—the platinum offered by Harris was similar to this sample produced—it had apparently been hammered or rolled, which we thought Was done in course of manufacture; it was described as waste to us—it did not occur to me that it might have been done for the purpose of concealing its identity—we constantly buy platinum from dentist manufacturers—they use pins, but I have never seen flattened out pins like these.</p>

Perriman and Sons, and that we dealt in various articles, and did business with France, Germany, Austria, and so on—he asked me whether I could sell any platinum—I told him the article was out of our line altogether, in fact I knew nothing about it—he produced a sample, and asked me to try and sell it—he said he knew a man who now and then had a certain quantity of it to sell; at the present time there were about fifty ounces so far as he knew—he did not say definitely there would be more, but the man might have more—he said he thought the man would take 20s. per oz., or he might take less, perhaps 18s.—I told him I could not say anything, the thing not being in our line, but I would send it to Paris to some of our friends we were connected with, and ascertain whether the price was right or otherwise, and if we could sell it we should do so—on that understanding he handed me the sample—I kept it for about ten days, and made inquiries not in Paris, but in London, going to different firms who deal in platinum, and making inquiries as to the price, and so on—I left samples of it with the firms I went to; among them being Mr. Robert Wills, of Johnson, Matthey and Co., and Mr. George Darby, and Mr. Reginald Foster, of the Sheffield Smelting Co.—the sample was very similar to this produced—I got</p>

               <p>prices from some of those different people; some of them refused to quote prices—in consequence of a message which I sent him through my land<lb/>lady I got a further sample, and with that I made inquiries also—after that I saw Smith at Frederick Street, and told him that our Paris client was agreeable to take the stuff, but that the Paris firm required me to send it to Johnson, Matthey and they would pay for it, and that the man should come with or without the stuff to disclose who the firm was that was the vendor—he said he would tell his customer to come—a few days afterwards I saw him at the same place, and asked him why the man did not come with or without the stuff—he said he had not seen him; he would see him and tell him—I saw him again, and got an indefinite answer—he never brought the man—after waiting some time, seeing there was something wrong, I went and made a communication to the three firms with whom I had left samples—I last saw Smith the Sunday before he was in custody—I had no conversation with him then about platinum.</p>

I knew him as a visitor to the land<lb/>lady—I should say I have seen him twenty times since September—in our first conversation he asked me whether I could sell a couple of tricycles for him—very likely I said I could sell anything for anybody—he did not then produce a sample of platinum and say, "Can you sell this?"—he produced a sample when he first mentioned about platinum—he mentioned the name of it at first—I might have said it looked like silver—he did not say "It appears by the weight to be more like platinum"—I told this first to the Inspector who came and put questions to me—Smith told me he knew nothing about it except that a man had given it to him, and said he wanted to sell it—he did not say who the man was, and I did not ask him—I have been in London over ten years, and with my present firm over three years—I told him I had written to Paris, because he expected me to send it there—I had not written to Paris; I had good reasons not to do so—I had to find out in the mean<lb/>time what the platinum was, and where it came from—I told him I had written to Paris in order to have a longer time to find out—I may have said before the Magistrate: "I told him the lie because we should be able to charge him greater profit," but it was because I wanted longer time; it may have been for both reasons—Smith told me all along that the transaction had nothing to do with him—I remember distinctly that when I said my firm thought it was not all right, he said he was sorry he had had anything to do with it, and he was not to blame in any way—I showed the platinum to my firm next day, and they knew what was going on.</p>

Your employers have missed a very large quantity of platinum; I find you have been negotiating with Mr. Perritz, of Frederick Street, King's Cross, about the beginning of January last, and you gave him this fifty-ounce sample, and you said you should have another fifty ounces in three weeks' time"—he said, "Yes, that is so"—I said, "You will be charged with stealing it"—he said, "The whole thing is a joke; it was only done to nettle an argument"—I said, "I must write it down"—he said, "I have never seen anything like this before; it is a very serious thing for me; I have been here all these years. I got it from Mr. Prune, and he died last week; I did not know it was platinum; I was told to say there were forty or fifty ounces, or the buyer would not understand it"—on 25th April I went with Mr. Robertson to 20, Fulbrook Road, Kentish Town, and saw Harris—I had been trying to find him for some time—I said, "I am a police officer. Do you know this gentleman? This is Mr. Robertson, a refiner, of Aldersgate Street; he informs me that you, have sold him a large quantity of platinum during the last four years, as much an fifty ounces at a time; Messrs. Ash have been robbed of a large quantity, and I want to know where you got it from"—he said, "I got it from a man named Dickens, of Taylors Road"—I said, "He is a carpenter, do you know where he got it?"—he said, "No; I had a commission from Dickens of a quarter, and then a third, of what it fetched"—I took him to Kentish Town Station, and then went to 51, Leyton Road, where I saw Dickens, who knew me—I said, "Do you know me?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will be charged with stealing platinum from Messrs. Ash"—I took him to the station, confronted him with Harris, and said, "Do you know this man?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He says you paid him a commission for selling; first he had a quarter and then third"—he said, "I suppose you want to know where I got it from?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I got it from the other man"—I said, "What man?"—he said, "Smith, who is now in custody; I did not ask him where he got it; it is useless to deny that I did not know where he got it; of course I knew"—I said, "Have you got any now?"—he said, "No; what I had I threw in the tank."</p>

               <p>in that sack?"—he said, "Only some chaff, governor"—I shouted to him to stop—he said, "All right, Bill; it is all right"—I caught hold of the pony's head—he jumped out; I put my hand on the sack, and said, "This is funny chaff; it is meat"—he said, "I don't know how it came there; those two men have sold me"—Law came up some minutes after—the prisoner was taken to the station and charged—I found this chisel in the vicinity of where the hams were found, and about half a mile from where I arrested the prisoner—I have compared the chisel with marks on a case shown me, from which the hams were stolen, and the chisel corre<lb/>sponds with three of those marks.</p>

About 1.30 a.m. on 8th April, I was going home from duty—I heard a police whistle, and proceeded in the direction from whence it came—I saw Bushbridge with the prisoner, and Law with the pony and cart—Law said something to me—I went down to the bottom of Tate Road, and there saw a dock constable—I went across a field and found two sacks, each containing twelve hams; further on I found four against the dock fence, and coming back I found a sack containing seven—about 9.40 I saw the prisoner in the cart—the hams were all of the same sort, and the same as the eight other hams produced.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were letters of July 4th, 1892, and April 23rd, 1894, addressed to the prisoner's wife Selina; the latter dated from Hollo<lb/>way Prison expressed his sorrow at the way he had treated her.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Lupus Street, Pimlico, and am coroner for the south-west district of the County of London—on 10th March I opened an inquiry at the Coroner's Court, Lambeth, upon the body of Albert Augustus Robertson, aged four months and three weeks—on that day the prisoner was called as a witness, and also William Thomas Atkinson—she was sworn—I took down her evidence as she gave it in answer to questions I put to her—I produce the original depositions—she gave her name as Emily Atkinson, and she said, "I am the wife of William Atkinson, an amanuensis living at 8, Offley Road, Brixton. I and my husband placed this child with the last witness. The child was a. child of a cousin of my husband. Her name was Kate Robertson, and the father's name was John Robertson. The mother was confined in the York Road Lying-in Hospital. She had been staying previously with me. Her husband had left her five months previously to October, 1893. They had been living in Falmouth Road, Newington. The</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300081"/>
               <p>mother was too ill to take the child to the last witness. She left at the same time as, the child. She went with a friend to Clacton-on-Sea. I had a letter from her once, but I have not kept it, and do not know the address. I have heard she is dead, but I am not quite sure. She was about twenty-six years old. I do not know where she is, and I have not seen her since she left the Lying-in Hospital"—I did not believe the story, and I adjourned the inquest, and told my officer to make inquiries—on 17th March the inquest was resumed—the prisoner was not sworn again; her previous oath covered the whole inquiry—she gave evidence on that day, after Kate Robertson had given hers; she was not present when Kate Robertson gave hers—I asked the prisoner her name again, and she gave it as Emily Marian Thomas, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Atkinson—she said "I have been living with William Thomas Atkinson for the last ten years. Kate Robertson is my daughter by my late husband, William Thomas. I was present when she married at Trinity Church, Trinity Square, South-wark, on October 28th, 1883. Her husband left her two years ago. She was then living at 2, Crudeson Road, and, after her husband left her, I and Mr. Atkinson went and lived with her there, and a few months after we all moved to 8, Offley Road. She went to the Lying-in Hospital on 14th October, 1893, and the deceased child was born the same day; she left on 21st October, 1893, and I took the deceased to Mrs. Baldock, and the mother went straight to 8, Offley Road, Brixton, and has been there ever since, with the exception of stopping a day or two with friends. It is untrue that I ever thought she was dead; it is untrue that she was a cousin of Mr. Atkinson; it is untrue that I ever thought the deceased child was the child of Kate Robertson's husband. My daughter and her husband never lived in the Falmouth Road. It is untrue that she went to Clacton-on-Sea on leaving the Lying-in Hospital; it is untrue that she ever wrote to me from Clacton-on-Sea after she was confined. The children have been there since last September"—by the Registration Act of 1874, it is the duty of the coroner and the coroner's jury to inquire into all the facts necessary for the Registrar—it is not only our duty to record the death, but other facts as well—in the case of an adult we record his occupation or profession; in the case of a child of tender years we record its father's name if it is legitimate, its mother's name if it is illegitimate, with its age, sex, and the date of its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am corner for the south-west dis<lb/>trict of the County of London—on 10th March I held an inquest on the body of the child Albert Augustus Robertson—the prisoner was called and sworn as a witness—I took down this statement, as he gave it in answer to questions I put to him: "I am an amanuensis, living at 8, Offley Road, Brixton. I knew the mother and father of the deceased. The father's name was William Robertson, a mercantile clerk. He lived in Falmouth Road, Newington. It was about in the middle of the street His wife was a cousin of mine on the mother's side. They have been married eight or nine years. She was about twenty-eight years old. After her confinement she was very ill, and my wife said she would do what she could for the child, as I was in hopes of getting someone to adopt it. She left the hospital fourteen days after confine<lb/>ment, and went with a friend unknown to Clacton-on-Sea"—there was an adjournment to 17th March, and in the interval inquiries were made—on the 17th prisoner was recalled, and said, "The witness who called her<lb/>self Emily Atkinson on the first holding of this inquest is not my legal wife. I have a wife and one child now alive. I have been separated from my wife eleven years, I have since been living with the person called Emily Atkinson, whose right name is Emily Marion Thomas, she was then the widow of William Thomas, and had one daughter, who is the last witness, Kate Robertson. I knew her husband, William Robertson,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300083"/>
               <p>well. It was two years next July when he went away. It was untrue when I said on the previous occasion that he had left five mouths before October, 1893; it was untrue when I said that his wife was a cousin on my mother's side; it was untrue when I said that after leaving the Lying-in Hospital she went to Clacton-on-Sea. It is a fact that she went home straight to 8, Offley Road, Brixton, where I live. I have known where she has been ever since, and I had never any reason to suppose her dead. I am the father of the deceased child"—I went through each statement, and said, "Are they true?"and he said, "No, they are untrue."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You asked me if you were bound to answer the ques<lb/>tion, who was the father of the child?—I had no animus against you, I never saw you before—I was not embittered against you; I said I was exceedingly annoyed with you for giving me all the trouble you had—the jury made a representation that I should lay the facts before the Public Prosecutor, in order that there might be a prosecution for perjury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a platelayer by occupation—I am now an in<lb/>mate of the Richmond Union Workhouse—the prisoner is my sister-in-law—last September I went to her house to have a shelter—I left there to go into Richmond Union Infirmary, as I was ill—I left at Her house my box, containing a suit of clothes, two shirts, a silk handkerchief, two pairs of socks—there were other things left out of the box, and I gave her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404300084"/>
               <p>the key to pack up the things in it for me, as I was too ill to do it—at the end of January I came out of the infirmary; I asked the prisoner for the key; she gave it to me—I looked in the box, and asked her where my clothes and money were gone to—the money was a postal order sent me from South Africa, that I had left in the box—she made no answer about the clothes, but she said, as to the money, that she went to the General Post Office and drew the postal order, and put the money in the box, and that she got drunk at Christmas, and lost the money—these three cotton and two silk handkerchiefs I left in the box—there was only an overcoat left in the box; all the other things were gone—she made no reply as to the clothes—I told her when I was leaving that I should take proceedings against her if she did not get the things back by such a time—I have got the suit of clothes which the policeman found at the pawn<lb/>shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never asked her to marry me—I did not shoot at her with a pistol—I went to South Africa in 1875, and came back in 1893—I then went to live with my brother-in-law, Oliver; I paid them—after they had sucked out of me everything they could they kicked me out of doors—I had been working on the Natal Government Railway, and brought back over £100 with me—I stayed with the prisoner from Sep<lb/>tember till 8th October, and I was with her part of three weeks after 31st January—I paid her no rent, but I gave her one shilling or two shillings now and then as I had it—for the last five or six years, since my brother died, I sent her £2 a month from Natal, out of charity—after my £100 was gone I raised money to meet my daily expenses, by sending things to the pawn-shop from time to time—I sometimes sent a boy with them—I never sent the prisoner—there was no arrangement as to any rent or board—I never told her she might pawn some of my things to raise money, and pay herself for my board and lodging—I only gave her the key of my box to put away my-things that were lying about—I missed the things on 30th or 31st January—the prisoners charged with stealing them on 9th February—no proceedings were taken against her till 28th March; I threatened her with proceedings if she did not get them out; if I had got them I should not have prosecuted her—I reckon I did pay her from time to time; she had a part of what I got; if I had one shilling or two shillings, and she wanted it, she had only to ask for it—when I pawned things, if she wanted anything for household expenses, I used to give her cine shilling out of the proceeds—I never told her she might pawn these things, and take some of the money for her ordinary expenses—I told her to take a week's rent (4s. 6d.) out of the postal order—she asked me to give her money for the rent, and I had this postal order for £4 in Nov<lb/>ember or December—it came when I was in the infirmary—the prisoner brought me the letter, which came from Pietermaritzburg, opened—I sent the postal order, and told her to change it—she asked me to give her enough to pay her rent, or her week's rent, I won't be certain which—she pays 4s. 6d. a week—I took it she wanted me to let her have 4s. 6d.—I told her she might take it, and put the remainder in my box, because I should want it when I came out—when I came out she said she had got drunk and spent the money—I charged her with failing to account for £3 10s., because I thought at the time I would give her the 10s.—I did not tell her to take what she wanted from it.</p>
