                  </hi>. I live at 6, East-street, Chelsea, and am a mason's labourer—on Saturday, 28th December, about 3 o'clock, I was in Mr. Crowther's kitchen—the prisoner was there, and my brother-in-law, Pratt, and Mr. Francis—my brother-in-law was going to strike the prisoner—Gibbs said, "He has insulted me before," and made a hit at him—they then went into the yard, and Mr. Crowther came in and told the prisoner to put the horse in the cart—we stood at the gate, and Mr. Crowther asked me if I would have something to drink—we went to a public-house; he stood a quartern of rum—I said in the public-house, "I will go and take my brother-in-law away; I did so—I got him out, and we went into Bond-street, and met the prisoner and Francis—Pratt said, "That is the man that insulted me;" that was Gibbs—Gibbs took him by the shoulders, and began shaking him—I got up to them, and Gibbs let go—I passed between them, and Gibbs came before me and hit my brother-in-law on the mouth, and knocked him down—I did not see him struck, but I heard the blow, and looked round and saw my brother-in-law lying down in the road—a man helped me to pick him up and set him on the kerb—his head dropped down, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth—the prisoner and Francis walked away—I took the deoeased home to my place, which was about half a dozen yards off, and sent for Mr. Daniels, the doctor, who came in about three-quarters of an hour—the deceased lay on the sofa in my back parlour—he never spoke afterwards—he died on the following Sunday afternoon, between 3 and 4.</p>

               <p>you were in before you went to the Blenheim? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was my employer before Christmas, and was the prisoner's employer—I was in the kitchen, because Mrs. Crowther asked me to go in—I cannot tell you how the deceased came there—I did not hear Gibbs say that Mr. Crowther had desired him to leave—no such words were spoken while I was there—I was examined before the Coroner—I did not hear the prisoner say in the kitchen that Mr. Crowther had desired him to leave—he has said so since—I did not see any drink in the kitchen—my brother-in-law was not drunk—he talked to me quietly enough—he had been drinking—the prisoner left to put a pony in the cart; that was after they had quarrelled in the kitchen—his mistress did not tell him in my hearing to get the deceased out of the kitchen—I did not say so before the Coroner—I first saw the deceased in the kitchen about 12 o'clock—I had nothing to drink there—I went away between 12 and 1, and returned about 3—my brother-in-law was still there, and the prisoner—they were in the yard, and as I went through they followed me into the kitchen; my brother-in-law was not then drunk; he had been drinking—I think the prisoner said the deceased had insulted him, or else insulted one of the others who had been there—Mr. Crowther said to his wife that he was very much surprised at her having a parcel of men in the house when we were going to a funeral—I did not hear it stated that Mr. and Mrs. Crowther had requested Gibbs desire the deceased to leave—we did not adjourn to the Blenheim—we were going towards it when we met Gibbs and Francis—I had been there with Mr. Crowther, but not with my brother-in-law—Gibbs and the deceased were passing one another when the deceased first addressed Gibbs—they would have passed, as far as I could judge, if the deceased had not said, "That is the man that insulted me"—Gibbs took the deceased by the shoulders; the deceased had a pipe in his mouth, and Gibbs said, "That pipe does not belong to you"—the other one said, "I know that, and it does not belong to you; if there is anything amiss I will rectify that with Mr. Crowther"—I believe the pipe belonged to Mr. Crowther's nephew—there was not the least scuffle between them, only Gibbs had him by the shoulders—some men laid hold of one of the deceased's arms, and I had the other, and we dragged him home.</p>

                  </hi>. I have retired from business, and live at 70, King's-road, Chelsea—on this day I was coming along Bond-street, with my wife, about 4 o'clock, and heard a little bit of a wrangling; very little—I saw the prisoner knock the deceased down with his fist into the road—he fell back<lb/>wards, and his head sounded as if his skull was smashed—it was like the smashing of a large flower-pot—two men picked him up; he was bleeding at the mouth and side of the head—he was senseless—I followed the prisoner to see if I could see a policeman to give him in charge, but could not find one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner and the deceased scuffling together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw the prisoner and the man who was with him scuffling—his name is Francis—the deceased was standing as upright as I am now—there were four altogether, with the brother-in-law of the deceased, but he was standing iu the road at a little distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whom did you see Francis scuffling with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With the prisoner—they seemed to be mauling one another about—the deceased could stand and walk well—he was standing up smoking his pipe.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270005"/>
               <p>together—the quarrel was about a pipe—the prisoner said to the deceased, "That pipe don't belong to you"—he said, "No, nor to you; when they want it let them fetch it"—they had a few words, and the prisoner caught hold of the deceased—he said, "Don't handle me, and I will let go"—I was talking to the deceased's brother-in-law when the prisoner struck him—I helped to pick him up—the deceased was intoxicated; it was as much as he could do to walk before he was struck—the pavement was not slippery from frost—I saw the blow; it was on the mouth—it was not particularly heavy—I did not stop to see whether it was bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in Mr. Crowther's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not hear Mr. Crowther desire Gibbs to request the deceased to leave the kitchen; but the prisoner told me so just before the blow was struck—there was a quarrel between the prisoner and the deceased in the kitchen—I did not hear the words, but I saw them motioning—the deceased was drunk at that time, and the prisoner had been drinking—Mrs. Crowther was not there at that time—I heard the prisoner say that he had taken a pipe out of the kitchen belonging to Mr. Crowther—he had it in his hand—I heard the deceased say, "That is the man that insulted me," as they were passing, and the prisoner turned back and went up to the deceased, but merely caught hold of him—the deceased said, "Don't handle me"—I saw the blow struck—the deceased said something—they were quarrelling, but I could not hear the words—it was not a very heavy blow—if the man had been sober I do not think he would have fallen—he was standing about half way on the pavement—it is not a narrow pavement—his shoulder came on the kerbstone, and his head in the road—the kerb is six or seven inches high from the road—if he had fallen in the road altogether the blow would not have been nearly so great—I have known the prisoner about six months—he is in Mr. Crowther's employment—he is a quiet, inoffensive man—I never saw him the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 222, King's-road, Chelsea—on Saturday, 28th December, I saw the deceased—he was then insensible from concussion of the brain—he died on the Sunday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the following Tuesday—I heard that he had been knocked down—I saw that he had a contused wound on the side of the head—on opening the skull I found that he had received a fracture of the skull on the right side, nine or ten inches long—the cause of death was a large clot of blood which accumulated under the fracture; three or four ounces, making a heavy pressure on the brain—falling on the hard pavement would be likely to cause such an injury—he must have fallen with very great violence.</p>

Allan and Badger's—I showed them to the prisoner, told him where I had found them, and asked how he accounted for the possession of them—he said they were Messrs.

I knew I could get a reduction on the price, and so earn an honest shilling or two for my trouble, and return them into stock again on Monday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James Hunton, the pro<lb/>prietor of Bull's library, in Holles-street, Cavendish-square—on 17th Decem<lb/>ber the prisoner came to our shop and paid a quarter's subscription for old books—for that subscription he would be allowed six volumes of old books—I gave him six at that time—on 23rd December he changed some of them—on 8th January I had some business with Mr. Kimpton, a bookseller of Great Turnstile, Holborn—I recognised three books of ours on Mr. Kimpton's table—in consequence of that we communicated with Ser<lb/>geant White—these are the three books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are the "Seven Lamps of Architecture," and the fourth and fifth volumes of "Ruskin's Modern Painters"—they belong to Mr. Hunton—we should value them at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the "Modern Painters" is a very expensive work.</p>

               <p>and we have only one other copy of "The Seven Lamps of Architecture," and one other copy of volume five of the "Modern Painters"—I am quite satisfied we have no surplus copy of volume four—I am certain that no other copy has been sold—I have the management of the sale department—I have been with Mr. Hunton eight years in London, and four in the country—the date of the work is 1856, but volume five was published after that—here are three volumes that do not belong to us—it was on 17th December, 1861, that the prisoner first became a subscriber—he subscribed for six old volumes—we call them old volumes if they have been published six or eight months—the subscription would expire on 17th March, 1862—I served him on the first occasion, and saw him served on the second and third—I did not on the fourth—I saw him served with these books—I recognise them—we bind them in a particular way, different from other libraries—I swear this is our binding—we are bookbinders as well as booksellers—we bind for other people, but not like this—we should not refuse to bind in this manner for other persons if it was desired, but it has never been asked for—I do not say that we have never bound another book like this, but not of this work, certainly—we sometimes make inquiries of persons who apply to become subscribers, not always—it is generally sufficient to give the name and address, and then books are supplied in the regular manner—we keep entries of the books that are sent out—I have a record here of the books which the prisoner had, copied from the ledger—we also enter the books that are returned, at the time they are returned—if a subscriber wished to exchange a book for a more valuable one in the possession of another subscriber, he would have to ask our consent before it could be exchanged—Mr. Hunton would be the person to refer to—he is not here—any person who presents a book to have changed for a subscriber, we should exchange it—the books that were given out to the prisoner were, the fourth and fifth volumes of "Modern Painters," "The Seven Lamps of Architecture," "Du Chaillu's Explorations in Africa," "The Ingoldsby Legends," first series, and the first volume of "North and South"—if a book warn damaged it would be bound again if it was of any value; it would depend on circumstances—these books were not for sale at Mr. Kimpton's—they were lying on the table.</p>

Hickson &amp; Sons, boot and shoe manufacturers, in Hosier-lane—I saw the prisoner leave those premises about 7 o'clock that evening—I followed him through some courts into Cow-cross—I noticed something bulky under his coat—I went up to him and said, "What have you here? I am an officer"—he said, "Nothing, all right, master"—I said, "What have you under your coat?"—he said, "Nothing"—his left hand was then placed down, and supporting this lead—I took it from under his coat, and said, "You have brought this from your employers"—he said, "Who says so? I have not"—I said, "I have watched you from your employers, Messrs. Hickson's"—he said, "I have only borrowed it, I was going to take it back again; let me see Mr. Hickson"—I took him to the station and charged him—I knew his address previously—I went in company with two of the firm to 51, Gray's-inn-lane, where the prisoner resided—I searched the premises, and found eighteen lasts, partly wood and partly iron, and eighteen pieces of cutting toe-pieces and heel-pieces—next morning I went to the prisoner's cell, pre<lb/>viously</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of the Metropolitan police, and am now employed under the Mint authorities—on Wednesday afternoon, 15th January, I went to No. 5, Wilson's-place, Flower-and-Dean-street, Spital-fields, accompanied by Inspector Fife and other officers, seven in number—as me went there, I noticed a blind on the second floor drawn aside, and a face there, which I believed to be a female's—the house consists of three floors, one room on each floor—we went round to the back door, and pro<lb/>ceeded up stairs to the second floor, forced the door open, and saw the prisoners sitting in their shirt sleeves by a clear bright fire—I heard some<lb/>thing drop, as if thrown down with some force, and saw Barratt stamping on what turned out to be the fragments of a plaster of Paris mould for making half-crowns—I produce the pieces—I pushed him back, and he fell partly into a chair, but clung to the fireplace, and kicked me with both feet—he was seized by Inspector Broad, and a desperate scuffle ensued while they were on the ground—Gouldbourne was sitting at the table; he seized and upset a jar which contained solution and ten counterfeit half-crowns, and in the jar I found another half-crown—they were undergoing the process of electro-plating—Gouldbourne tried to push the table between me and Bow-man to prevent my getting to him—the jar fell on the ground, but did not break—there was a little acid left in it, which I produce—he was secured after using every possible means to prevent my getting at Barratt—on the table I found a file, with white metal in its teeth, as if recently used, and by the fireplace I found a ladle with white metal in it warm, almost hot—I found on the shelf another jar containing acid, some plaster of Paris in the powder, another file, and all the necessary implements for making and colouring counterfeit coin—I said to Barratt that I received instructions from authorities to look after him for coining—he said, "You have got all there is; if you search till this time to-morrow, you will find no more; it is a b——shame to take the old woman, she is innocent"—that was the woman who was sitting at the window—she was charged, remanded, and discharged—I believe the prosecution was withdrawn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Albion Stores, High-street, Shadwell, and was so in August last—the prisoner came in there about 10 or 11 o'clock one morning in August—he asked for half-a-pint of beer, which came to one penny—I served him, and he offered me a shilling—I found it was bad, and knowing him previously I did not take it off the counter—I told him that I knew very well what he was, and that I knew him before; that it was a bad one, and it was no use his trying his games on me there—I had seen him before—I said if he did not leave the house I would lock him up—he offered to pay me with a penny, which he handed me—I refused to take it—I took the beer away, and he left the house—before he left I broke the shilling in two, gave him one part and kept the date part, which I afterwards gave to the constable—that was the first time I saw the prisoner in that house, but I have seen him previously at another house where I was in service—that was in Whitecross-street, St. Luke's, about eighteen months ago—I served him with some beer—I do not know whether it was a pint or half-a-pint—he tendered me a bad shilling—I do not know what I did with it afterwards; it was lost—I told him at the time that it was bad, and he left the house as quickly as possible, and did not drink the beer—I also saw him on the Thursday or Friday before Christmas, about 19th or 20th December—he asked for a pint of beer—I served him—I recognised him when he came: in—I called the attention of the master and mistress, and of the other barman, to him—the beer came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a bad shilling—I told him it was bad, and broke it in two—I told him I should lock him up if he did not leave the house quickly—he then left—I was going to give him half of the shilling, but did not—I kept the two pieces—I afterwards gave them to the constable, K 149—there is an under-barman in our house, named Wasp—he never serves any one in the morning—on 1st January, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I was behind the bar, down on my knees, doing some cleaning, and my hands were dirty; the prisoner came and called for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—I said to the under-barman, "Just serve that gentleman"—I said, "What did that man give you?"—he said, "A shilling"—I did not see him come in, but I saw him go out—he could not have seen me—I recognised him as being the party that was in before—from something Wasp said I looked in the till—there was only one shilling in it, and it was a bad one—Wasp ran out after the prisoner, and brought him and a constable back—I gave that shilling also to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 4, Wood-street, Westminster—prior to last Christmas I had the repair of the house 10, Portland-place, near the Regent's-park—Beckett, the deceased, at that time was taken into my employ as overlooker—I believe he had been a constable—I engaged a woman of the name of Flynn to take care of the house—the repairs went on—it was her duty to take care of the house at night, principally, as the foreman of the works was in charge in the day time—I cannot say whether the prisoner lived with that woman in that house—I have reason to believe he did, but I myself do not know—I told Beckett that he was to give her a week's notice for her to leave on the Saturday after Christmas—she occupied the butler's pantry, in the basement—that consisted of one room, which opened into the basement passage—there was a window in the room looking into the front area—Beckett had a perfect right to go in and out of the house, by my authority, at all reasonable hours.</p>

               <p>fact that he was sleeping there until his misbehaviour—the woman had to take charge of the whole of the house at night—there were repairs going on daily—the whole house was under repair; every apartment—they slept in the butler's pantry; she slept and lived there—I don't know anything about him—that was the only room that the woman occupied—there was another room occupied by my foreman—that was the only room occupied by the woman; I am positive of that—if she was in any other room it was against my order, or against my knowledge—she had a right to pass through every other room in the house to see that fires were alight in the day time—she had no right to have her meals in any other room—I desired her not—I said, "That is your room; you will live there until I wish you to re<lb/>move into another room"—I did not positively desire her not to go into any other room—it was the butler's pantry that was broken open by the deceased, I have been informed; the very room that she was occupying—there was a verbal notice to be given to her—I also told Beckett in the week of Christmas, which was the week of her notice, that he was to enter the house daily, while some of the workmen were absent, to see that it was safe from fire and thieves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter of 20, Cowley-street, West<lb/>minster—I am foreman to Mr. Tyler—I had been employed in this house, 10, Portland-place—on 27th December I accompanied Beckett there about 9 o'clock—a labourer, named Gregory, was with me, my brother, a carpenter, and a man of the name of Boyce, a carpenter—when we got to the house I rang the area bell—Mrs. Flynn answered it—we were let in some few minutes afterwards—I did not see the prisoner previous to going to the house—on entering the house we went down the stairs to the basement, and went to the pantry door—I tried the door and found that the prisoner had fastened himself in—I called out to him to come out—I said, "Now Flynn, come out quietly, will you?"—he answered, "I won't come out, for that police<lb/>man is there," meaning Beckett—Beckett said he would get in by some means, and he went to fetch a constable—I can't call to my recollection any particular words the prisoner made use of, though, he was speaking a great deal in</p>

               <p>there—Beckett then left—whilst he was gone the prisoner stated in reply to other parties as well as myself requesting him to come out, that he would not come out, and the first man that entered he would run him through—Beckett returned in about half-an-hour, as far as I could judge, with police-constable <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 129 (Woollard)—Beckett first of all tried to force the door with his shoulder, but could not—he then requested Gregory to break it open—before that he called out to the prisoner to open the door, but he could not get it open—I cannot call to my recollection any particular remark he made, no further than calling on him to open the door—I don't think he said anything about what he would do if he did not—I could not hear the prisoner answer Beckett's request—the door was then broken open by Gregory with a crow-bar—Beckett placed himself before Gregory, and was the first man that entered—I saw the prisoner make a thrust with his right hand, and Beckett said, "He has stabbed me"—I gave the prisoner in charge, and requested my brother to take Beckett to a doctor—I did not examine Beckett at all—when he said he was stabbed he put his hand to his side, just by the side of the naval on the left side—I saw no more of him—I afterwards saw a knife given by Mrs. Flynn to the police-constable—that was after the constable had taken the prisoner up into the hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After the door was open did you go down stairs im<lb/>mediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think half a minute elapsed—the woman did not open the door for me—she was out in the area—she was not up at the front door at all—I don't know who opened the front door—it was open some minutes before I saw it—I rang the bell, Mrs. Flynn answered it, and came up to the gate to speak to me she was speaking to me when the front door was opened—it was not opened in answer to the bell—I believe it was opened by one of my party who got in at the back window—Beckett and Gregory were the two men that got in at the back window—on their opening the door for me I walked straight down stairs—we had not been able to get in to work that day—that was what we wanted to do; we were going there to work that day—we were not in the habit of breaking in at the back of the house to go to work—we had always had the house opened to us previously—we had not been at work on the 26th; we could not get admission then—it was the door of the butler's pantry that was broken open—the woman was out in the area until after the prisoner was taken in charge—I did not shut her out—she was shut out—the door was closed on her, end she was shut out in the area—it certainly required violence to break the door open—it is a large house, consisting of upwards twenty roome—it is a generally strongly built house—the door of the butler's pantry was not a very strong deer; it was an inch and a half-deal door—I should say I was not half a minute in breaking open the door—it was a heavy crow-bar; Gregory was wielding it—he struck it with the end, butted it against the door, like a battering-ram—the door went open with a sudden force—it did not go exactly wide open, it flew open as far as it did go; flew open suddenly—I was not standing close to the door at the time—I was, I suppose, three or four yards away—Gregory and Beckett were standing close to it—the policeman was not far be<lb/>hind them; he was very close to them—Beckett went in the moment the door was open—it was done in an instant—the moment the door went open in went Beckett—he went in before Gregory; the moment the door was opened—when the crow-bar was applied Beckett went in first, and imme<lb/>diately he went in this took place—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand before the blow—he was holding it like that (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>) with his thumb a little forward—that would be the position of his hand, I think, as near as I</p>

               <p>could tell, but in the state of confusion I cannot speak to an inch—in a case like that of course there was confusion, which prevents my speaking with accuracy about it—the prisoner was close behind the door when I saw him first—when I say close, I mean within two feet—Beckett entering as he did would not come into close contact with the prisoner exactly at once, because the prisoner, as near as I can judge was about two feet from the door; he certainly would almost immediately, because the whole transaction did not take more than three or four minutes—I believe Gregory was next to Beckett—I was some distance behind at the time the blow was struck; about three yards, as near as I can judge—I did not see Beckett seize hold of the prisoner—I saw Beckett hold up a stick, a common walking-stick—I cannot say whether it was a heavy one—I never had it in my hand to judge—he had it in his right hand and placed it against the prisoner's left shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the first thing he said, or did he say anything before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear him say anything more—he requested me to break the door open, and I got the crow-bar and broke it open—I should say I was about two minutes breaking it open—as soon as that was done I cautioned the deceased that the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I said, "Be careful; he has a knife in his hand"—I spoke that loud; anyone inside could hear—the door was open at that time—the deceased stepped forward with the stick in his hand, held his hand up in this direction, and said, "If you use that knife, I will drop this stick on your head," no sooner did he say so than the prisoner made a plunge with the knife, and Beckett said, "I am stabbed, he has stabbed me"—the constable then stepped forward and told him to shut the knife up—the prisoner shut the knife up, and gave it to the woman in the area; dropped it in the area—I did not see it afterwards—the woman was in the area at that time—the policeman took the prisoner away—I did not examine the deceased at all; they took him away—I assisted the constable with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you one of those that shut the woman out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deceased shut her out—I entered the house with him—she was not calling out to us to let her in—the room the prisoner was in was a small butler's pantry—I cannot mention the size—it was about as wide as the the dock, I dare say—it was much longer but narrow—I was next to Beckett—the stick did not touch the prisoner at any time—I am sure of that—I could see quite plain—Weston was standing at the back of me on the right hand side, when these words were used by the deceased—he might be near enough to hear them, I dare say; I cannot say—they were not said in an angry excited tone on the deceased's side—what he said was, "As soon as you use that I will drop this stick on to your head"—he did not say that in a tone of voice in any way put out—he said it in a loud tone,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270030"/>
               <p>in a determined voice; of course he was determined—Weston might easily have heard it—I do not know whether he did or not—I saw the knife before these words were used, through the glass—I saw it in his hand after the door was broken open, and before the words were used—he had it in his right hand when the words were used by him—there was no movement of the stick accompanying them—the stick was up; he had it up in this direc<lb/>tion (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—the movement of the stick at the time corresponded with the words, so as to intimate to the prisoner that he really meant what he said—he had the stick in that direction (<hi rend="italic">in the middle</hi>)—he had full opportunity to have given him a very severe blow if he thought proper—the next instant he could have given him a very severe blow on the head if he thought proper—not a blow that would have killed him, with that stick I should think—it was an ordinary walking stick—Beckett appeared to be a strong man—it was immediately after the words were used that the blow was struck—Beckett had not advanced at all before the blow was struck—I had the crow-bar in my hand—I was close behind Beckett—I was holding it in both hands—I broke the door open with the ends—after I broke the door open I set the crow-bar down—I did not have it in my hand when I was following Beckett—I had not got it in my hand at the time Beckett used those words—I set it down by the door outside—I had it in my hand till I broke the door open, not after; the moment the door was broken open Beckett went in, the very instant—I mean to say that at the time Beckett said those words, I had not the crow-bar in my hand; it was set down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you got in at the back window with Beckett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had not the crow-bar with me then, it was in the house—I first took possession of it when Beckett came back with the policeman, when he ordered me to break open the door—I found it in a little room which had been a wine-cellar—I got it for the purpose—there was a window which enabled me to look into the room and see the prisoner walking backwards and forwards—I was observing him through that window at different times during the half-hour, every now and then—the door was shut at that time—I went to the window from time to time and looked in—I was not always at the window—there was another man there, and when he had had a look I went and had a look—I should say I noticed him two or three times walking about with the knife in his hand during the half-hour, while Beckett was gone for the policeman.</p>

On 27th December, I accom<lb/>panied Beckett to 10, Portland-place—when we got to the house, Beckett said, "Come into the house"—I went down stairs with him—I heard Beckett ask the prisoner to come out of the room—he said, "You had better come out quietly, and go away quietly"—I could not hear any answer from the prisoner, but a minute or two afterwards they broke open the door—Beckett was one and Gregory the other that did it—as soon as the door was opened Beckett was the first one that entered the room—he came back again, and said, "I am stabbed"—Mr. Weston said, "I will give the prisoner in charge"—I went into the room and saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing in the middle of the room with a knife in his hand—I have produced the knife to-day—I told him to lay the knife down; that he must go with me to the police-station—he closed the knife and dropped it out of the win<lb/>dow into the area—I took him into custody, asking Gregory and Mr. Weston to hold him a minute while I went into the area and got the knife—I went into the area but could not find the knife anywhere—I afterwards got it from the female—she gave it to me—I then returned to the prisoner</p>

               <p>and conveyed him to the station—on the way he said something to me—before he said so I had said nothing to him—I held out no promise or inducement whatever—it was in Oxford-street that he said it—he said he had been living with this woman and had told her she would be the cause of his doing something wrong, as she would not get up to get his breakfast ready that morning for him to go to work—that was all he said—when the door was broken open I was standing about two or three yards back, in the passage, just at the bottom of the steps—I was about two or three yards from Gregory, as near as I can tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital—on 27th December, Beckett was brought there—I took him in about 11 o'clock in the forenoon—I examined him in the out-patients room—his clothes were removed before I saw him—there was a punctured wound in the abdomen, about half an inch in width—it was such a wound as a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would make—he was then taken to the ward and placed in bed—I examined the wound many times afterwards, but did not probe it during his lifetime—he died, on the 8th January—I made a post mortem examination—I found that the whole lining membrane of the abdomen and the lining membrane covering the intestines was in a state of inflamma<lb/>tion, or had been—that was the cause of his death—I traced the wound—the depth of it was about two inches—it had penetrated to the lining membrane of the abdomen, the lining, of the wall of the abdomen—I should say the inflammation arose from the wound, and the inflammation was the cause of the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The wound had only penetrated as far as the lining of the abdomen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is continues with the wall of the abdomen—the inflammation was over the whole of the intestines—I have no doubt that the inflammation was the cause of death, and that was caused by the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you attend him from the time you saw him first until his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I thought it a slight wound at first—there were two surgeons attending him; myself and Mr. Shaw—I saw him every day, and I think Mr. Shaw did—he prescribed for him, and I saw his direc<lb/>tions carried out—Mr. Shaw is not here—the wound was on the left side of the abdomen—I did not know the deceased before—I examined the whole of his body, and the head—it was quite healthy—there was some abnormal appearance on the brain; that appeared to be of long standing—I think he gave his age as 35—the inflammation was all over the intestines—I can undertake to say that the inflammation was owing to no other cause, besides the wound—there was nothing else to accouut for it—inflammation is generally set up from a wound within twenty-four hours—you cannot very well ascer<lb/>tain it except by the pain it gives rise to—it is ascertained more from the pain which the patient experiences on pressure—I did not really suppose him in danger until about four days before his death—the inflammation was then first well marked—he was confined to his bed in the hospital—I can under<lb/>take to say positively that the inflammation could not have been produced by other causes than the wound—I thought it a slight wound at first—it is against the rules of surgery to probe a wound in the abdomen—if I had probed it I could not have thought it a slight one; but from the external appearances it only seemed to be through the outer wall—it is not usual to probe, because that operation might give rise to the penetration of the peritoneum, the very mischief you are anxious to avert—I say that I know of no other cause to have produced it.</p>

               <p>by 8 o'clock, an there was not time, that was the nearest way, or words to that effect—we then went that way—we went up the road by the side of the canal, or rather a pathway by the side of the river—not the tide that' is usually frequented by foot passengers; but the side where there had been a quantity of bricks standing for some time—I said to him then, "Why don't you cross over the bridge and walk on the other side, it is so very muddy on this side?"—he said. "Oh, never mind that, you can easily wash a little mud off your boots"—he asked me to walk by myself, as he was well known about that quarter—I said it made no difference to me—he walked on first, and left me—it was close by Paul's-terrace that he made that remark; but I cannot say exactly at what spot—we then proceeded a little farther, and he said, "Is that a man and a woman standing there"—I said, "No; it is only your fancy"—we walked about three parts of the way up the path, and he said, "Walk a little further in that direction"—that was pointing from the river I walked back a few steps, and he struck me a violent blow on the head—I turned half round—he repeated the blows several times, and I fell down—he then caught hold of my coat and waistcoat, and endeavoured to drag me towards the water—with a violent straggle I managed to get away from him, or he must have got me in—I saw afterwards that I had lost part of my waistcoat—it was in his hand—he then commernced striking me over the heads second time—he had a life-preserver in his hand the first time—it was after the second number of blows that he put the life-preserver on the ground—I dis<lb/>tinctly saw him lay it down, after palling me towards the water the first time—the second time he attacked me with the life-preserver he laid it down on the ground—the first blow on the bead was with a life-preserver—he tried to drag me to the river the first time with it in his hand—it was after that he laid it down—I distinctly saw him take it up again, and he repeated the blows over my head again the second time—he then caught hold of me by my scarf, and endeavoured again to drag me towards the water—it was a scarf that I wear with my collar—I resisted as well as I could, and the scarf broke away from my neck—he then looked about for the life-preserver, picked the up, and began striking me over the head the third time—I then pulled the life-preserver out of his hand, and threw it from me—he did not take it up again—that was the last time he struck me—he then caught hold of me by the collar of my coat, and endeavoured to drag me into the river the third time, and I then slid down the embankment, and ran and walked away as well as I could—he ran past me towards a pile of bricks, and I fell into a pit—he came to the edge of the pit, and said, "Come out of there, what do you want down there in the pit?"—I said, "You wicked villain, to get away from you; I know you wish to murder me"—he made no further reply—I then got out of the pit, and ran towards a brick wall—I came to the brick wall, and tried to get over it—I clambered over it, and fell on the other side—while I was doing so the prisoner caught hold of me by the tails of my coat to endeavour to pull me back—he did not do so; I fell over—over the next wall I saw a light—I had two walls to get over—I got over the second wall—the light was in the kitchen of a house—I went into the area, knocked violently at the window, and called out "Murder!"—a man came out and assisted me—I went with him to a surgeon's, and afterwards to St. Bartho<lb/>lomew's hospital—I have been suffering ever since from the effects.</p>

I enabled him to the best of my ability to go abroad; he said he would repay me if he could do so. He went to New Zealand, and returned, not having accumulated any cash. He went again, and returned, and started in business; he had previously started in business, but failed. When he returned he said to my friends he did not mean to do anything for me; he ridiculed what I had done for him, and said it was only to answer my own purpose and for my own ends. I lent him to the amount of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have known the time when he has refused me bread. He provoked and aggravated me so that I did what I never thought of doing. He has taken things from me and from my sister, and sold them through his wife, and he has told my friends that I merely assisted him to gain my own ends. I hope you will take the matter into consideration before you pass sentence on me. I had no intention at the time to murder; I was so excited that I scarcely knew what I was about.</p>

On Wednesday, 8th January, I was with Betts in Queen-street, near the prosecutor's warehouse, and saw Wilkinson two or three yards from their door, and Johnson at the corner of Cloak-lane, about ten yards from the door—I had previously seen them walking together—I passed them and walked on—they were looking about them in every direction—we passed down about thirty yards—we were in plain clothes, and we then turned round and saw that Johnson had disappeared—we crossed to the west side of Queen-street, and saw Wilkinson standing outside the warehouse door, and immediately afterwards Johnson came out of the warehouse with a case in his arms, which appeared heavy—Wilkinson turned his back—Johnson put the case on Wilkinson's back—we then crossed over Queen-street—Johnson turned his head and saw us, and took it off Wilkinson's shoulder, put it on the pavement, walked two or three yards, and then they ran off as fast as they could—I pursued them, and took Wilkinson—I told him I took him for stealing a case of goods out of a warehouse in Cloak-lane—he said, "It was not I who stole it; it was the other man; he asked me to carry it for him"—this is the case, and this is a portion of the starch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was filled with these packages.</p>

I am a porter in the service of last witness—in con<lb/>sequence of a ring at the warehouse door I came from the cellar, and found the prisoner in the warehouse—that ring indicated that somebody had come in—when you open the door it rings a bell—I asked the prisoner what he wanted—he asked me if there was any clerk there of the name of Anson or Ansell—I told him no, and he asked me whether I was sure of it—I told him I was—Mr. Rawlinson then came in, and the prisoner ran away directly—we had lost a piece of cloth the day before.</p>

               <p>St. George's—I know the prisoner, he lived at 6, New-court, right opposite me—on the night of 1st January, I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at a little part 10—I stood at my door and heard the cry of a woman and of a child, at the same time, in the prisoner's house—I could not exactly tell what room it came from—I heard a blow at the same time as if something had fallen against a table—I did not see anyone come out of the house, but I heard the woman scream after the blow was struck—I returned into my room, and afterwards heard somebody come down stairs in that house—it is a very narrow court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the first noise you heard something knocking against the table? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first noise was the cry of a woman—the only persons in the house are the prisoner and this woman, and two children whom he takes care of and who were sleeping in the same room—I have said before that I heard the cry of a child—what I heard was as if a per<lb/>son had been shoved—it was a fall against a table that I heard, it was like as if a person knocked against a table—I had known the deceased six or seven weeks—I never saw her drunk—I never saw her out late at night—I have known the prisoner for some time—nobody was in bed at my house I did not call any one, but I said to my husband, "There is a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> over the way"—what I heard, appeared like a person coming down stairs—our house if No. 1, and the prisoner's No. 6—No. 5 is not so nearly opposite our's as No. 6—I did not go to bed that night as my little boy was very ill—I heard what had happened at half-past 5 in the morning, his sister came and told me.</p>

I live at No. 4, New-court, two doors from the prisoner, on the same side—on 1st January, I was sitting by the fire; it was getting on for 10 o'clock, and I heard a very heavy cry in the prisoner's house it was soon over—that was a little after 10—then there was another cry—I did not hear anything between a man and a woman—I went to the door to see where the sound came from, and I heard, an "Oh!"—I heard no more than that—that came from the prisoner's house, the door opposite Mrs. Johnson's—the prisoner came downstairs—he was talking and jawing about and stepped his foot on the door step, and I immediately turned in and saw no more of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of 156, High-street, Shadwell—on 2nd January I was called in by the police-constable, Bugby, to No. 6, New-court, St. George's, between half-post 5 and 6 in the morning—I went into the first floor, and upon entering the room, found a woman dead, lying on the floor—she was dressed—her clothes were not at all disturbed—she had a graze on the forehead as from a fall—being a very dark room and early in the morning, I was unable to observe any other marks of violence—the rest I found out from the post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was she on her back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and her head was under the window, rather on the fire-place side of it; it was a little room—the prisoner was in the room—he said, "I have been out two days and one night at Ber<lb/>mondsey, at work pulling down old houses, and when I came home last night there was no fire, and nothing prepared for me; she then called me names, and I struck her, and she fell first against the window-sill and then on the floor; I then went out, returned shortly, got into bed at the foot, and went to sleep, then I got up in the morning at 5 o'clock to go to work, and I trod on her back"—I think he used the word "deceased"—he said, "I then fetched her sister, and then went to the police-station"—the following day I made a post mortem examination of the body—I found a graze on the forehead, a graze on the left cheek, two small bruises on the left side of the head above the ear—on opening the head I found the brain congested and an infusion of serum into the ventricles—on opening the chest I found the heart very much diseased, the liver congested, the viscera healthy, and the whole of the body remarkably fatty—there were fatty deposits in the heart as well—when I had made that examination, in my opinion the immediate cause of death was disease of the heart, accelerated by the blow or fall—person with such extensive disease of the heart would be in a precarious state at all times from any shock or exciting cause.</p>

               <p>not complain—the captain saw it and stopped it—that was all the trouble there was—the prisoner's berth was open—we call it a state-room—it is open to everybody—I offered the reward for the recovery of my watch and chain the next morning, the 4th January, and gave the prisoner in charge on 21st—I searched his berth on that day on account of suspicion—I went in alone, because I thought it would be better—the captain has never said in my hearing that it would be the best thing that could happen if this man was got out of the ship—the crew said they wished he was out of the ship—they were angry with him—I have heard that said on more than one occasion—no sailors use this state-room; only the second and third mates together—I do not know if this man was discharged whether the third mate would succeed to his office as second mate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am inspector of police in the employ of the Victoria Dock Company—that dock is a port of entry and discharge in the port of London—on 21st January, in consequence of some information I received from the last witness, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Wave,</hi> lying in the Victoria Docks—I there saw the prisoner standing at the door of his cabin—I asked him if that was his cabin—he said, "Yes"—I told him I wished to search his cabin, as he was suspected of having stolen the chief mate's watch—he said, "Very well"—I did search, and in searching his bed found under his pillow a waistcoat, in one of the pockets of which I found the watch, chain, and ring, that I now produce—I then asked the prisoner if that was his waistcoat—he said, "Yes, it is"—I asked him if it was his bed and his berth, and he said it was—the watch was ticking at the time I took it from the waistcoat pocket.</p>

I am a watchmaker, living at Victoria Dock-road, West Ham—I know the prisoner—on 15th January he brought this guard and ring to my shop to have them repaired—the guard was broken—he wanted the ring made less, to fit his finger; a piece taken out of it; he said he wanted it to fit his little finger—I mended the guard, but the ring I did not do anything to—I saw him again on 17th two days after—he came back and paid the money, and took away the ring and guard—I had lent him ten shillings the first day he brought them, on 15th—I had no security—he brought these things and asked me to repair them—he said he was</p>

I ran into the taproom; some one had put the light out, and I never heard anything about this till after. A man came and took me by the collar, and led me out. I went and found the door still fast, and I went back into the tap-room; and three young fellows came up to me, and said, "Here he is now," and struck me again in the face, and pommelled me as much as they liked.

I am a builder at Plumstead in Kent—Darley has never been in my service, Ward has, at three different times, eighteen months past; the last time for about thirteen weeks, up to the time he was taken into custody—he was in my service then, he worked at piece-work or task-work as they term it—about half-past 5 in the evening of 23d December, two constables came with the two prisoners in their custody to my house—previous to their coming I had gone across the road out of the house—mine is a public-house—when I came in at the door, the boards' were lying at the door—I said to Ward, "Halloa, this looks like some of my timber;" and said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "Is this some you have taken away in the cart this afternoon"—he said, "Yes"—I had not seen the cart; I was not able to get out—I had given him authority to take a board for work that he required, but that would not have taken him more than two boards—instead of that, he obtained a cart and took a cart-load—I had given him authority to take two boards—he said in the presence of the two constables, "I dare say it will be paid for"—they were taken to the station-house—I was with the constable to Ward's house, but was not able to go inside—I saw some wood there, there were some forty pieces of various descriptions brought out of that house, put into a cart and taken to the station-house—those forty pieces were my property—we have some of the stuff in Court which I pur<lb/>chased—I know this to be mine by the peculiar way of cutting, and the class of goods—it is a class of goods that is not generally used—they are here—this timber is bought in this shape, in the whole, it is five inch cut, and then cut this way twice—this other one, much larger, was found in the bakery, and the other at Ward's house, and it exactly corresponds—it is cut in London before I purchase it—it is cut to my order, as it is now—the lesser ones were found at Ward's house, and this at the baker's shop, one much larger—I can positively identify a portion of that found at Ward's place as my property—I never gave him any authority to take it away—I never sold him it—I did not know of my own knowledge that he was working at this baker's shop until the Saturday previous—I had not seen him working there—the long piece which he had in his house is a piece of very thin floor-board; this was purchased at the same place—I know that to be my property—I have seen that on my premises; a great quantity of the same class of goods—there is no particular mark on it that I know it by, more than it is white wood—I had never given him any authority to take that wood away or to sell it—we have a portion of the four pieces that were at the door (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is my property—this is a piece that was cut off—there are four pieces, eight feet six inches long—I identify them as mine; no doubt whatever about it—I never sold any of that or gave him permission to take them away—those I told him to take were for battening in a small pair of gates for a side entrance—they were thicker than this—that was for some work on my premises—I went to a bakr's shop in Plum<lb/>stead, and there took a piece of wood away—it forms a portion of this other wood, and forms a five-inch square—I have only valued the forty pieces of wood at fifty shillings—they are various lengths and widths; pieces that were taken at different times.</p>

I am a builder—I do not live at Plumstead, I am finishing two houses there—I have known Ward nine or ten months—I recollect selling him two white inch boards, about nine or ten feet long, in December last—it was what is called white wood—I have none other by me—there are thousands, and hundreds of thousands, of this white wood used daily—it is nearly all of the same sort—there is white spruce, and Christiana—a person, could not identify it without a private mark—I do not see here any of the white wood I sold him—mine was inch stuff, but not this description—this is all white wood, but what I sold him was not like this—it was about this thickness—it might be worked into this shape—this piece might have been sold by me to him—I have not sold him any of the other kind—I have sold stuff to him for nine or ten months—I was repairing his house about the 18th December, taking the roof off his kitchen and work<lb/>shop</p>

I am a bricklayer and builder—I have known Ward twelve months—he has always borne the character of an honest, hardworking man—he worked for me all the summer—I know him as doing various jobs for different parties, as a carpenter—I never sold him any wood—the wood he had of me I permitted him to take from my place down to his house—it was three deals, fifty-two feet—it might have been about 14th or 15th November—he did not buy it of me—he was to make a pair of gates and a sash-door for me out of it—he did not make it—the stuff is at his house at this very time, and it was taken away by Mr. Hopperton along with his stuff—he identified it as his—I swear that it is mine by the invoice which I have—I do not believe that any one can swear to timber without there is a private mark to it—this block cut into three pieces is the ordinary wood used in the trade—there is nothing peculiar about it in the least—these three pieces do not seem to me to fit—I was before the Magistrate and was examined.</p>

I am a waiter at the Kentish Drovers public-house, Old Kent-road—on Monday, 23d December, between 5 and 6 in the day, the prisoner and three more were playing a game of shove-halfpenny—Russell was one of them—while they were playing, George Norris, the deceased, came in—he stood there, leaning over one of the partitions there, watching the game, and he began interfering with it—he said the halfpence were not fair in between the lines—the prisoner cautioned him two or three times not to interfere, to go and sit down, and mind his own business—Fox pushed him to shove him away—the deceased had a pair of gloves on with the fingers off—he pulled the gloves off, and said he would serve him the same as a young man of the name of Thrower had served him; but I believe he made a mistake in the name, it was another party that Fox had had a quarrel with—as soon as he mentioned those words, Fox <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> into him, and Norris was <hi rend="italic">pitching</hi> into him at the same time—they closed together, and were pushing one another, and by that Fox threw him on the ground, and fell on the top of him—Norris fell on the back of his head—I and Fox helped to pick him up after he lay there for a moment—he was insensible—some water was got for him, but he could not partake of it; it was put to his mouth, and he spat it out again—we put him on one of the seats in the tap-room, and he remained there until he was taken home—that was between 11 and 12 o'clock; but he was on the floor once or twice—he remained in an insensible state all the time—he was taken home on a truck by the doctor's orders—he was in liquor, but was not drunk—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting inspector of letter carriers at the Southern District Post-office, Westminster-road—the prisoner was an auxiliary letter carrier in that office—he had also to sort letters—on 14th January he was employed there from a quarter past 5 till he had completed his 8 o'clock delivery, which would be about a quarter before 9—it was always very light on his walk—on the evening of the 14th he was engaged in sorting letters—I observed him clearing his own letters; taking them from the sorting-boxes to his own table, which we do not allow—I stopped him, and told him to let the regular man do it—I watched an opportunity, looked at the letters in his box, and found two thick letters which were not in his delivery, but which he had sorted to himself—he arranges the letters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270084"/>
               <p>for his delivery himself—there are thirteen men who sort the letters into the different walks, and he sorts together with the others into the sorting-boxes, and two men are employed to collect them to their own tables—the prisoner would sort letters to any walk, or all the walks—each carrier then goes to his sent or table and arranges the letters for delivery—the prisoner was not one of those two men who had any right to collect for his own table—there are three roads for the country letters; the Norwood, the Croydon, and the Carshalton—there was one thick letter for Clapham, and a letter for Mr. Morgan, of the Waterloo-road walk, which he sorted to his own walk, the Vauxhall walk—I put those letters back into the sorting-box, and allowed the regular man to collect them and take them round to his walk—they ought not to have been in the prisoner's walk—that excited my suspicion, and about twenty minutes after that I called him to take a Croydon bag to the cart downstairs, and in the mean time I went to his letters, because I thought perhaps he might have missorted them, but these two thick letters were still among his, at his seat—I took no notice of it, and each man tied his letters up and went out on delivery, and just before the prisoner went downstairs I called him, and said, "I want to examine your letters"—he took them from under his great coat, and I found these two thick ones, and five or six others which belonged to other men's walks, among his own—I told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself, and I should not allow him to go out on delivery—I sent some one else out with the letters, and then said, "Have you any more letters in your possession?"—I think he said, "Mr. Shooter, you are very hard; very severe," and he took out of his pocket nineteen letters, and handed them to me—I have some of the envelopes here, the letters have been delivered—they were not on his walk—some were for Croydon, and some for Carshalton—they bear the post-office mark of that day—they ought to have gone out at that time—the dispatch to the country was at a quarter before 8—some of them were Brixton, Streatham, Merton, and South Lambeth—I do not think any of them bore two stamps—these are they (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when he produced them I said, "I have sent for a police-constable"—I asked him if he had any more, and he took out this packet, addressed to "Sim, Esq., Nonsuch-park, Cheam," containing a silver breast-pin—that also ought to have gone by the same delivery—it bears the Epsom post-mark of that day and the London poet-mark also, showing that it had been posted at Epsom, and had come through our office—an officer came and I gave the prisoner in custody and followed him to the station—Dawson searched him in my presence, and took from him a letter addressed to Mrs. Bullen—it was open—it seemed to have been the contents of another letter—there was no envelope—it contained a money order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Dawson also produced an envelope addressed to some one at Hastings—I do not know the name—among the nineteen letters found in his pocket was one to "R. Titman, Croydon barracks," in which I found the halves of four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—there was another letter addressed to Mrs. Detman of Lambeth—I delivered that to her and saw it opened—it contained a sixpence—I took the packet contain<lb/>ing the pin to Mr. Sim, who opened it in my presence—when I told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself—he said, "I can't think what I have been about."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 54, New-cut, Lambeth—on Tuesday, 7th January, the prisoner came, picked up the pieces of meat off the board, and tendered me a shilling—I detected it in a moment, and said it was had—he said that he knew where he took it, and wanted me to give it him back—I refused, and he left—I instantly followed him to Mr. Schraders, who lives two doors from me—I had seen him leave their shop previous to coming to mine—he passed into Mr. Schrader's with something in a paper; then he went to a public-house at the corner, and from there came to my shop—I made a communication to Mrs. Schrader, and afterwards gave Mr. Schrader the shilling, which had never been out of my sight.</p>
