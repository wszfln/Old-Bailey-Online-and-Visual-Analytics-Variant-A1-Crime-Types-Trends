                  </hi>. I am manager and shareholder in the works of the Mambré Saccharine Company—I produce the certificate of registration—we are manufacturers of malt saccharine—we have a wharf in the Fulham Road, on the River Thames—we have been in the habit for some time past of buying coals from the prisoner Johnson—with reference to the purchase of those coals I have had interviews with Burton—the coals bought from Johnson were delivered at our wharf in his barges—we were to be supplied by him with coal from the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company—before a barge load of coals was delivered to us we should receive an advice note from Johnson stating the quantity—latterly I desired that the numbers of the trucks should be stated on the back of the advice note, and the width of each truck—that would be towards the end of December—Harrison was in our employment—it was part of his duty on the wharf to count the number of skips that were taken from the barges—sometimes three, and sometimes two skips are unloaded at a time—each skip weighs 7 1/2 cwt.—it would be Harrison's duty to give in to me the number of skips delivered—he would have no means of knowing from me the quantity that a barge would contain—he always reported to me the number of skips from the barge—I compared the number of skips with the quantity of coal in the advice note—I found that the number of skips he returned corresponded with the quantity of coal advised by Johnson—I always found they agreed with the quantity advised by Johnson—I sometimes found them over weight—I never found that Harrison's weights were less than Johnson's—early in January when I was making up my books I found that the coal account was rather heavy, that the coal was going very fast—in consequence of that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080002"/>
               <p>I employed Ryan to check Harrison's quantities—on 5th Jan. I received an advice note from Johnson—they generally came by post—I don't know in whose handwriting they were—I took them to be Burton's—this (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>) seems to me like Burton's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated Jan</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1378, <hi rend="italic">from Johnson, and advised</hi> 54 <hi rend="italic">tons</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">cwt. of Welsh coal ex barge Henry</hi>.) On the back of the invoice the numbers of the trucks are given—Harrison as usual counted the number of skips by the Henry, and re<lb/>turned them as 145 1/2—he made the return verbally—that would amount to 54 tons 7 cwt.—the last three skips were actually weighed, they averaged about 7 3/4 cwt.—Harrison weighed them—as a rule I was not present—I had instructed Ryan to watch the numbers of the skips in the barge; he made a return to me—in consequence of that return I in<lb/>structed him to watch the next barge—I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">B</hi>) with reference to the 54 tons. (<hi rend="italic">This was on a billhead of Johnson's</hi>, 54 <hi rend="italic">tons</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">cwt., at</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9, 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) On 10th of January I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">C</hi>) referring to the barge Joe—the quantity of coals mentioned in the ad<lb/>vice note was 53 tons 10 cwt.—the last three skips were weighed by Harri<lb/>son—the numbers of the trucks were on the back of the advice note—Ryan made a return with reference to that barge—a little before 12th of January I received this advice note with reference to a barge called the Jack—I weighed the barge on the 12th—the quantity of coal appearing on the advice note is 61 tons 6 cwt.—the numbers of the trucks appear on the back of the advice note—one is No. 1742 represented as containing 10 tons 1 cwt.—I had the contents of the Jack weighed; Ryan weighed them—I was there a part of the time, not the whole—Harrison was present—I afterwards went to the Chelsea station of the North-Western Railway, and endeavoured to trace the truck 1742, but was not able to—I then went to Johnson's office, and there saw a clerk—he read some<lb/>thing to me from a book—I was not able to trace the truck there—I saw Burton with reference to these purchases of coal—I imagined that the invoices were not written by a clerk, from the handwriting, and I asked Burton if he did not employ a clerk to write them, because they seemed to be written in such a loose slovenly manner—he said they were all written either by himself or Mr. Johnson at Johnson's house, as they did not wish the clerk to know the price they were selling at—the con<lb/>versation related both to the advice notes and the invoices—I had agreed to pay 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this coal delivered at the wharf—that was the price charged in all the invoices—on 15th January Burton called at my office and wanted me to give him the number of the last truck on the advice note, referring to the Jack—he said he had been sent from Johnson, for he had heard from a customer that he had received too much coal, and if some one had received too much, some one else must have received too little—I did not give him the number—it was about 5 o'clock in the evening that he called—I had spoken to Harrison that morning—he said there were rumours in the factory that the coal was wrong, and that his name was mentioned in connection with it, and he asked me for an explanation—I told him I did not desire to have anything to say to him then, that an opportunity would be given him to clear himself if he had nothing to do with it—he seemed satisfied with that and went away—this was after I had been to the railway station and to Johnson's office about the number of the truck—about 10th January I received this advice note referring to the barge Hetty, advising 56 tons—the numbers of the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I did not know Johnson—I had never seen him previous to this inquiry—I went to the coal depôt but not to his office—I did not communicate with him about this business—I employ a man named Tisdale—I did not inquire of him about this matter—I do not remember asking Harrison to speak to Tisdale about it—I was not aware that Tisdale was going to see Harrison about these coals and their weights—I did not know that Tisdale was lodging at the same place as Harrison—Tisdale made a communication to me—he is a painter, and is now employed by me on the same terms as he was before this inquiry—I did not tell Ryan why I wanted the countings—he is a weight clerk—I did not know of Harrison receiving plug-money from Johnson or others till after this inquiry—I do not remember seeing Harrison plugging a barge on Sunday morning, or saying that he ought to be paid—I would not say it did not occur—our men sometimes plug barges, but it is done in our own time—this is Welsh coal—I dealt with other merchants besides Johnson for eighteen months or two years—I never heard of any complaints as to the weights before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR HARRIS</hi>. Harrison has been in our service about three years—he came as a hammer-man, and was promoted to drive an engine as soon as we got a crane in the summer of 1875—the engine works the crane—he would also have to count the skips and report how many were made, and the entries were made in a book—he would also have to unload thousands of bags of sago—the clerk who weighed it would make the entries of the sago—coals were sometimes unloaded in the evening—there was sometimes a break in the unloading—the barge Jack was</p>

               <p>begun on the 12th and finished on the 14th—I do not remember Harrison coming to borrow my water-boots, to plug a barge, before Christmas, 1876—I would not say I did not lend them to him, but I do not remember it—I do not remember his saying he got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my saying it was plenty—there were two skips when Harrison unloaded the barge—there are sometimes three—two are of the same size, the third is a little larger—I have not measured the skips—oh, yes I have, but I cannot re<lb/>member their dimensions—the third skip holds half a cwt. more than the others—a bushel of large coal would weigh heavier than a bushel of small—the difference in the weight of a skip of small and a skip of large would be nearly 1/2 cwt.—a skip averages 7 1/2 or 8 cwt., if piled up to the top, but it never holds 10 cwt.—I never knew it to hold 9—I never weighed it—Ryan can tell you more about the weight—we have two sets of scales, one of iron and the other partly of wood—7 or 8 lb. of lead was not put to make the scales balance—there is a receptacle for adjusting the scales—Pierce was timekeeper as well as weight clerk occasionally, but taking weights was not his duty, but Ryan's—I do not remember complaining to Harrison about a year ago with regard to his being short—I know Ellmore and Scott's barges, but do not remember their being short by 9 tons and Harrison speaking about it, or saying "I will do the best I can"—I asked Harrison how many tons there would be in the Jack, when he said about 60—I do not remember his saying he could tell by her length and width—after Burton called on me on 15th January. I sent for Harrison and said "Now, Harrison, you have got a wife and children, and I do not see why they should suffer. I have sent for you to give you an opportunity of confessing"—I do not remember using the word "repent" or "foolishness"—he said he had nothing to be afraid of—I said "I took you to be an honest man;" I do not remem<lb/>ber his replying"I am one yet"—I do not believe he did say it—he had no more to say and went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRINDLEY</hi>. Burton called on me as Johnson's agent for orders—the quantities would only be known of a barge of coals when the notes were supplied—I was not aware of Burton being agent for anybody else but Johnson—I am giving my evidence from memory—I understood Burton to ask for the number of a particular truck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Some of the small coals were brought in carts, and some in barges—Harrison raised the skips by a steam crane—he counted them as they came up, and put them down on a slate provided for the purpose—I have seen him mark them—I obtained the weights of the skips from Harrison himself, and I find they average about 7 1/2 cwt.—I have assumed they were full—the sago was weighed after it had been unloaded, and in the top story of the building—I had been advised from Johnson's office the day before Burton called what the Nos. of the trucks were—Harri<lb/>son has been employed by the company about three years—he was a hard<lb/>working industrous man—my object in sending for him was to give him an opportunity of confessing if he had done anything wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weigher to the Mambré Saccharine Company—on 5th and 7th January last, in consequence of instructions from Mr. Francis, I checked the unloading of the barge Henry—I counted the number of skips that were taken out of that barge; it was 133 1/2—I am quite sure as to that—on 10th January my attention was called to the barge Joe, and I counted the number of skips that came out of that; it was 131—I did not count the skips in any other barge—I had to weigh the next—the paper I am looking at contains the number of skips—I merely made it as a memorandum for myself about a month ago—I have the original paper that I made at the time (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I was desired by Mr. Francis to weight the barge Jack—I found it contained 49 tons 12 cwt.—I also, under Mr. Francis's instructions, weighed the barge Hetty; that weighed 47 tons 8 cwt.—I got the weights in this way: the skips were filled in the barge, they were then taken up by a steam crane out of the barge and lowered on to iron scales, and I then ascer<lb/>tained the weight from the scales, the gross weight of the skips; and at the end, when I had finished all the skips, I deducted the tare of the skips, which I had previously ascertained, and that gave the net weight—I made an entry of the weight of each skip as it came out of the barge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I counted the skips of two barges; one barge, the Henry, occupied two days, the 5th and the 7th, and the other, the Joe, one day, the 18th; the Jack and the Hetty I weighed—I have weighed others since this inquiry—Mr. Francis directed me to tally these barges and to weigh them to check Harrison—he did not tell me that was the object; he told me to do it—I knew afterwards that it was to check Harrison, not at first—Harrison was numbering the skips and taking the coals out of the barges—I believe he put the weights on a slate, the number of skips—the barges were drawn up at the side of the wharf—I stood in the laboratory while I was doing this; that is a room—I was concealed from Harrison—Mr. Francis told me to go into the labo<lb/>ratory and tally the skips as they came out of the barge—he told me to conceal myself from Harrison—I don't believe Harrison could see me—the laboratory is just at the top of the building—I could see down on the wharf from the window—the laboratory is about four stories up—I com<lb/>menced to tally out the Henry about 10 minutes to 1 in the day and was at work till 4 that evening—I started again on Monday morning to finish the Henry—Harrison was working on the wharf at the same time—the house is on the wharf—I was about as far from the barge as across part of this Court—no one was with me—the skips are let down by a steam crane into a truck and then into a stokehole—I marked the skips as they were turned into the truck—I gave these papers to Mr. Francis after I had made them—no one was with me when I weighed the barges—Harri<lb/>son was on the engine of the crane.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. I had nothing to do but to take a note of the skips as I saw them—I had not to work any crane or engine—Harrison had to work the engine, and had to make a mark on the slate when he stopped the engine—I had pen and ink, and desk and paper—I had no book, this is the paper on which I put the weights—I peeped out of; he window—I had to keep my eye upon the thing the whole time—the skips are all put down here in two's because the truck they were turned into held two—I counted the skips and put them down at once—it occupied my attention all day—I left off counting on Saturday at 4,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080007"/>
               <p>they had finished then—I began again on Monday morning about 7.30 and went on until 6 p.m.—I actually weighed the coal out of the barge—Harrison did not do that—I was directed to weigh them—one skip was not full—some might come up with 6 cwt. of coal in it and some with 8 cwt., none 10 or 9 cwt., the average is about 7 1/2 cwt.—the skip and coal together might weigh 12 cwt. 2 qrs. 2 lb.—a skip's weight is 3 cwt. and some pounds.,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The largest skip would hold about 8 1/2 cwt.—I should think that would be the maximum, they might hold more—in weighing the Jack and the Hetty I weighed the contents of those two barges in skips—I took down the quantity in each skip, that is what I entered on this paper—the largest quantity was 12cwt. 3qrs. 24lb., taking the skip and coal together—I could perfectly see the crane from the laboratory—there was no difficulty in seeing the skips as they came up—Harrison had nothing to do with the filling of the skips in the barge or tipping them into the trucks—he would have the opportunity of taking the number of each skip—he would stop the engine every time the skip came up and then make the mark.</p>

From information I received, I stopped Donovan in Little Pole Street at 12.45 on 10th March—Mrs. Edgell was with me—she identified him—I told him the charge—he replied that he had not been in the fish shop or near it, but that he had been to an Irish wake and had only just come out—I was at the station when Mrs. Edgell came, and it was from her description that I appre<lb/>hended Donovan—I went to Hurley's house with another constable—I told him the charge—he replied that he had been drinking at a public-house in Whitechapel and had heard of the occurrence about an hour previous—at the station he said he saw and knew all about it, but he did not leave the fish shop but stayed in the shop the whole time—I found nothing on him.</p>

From what I know of him I should think it quite possible. When he was with me one night he happened to drop three letters; they had your address, a Mrs. Elmer's, and a Mr. Hoppe's. I mean to send them all a letter each, and if I can get hold of any of his relations' addresses I will send them letters also. I do not like to see people imposed upon, so I have gotten my brother to write these letters. Should I hear any more about his goings on with other women I will let you know.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Godfrey Pearse, of 40, Ebury Street, Pimlico—I am twenty-three years of age—I am daughter of Signor Mario—I have resided abroad up to the time of my marriage—my marriage took place in 1872—in the latter part of 1876 I was calling frequently on a doctor who lived in the neighbourhood of Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, and in the course of passing along Duke Street I observed a perfumer's shop—there was over the shop "Arabian Perfumer to the Queen"—I went into the shop and for the first time saw the defendant—my first purchase was of some tooth-powder—she served me with it and I ultimately bought some violet powder—she said she had something far more harmless than violet powder and far better for my skin—she said it would be a wash which would cleanse my skin and keep it in a healthy state—she showed me something in a bottle at that time—she said it came from the East—the price she asked was a pound for the bottle—I did not take it then because I did not know what it was, but on the next occasion I purchased a bottle of the wash—she told me I should have to purchase more bottles as it would be a process—I purchased bottles to the extent of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she called the use of the wash enamel<lb/>ling—when she mentioned enamelling I said I would not be painted—she said it had the same relation to her wash as that of a painter to his painting, or a doctor and his prescription—she said it was not paint or anything approaching paint—she said "Do you know Lady Dudley?"—I said I did—she asked me if I thought she was painted, and I said "No"—she said Lady Dudley had used her washes fifty times, and that, she was finishing her process with Lady Dudley at that time—she said, as to the use of these things, that the effect would be like that of a Turkish bath—I was to write to her and put "enamelling" or a "little enamel<lb/>ling" in my note—she said her fee was a thousand guineas, and that the process would take some months—all this was said before I went to Rome—she said on one occasion a lady who had left the shop had told her I</p>

               <p>was Signor Mario's daughter, and I said it was so—she said she had heard I could sing; she had been told so by persons who had heard me in society—I saw in the shop in Duke Street a bust of the great Rachel the <hi rend="italic">tragedienne</hi>—I asked if she was any relation of hers; she said she was—I saw a portrait of Rachel as well—I then went to Rome about the end of February, 1877, and came home the 25th or 26th of May—before going away to Rome I wrote this letter to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I was not able to leave on the 5th, but I shall start on the 17th. Could you see me on Friday or Saturday morning? If at all events you could send me a little enamelling, it would spare you sending any to Rome. If you can please try to see me about this matter, if you are not too ill. Address me as ' Mrs. Pearse, 40, Ebury Street, ' without putting your name to the letter.—C. M. P.—Please burn this letter.") That I wrote before going to Rome—I did not, to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion, see her again—on returning home I found she had changed her shop from Duke Street to 153, Great Portland Street—at that time I was not acquainted with Mrs. Crossman Turner, but I received a letter from her, which I destroyed—in consequence of the receipt of this letter I went to Mrs. Turner's house at St. John's Wood, and it was arranged I should meet her at 153, Great Portland Street—at that time I was not aware the prisoner was the mother of Mrs. Turner—when I went to meet her some time in June, 1877, it was my second visit to Great Port<lb/>land Street—I then ascertained, for the first time, that the defendant was Mrs. Turner's mother—on the first occasion of going to Portland Street Mrs Turner was not there—I had no conversation then with the defendant about enamelling—we never spoke about that any more, but I bought another bottle of wash, which I paid for—I remember asking why she did not apply the process to herself, and she said, "Oh, when you are about 60 your skin will be in such a healthy and purified state that you will look as young as you do now"—I asked why she did not apply it to herself—she said, "Are you aware how old I am?"—I said I was not, and then she said she was 85—that was what took place at the first interview at Great Portland Street—at the next meeting I met Mrs. Turner, and there was then some conversation about giving a con<lb/>cert, and I was invited to sing—my husband knew of this invitation by Mrs. Turner to sing at this concert for the Turkish Compassionate Fund—it was an invitation by Mrs Turner—the prisoner asked me not to men<lb/>tion to my husband who she was, she said she had been locked up five years through a conspiracy some years ago, that she had cleared her name before the public, but that she would rather I should not mention that I knew her—in the course of conversation with reference to the concert, the name of Mr. Arthur Sullivan was mentioned, and she said she knew of me through him—the name of Lady Coutts-Lindsay was mentioned, and reference was made to a concert at Stafford House—she asked me if I knew the Duchess of Sutherland—I said I did and I would write to her—the ques<lb/>tion of the Turkish concert was discussed—there was also a question of getting up a concert for my father—Mrs. Turner, who was on the stage, said that she knew more about the artistes and could get persons to help—it has never taken place—it was to be in two or three months—while that concert was under conversation, Madame Rachel said she was using her influence to obtain patronage and subscriptions—Her Majesty sent a sub<lb/>scription to the fund for my father, and I mentioned it to Madame</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080027"/>
               <p>Rachel, and she said she was not astonished, for it was through her influence that the Queen sent it—she said she brought her influence to bear upon the Queen through ladies of honour near the Queen—she showed me a letter—she said a good lot of things about the concert—I recollect the first occasion when the sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned—after using the washes an eruption came out—that was about the end of December, 1877—in the intervening period from June to December I oc<lb/>casionally used these washes—I paid her altogether, from the first I saw of her, about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in buying these washed I believed the statement she made as to the effects the wash would have in clearing and cleans<lb/>ing my complexion—I believed the statement that these washes were used by ladies whose names she mentioned—after this rash came out upon my face I went to Madame Rachel, and called her attention to the state of my face—she said I was in a terrible state, that all the pores of my skin were open, and that unless I let her finish her process at once I should be ruined for life—I said to her, "I must go to my doctor"—she said it would do me no good, that it was not a matter of the con<lb/>stitution, but entirely that of the skin—she said she had studied the skin for more than 30 years, and that doctors brought ladies there to her to be cured of any rash or marks on the skin or complexion, conse<lb/>quently she was the only person who could save me from being dis<lb/>figured—she then said, "You know my fee is a thousand guineas, but for you, as you are a friend of my daughter's, I will make it 500"—I said, "It is impossible; I cannot do it"—she said, "Very well, you will be sorry in after life; and I warn you, you are in such a state that if you put even cold cream or water on your face you will be disfigured for life"—that ended the interview, and I went away—in consequence of a letter I received from the defendant I went and saw her—a sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was then mentioned—she said she could not bear to see me in the terrible state I was, but if I would let her finish the process she would take 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that Lady Dudley had given her 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the same thing, so of course it was worth while my giving 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on that occasion I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the defendant, not at her dictation—I wrote that from my house—it was the same day—I wrote that letter on December 21st, 1877. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Friend, I have ascertained that by the first or middle of February I can have the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Now will you promise me faithfully to finish me for that sum? if not, alas, I must throw up the whole thing. Please send me a small pot of cream, for I have very little to last till February. Please give Jane an answer, as I hardly know what I have to do for that sum; so if you say frankly you won't, I must of course stop what I have begun to realise the same. I cannot promise any more.—Yours, C. M. P. Please send me Gye's letter. If you consent to finish me for that sum, I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first day I see you, and the other 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day you tell me I am finished. Is that right?") In order to carry, out what I promised in that letter I went to several money-lenders for the purpose of raising the money, but found I could not do it without my husband's signature—I then wrote a letter to the defendant—that was two or three days after the other letter—I wrote to say that I could not pay more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent it by my maid Orsolina, an Italian, who brought back a message that I was to go and see the de<lb/>fendant—I went with my maid—she then began by asking if I could not in any way give her the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "No"—she then suggested I</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The jewels were produced</hi>.) that is the case in which I put them, and the jewels produced are mine—most of them were my mother's—I saw Madame Rachel—I said I had brought my jewels, and that later I would bring her the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said they were in trustworthy hands—she again remarked that I was in a terrible state—the rash was still out upon me—my husband had noticed the state of my skin—she said the bath she would give me would take it away—she had not said anything about a bath before, but she pulled it from under the table, and said that I was to have a bath there and then—it was a tin bath, an ordinary hip-bath—she refused to do anything to take away the rash until she saw the jewels—I had a bath, and my maid was present—I handed my jewels over into the custody of the defendant—at that time I believed the rash upon my face was a serious matter—I believed the defendant had the power to cure that rash—I still believed the statement that she made as to her having treated other ladies whose names she mentioned—I believed the statement she made on the preceding day that she had 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of Lady Dudley's jewels in her possession—I believed the woman I had seen coming up the stairs was the Countess of Dudley's maid, and it was my belief in those matters which induced me to hand over my jewels—I was also under apprehension as to the condition of my skin at the time—Madame Rachel said Lady Dudley had sent her jewels instead of the money for finishing her; or for the finishing process—I dressed and went away then immediately, leaving the jewellery—on the Monday I went again—I was to have met Mrs. Turner on the Monday, and I wrote to her—she (Madame Rachel) said, "Would you like to have your jewels back?"—I said, "I would"—she then said she knew of a lady who would give the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her, that I might take my jewels back with me, and the lady would look to me for the money; but to do that I should have to write her a letter—I wrote that letter—she dictated me the letter that I would bring her my jewels for her to raise a sum of money on—I said I had better put in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did then put in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that I left the letter with her, and when I got home I sent my maid with this letter.

This is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—Madame Rachel has informed me that she has placed in your care my jewels, of which I have the list of memorandum; and she also assures me I can have them when applying to you at an hour's notice within six months, by forwarding to you the amount I authorised her to get. I hope to have, by the end of the month, the money, and Madame Rachel assures me of every care you will take of them; and also all secrecy and the respectability of your firm. Address me under cover here, 153, Great Portland Street. C. M. Pearse.") This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the list of my jewels, which I had enclosed in the jewel box when I gave it to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi> "I deposit with Madame Rachel in her care" <hi rend="italic">various articles of jewellery</hi> "instead of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ") I inquired on that occasion, if the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were paid, if I could get my jewels back—she replied that they could be—I asked for a receipt for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which she had received in connection with my jewellery—she asked me to write a receipt for the money I had promised her—she opened a book with printed forms in it, which she placed before me—she told me to fill up one—I objected to a printed form—she said it did net matter, for it was only a receipt, no one saw it—upon that I signed it—I was going to put 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she asked me to put 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I objected—she then asked me if I would put down 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my maid witnessed my signature to the document (<hi rend="italic">The document bore the signature of A.

She gave me no receipt for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent my maid for it, but she came back without it—before that I had not men<lb/>tioned the subject to my husband, but I mentioned it to him that night—at that time I had remaining some of the wash I had bought at Madame Rachel's—it was afterwards handed by me to my husband and analysed, but I do not know by whom—my husband, accompanied by my maid, went to see Madame Rachel on the Sunday—I went on the Sunday week and saw the defendant, at 153, Great Portland Street—there was was not a very long interview—she denied she had dictated the letter to the lady, and said I owed her 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. beyond what I paid her—she went into a variety of matters—my husband said he should go for his solicitor; but I do not think he mentioned a name—the defendant said she should be very pleased to meet me in Court, if I dare appear, and that she had letters that would incriminate me—my husband said he could not discuss the matter, that he should take proceedings—she abused us all the way downstairs, calling us names—that very day Mr. Lewis was communicated with—I have written other letters to Madame Rachel than those produced, from time to time, on various subjects, especially with reference to the concert.</p>

               <p>four years, and since December, 1876, I have frequently seen my doctor; about once a fortnight, when I have been in London, having suffered in health for some years—I was living in Pimlico in December, 1876, the doctor was living near Grosvenor Square, and sometimes I passed the prisoner's shop—it was not quite in my way—I went in to buy some tooth powder—I had not heard of her name before; I knew the name as being the same as the great French tragedienne—I had not heard of her wares at all—I was passing the shop and I went in to buy this tooth powder—her name had never been mentioned to me—I found the tooth powder was very good, but not better than any other—I went afterwards and bought some violet powder that is used for children after bathing, and things of that sort; not for ornamentation necessarily—I had been in the habit of buying such powder ever since my childhood; washes I had never used before, powder I had used—I used to buy the powder anywhere—the powder was very good—I think on my second visit there was some talk about the wash—I did not buy it then—I think it was talked of the day that she recommended the violet powder—the third time I went in would have been less than a fortnight—I went to buy the wash, she called it enamelling, and that it would cleanse the skin—whenever enamelling was spoken of, I understood some liquid which would clean and cleanse the skin; that is all it was—it was not to leave any coat of plaster on the face—it was explained that the enamelling had nothing to do with any paint, pigment, or powder—I then bought a bottle of liquid which was to be used for the whole body—before going to Rome I don't remember exactly how many bottles I had; perhaps three or four—a bottle would last several times; it was not all put in, about two or three tablespoons were to be put into one bath—there was no label on the bottle—I was to use it whenever I liked, occasionally—I continued that till I went to Rome in February, I think—the effect of the washes was nothing particular; beneficial rather—I did not notice anything particular—I asked her for something that would remove hair—she said she would give me some; she did not do so or caution me as to the use of it—I had only one bath at her house—the effect of the washes I think was satisfactory, but I did not notice any difference—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) this is my writing, I was not staying at Grove Hall in Staffordshire while I was using Madame Rachel's washes—I was at Market Drayton in Shrop<lb/>shire—my friends there said I looked quite "lovely"—the defendant had given me some powder to put on my arms and neck when I went to a ball, and she told me to write to tell her what effect I produced—before I went to Rome I was on very friendly terms with Madame Rachel—I wrote her a number of letters and post-cards—I was not short of money at that time—on December 8, 1876, probably I owed her money—the post-cards were written in French. (<hi rend="italic">They were put in and read.

               <p>the case. <hi rend="italic">Au revoir</hi> till Thursday.") I was very anxious at that time to see Madame Rachel—I believe it was for the purpose of getting more of these washes to complete the cleansing process—I had not been able to pay her the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between Dec. 8 and Jan 5. (<hi rend="italic">Two other letters were put in and read, one dated Jan</hi>. 19 <hi rend="italic">from Luton, stating she would come to see her on Tuesday, and the other from London, Jan</hi>. 23: "I have to leave England on 5th Feb., and would like to be made beautiful for ever before I leave.") Madame Rachel had been ill for a considerable time, and I had not seen her most likely for a month before writing that letter—the expression "beautiful for ever" was her expression, I used it—I was in Paris on 19th Feb.—I don't think I was at Market Drayton then—I don't think this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I could not take my oath of it—I have no notion whose writing it is—this letter of 19th August is mine, but not this dated from Market Drayton on 19th Feb.—I had not men<lb/>tioned to any one at Market Drayton that Madame Rachel dealt in these things—I was stopping at Chesney, not at Hodnet Hall. This letter is mine. ("Rome, April 6, 1877. Dear Madame Rachel,—I am in want of some more pink powder, and also a little red powder and some cream. Could you send me them here? My address is Madame Pearse, 4, Corso Prima Piazza. I hope you are now quite well, and can get about again. Please let me know if you can send me these things.") At that time I was in Rome—I had to act in some private theatricals—I wanted cream and two sorts of powder for use in the private theatricals—my father told me so—they are things which can be purchased in Rome, but I thought it better to send to London for them, as she had said they were harmless—I am a foreigner when in Rome—my father was living there at the time—he had been living there for two years—I don't think my father could have told me where to get innocuous cream in Rome—Madame Rachel never answered my letter nor sent the things—my father gave me his cream and I used it for three performances without experiencing any ill results from the use of it—when I returned to London from Rome I went to see Madame Rachel—most likely I went to see her at once, most likely not—I have no recollection of how soon I went to see her after I returned—it was probably early in June—I went there to buy washes—I had no letter from Madame Rachel during my absence in Rome—I cannot remember whether I saw an advertisement that she had removed to Great Portland Street—I don't remember what occurred at the first interview with her in Portland Street—she never did anything else for me except to supply me with washes and powders for my personal decoration—sometimes she would apply these washes to my face to show me how to use them—she never removed any spots from my face—I was to put the wash into a bath—she said sometimes I might use it in a bath and sometimes with<lb/>out—I was to use it on a sponge and it would dean my face as if I was to use some acid—that was not to remove hair or spots—I do not remember "black spots" or any slight spots alluded to—she had spoken about removing hair from my arms, not from the face—she said these washes would have the same influence upon everything—I saw Mrs. Turner at the defendant's house—I had heard that she was a distinguished vocalist—I have heard some of my friends say that she is a pretty fair <hi rend="italic">artiste</hi>—she performs at Her Majesty's Theatre—to the best of my belief I paid Madame Rachel about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, but how I paid it, whether in large or small instalments, I don't remember—I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080032"/>
               <p>paid for some washes singly as I got them—on the occasion of the second visit which I paid to Madame Rachel, after I came from Rome, she spoke to me about her having undergone five years' imprisonment—she said that her daughter was upon the stage, and that for her sake she did not wish the relationship between them to be known—she said that she had been imprisoned as the result of a conspiracy—I knew in June or July that she had been imprisoned—she did not go into the matter very fully—she said that they wanted to obtain 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her; that not being able to get it a conspiracy was entered into against her, and in the result she was locked up for five years; that the Home Office was taking it up to prove her innocence—she was talking for three hours, and at the end of the conversation that is all I know about it—she produced letters from many ladies referring to the matter, but I did not read them—she showed a very strong feeling against a solicitor, Mr. George Lewis—I cannot say that she very often mentioned his name—she told me that some people wanted to get 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her, but she never explained it to me—I did not suppose that it had anything to do with the washes—she said she did not wish her daughter's name to be mixed up with the affair—I continued to deal with her on the strength of the document from the Home Office—I saw the beginning of it, but I do not know what it was—it being from the Home Office led me to believe it was truthful—it was about this time that the con<lb/>versation took place about my father—Mrs. Turner said she knew the artistes were ready to come forward to sing as a sort of tribute to my father's name—I understood that a daughter-in-law of the defendant's was at the Royal Academy of Music—I understood that she and Mrs. Turner were engaged in getting up a concert, and a great many letters passed between me and Mrs. Turner on the subject. This letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Wednesday, February 11.40, Ebury Street. My dear Madame Rachel. Should I not hear from you am I to understand that I am to go to you on Saturday at 11 o'clock at 29, Duke Street. I hope to go and see Mrs. Turner next week to arrange about the concert, but everyone thinks I had better put it off for February, as in November we could not make so much. I fear if the Albert Hall were chock full it would not bring altogether 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as most of the boxes and stalls are private property.") (<hi rend="italic">Another letter dated July</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th stated that she had heard from Mr. Gye, who thought it was too late in the season to do anything now, referring to the concert</hi>.) I believe it was Mrs. Turner's idea to write that letter—my idea of "finishing" was when this process was over—she told me three or four months as the time for it to be used—I believe I used some in June and July—the rash had not then come out—it came out at the end of December, 1877—I had used this wash in its pure state to my face and no rash came out—I don't remember saying before the Magistrate, "I rarely used the wash, and when I did the rash came out"—rashes did now and then come out on me, but I can't say whether it was from her washes or anything else—I don't think, except the measles, I ever had any rash before dealing with Madame Rachel—I never had a rash like that which broke out at the end of December—before that date I had merely little spots and blotches, and that sort of thing—I went down to Luton about this time—I wrote this letter dated July 30th, 1877:—"Dear Madame Rachel,—I write to remind you that I shall be with you on Wednesday between 11 and 12. Did you get</p>

               <p>Gye's letter all right?—Yours, C. M. Pearse."—I also wrote this dated August 2nd, from Luton:—"Dear Madame Rachel,—I find no letter from Mrs. Turner; if you see her tell her to write to me to The Elms Dartmouth, Devonshire. I had an accident coming up. One of the bottles you gave me I let fail and broke it. The other is all safe. Perhaps at Dartmouth I will take sea baths. Do you think they will do harm to my skin? Let me know at 40, Ebury Street, if you can see me on Friday afternoon between three and four, so that you may touch my face for the last time, as when I come back perhaps I shall be improved enough to be finished off. I will be up in the morning, and hope to hear from you.—Yours, very sincerely, C. M. Pearse. "She told me there were different processes—I really cannot explain more than I have—the "touching" was with the wash to cleanse the skin—she said when I was finished I should have a receipt from her which I could have made up at any chemist's, and which I could throw into my bath at ordinary times, and which would keep my skin in the healthy state she had got it into—she had most likely touched me several times before that—she was always saying that she wanted to touch it up herself—she told me if I went to a doctor's for one illness he would not always give the same medicine, but various medicines, and it was the same with her washes, which were not always the same—I really don't know whether what she gave me was anything different—she used to tell me to touch myself with the same thing that I put into my bath—I wrote this letter from The Elms:—"Dartmouth, August 10th. Dear Madame Bachel—Give me your views how you are getting on? It is lovely here, and we are enjoying our<lb/>selves a good deal. I heard from papa, who is very well, and very poor. However, he is in hope of better times. My face improves every day, and I hope you will find it so when I return. Write soon.—Yours sin<lb/>cerely, C. M. P. "My face had very much improved—I was anxious about her health—she always said she was ill whenever I saw her—sometimes I had difficulty in seeing her on that account—I wrote this letter:—"Thursday, 15th. Dear Madame Rachel—I will be up in London for one day before going to Staffordshire. Can you see me on the morning of the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> (Tuesday), between 11 and 12 o'clock? Please let me know, either here or at 40, Ebury Street. I leave here on the morning of the 20th. If you cannot see me on Tuesday I must put it off for another fortnight, but I hope you can see me. Please let me know. From yours very sincerely, C. M. P. "I also wrote these:—"40, Ebury Street, Monday, August 20th. Just arrived from Dartmouth. So sorry not to have heard from you. Please telegraph to me if I am not to come to-morrow.—From yours affectionately. If I don't hear from you I shall be with you between one and two o'clock. "—"August 30th, 1876. Dear Friend—I hope to hear from you soon. I am pretty well, and very admired, thanks to you. I will leave here Sunday, 9th September. Will you be in London about that time? If so, I will come next day after I arrive, Monday, or any other day that suits you best. Write and tell me how you get on. Have you seen Mrs. Turner yet? It is bitterly cold here, but fine. With very kind regards, I am, yours sincerely, C. M. Pearse. "I wrote a great number of letters in September, October, and November, asking to see her—I used to write to thank her, because she always used to ask me whenever anything was said about my being admired, to let her know, and naturally thinking that she was helping me for my father, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080034"/>
               <p>wrote those things to please her—it was not in consequence of the wash that I was admired, it was some powder she gave me to put on my arms and neck. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Dear Madame Rachel,—I find I won't be up in town till the 19th, so won't see you until the 20th. I made a great sen<lb/>sation at the ball, and was considered quite lovely, thanks to you. I have received a most kind letter from Mr. S. He wishes to see me personally about the concert, and encourages me to every hope of realising a good sum by it. Please write to me at the above address if you have any news. Have you seen Mrs. Turner, and has she seen C.—Yours most sincerely, C. M. P.") There are many letters which I have written to Madame Rachel addressing her as "Dear friend," and "Dear Madame Rachel," and subscribed. I also wrote several letters to Mrs. Turner on the same subject, in which I urged her to exert herself on the matter—the first con<lb/>versation about any fixed sum was the day that I had the rash out; I spoke to Madame Rachel, and something was said about the price I was to pay for finishing—I don't think that at that time I was under my doc<lb/>tor—I have not seen him for some time, two or three months, but I am seeing him now—Madame Rachel did not say that I had better have a medical certificate that I was well in health before she performed the pro<lb/>cess—she did say that she would prefer my having a medical certificate to see whether the application of the wash had done me any harm—I don't know why—it was not when the rash came out that she said she would like me to have a medical certificate—upon my oath it was not—it was before the rash came out—when the rash came out she said I was not to go to a doctor on any account—she looked me all over with a sort of little microscope thing, and said that all the pores of my skin were open—she said I must only use cold water, as anything else might ruin me—she told me not to use anything except cold water, not even soap—it was not then that she suggested I had better have a medical certificate—I had a bath when I took the jewels—I saw the bath prepared—I don't know what was put in—to me, it seemed only bran and water—I have no reason to sus<lb/>pect that anything else was put in—the rash was on my face, arms, and neck, and that necessitated a bath, so she told me, to cure it—I kept my face perfectly dry—I did what she told me—the action of the bran and the water was to be to bring the rash down—there was no requirement for me to take a number of baths—at this time my jewelers was in the house—I have sometimes obtained money upon jewellery, but I never authorised Madame Rachel to pawn these—she told me she had pledged the jewellery—I heard at the police-court that it was in my name—she has sold small things for me, in connection with acts of charity, and handed me over the money—she has sold things for me twice for a charity I am interested in—I entrusted her with things to sell that she sold for me, and handed over the money—one occa<lb/>sion was probably as late as last December—the letter to the pawnbroker was written on the Saturday at her house—the one relating to the jewel<lb/>lery was written a week before—the printed form was filled up in my own handwriting—I thought she could not read—I never saw her write—the jewels were taken to Madame Rachel's on a Saturday—the letter of Jan<lb/>uary 5th was written, I believe, on the day I had my bath—it was written from my own house—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters referring to the proposed concert were here read</hi>)—the last time I saw the defendant was the day I wrote the letter to the pawnbroker; that was on the Saturday—there had not been any</p>

               <p>arrangement that the jewels should be put in pawn before I wrote the letter marked "E"—I wrote a letter to the prisoner, which was to be placed in the hands of the lady who was to give the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know what has become of that letter, it was to tell her that I was bringing her the jewels for her to raise a sum of money—she said this lady would know me personally, and would take my own security, and that I was to give back the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I might take my jewels home—I understood she was to go and see the lady who would give her the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and send back my jewels; that conversation was on the Monday after the Saturday when I had the bath—no arrangement had been made before the Monday for pawning the jewels—I call giving them to the lady putting them in pawn—I had not seen a man before that about advancing the money—that was incorrect—I never had conversation with Madame Rachel about the loss of any jewellery—my husband was on the jury in the detective trial, and she spoke to me about the detective trial, not about the jewellery—she never said anything to me about jewellery, except on the occasion when I objected to pawning my own jewellery—I had heard of Lady Dudley's jewellery being stolen, but I and never had any conversation with the prisoner on the subject—Lady Dudley's jewellery being in her back-room was no business of mine—I was astonished to hear that Lady Dudley's jewels were in Madame Rachel's house; and then she explained that they had been brought by Lady Dudley's maid because Lady Dudley had to pay her 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for finishing her—that was the day I pledged my jewels to the pawnbroker, and she said "You make such a fuss about jewels worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when I have jewels in my house worth thousands"—she said 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward had been offered for them—I said my husband was on the detective trial, and I could not dine with her—she then jumped up and screamed, said she knew Froggatt, who was one of the prisoners, and that he was one of the conspirators, with Mr. George Lewis, against her—nothing was said about jewels in connection with that trial—I went with my husband to her after telling him about this, and my husband understood then that my acquaintance was only of three or four months' duration—subsequently, after going to Madame Rachel, my husband had a further explanation from me, and then we went together, a week after, on the Sunday.—I believe at that interview my husband mentioned Mr. George Lewis's name, just as we were going out of the door—the defendant did not then say that nothing would give her greater pleasure than to meet Mr. George Lewis in a Court of law—she did not say she was willing to return the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said that Mr. Lewis wanted to hang her, and she said a good deal all the way down stairs, but I believe she was abusing us, and not Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>

I insist upon your returning them to me at once"—she refused entirely, and said "So far from my owing your wife anything she owes me a large sum of money"—she showed me a letter in which the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was named—nothing further passed on that occasion except that she tried to talk about the use that she had been to my wife—I saw her again on the Tuesday or Wednesday—I told her from what I had further heard it was just what I had supposed, namely, a fraud, and I again demanded all the jewels and the letters—she then said that she was never alone, and that she had a witness who was listening, to prove that on the former occasion I had promised to pay her—she again tried to talk about the services which she had rendered to my wife, but I would not listen to that tale—I said that if she considered she had fairly earned 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the things which she had supplied to Mrs. Pearse, I would give her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the seller of messes—she then said that if I would bring my wife she was sure that she would make me believe that it was all right—I went away, saying that I would bring her—on that occasion she said that she had a witness to prove that on the former occasion I had promised to pay her 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any other sum which my wife might owe her—after that interview I had a letter purporting to come from her—I believe I burned it—I saw her again on the following Sunday—I took my wife with me—there was a repetition of her former statements with reference to the services which she had rendered, and she made an offer to go on with the process—I refused, and then said that that was the last time that she would have a chance of treating with me—I said I should go to a solicitor—I did not mention his name; I had no one in my mind at that time—she said I could not do so because the letters which she held of my wife's were such as could not be produced—she gave me to understand that I should not dare to have them published, and added that she had been on the most intimate terms with my wife for nearly two years, knew all my friends, and all the members of my family and a great deal of their personal affairs—when we were going down<lb/>stairs she said she would make the City ring with it—she said she knew every friend I had—there was nothing further then—I saw her again before I went to Mr. Lewis—I saw her the morning after I saw Mr. Lewis—one of my clerks told me she had been sitting in the office an hour—she then showed me Mr. Lewis's letter, and said "What is this about Lady Dudley's jewels?" and that it was very unfair mentioning this, as it was said in confidence—I said that the whole thing was now in Mr. Lewis's hands—she then said she would give up all the letters conditionally if I went up to Great Portland Street—she said that Mr. Lewis had made up his mind to ruin her, hang her, I think she said; and that she would do anything rather than face him—I saw her again either that evening or the next—when she spoke about giving me the letters I said I would go and see her—I said I had come for the letters—she said "What, give them up and put myself in the hands of that man?"—I stated she must trust to my word that no further steps should be taken if the letters were given up—it ended in my going away without anything—she refused to give the letters up—she said they were "compromising"—she said "I have got letters of your</p>

There are at least 30 compounds of lead—in this case part of it was in solution, and part of it was at the bottom of the bottle—the lead in the solution was chloride of lead—as to the in<lb/>soluble portion of the lead, I cannot say exactly in what form it was, but it was in an insoluble form—altogether I had to analyse not more than 2 oz.—that would be about a third of a 6 oz. bottle—the lead not in solu<lb/>tion was very small in quantity—there was not a great deal of difference as to the proportions—the soluble was 3.8 grains, the insoluble 5.3 grains, making 9.1 grains—there was more insoluble than soluble—from what I analysed that would be the proportion of a 6 oz. bottle—the smaller quantity was soluble, and the larger quantity was chloride of lead—the larger quantity I would define as an insoluble form of lead, but I found chloride of lead as well as hydrochloric acid—Godfrey and Cooke have two shops, in Conduit Street and St. George's Place—the firm has now</p>

               <p>been established about 200 years—they have a great number of very valuable nostrums—I distinguish hydrochloric acid from chloride of lead in this way: in the first place the solution which was separated was dis<lb/>tinctly acid; but chloride of lead would be neutral in solution—Goulard water is sold as a wash, and sold by Godfrey and Cooke—I don't know exactly how much load there is in Goulard water, quite ten times as much as this—it is used for women's skin occasionally—the defendant applied to have some of the wash for analysis by Professor Redwood—I declined, because there was none left, the quantity I had beings small; hut I offered to submit my analysis to any qualified person—Professor Redwood is the very best authority on that point.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 50, Parliament Street, Westminster—I am F. R. C. S. and surgeon to the Westminster Hospital; lecturer also on forensic medicine at the hospital—I have heard the evidence of the last witness—if a wash of the description mentioned were applied to a lady's face it would cause great roughness of the skin, and I believe it would bring out an eruption if applied sufficiently often—the hydrochloric acid would produce the roughness of the skin—a wash of this description is a stimulating wash, and also irritating, and it cannot be applied to a lady's face unless she has a very bad skin disease—it certainly cannot properly be applied to a lady's neck—it would not have the effect of removing the hair—the intrinsic value of a bottle of stuff of this sort would be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the outside—Goulard water is a very common lotion.</p>

For internal administration one would take about 15 minims of dilute hydrochloric acid, which would contain rather over a grain of hydrochloric acid—that is about the dose, the ordinary dilution of the acid—about 6 grains in an 8 oz. bottle would be a tonic to be drunk—it could not well be taken in a more concentrated form than that I have given—if 6 grains were in 8 ounces of water as a drink you would drink about one-sixth of it—in that way it is recom<lb/>mended as a drink in hot weather, but not so strong, I think—I should give about half a drachm, or about 3 grains in a pint for a person to drink as a refreshing draught—I don't know whether acetic acid is frequently used by ladies for the purpose of decoration—I have no doubt that all the "toilette vinegars" sold in London are acetic acid—hydrochloric acid is irritating, but acetic acid is soothing—fuller's earth, with starch in com<lb/>bination, would not be irritating—hydrochloric acid, with starch in com<lb/>bination, would not be soothing.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Lewis and Lewis, of Ely Place—on the 24th of January in the present year I was consulted by Mr. and Mrs. Pearse on this case—I ultimately instituted proceedings against the defendant at the Marlborough Street police-court on summons—before the committal of the prisoner I acted for Mr. Pearse, but the Treasury took up the proceedings—Mr. Blanchard Wontner, who is now instructing Mr. Day, defended the prisoner at the police-court—I recollect at the third hearing Mr. Wontner making a statement with reference to Lady Dudley—he said that he did so at the request of the prisoner, and he desired to state that Lady Dudley had never been in Madame Rachel's shop, neither had the prisoner any acquaintanceship with her ladyship, and in unqualified terms he wished it to be known that Madame Rachel had never in any way attended upon or supplied any washes to Lady Dudley, and that statement Mr. Wontner repeated a second time after Lord Dudley arrived in Court—Mr. Wontner also, at the same time, made a further statement of the prisoner's explanation of her conversation with Mrs. Pearse with reference to the Dudley jewels—he stated that Madame Rachel denied that she had ever stated to Mrs. Pearse that the Countess of Dudley's jewels had been brought to her house—her explanation of the Countess of Dudley's name being mentioned arose in this way, that Mr. Pearse was upon the Jury in the detective case, and that Madame Rachel said to Mr. Pearse that one of the persons accused could give information with reference to the Countess of Dudley's jewels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor at the Institute of Pharmacy to the Pharmaceutical Society, and have been so more than 30 years—I have studied chemistry all my life—I have been in consultation with Mr. Senior—we conferred together as to the probable mode in which the lotion of Madame Rachel was made—we made an analysis—we found 10 grains of carbonate of load, 50 grains of fuller's earth, 160 grains of starch, 24 grains of hydrochloric acid, and six ounces of distilled water, making up a 16-ounce mixture—two of the constituents would enter into combination to form the chloride of lead—part would remain as free hydrochloric acid—as to the effect of such a mixture applied to the skin, so far as the lead is concerned, it would be the same as that produced by extract of load, which acts as an astringent and desiccant, and is commonly used for allaying irritation on the surface of the skin—the fuller's earth possesses detergent properties—starch is an absorbent, and is frequently used—salts of lead are frequently used as lotions, perhaps none more frequently, and I do not consider their use dangerous—as to the lotion I have described, the result to be looked for would not be the bringing out of a rash upon the skin—I applied it to my own arm—I did not find any such result—as it dries, the starch and fuller's earth and chloride of lead tend to whiten the skin—the result was only the effect of whitening of the skin as the lotion dried—I am 68 years of age—in a 6 oz. bottle of Goulard water there would be about 30 grains of lead—as to the effect upon the skin, in connection with the chloride, I judge by inference in saying that its effect would be the same as that of the acetate—what is called toilet vinegar is a mixture of acetic acid,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080044"/>
               <p>diluted with water, and scented—the mixture would not perhaps be so strong as Rim ell's vinegar—toilet vinegar would probably have a stronger action than the lotion about which we have heard—I know pearl white, which is a name for carbonate of lead—it is habitually used by ladies for whitening the skin—it frequently is applied as a powder—it is quite insoluble—it is not put on the face to cool it, rather to whiten it—the deposit would be whitehead—it is put on the face to produce a temporary effect—the undue or continued use of cosmetics of that description are more or less injurious—anything which fills up the pores of the skin is injurious—the use of the ordinary violet powder is much better left alone—soap and water and nothing else is the best—I do not consider pearlash with ordinary water a dangerous hair wash, unless it is very strong—I believe the best hair wash is an alkaline solution of that kind—I frequently conduct analyses for the Government in poisoning cases—hydrochloric acid is a liquid—it could not exist as a powder to be shaken out of a paper. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. A wash of that description would not in the slightest degree remove hair—dilute acetic acid rather softens the skin—hydrochloric acid is not used as an application to the skin—I am unable to say, therefore, how it would affect the skin—I have no experience of its effects—I applied it to my arm—I am not prepared to say that the application of wash to a delicate lady's skin would not produce a rash, but I should be very much surprised to find that it did—I have never known it applied to a lady's skin; there are certain idio<lb/>syncrasies, some persons possess a skin which would be irritated by almost any application, especially if any irritation were anticipated—imagination has often much to do with it—I don't mean to say that imagination would produce a rash on my face, but I believe the mere ap<lb/>plication of soap and water would do so with some persons—soap is an alkaline which would act on and irritate the skin quite as much as the dilute hydrochloric acid referred to, and for that reason many persons cannot use soap—I don't mean that a lady, under those circumstances, would bring out a rash—soap is an irritant, and imagination with a slight irritant may produce much that an irritant without the imagination would not—I can understand a beneficial effect from a wash of this kind where there is an ammoniacal emanation from the skin, the acid would neutralise that—I agree with the Countess of Dudley's maid that soap and water only are the best things—this lotion might be properly used in a skin disease, or where an abnormal state of the skin existed—this lotion would not act as an irritant if there were any ammoniacal effect on the skin.</p>

                  </hi>, Q. C. I am Recorder of Liverpool, and live at 64, Queen's Gardens, Bayswater—on the evening of 7th March I re<lb/>ceived this letter—I had given the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a fortnight before, on account of Lord Howard of Glossop—I have been acting as a friend of Lord Howard in the matter—I first saw the prisoner on Easter Sunday, 1877, or else the Saturday before, at a monastic establishment called Mount St. Bernard, in Leicestershire—he was working there as a gardener, but not living there—I told him that Lord Howard had asked me to come and see him, and that I had been informed by Lord and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080060"/>
               <p>Lady Howard of numbers of things which he had done, and that if I had had the entire guidance of the matter I would not have done anything for him, but I found that Lady Howard had some time before made an ar<lb/>rangement with him, under which he had been working there, his wages being paid by Lord Howard—he said that he did not know that before but that he suspected it, that he was tired of being there and would stay there no longer, that Lord Howard had unjustly dismissed him a number of years before from his situation as gardener, when he expected to be made head gardener, and that he had been given in custody on a charge of cutting some vines, and had lost eight years of his life, and had been brooding over it ever since, and that Lord Howard was bound to get him head gardener to the Duke of Norfolk, or Lord Bute, or Mr. De Lisle, or to pay him 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "You know that you confessed to Lady Howard some time ago that you have for some time been writing or causing to be written anonymous letters to Lord Howard, his agent, and neighbours; "(I think I mentioned the name of Canon Tasker)" and that you have done a number of acts against Lord Howard's property for which you might have been criminally proceeded against, but Lady Howard and her family take a considerable interest in you and your family, and they think you must have taken some extraordinary notions into your head about your treatment; Lord Howard is in a very low state of health, and Lady How<lb/>ard does not wish him to be annoyed any more, and they are willing to continue the payment which you have been hitherto receiving, giving you permission, instead of remaining at Mount St. Bernard, to go wherever you like, provided only that they are kept informed as to where you are and what you are doing"—he declined to make any arrangement, except on the conditions that he was made head gardener to some nobleman or gentleman, or had 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given him—I said "You will be much better off with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and your own time and labour free, than you will be in any situation, even if you keep it," and I pointed out to him that he would probably lose it almost immediately he got it, on account of his temper; and that it was truly impossible Lord Howard could recommend him to any gentleman without telling him the whole story, in which case nobody would take him; and I think I said that the Duke of Norfolk knew the story already and certainly would not take him—the interview then ter<lb/>minated—he came again to me next day to the Monastery and said that he was willing to make an arrangement—he still asserted that he had a right to be made head gardener to somebody or have 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he signed this paper in my presence, but the gentleman who wrote it says that he did not, but that he signed it and gave it to me afterwards—I did not see him for some time afterwards, when he spoke not of this paper but of another—I had drawn up a duplicate of the second, and sent it to the Rev. Mr. Sisk, of Manchester, by post, and by return of post received the duplicate back signed by the prisoner—[ spoke to him about it, and discussed it very fully a year afterwards at Liverpool—the signatures are both in the same writing—he had agreed to enter into an arrangement, which was shortly discussed and embodied in this document, to the effect that he should have 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week on condition of his good behaviour, and invariably receiving it through some person known to Lord Howard, either a banker or solicitor, at any place where he might choose to reside; and I stipulated that he should not attempt to live on it, but should save it and support himself by getting a situation—I saw him again one Sun<lb/>day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080061"/>
               <p>last February at Birkenhead, during the Liverpool Assizes, and asked him why he had not drawn any money under the arrangement, and why he had left Mount St. Bernard leaving a considerable sum of money in the hands of Mr. Sisk—he said that the arrangement was a paltry one, and he would not condescend to accept anything under it, and asked to have 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or be made head gardener to the Duke of Norfolk—I told him he would be much better off with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with his time and labour free—he was very violent in his demeanour rather than his lan<lb/>guage, and went away saying that he would not accept anything—I told him that he would be sure to come back in a week, and in a week he did come back—I found him waiting at the door of my Court—he followed me to the hotel, and said that he had made up his mind to take the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and live on it—I told him he would be very foolish if he lived on it, I thought he had much better work and save the money—he said he thought he would go to America, where he had been before—I said I thought that would be much the best thing; and if he did that I would advise Lord Howard to make him an advance on the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to maintain himself when he got there—I asked him how much he wanted—he said he thought 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said he might have anything he liked, for, although he had not fulfilled the conditions of the agreement, Lord Howard would not take advantage of that; and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wrote down my address in London—he almost recited the terms of the arrangement on paper "C," and he was to write to me—I received a letter from him on 27th or 28th February—I believe it to be in the same writing as his signature—I did not answer it, and received a second, dated 5th March—I then wrote to him—I have no coppy of my letter. (<hi rend="italic">Notice to produce this letter was here proved as being served on the prisoner by Andrew Lans<lb/>down on 5th April</hi>.) I said in my letter, "Sir, I did not answer your first letter because I had so often answered in conversation with you the questions you put to me; Lord Howard does not intend to get you a situa<lb/>tion for the reasons I have so often given you before. He is, however, desirous of assisting you to the utmost of his power within the terms of the arrangement which was made with you about a year ago, and which we have discussed several times. I can't help again pointing out to you that you would be much better off with the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week which was arranged for, and your time and labour at your own disposal, than you could possibly be in any situation." That was the substance of the letter—the next letter, the subject of this indictment, was delivered by post at my house, and I handed it to Lord Howard.</p>

He complained that he had been dismissed from Lord Howard's service and had been improperly charged with doing malicious damage to Lord Howard's property—I asked him whether Lord Howard was personally responsible for that, he said "No"—he was not dis<lb/>respectful or violent to me but he was emotionally violent—when I spoke to him at Liverpool, he came in consequence of a message from me—I sent for him, as Lord Howard had informed me that he had left the convent using very violent language, and it was reported that he had used very violent language at Birkenhead—Lord Howard was in a deli<lb/>cate state of health at that time and under medical treatment—I had told the prisoner that Lord Howard was ill, but it was a year afterwards that he wrote "It will be the happiest day of my life when I hear of Howard's death."</p>

               <p>for a sum of money who would undertake to do it, and at last he found a man who had been in Kirkdale Gaol some time, who consented for a good sum of money to do the thing, and he was very flush of money, having been betting at the races, that he gave it to the man, and they went down together to the neighbourhood of Glossop to see how they could put their plan in execution, and it was a very fine plot, and he was to cut the vines and the other man was to shoot Lord Howard, and they concealed them<lb/>selves behind the bushes and watched for him to come out; that the man was armed with a gun, but Lord Howard did not appear; that they saw two young ladies coming on the terrace and concluded that Lord Howard was not there, and the dinner hour of the gardener was near, and the man thought it was not fair for him to do nothing, so he went and cut the vines, and he would have cut them all if he had not been afraid of the gardeners coming—there was a second cutting of the vines in August, 1875—I asked him who did the vine-cutting about the 1st—he said that he had done it—I said "Did you do it yourself?"—he said "Yes, I did," and then he drew himself up, and said "No, the other man did it"—I am speaking now of the more recent cutting—he then told me a long rambling story about having joined the American army, and that he had deserted and was obliged to be in hiding for fear of being shot as a deserter, and had suffered an immense deal from starvation and fell ill with brain fever, and there was a change in him, he got weak in his head and his hair turned grey, and all that was Lord Howard's doing—he got very much excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He showed violence towards Lord Howard, but he was perfectly respectful to me—he admitted that Lord Howard and I had been very kind to him and his family—this long conversation took place at Garrington Park—I went there on purpose to have the interview—I thought that having known him in his childhood and my family having done so much for his parents I might have some influence—before the end of the interview he became calmed down and, to some extent, re<lb/>pentant—he did not say that he did not mean any harm to Lord Howard—he said that he had in the past meant harm to him—he promised amend<lb/>ment for the future—I have known him from a child—I was a child my<lb/>self at that time—he was perfectly well-conducted as long as he was at Garrington and was in my father's employment—he came to Glossop as gardener I think in 1867, and remained two or three years—the head gardener who was there when he came was an old man, and he retired on a pension about three months after Shehan came—I forget whether Scott immediately took his place, perhaps Bradley came first, I know there were two head gardeners—I am of opinion that the police treated him with a good deal of harshness by handcuffing him, and I am sorry for him—he was at St. Bernard just a year—I was abroad when he left but I heard of it shortly afterwards.</p>

Glossop Hall is one of my seats, and I occasionally live there—in August, 1867, I engaged the prisoner as gardener—I had heard that he had previously worked on Lady Howard's estate, and he was recommended to me from there—my head gardener was about to retire—to the best of my recollection I held out a hope to the prisoner of being head gardener on a reduced establishment—I engaged him for one or two months at 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to see whether it pleased him and he pleased me—I subsequently found he was not up to the business, and in</p>

I am managing clerk to Gask and Gask—I received this cheque from a clerk; it was paid to our bankers and returned—on 10th February I went to Lewis at 74A, Southwark Bridge Road, saw him, showed him the cheque, and said "Is this your signature?" pointing to the endorsement "Geo. Lewis"—he said "No; but I think I know whose signature it is"—I asked him to tell me, he said "I can't tell you," or "I prefer not telling you"—I said "Who is Smith?"—he said "I do not know"—I said "Where does Pitman live?"—he said "Stamford Street"—I said "Gask and Gask sold a costume and this cheque was paid for it"—he seemed surprised, and said "I do not know anything about it"—I said "Did you buy it?"—he said "No"—I left and went again three or four weeks afterwards, and asked Lewis who purchased the goods, he said "A man named Wright"—I said "Had he any authority to use</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist, living at 19, Fouden Road, Stoke Newington—in May, 1877, I inserted an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> to obtain a loan of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">Park Road, Dalston, May</hi> 21, 1877, <hi rend="italic">asking the witness to call at that address</hi>.) On receiving the letter I called to see the prisoner at 24, Park Road—there was a plate on the door, "Mrs. Dobson, Governess, patronised by Royalty," or something like that—I did not see the prisoner then—I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the same address, dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and made an appointment to call on the witness at</hi> 9 p.m.; <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson</hi>.") The prisoner called on me soon afterwards, and said that he represented Mr. Dobson—he asked me how much I wanted, for what purposes, and what security I could give—I asked him what interest would be necessary, and I told him I could give him the deeds of an intended partnership—he proposed that I should give him a life policy of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him f would do so—he said that was satisfactory, and I should hear from him again—I subsequently received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th June, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson" and said</hi> "My representative will wait on you and settle matters to-night at 7 p.m.") The prisoner again called on me—he told me he had called on a friend of mine whom I had mentioned to him, but had not suggested that he should call, that he found everything was satisfactory, and he should be able to give me the loan I required upon the security of the deed of partnership and the life policy—I saw him again, and he said I should have the money at 5 per cent.—he asked me to give him a bill of sale—I refused—he said that he was satisfied, and produced a receipt for 2 guineas, saying that it was necessary to settle that first—I paid it to him—that was to pay for the documents—he went away, and I did not see him again—I wrote seven or eight letters, and I called at 24, Park Road two or three times—a woman opened the door—I was told he was never to be seen—I subse<lb/>quently received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the same address, and was dated</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">and signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">E. A. Dobson</hi>," <hi rend="italic">and said</hi>, "I am wait<lb/>ing to hear from Mr. Gray in answer to my note some days since.") This letter was also sent to my intended partner, and was handed to me—there is no date to it: "Re Loan. Private. Sir,—Yours to hand. Bill of sale on your furniture will be prepared. Please to say when you can be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080070"/>
               <p>waited on for the inventory to be taken. Yours faithfully, Edward A. Dobson." It was addressed to Mr. Gray—it is the prisoner's writing—I also received this letter, dated 10th July, 1877, in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that, as the witness could not give the bill of sale, two responsible persons would be required to join him, and on his doing so the matter would be proceeded with; signed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">Edward A. Dobson</hi>.") Also this one, dated August <hi rend="italic">4</hi>, 1877. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Edward A. Dobson, and expressed some surprise that the witness should demand a return of the</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">guineas, as the prisoner had taken so much trouble in the matter as an agent, and that his solicitor would defend any proceedings the witness might take</hi>.) This document was written by the prisoner in my presence: "Hawthorn Villa, 24, Park Road, Dalston. Advance 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., terms (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) 5 1/2 percent. interest per annum; valuation 2 guineas; no other costs; bill of sale unregistered." I advanced the 2 guineas because I believed the prisoner's statement that he was a financial agent carrying on a <hi rend="italic">bonâ fide</hi> business—the words "financial agent" are on all his letters—I believed him when he stated that he represented Edward Dobson—I never got back the 2 guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I never deposited the deed of partnership nor the policy of insurance, nor executed the bill of sale—the document I saw the prisoner write was not drawn when I paid him the 2 guineas, but on the first or second interview before I paid it—I referred to Mr. Hinton, a printer and stationer in Shoreditch, and the prisoner called on him—I was in business with Mr. Gray some years ago, and intended to take him as a partner—that is what I wanted the loan for—I did not put the prisoner in communication with him, but I mentioned him as my intended partner—the receipt was similar to this form: "Received of (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) the sum of 2 guineas, the whole cost of attending negotiation of loan, the sum being returned if business declined by us." I have lost the receipt—I said I would not give the bill of sale before I gave the prisoner the 2 guineas—the prisoner led me to suppose Dobson would lend the money.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">upon the Alliance Bank, for two guineas, signed "Chas. F.

I did not get the money and began to look the matter up, but I could not find the prisoner—I saw him once, when he wanted security on the plant, which I gave him—I then received this letter of 4th September, 1877. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Edward A. Dobson</hi>," <hi rend="italic">asking for the name of the person affording additional</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">security</hi>.)

I would not have sold my copyright for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never told him that the circulation of my paper was equal to the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazetts</hi>—I did say we looked to the advertisements to pay us—he expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the security of the paper—he did not ask for a bill of sale on it—I told him I had a small charge on the plant of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he could have security on the plant—he did not mention the London and Westminster Loan Company—I never knew of his want<lb/>ing personal security till I got his letter.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were headed</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">Park Road, Dalston, and signed E. A. Dobson</hi>.) "10th September, 1877. Dear Sir,—Re 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. My brother's report is quite satis<lb/>factory. Be good enough to hand the bearer 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the cost of agreement. This is the only cost in your matter. No further expenses." I handed him the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "13th September. Dear Sir,—I find that it will be Monday next before I can give you a final answer to your matter. On that day shall write or call on you." "23rd September, 1877. Dear Sir,—I should have written you sooner but did not get my client's reply until this afternoon. It seems they would much prefer your giving a respon<lb/>sible person as guarantee that your stock will be kept up to the value as security for the capital advanced. If you will, therefore, be good enough to let me have the name and address at once of some responsible person I will hasten the negotiation all I can as your agent in this matter. I assure you that I have left no stone unturned to get the loan done, but, from inquiries I have made, they seem to consider a guarantee</p>

               <p>requisite to the perfection of the security deeds. If you get it at once it will save further delay.

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, of 89, Islington Green—in October last I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a partner—I received this letter:—"24, Park Road, Dalston. 18th October, 1877. Sir—Should you prefer borrowing capital for a term of years at 5 1/2 per cent. I should be happy to see you here at once on the subject. Yours truly, E. A. Dobson." I went to the address and saw the prisoner—I asked if he was Dobson—he said "Yes"—I saw a plate with "Mr. Dobson's Office" on it and one on the door, "Mrs. Dobson," and on the window were the words "Auctioneer and Estate Agent"—the prisoner asked me if I wanted money or a partner—I said "I want a partner"—he said "I can obtain it for you"—I said "I have no security to give you"—he said "Have you a lease?"—I said "I have a lease of my premises"—he said "That is something; I see no difficulty in obtaining money for you"—I suggested 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could be advanced, and there would be four guineas to pay for taking the inventory and preparing the agreement and the full negotiation—I said "Why do you want the money first?"—he said "It was simply to make it binding"—I said "I have an inventory taken"—he said "Then we shall not want to take another, that will save you a guinea"—I aid "Why do you want three guineas?"—he said "Sometimes people come to me and ask for money, and after I have been to the trouble of endeavouring to get it for them they say owing to some circumstances they do not want it and I have my trouble for nothing, therefore I must have three guineas, which will be returned if you do not get your money"—I asked him or a memorandum, which he gave me—I said I would consider the matter—he said he knew gentlemen who instructed him to find safe investments for their money, and he considered my business was a safe and good investment, and that I could afford to give him 6 per cent. and he would pay five, so that would pay him one per cent. for his trouble—I had several other letters, and I made an appointment for Monday evening, 22nd October, when I went to his house, and on the advice of my friend I parted with my three guineas, and on the Tuesday he called on me and I handed him the inventory—he gave me a receipt which stated that the three guineas would be returned "if business declined by us"—I saw the prisoner again the same evening after receiving this letter. <hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My brother has reported the matter of his visit as to 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This can be carried out at once. My brother will be with you between five and six o'clock this evening." These letters passed between us after paying the three guineas, which I paid believing his statements: "27th October, 1877. Dear Sir,—It would be quite Thursday next before I can get an answer from my client. I shall then call on you or write to you." He did not call."30th October. Dear Sir,—My clients</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080073"/>
               <p>require some further security in some shape or form. Be good enough to let me know if you can get this." I called to see him but could not. "13th November. I am much surprised at your conduct on Saturday evening"—that refers to my calling with a friend and threatening pro<lb/>ceedings—I could not see him, but I left word. (<hi rend="italic">The letter went on to state the large business the prisoner was doing with the London and West<lb/>minster Loan Company, and asked for another person to join the witness as security</hi>.) I again advertised, when I received another letter from the prisoner dated 7th December, stating that if I preferred borrowing capital to taking a partner he would see me privately—through the advice of a friend I did not do so.</p>

Dobson." "27th November, 1877.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife and live in Great Camden Street, St. Pancras—on Wednesday night, 13th March, about 8 o'clock, I and my husband went out—we returned about 11 o'clock; we went upstairs and sat down by the side of the fire, the children were lying on a couch in the room; we have two rooms, one leading into the other—my husband passed into the back room for a minute, he then returned, looked round, and took hold of the back of the chair I was sitting on and tilted me into the fire, but instead of falling into the fire I fell on the back of the fender—I said "Oh, William, don't do that"—he said "Now you b—b—, there is no witness here now, you b—, I will do for you;" no sooner the words he turned round and instantly took up the tongs, with which he began hammering into my head and all over my body; I was bruised from head to foot, my eyes were blacked and my nose cut—after receiving about four or five blows I fell and do not remember anything afterwards; when I came to myself I was sitting in a chair with the doctors and police round me—all the six children were in the room, but only one was awake—my husband and I had not had any words that evening, we were quite comfortable, for a wonder.</p>

I am a meat salesman, of 49, Central Meat Market—I was walking in the High Road, near Bruce Grove, and saw the waggons—Henson was in the first waggon, standing up and urging the horses along by thrashing them and shouting out to them—the waggoner behind was also doing the same, trying to pass the first waggon—I went into the middle of the road, held up my umbrella, and said, "Steady, steady, you stupid fellows!"—they were going about 10 miles an hour, as I judged, going very fast for a short distance—they passed me—they continued shouting and driving fast as before—I saw some persons trying to stop them—there was a general excitement on the path—I saw the old man knocked down, and the two off wheels of the waggon pass over the middle of his body—I was about 10 or 15 yards from them—I should think Henson's waggon was pulled up within 20 feet beyond him—there was a separation of about 10 feet between the two waggons—when they stopped, the body of the deceased was between the two waggons—the hind one pulled up before it came to him—I spoke to both the drivers afterwards, and they were quite sobers—when I raised my um<lb/>brella I think the man in the second waggon did tighten his reins—I don't know whether the first driver noticed me—he did not pull up until he had run over the man.</p>

I was from 70 to 100 yards from the first waggon when I first saw them going in the same direction—they over<lb/>took A me—they were then 60 or 70 yards from the deceased—I do not think Henson saw me, he was too excited watching the waggon behind—Henson was undoubtedly exciting his horses when he passed me—I can't say whether the shouting was to the old man or his horses.</p>

The horses in the first van were a tandem, in the other they were abreast—I continued running by the side of them—when I first saw them King was sitting down in the waggon and some other man was driving, who was with him—I then saw King take the reins and the whip from the other, and then he continued driving—he tried to pull up and did pull up.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a clerk to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a dyer—I lend money occasionally—the prisoner came to me to borrow 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in February 1876—I required him to make a statutory declaration—he offered me as security the furniture at 2, John Street, Bedford Row—I saw the furniture, and he supplied me with an inventory, and made the declaration, the form of which I supplied—he sent it me by post—I knew nothing then of the claim of the Trustees of Settlement, nor of any transaction with Mr. Stevenson or Mr. Chambers; he also made another declaration on the 3rd August—these are the bill of sale, inventory, and declarations—the inventory is in Graham's writing—he asked me not to register the bill of sale, as it would ruin him—it was renewed at 21 days, and made continuous—he asked me to allow him to remove the furniture to Kelsall Lodge, and I consented—I first heard of a previous charge on 26th May, 1877, when Mr. Stevenson came into possession—I paid 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including charges.</p>

I did not take proceedings on 26th May because Graham was in Holloway Prison, and Mr. Maynard told me if I brought a charge against him it would be said I did it for the purpose of closing the prisoner's mouth—I sold out the furniture at Kelsall Lodge—that person (Mrs. Clark) was there as a servant—I did not leave his wife in an almost dying condition, with nothing to lie on—most of the furniture had been cleared out before by the landlord and for rates and taxes—I did not leave Mrs. Graham and four or five children without clothes, blankets, or bed—the beds and blankets had been taken away—I sold what was left—I did not tell my men to smash up a dozen seltzer-water bottles—I have received altogether from the prisoner 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down to the sale—he paid the first loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I advanced money on 13th November, 1876—he also paid another bill of sale for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I realised 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the sale at Kelsall Lodge, and 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his furniture in Poultry—the furniture was taken to Hollingsworth's after 6 in the even<lb/>ing, because we are not allowed to take it away in the day-time—it was not taken in the middle of the night—I saw the men there at 6 o'clock—I have still some securities, including some deeds which are valueless—Mr. Maynard holds them—these are the deeds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also realised 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill of exchange—I have another bill for 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also the lease of Kelsall Lodge and several dishonoured cheques—I have not sued on them—they are post dated—I took them knowing they were post dated—I know nothing of the advertisement of "Money lent without security to male or female at 111, Newington Causeway," nor the branch office, 117, Caledonian Road—I never paid a Mr. Cox any commission—I now claim 234<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I claimed 780<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against Mr. Appleby's estate, who was tried at this Court for a bankruptcy fraud—my claim was not reduced to 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to a bill of sale, which was allowed—I cannot give you particulars, I have not the papers—I appealed to the Lords Justices, who upheld Mr. Spring Rice in his decision against me—I was tried at this Court for conspiring with Appleby, and ac<lb/>quitted—I deducted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest out of the first loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other loans—I bought the prisoner's furniture for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let it</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 137, Blue Anchor Road, Bermondsey—in 1863 I met Hill and the prisoner and we went to the Bird in Hand, Long Acre, where the Hearts of Oak Benefit Society was held—the person I thought to be be the secretary, told the prisoner that the committee had assembled, and asked him to go upstairs—he went up and asked me and Mr. Hill up—Mr. Hill was asked into the room, and asked whether his two friends could be admitted—the secretary said "Yes," and we stepped in, and after that we were asked to withdraw for a few minutes—we were afterwards called in again, and Mr. Clark told the committee the position he was in with the person he was living with; that she was about to become a mother, and asked whether he was justified in receiv<lb/>ing the money—the secretary said "Yes," but if his wife turned up they should not consider any claim that he made.</p>

If I hear my name mentioned again I will come up again," but he did not come up—my husband afterwards went into the street—the prisoner works in the kitchen close to the window—as he went out he said "Pay me what you owe me"—I did not hear any more—between 12 and 1 o'clock I saw my husband talking to a policeman and thought he was coming up to get his dinner—he came back several times but did not come upstairs—I went downstairs and saw him lying on the pavement and the prisoner was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 74, Kellett Road, Brixton—I formed the prisoner's acquaintance eighteen months ago, she was a domestic servant in the same road—I was in the habit for some time of going out with her, and there was a close intimacy between us which ceased in April, 1877—I was at home on 24th March, 1878, about 9.30, and there was a knock at the door—my servant opened it and I went out and saw the prisoner in the passage—I said "What do you want?"—she said "I want to speak to you"—I said "You had better get out"—she made a rush at me—I took hold of her by both arms and put her completely outside the door—I let go of her to shut the door and she put her knee in and I could not shut it—I opened it to give her a push and saw the gleam of something in her right hand and felt my throat touched—I took hold of her arm, turned it up, and saw that it was a razor, open—there was blood on it, and then I knew that I was cut—I took it from her, and said "You will have to go to the police-station"—I took her there myself—on the way she said "What have I done? Let me go and I will never trouble you again"—a constable overtook us and I gave her into his charge, with the razor—when we got to the station I put my hand to my chin and found I was bleeding—a doctor was sent for who dressed my wound—she has called at my house on several occa<lb/>sions and asked to see me, and I have shut the door and told her to go away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The wound is perceptible now—I have known her about two years very intimately—I was not on good terms with her as late as February this year, not at all after April—I cannot positively swear whether I went to Thames Ditton with her in June—she has been trying to frighten me because I formed the acquaintance of <hi rend="italic">another lady</hi>—I pushed her out on to the flags in front of the house, and we eventually struggled in the road—I lost a great quantity of blood—I had hold of her going to the station—I believe there were men lodgers in the house where she was.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am divisional surgeon to the police at Brixton—I was sent for to the station and found the prosecutor suffering from an incised wound in the upper part of his neck, about 3 inches long, passing from the centre downwards—it was a superficial wound, one likely to bleed a great deal, but not dangerous except from its situation—it went within three-quarters of an inch of the carotid artery—the under tissues were slightly divided—it was a clean incised wound by a sharp instrument—the bleeding had partially stopped when I arrived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Any wound dividing the skin would bleed freely—he was quite well in three days—it healed very rapidly.</p>
