               <p>Counc. Was any Application made to you to quit the King's Service, for any other?</p>
               <p>Hough. I did not think proper to leave my King and Country, to serve the King of Prussia, but I have had great Encouragement to do it.</p>
               <p>Connc. From whom, and when?</p>
               <p>Hough. About the Beginning of last August, or the latter End of the other Month, (it was last August) one Carrol came to my House, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170003"/> asked me to take a Walk with him; I refused him at first, because my Wife was ill a-bed: He came again in the Afternoon of the same Day, and likewise the next Day; I then went with him, and he carry'd me to a publick House at the Back of the Royal Exchange, I believe 'twas to the Sign of the Horseshoe. After we had drank together, he told me he would fetch a Gentleman who would speak with me, and accordingly he went out, and in a few Minutes he brought in one Anderson, who shook Hands with me, drank my Health, and ask'd me if I had any Desire to go Abroad? I told him, no. Then he asked me it I had dined? I told him I had not: Upon which he sent Carrol for some Beef Stakes, and in the eating them he told me, I was a likely young Man, and would do very well for the King of Prussia, and that his Service was much better than the King of England's. After we had din'd plentifully, he drank a Health to a particular Person on the other Side the Water, and we parted for that Time; but Anderson and I met several Times after this, and he having promis'd me some Work for him, as a Taylor I went to his House in Crown Court, in Crown Alley, Upper Moorfields, and spoke to him about it: He told me, he would send me some Cloth to make up for him; but, says he, I know a Gentleman that wants to speak with you, and if you'll go to the Royal Exchange, and sit down on the Bench, I will meet you a Quarter after Twelve. I went thither, and waited a good while; at last the Prisoner came up to me, and asked me if I was not waiting for one Anderson, I told him yes; he then took me to the Cross Keys Tavern, where I found Anderson, and we had a Fowl and Bacon dress'd for Dinner, and drank several Bottles together. After we had drank plentifully, the Prisoner told me, Carrol had used me ill, in not delivering me the Cloth which Anderson desired I might make up for him, but I do assure you, (says he) you shall have whatever Anderson has promis'd you; and pulling a Sheet of Paper out of his Pocket, he gave it into my Hand, saying, - here is my Master's broad Seal, and this is his own Hand writing: His Master (he said) was the King of Prussia, and that was his Power to enlist all Men who were willing to go, and none else. At the Bottom of the Paper he shew'd me the White Horse, which is Part of the King of England's Arms. What the Contents of the Paper were I cannot tell, for I could not read it: I am but a poor Scholar, and cannot read English, unless it be wrote very plain.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Day was it when he produced that Paper?</p>
               <p>Hough. It was in the Beginning of August, but I cannot tell the Day exactly. The next Day we met at Guild-hall Coffeehouse, and agreed to meet again in the Evening at the Crown, in Princes street, near the Royal Exchange: There we drank Beer, and had Oysters for Supper, and the Prisoner paid the Reckoning; he was too honourable to let me pay any Thing; I never paid but one Two-pence in his Company, and that was at this Place, when our Reck nig once came to 20 d. and he paid 18 d. and I laid down 2 d. At this Time he appointed me to meet him the next Morning, and he then told me, he had got a young Gentleman (whose Father had a Place under the King) to go Abroad with me, and who was taller than me by an Inch or two, and the Gentleman would be glad of my Company, and we might pass for Brothers. The Day following this, we met at Guildhall Coffeehouse again, and he talk'd about the young Man that was to go with me; I have since found it was one

            , who had lately been discharged out of Newgate, that was to pass for my Brother, and to go with me to Prussia. This Man the Prisoner brought with him the next Day to Guildhall Coffeehouse, and there he told me he would make Anderson's Promise good, and would make up 10 l. for me here, and 10 l. more he would give me when I came on the other Side of the Water.</p>
               <p>Counc. What was you to have this Money for?</p>
               <p>Hough. The Prisoner was to give me this Money to go over to be one of his Majesty's Gentlemen, as they are stil'd, - to be one of the King's Body Guard: The King's Gentlemen is the usual Appellation given to his Body Guards; - we call them here the King's Gentlemen, and to be sure 'tis so Abroad. Our next Meeting was at the Crown Tavern at Cripplegate, and he would have had us have brought our Wives with us; but I refus'd, and said, no, no, we'll have no Wives with us. When the Prisoner order'd me to meet him at the Crown at Cripplegate, he wrote me this Paper of Directions. - I saw him write it with his own Hand.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say he agreed to give you 10 l. here, and 10 l. on the other Side the Water, - what was you to do for it it?</p>
               <p>Hough. I was to serve the King of Prussia, as one of his Body Guard. I asked him how I should be sure of the Money when I got Abroad, and he swore, by the Eternal God, I should have it. He likewise told me, he would give me some Cloth to make up against I went Abroad, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170004"/> desired me not to be dilatory, for he did not know how soon the Captain would go off. According to his Order, I met him and Clay about Noon at the Crown at Cripplegate, and we had not been there long, before the Prisoner's Wife and Child came to us. We all ded together, upon a Shoulder of Lamb roasted and a Scrag of Mutton boil'd; and after Dinner, the Prisoner said - I don't know, Mr. Hough, how soon we may go; if I should give you some Cloth, I don't know whether you'll have Time to make it up, therefore here is a Thirty-six Shilling Piece to buy you a handsome Coat. Your Cloaths (says he) will be but of little Signification to you there, for my Master allows a Summer and a Winter Suit. At the same Time he changed a Guinea, and gave Clay half a Guinea, as a Person who was to serve the King of Prussia, as well as I; and Clay and I drank to one another, shook Hands, and agreed to pass for Brothers. Before we parted, he order'd me to come every Night to him at the Crown in Princes-street. and I accordingly went thither the next Evening. He then asked me if I had got Cloaths to go in? Perhaps (says he) you have not Money enough; so he left a double Louis d'Or with the Man of the House, and borrow'd 14 s. upon it, which he gave to me. He then took Measure of my Head, telling me he would buy me a Hat, and some ruffled Shirts, and would put me on board as a Merchant.</p>
               <p>Counc. On what Account did he give you these 14 s. at this Time?</p>
               <p>Hough. This was the Day after I had the Thirty-six Shilling Piece; and he gave me the 14 s. to buy other Things (as I thought proper) in order to my going over with him. I had made an Information of all this, sometime before, to Colonel Deveil, but there was no Warrant granted, because he said he would acquaint the Lord Harrington with the Affair; but in the mean Time I discover'd it to my Officers, and they inform'd my Lord Albemarle, and then I had a Warrant to take them up; but upon enquiring after the Prisoner, we found he was gone on board to provide for our Passage; Carrol and Anderson were fled before, and the Constable and I went several Times to the Prisoner's House, and we were told he was gone Abroad likewise.</p>
               <p>Counc. Had you any more Money of the Prisoner, than the 36 s. and the 14 s. which you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>Hough. Yes; I had several small Parcels before, which he gave me for my Keeping till I went with him to the Ship.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Excuse did you make to him for not going?</p>
               <p>Hough. He press'd me to make haste, because the Captain was going; but my Intent was not to go, tho' I promis'd him I would: I told him, I would get my Things ready as soon as possible. And after I had a Warrant to take these People up, I went immediately about it; but they were all fled. Carrol, I hear, is in Ireland, and Anderson is with the Prisoner's Brother at Dunkirk. The Prisoner was taken at the Dolphin Inn without Bishopsgate; he was to have gone Abroad next Day.</p>
               <p>Counc. How far was August run out before the Prisoner was taken?</p>
               <p>Hough. We were never three Days asunder in the whole Time. The last Money I receiv'd of him was on the 22d of August.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long was that before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Hough. He had left his Lodging four Nights, and was taken nine or ten Days after at the Dolphin Inn.</p>
               <p>Counc. Look on these Papers. - Are you sure the Prisoner wrote them?</p>
               <p>Hough. Here's three Directions: These two I saw him write with his own Hand. The Papers were read.</p>
               <p>'' 12. At the Crown Tavern, Cripplegate.</p>
               <p>'' At the Bare, (Bear) Castle-street, against the '' Meuse.</p>
               <p>'' 12. At the Crown Tavern, Cripplegate.''</p>
               <p>Hough. The second Direction to the Crown, the Prisoner wrote, because the first was not wrote plain enough for me.</p>
               <p>Counc. Are you sure what Day in August you met the Prisoner at the Crown at Cripplegate?</p>
               <p>Hough. I am sure it was the 21st or 22d. The last time I met him was on the 22d of August, and that was at the Crown in Princes street.</p>
               <p>Counc. When was the first time you met at the Crown at Cripplegate?</p>
               <p>Hough. The first time was in the Beginning of August; but when he gave me the 36 s. it was about the 20th or 21st, and I am sure it was a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, for I put it off for so much; and I received it from him, for going to Prussia to serve in that King's Body Guards. He said he did not know how soon the Ship would sail, and I said, - I did not care how soon I went.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Day of the Week was the 14 s. given you?</p>
               <p>Hough. I can't tell what Day of the Week it was; but 'is my Opinion it was on the 22d of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170005"/> August; for the Begining and End of the Affair was in that Month. He had been out of the Country, and was come to England but five Days before he apply'd to me. He had been to carry a Man Abroad, and shew'd me a Letter intimateing the same, at the Time he shew'd me the Commission, - the large Sheet of Paper: And I know the Man he carry'd Abroad was offer'd to our Company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say I paid you other small Sums at different Times, what were they for?</p>
               <p>Hough. He gave me 3 s. 6 d. and such small Sums, for my Keeping, and those little Sums were to be made up 10 l. here, and I was to have 10 l. more on the other Side the Water; he told me so, when he gave me the second little Parcel of Money. He gave me 4 s. 6 d. at Guildhall Coffeehouse, and bid me speak if I wanted any thing, for whatever I wanted I should have, while I was here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I mention one Word to you of serving in the King of Prussia's Army, or in the Body Guards?</p>
               <p>Hough. He did, as God is my Judge, twenty times over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At what Place was you first told, that you was to serve in the King of Prussia's Army?</p>
               <p>Hough. At the Cross Keys, by the Exchange; where he shew'd me the Commission: and that was in the Beginning of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was your Name enter'd in any List or Roll?</p>
               <p>Hough. I believe you know that is what cannot be done. The Roll, I suppose, is kept on the other Side the Water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have not you apply'd to me for Work as a Taylor?</p>
               <p>Hough. The Prisoner promis'd to employ me several Times during our Meetings, but he never was as good as his Word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And was not you angry with me for not employing you?</p>
               <p>Hough. No. For if he did not give me Work, he gave me Money; and that was as well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been ill and fatigu'd, so can't express myself as I would. 'Tis a base Prosecution, and I believe will turn out so.</p>
               <p>William Court. I keep a victualling House; the George, in Monmouth-street. I have known Hough about three Years: His general Character is that of a Rogue. I never heard any Man give him a good Character, but have heard many give him a bad one. He lodged twenty-three Weeks in my House, in the Year 1736, but he never paid me any thing. He was a Soldier, and bid me kiss his Arse. I had him before his Colonel and the Colonel endeavoured to get my Money, but Hough told him plainly he would not pay me. He has been once in my House since that time, and drank a Pint of Beer, but I believe he did not sit down.</p>
               <p>Counc. Who do you know, that are of his Acquaintance?</p>
               <p>Court. I can't tell. He is known about Monmouth-street; The Neighbours who use my House, know him.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, by Drury-Lane, and have known Hough very well by Sight, for these two Years and upwards He has a very bad Character given him, by every one he deals with. I took the lower Part of his House to sell Beer in. I believe he values his Oath no more, than I would [do to] take the Snuff of this Candle and throw it on the Floor.</p>
               <p>Counc. And how long did you live in his House?</p>
               <p>Grogan. About a Quarter of a Year: I did not observe any ill of him during my Continuance in his House, but the People in the House gave him a bad Character. Once I saw him buying stolen Goods in my Apartment. He bargained for a Waistcoat, and was to give fourteen Shillings for it; then he took the Man to the Barley-Mow, and afterward I saw him bring the Waistcoat home. I did not know at that time, that it had been stole; but afterward the Man at the Cross Keys in Monmouth-street, came to ask me if I had bought such a Thing? I told him no, - but I knew who did.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pray where do you live?</p>

I have made him 14 Great Coats for Exportation, and two or three of my Servants pack'd them up, with some other Goods, among which was a Piece of coarse Cloth, about eight or nine Shillings a Yard, and some Remnants of six Shillings a Yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Sums and Bills have you seen in my Possession?</p>
               <p>Oldridge. To the Value of 600 l. in Money and Bills.</p>
               <p>Jury. What Colour were the Cloaths you made up for the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Oldridge. Some of them were dark Drabs; some of them were lin'd, and four of them unlin'd.</p>

               <p>Witnesses, to support the Character of Hough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Timms. I know Hough; his general Character is, that he is an honest-Man. I am a Taylor, and live very near him in White-hart Yard; I am a Housekeeper there, and have known him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170007"/> nine Years.

            . I live in Russel-street, Covent-Garden - but a little Distance from Hough's. I have known him three Years, and he bears the Character of a very honest Man. I have entrusted him with some Scores of Pounds; he has return'd Money for me, because I did not think myself so proper to do it; and I have always found him honest, and he has faithfully accounted with me, for a Hundred or two of Pounds. He is entrusted by me at this present time. I never heard any Man give him an ill Character, or speak an ill Word of him in my Life. As for perjuring himself, I do not think he would be guilty of such a Fault.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Crisp. I am a Housekeeper; I keep a Chandler's Shop, and have lived about Half a Year where I do now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say you are a Chandler, and you talk about his returning 200 l. for you. From where did this Sum come?</p>
               <p>Crisp. From Norfolk. I am not Scholar capable of taking Care of my own Affairs; so I entrusted him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why Hough cannot read a Letter. [The Prisoner produced a written Paper, which was Shewn Hough.]</p>
               <p>Hough. I can't read this Paper; but what signifies that? I can keep an Account, and I can write a little. Mr. Crisp had 200 l. left him in the Country; I went down, and manag'd the Affair for him, and kept a just Account. I have paid Six-score Pounds, and have Fourscore more to receive for him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Has he never been punish'd?</p>
               <p>Captain Hopkins. No; never. He came and told me of this Affair, on the 24th of August; but he had been with Mr. Deveil before. When he acquainted me with it, I informed the Major and we went to my Lord Albemarle about it. The Warrant to take the Prisoner was granted a Fortnight after Hough had made his Information before Mr. Deveil; but he was not taken till a Week after that time. I know nothing of the Prisoner.</p>

On Sunday Morning, the 16th of September, about One o'Clock, I open'd a Sash that looks over a Parlour, (which is lower than the rest of the House, and was cover'd with Lead) to see whether it rain'd or not: The Leads at that Time were very wet, but upon putting my Hand out of the Window, I found it did not rain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paris. This House is mine; and the Parlour that has been mentioned, was cover'd with near 40 C. wt. of Lead. On Saturday Night, between Ten and Eleven o'Clock, as I was going to Bed, I look'd out of a Window that looks over these Leads, toward Somerset Gardens, to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170009"/> what Weather it was, (according to my usual Custom) and I then saw the Lead safe; but at Six o'Clock on Sunday Morning, Sept. 16. as I came down Stairs, I saw two great Strips cut off to the Joinings where the Lead is doubled over. Upon this I went down Strand-Lane, and enquired of several People if they had seen any Lead carrying off? One of them told me, that William Green of Maypole-Alley had a good Job To-night, and that a great deal of Stuff had gone into his House. Hearing this, I went to Maypole-Alley, and enquired after Green; before I could get a Word of an Answer, the People said, - What, Sir, have you been robb'd To-night? I had a wretched Character of him, and therefore I apply'd to a Magistrate for a Search Warrant, but could not get one on Sunday. However, I planted my own Servants, and five or six others, about the House: In short, I beset it all Sunday and Sunday Night, and went myself every Half Hour, or Three-quarters, to see that my Watch did Duty. About One o'Clock on Monday Morning, my Servant sent me Word, he had seiz'd a Man with some Lead; I went to him, and found Hesketh with a large Quantity, which I thought was mine; so I carry'd him before a Justice, and upon his Information I search'd Leeson's House, and in a little private Hole under the Stair-Case, I found another Quantity press'd as flat as possible. I examin'd it, and found some of it still wet; I took as much of it as I thought was mine, and sent it to be flatted, and upon laying it to the Place, I found it tallied exactly in all the Notches and Indentures. I am very positive all the Lead I found in Leeson's House was mine; but when I had it laid on the Place from whence it was taken, there was not enough, there was still some wanting: So I went to search Green's House; there I saw some small old Iron, but a huge large Pair of Scales, and at last I found my Lead, and pick'd it out of a great Quantity which he had in his House, and upon laying it to the Places where it had wanting, it tallied in the most exact Manner; in one Place they were forced to cut round a Nail, and the Cut in the Lead fitted the Nail. Upon this I took Green, and carry'd him before a Justice, where he own'd that he himself carry'd Part of my Lead to Leeson's House, (which is exactly opposite to his own in Maypole-Alley) at Three o'Clock on Sunday Morning. The Lead that my Man stopp'd upon Hesketh, that likewise was mine, and I left it in the Constable's Hands; that was cut very irregularly, and tally'd exactly. I lost above 8 C. Wt. I think there was 9, but I won't swear to a Pound or two.</p>

            . I don't know the Prisoners; but on Sunday Evening, I saw two Men carry something like Lead under the Flaps of their Coats to Hesketh's, at the Corner of Maypole Alley. One of the Men had a Set-to Coat on, with a Cape; he was very much like the Prisoner, and the Coat like what Green has on now: I saw them carry it into Hesketh's Cellar. I saw no more of them that Evening, but on Monday Morning, between Six and Seven o'Clock, Hesketh brought something in a Basket out of his Cellar; and to me, it appeared, as two Bunches of Turneps. He called a Man to give him a Lift-up with the Basket; which I saw, and was surprized that two Bunches of Turneps should be so heavy; so I followed him from his Cellar to Clare-Market, and there he pitched the Basket upon a Bulk. Then I went up to him, and asked him if those Turneps were to be sold? No, says he, there's nothing to be sold. I insisted on looking into the Basket, and found a Parcel of mill'd Lead under the Turneps; so I sent for my Master, and we took Hesketh before Mr. Justice Frazier, who granted us Search-Warrants, by virtue of which, we found great Quantities in Leeson's and Green's House, all which, (with that, which we took from Hesketh,) fitted exactly to the Places, from whence they were taken. When Green was before the Justice, he said, he had been out that Saturday Night till Twelve o'Clock, that he then came home in Liquor and went to Bed, but his Wife called him up about Three o'Clock, and told him, some Lead was brought to the House, which his Cousin took in, and he was uneasy about it, and said, it must be removed. He told us, that his Wife informed him, the Lead was brought in by

            . I was the Porter, and the Lead found was in my Basket. On the 16th of September, at Night, the Prisoner Leeson called to me, and asked me where Green was? I asked him if any thing was the Matter, more than ordinary? He said, yes; he had a great deal of Lead in his (Leeson's) House, which was brought in that Morning. Leeson wanted to move it to my Cellar, but I advised him to stay till Green came; but he swore a great Oath, and said he would throw it down the Vault. After this I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170010"/> went to get a Pint of Beer, and while I was gone, I found two Pieces had been brought into my Cellar. I saw Green presently after; he told me he was not afraid of any thing, and bid me carry the Lead from my Cellar to Waldron, the Plummer, in Holborn. Accordingly, the next Morning, between 7 and 8 I put the Lead in a Basket, and covered it with a Bunch of Turneps, because I was afraid 'twas not honestly come by, and I was stopped with it in Clare-Market, as I was carrying it to Waldron. This is one of the Peices that was then taken from me: I put my Name upon it, and here it is now.</p>

            . I am a Midwife. I live in Russel-Court, by Covent-Garden. On that Saturday Night I was sent for to Green's Wife; she was ill, and I thought it would be her Labour, so I staid with her till between Four and Five o'Clock on Sunday Morning. Pretty near Twelve, Green came home very much in Liquor, and his Wife and I went up, and saw him safe upon a Bed up two Pair of Stairs in his Cloaths. This was about 12 o'Clock; - I am sure it was not past One. After his Spouse and I had seen him safe, we came down Stairs and had a Dish of Tea. About Two o'Clock, somebody knocked very hard at the Door, and Mrs. Green called to a Relation to see who it was. She went down two or three Steps herself, and I (being a little curious) listned myself; and I heard three or four People say, - where's Green? We have got some Lead to dispose of. Mrs. Green told them he was a-bed, fuddled; and that 'twas a wrong time o'Night to bring Lead to sell. Why then (says the Men) we'll leave it till we can speak to your Husband; and I heard a heavy Load fall on the Ground. I have known Green six or seven Years; he buys and sells old and new Brass, and Lead and Iron: I never heard any thing in this Respect before. He has the Character of a sober Man in his Neighbourhood. Indeed I have heard he has been in Trouble before, but he was Acquitted by the Court.</p>

I know I had 12 s. in it when I was at the End of Lombard-street, for I then took out my Snuff Box, and felt my Money; and I was no sooner off the Plank, but I miss'd two Half-Crowns and 2 s.

He was desired to send for somebody to his Character, but he refus'd. Then the Gentlemen asked him, if he had any Money about him?

We carry'd him to the Mansion-Alehouse, and she told the same Story that she has done now. We ask'd him who he was, and where he lived? He would not give us any direct Answers; but at last he said he liv'd in Whitechappel. I asked him in what Street? He could not tell. Then a Gentleman asked him, what Money he had about him? He said, he could not tell; but at last he pull'd out 12 s. and two Half-Crowns. We told him he might justly be suspected, and desired him to send for some People of Credit, to speak to his Character: The Drawer told him, there was a Porter ready to go to any one; no (he said) he was innocent, and he'd send for nobody. Upon this we advis'd her to charge a Constable with him, which she did, and we carry'd him to my Lord Mayor's, where several People knew him; but my Lord being at Grocer's Hall, he was sent to the Compter for that Night, and was committed to Newgate next Day.</p>

I had about 25 or 26 s. in my Right-hand Breeches Pocket, and upon feeling for my Money, I miss'd four Half-Crowns and a Shilling. I tax'd her with taking it; she deny'd it; - but I found a Half-Crown and a Shilling upon her myself, and the Napkin and Handkerchief were taken from her at the Watch-house. I never saw the Prisoner before the Night she robb'd me; but upon her asking me how I did, I stood and talk'd with her, but what Discourse happen'd between us I really can't tell, - for I have forgot it. When I first charg'd her with robbing me, she told me I had robb'd her; but upon searching her at the Watch-house, the other three Half-Crowns were found in her Pocket, and as they were stripping her, the Handkerchief and the Napkin dropp'd from her.</p>

            , Constable. About One o'Clock that Morning I had been with a Prisoner to the Compter; when I came back I found the Prosecutor and the Prisoner at the Watch-house. He charg'd her with picking his Pocket, and told me he had lost 11 s. but he had taken Half a Crown and a Shilling from her, and the other three Half-Crowns, he was sure, she had still somewhere about her. I (knowing her to be a Woman of the Town) expostulated with her, and desired her, - if she had done so, - to give him his Money again, - and I reprimanded her, and told her, our Watchmen must search her. Accordingly I carry'd her into my Kitchen, adjoining to the Watch-house, and a Woman coming in, we search'd her. I pull'd her Gown open, and search'd her Pocket, in which I found this Handkerchief, (which the Prosecutor own'd) and in the Bosom of her Shift I found these three Half-Crowns. The Napkin dropp'd from her on the Ground.</p>

            : He is a Watchman in Fenchurch street. On Saturday Night, about five Weeks ago, my Landlady sent me with 3 s. and 6 d. to her Husband at the Watch-house, that he might buy some Meat for Sunday's Dinner. As I was going along, I kick'd against something like Linnen, which I took up and put in my Pocket. At the Pump by Aldgate I met this Man: My dear (says he) where are you going? Why, I don't know you, says I, and I am in haste; but he gave me a Pull, and asked me to drink, telling me he intended no Harm; so I went with him into Crouched Fryars, and stood talking with him in the Street: He wanted to be rude, and told me, - perhaps I might want Money; I said I was not given that Way, but he put three Half-Crowns down my Bosom; and afterward, - when he found I would not agree with him, he put his Hand into my Pocket, and took out a Half-Crown and a new King George's Shilling, which I was carrying to my Landlord. <rs id="t17391017-17-verdict76" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Charles Ashburn. Wint was convicted of stealing the above-mentioned Goods last June Sessions. I can only say I lost them from the Horse Shoe Inn in Goswell-street, and that upon the Trial of Wint, one Akins, an Accomplice, gave in Evidence that he, Wint, and Brown, stole the Goods, and carry'd them to

               <p>Mr. Justice Chamberlain gave an Account, that Mr. Justice Heusch (lately dead) inform'd him, that the Prisoner absconded till Akins was gone; and that he believ'd there was a Charge against him on Account of a Fact committed in Bishops-gate-street. <rs id="t17391017-26-verdict110" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Gooday. On the 14th of August, between Eight and Nine in the Evening, I was going up Fleetstreet, and met with a Woman, who stopp'd me, and asked me to give her a Drink, and she carry'd me into a Room up one Pair of Stairs in <placeName id="t17391017-29-crimeloc118">Salisbury-Court</placeName>

I was no sooner in the Room, but the Prisoner came up with a Quartern, and bid the Woman I brought in go down Stairs, - she would stay with the Gentleman, (meaning me) herself. As soon as the Quartern was out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170014"/> the Prisoner demanded the Money for it, so I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out 2 s. and Half a Guinea, and I give her a Shilling to change, and put the rest of the Money into my Fob. Then (in a very impudent Manner indeed) she sat down on my Knee, and solicited me for more Liquor, and during the Time of Solicitation, I found her Hand in my Pocket: I charg'd her with it, and she immediately rose from my Knee, and ran down Stairs; I pursued her, and saw her give something into the Hand of a Woman on the Ground-floor. Upon which I got a Constable, and charg'd him with her; but there was such a Mob rose upon me immediately, that I thought I should have been murder'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a great Mob indeed, and I thought I should have been duck'd, but the Prosecutor got me to the Elephant and Castle in Fleet-Lane, and there he kept me, and told me he had lost his Master's Money, and if I would give it him again, I should be discharg'd. <rs id="t17391017-29-verdict119" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 26th of September, as I was going thro' Mill Yard into Rag-Fair, about Ten o'Clock in the Morning, I met the Prisoners. Wharton asked me to go with him and Deacon to Mr. Carrington's House at Hoxton: I went with them, and we watch'd till the Maid went out; then Wharton lifted me over the Pales before the Door, and I dug up the Threshold of the Door with a Butcher's Knife, and made a Hole under the Door, thro' which I endeavour'd to get into the House; but I stuck in the Hole, and could hardly get out again. When Wharton found I could not pass thro' the Hole, he wrench'd the Door off the Hinges with the Threshold which we had dug up; then we went in, and took a Silver Porringer, seven Silver Tea-Spoons, and a great Spoon out of the Kitchen; a Hat out of the Hall; a Wig, a Shirt and a Handkerchief, out of a Room above Stairs, and a Bottle of Brandy out of the Maid's Room. When we had taken these Things we came down Stairs, and went out of the House, thro' the Door that goes into the Garden, and carry'd the Goods to Wharton's Lodging in Rag-Fair: But upon offering them to Sale in the Back-Lane, I was stopp'd, and afterward Wharton was taken likewise.</p>
               <p>Deacon. Was I in the House with you?</p>
               <p>Steward. No: Deacon stood behind the Pales to tip Tommy, that is - to tell us if any body came.</p>

            . I and Mr. Pay were station'd on board the Voluntier; we came up to Ratcliffe Cross on the 1st of September, and the Ship lay facing that Place between Twelve and One in the Morning, September the 2d. At that time it was my Turn to watch; and hearing a Noise between Decks, I went down with my Candle and Lanthorn, and found the Prisoner and the Boastwain with two twelve-Gallon Casks of Rum; I told them I must take Care of them; but while I was arguing with the Boatswain, the Prisoner got one of them up upon Deck: I told him that he belong'd to a Man of War, and was only employ'd to work the Vessel up the River, and therefore that he had no Business with the Liquor; and I call'd to Mr. Pay, and to Mr. Blake, (an Excise-Officer) to help me; and we carry'd the Casks into the Steerage. Then I went down, and found two more Casks in the Bulk-head; but before I could remove them over the Cable-Teer, I heard Blake cry out, Murder! Upon this I ran up, and found the Candles and Lanthorns beat out, and the Prisoner immediately knock'd me down: The two first Casks which we had stopp'd, we had carry'd into the Steerage; and they were left under the Care of Pay and Blake: but while I was gone down to search farther, they fell upon the Officers, beat them, and got the two Casks over the Side of the Ship. When I found the Candles beat out, I attempted to strike a Light, and then they struck me a Blow in the Face, and beat away my Tinder-box, and got two more Casks from us, damning us, and telling us, - they would have them, or they would have our Bloods. When the prisoner was taken, he told us where the Liquor was, and we found it, according to his Direction, at the Lamb and Star at Newcranes.</p>

            </rs>
               </p>
               <p>The Council for the Prosecution set forth, That the Offence charg'd upon the Prisoner was Felony by the Act 4 Geo. c. 7. 1. 4. '' To prevent Persons '' acquainted with Thieves from following the '' pernicious Practice of procuring stolen Goods '' from the principal Felons, and making them '' over to the right Owners for a Sum of Money, '' without discovering the Felon''; and offer'd to prove it in the following Manner, viz. That the noble Lord above-mentioned having sent a fine Gold Repeating Watch to Mr. Delander to be mended, Delander delivered it into the Custody of a Workman of his one Lorton. As Lorton was going home with the Watch, he fell into the Company of Catherine Kaylock, and she pick'd his Pocket of it. The Defendant hearing of Mr. Delander's Loss, and that one Pope and Kaylock, (the Husband of Catherine Kaylock) were in the Computer on this account, he apply'd to one

            , (who is acquainted with many of this Sort of People) and told her if she would go to the Computer with him, and be instrumental in getting the Watch, it might be a good many Pieces both to her and him. Accordingly, she went, and the Defendant got the Watch into his Possession; but he being pretty well aware of the Penalty of the Act, it made him cautions in what Manner to restore it to Mr. Delander; for he did not do it openly, and with his own Hands, but it was to be left at a Tavern, in a Room, under an old Almanack. The Money was first to be put there, and when the Money was taken from thence, the Watch was to be left. And that the Prisoner actually had the Watch in his Custody, they offer'd to prove in this manner, viz. That<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170017"/> he came home one Night in a very great Passion with his Wife, and cry'd, D - n, you, why don't you turn out? But she not being dispos'd to go out that Night, he was angry, and said, - then these two innocent People in the Compter shall not suffer; fetch me the Watch down Stairs, - I will give it to Mr. Delander again; upon this she went up and brought it down; and deliver'd it into the Prisoner's Hands, soon after which it was restor'd to Mr. Delander.</p>
               <p>But before the Witnesses were sworn, the Defendant's Council beg'd a Point of Law might be spoke to, by Way of Objection to the Prosecution of this Indictment: And the Council for the Prosecution having admitted, that Catherine Kaylock (the principal Offender) was dead, and had not been convicted; the Defendant's Council urg'd, that the Act directs the Pains, Penalties and Judgment [that is, the same Pains, &amp;c.] shall be inflicted on, and given against the Person that receives Money for restoring stolen Goods, &amp;c. as should have been given against the principal Offender for stealing them, and that he shall be guilty in the same Manner, and shall suffer as for the same Crime the principal Offender had been guilty of: That the Crime charged in the Indictment was for privately picking a Pocket, which is a capital Offence; but upon the Trial of the Principal (Kaylock) it might have came out only a single Felony; the Evidence might not have been sufficient to have convicted her of picking the Pocket, but yet it might have been sufficient to have caused the Jury to have convicted her of a single Felony: And if, upon Conviction of the Principal, it had come out a single Felony, then the Defendant must not have been indicted for a capital Felony, &amp;c. therefore it was impossible to know what Punishment to inflict on the Defendant, unless the Principal had been convicted. That the Act expressly requires the same Judgement in this Case, as should be given against the first Offender; but as the first Offender had not been convicted non constat, whether the Crime was single Felony, petty Larceny, or Capital.</p>
               <p>It was farther observ'd for the Defendant, That this Case tallied with that of Principal and Accessary: That receiving stolen Goods was not a Felony at Common Law, it was only a Misdemeanor, but it was made Felony by a particular Act, and yet it was never known that an Accessary was convicted of Felony, till the Principal had been convicted, and when the Principal could not be found, the Accessary could not be indicted for a Felony, but only for a Misdemeanor, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Substance of the Reply to these Objections was, That if they were to prevail, the Act would be eluded, and the Subject frustrated of all the Benefit intended by it: That if the Principal had been taken, and a Bill found against her, and she had dy'd, or broke Goal before Trial, it would be hard that the Act should be eluded, when the Fact mentioned in it could be prov'd by sufficient Witnesses; and as to the Comparison of this Case to that of Principal and Accessary, it is laid down in Hale's, that tho' the Principal does not appear, the Accessary may be put to Answer in a Way of Defence; and Serjeant Hawkins says, that tho' by ancient Authorities, the Party is not to be compell'd to answer before the Principal has answer'd, yet the contrary Opinion (he says) he takes to be settled at this Time. It was farther urg'd, that the present Case was a different Case, and the Fact charg'd on the Prisoner was an independant Fact: That the Gentlemen had mistaken the Words of the Act, which were, That the Party ( supposing him Guilty) shall suffer according to the Nature of the Felony committed (which was to be prov'd by the Circumstances of the Case): That the Act does not say he shall suffer as a Principal; but, if he is guilty, he shall suffer Pains and Penalties, according to the Nature of the Felony committed, and it does not mention a Word of the Principal's being first convicted.</p>
               <p>It was likewise observ'd, That in the Case of Jonathan Wild, the Principal Felon was not convicted when Wild suffer'd: And if the whole of the Charge against the Prisoner was but a Pretence, yet he was under the Cognisance of the Act, (for the Words of every Act must be suppos'd significant) and this Act says, If any Person, under Pretence of restoring, &amp;c. shall receive Money, &amp;c. he shall suffer, &amp;c. and if it was a meet Pretence, he must answer, tho' he must be convicted before he can suffer.</p>
               <p>It was farther observ'd by the Counsel for the Prosecution, That they were ready to prove, that Part of the Indictment that affected Catherine Kaylock, and tho' it was not to be prov'd by Record, but by Witnesses viva voce; yet, if that was prov'd, it was hop'd they should be allowed to proceed to the Proof of the other Part which affected the Prisoner; and if both Parts of the Indictment were prov'd, then the Court would be under no Difficulty to know what Judgment the Prisoner ought to receive; because the Act says he ought to receive the same Judgment as if he had pick'd Lorton's Pocket himself. It was again urged, that this Construction would be an absolute Repeal of the Act, and directly contrary to the Meaning of it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which it was answered, That it was now impossible to convict a dead Body; That there was many a Case that might be called casus omissus; That the Party might die, and a Man might be disabled from doing what he intended to have done for his Country; That the other Side knew the Principal, and if they had taken her, and the Defendant had refused to give Evidence, then they would have come with a good Grace before the Court; That the Act relating to Principal and Accessary plainly chalks out the Method<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170018"/> of Proceeding in such Cases; which is, that the Court should give such Judgment against him, as against the Principal Felon, and it was impossible in the present Case to know what that Judgment must be, because it would have been in the Breast of the Jury to have found it either a Transportable, or a Capital Felony; That it was incumbent upon them to shew what kind of Judgment was to be awarded against the Principal, but as the Act of God had put it out of their Power, it was now impossible.</p>
               <p>That the Observation that had been made of a Man's taking Money under a meer Pretence of restoring stolen Goods, being within the Act, is not sufficient, because the Act lays it down, that the Goods must be stole, though it be not expressed therein totidem verbis, yet it says, such Offender shall be punished as if he had stole such Goods, and in such a Manner, and with such Circumstances, as if the Offender had stole them; and the particular Kind of Stealing must be proved, and the Manner of it, before Judgment can be given in such a Case as this.</p>
               <p>That as to the Citations from Hale and Hawkins, though they say the Accessary may be put to answer, yet his Tryal was never proceeded on, till the Principal was try'd: And an Instance was mentioned, where a notorious Receiver of stolen Goods was taken, and nothing could be done against her till they had got the Principal; who being taken, was try'd, and burned in the Hand immediately, that he might then be a Witness against the Accessary.</p>
               <p>That as to

            's Case, the Exceptions were not then made. And as to the Objections being a Repeal of the Stature, it was otherwise, for the Man that helps another to stolen Goods for Money may be laid hold of, and then for his own Security he will discover the Principal, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
