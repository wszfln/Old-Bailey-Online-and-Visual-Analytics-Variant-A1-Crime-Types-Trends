                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspecter of the Metropolitan Police; I am now employed by the Mint in detecting persons passing counterfeit, coin—on 24th February, I went with other officers to Charles-square, Hoxton, in consequence of information, and met the five prisoners and another person, a female, walking together, and apparently talking—we went into a passage to conceal ourselves, and as they passed, Fife seized Harding, Webster seized Cameron, and Abbott attempted to seize Baker, who was outside the others; he ran away, and I saw his left hand go in this position, as if throwing something away—Baker and Eveson were walking close together; I heard something drop, and saw that it was a florin, but could not see who dropped it—I seized Eveson, and a gentleman picked up the florin and put it into my hand—I said to Eveson, "I believe you dropped that; is it bad?"—Harding said, "No, I dropped it"—I put my hand in her dress<lb/>pocket, and found an empty purse with another bad florin in it—I said, "I have found a florin in her pocket"—she said, "It is a lie"—I put my hand in Harding's pocket, and found two paper packets containing two florins and a half-crown wrapped separately in paper—Baker ran away, and we took the others to the station, where Harding gave his address, 12, Hoxton-square, which was false, though I do not think it was intended to mislead me, as I knew he lived at 12, Hoxton-market—he said, "I will be on my oath this is</p>

               <p>the first time I ever took her out with me to do any of these things"—I then got a lamp, and went to 12, Hoxton-market; but on opening the door, I saw Baker put the candle out with his finger and thumb—there were two other men with him—I said to the officer, "This is the man who got away"—he said, "No, I will be on my oath I have not been out from here since 4 o'clock"—we then went to the station—I then went to Hoxton-square, where I had seen Baker throw something, and at that very spot I saw Inspector Fife pick up a paper packet containing three bad half-crowns—I knew Baker, Abbott, and Cameron before, and have seen them go to Harding's house at different times, and I believe Eveson lives with Harding as his wife at the same place—I also knew them at their previous address—Cameron said the coin was given him by one of the others.</p>

I live at 58, Palace-road, Wells-street, Hackney, and am working at Mr. Gilbert's, bookseller and stationer, Gracechurch street—on 19th February I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's-churchyard, and he gave me this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not open it—he made me understand I was to take it to Mr. Charles Thompson's, St. Paul's-churchyard, the address which it bears—he spoke broken English—I went there, gave it to one of the assistants, and received from him a parcel—I then left the warehouse—when I went out first I could not find the prisoner—I came back, and on going out a second time I saw him beckoning to me—I followed him and gave him the parcel at the corner of Newgate-street.</p>

I manage the business of the prosecutor—on 19th February I received this envelope from the last witness—I opened it, and found it to contain this order for three pieces of black taffeta, of different qualities, for Peter Robinson—our firm have been in the habit of transacting business with Peter Robinson—I gave directions for the parcel to be made up, and I saw it delivered to the boy—he did not tell me where he was going to take it—I went out before him, and watched the door to see him come out—I kept him in sight till I saw him return to the warehouse, having previously spoken to a police-constable—I then returned to the warehouse, and the constable followed me in—we sent the boy out a second time; I followed him, lost sight of him for a moment, but saw him again going towards Cheap<lb/>side—I ran after him, and opposite Peel's statue I saw him give the parcel into the prisoner's hands—I followed the prisoner to the corner of Newgate-street, brought him back, and gave him in charge to the constable—the parcel made up was worth about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the day in question I was in Regent-street, near where the fountains play, and a young man accosted me, and asked me if I would take this letter to Mr. Charles Thompson, and promised me half-a-crown for doing so. He told me I should receive three pieces of silk, and I was to bring it to the Strand; I, not speaking English, asked the boy to go there with the letter, and told him I would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I waited on the same spot, and he came back to me, and I was taken into custody. I afterwards went to the Strand with the policeman, but I could not find the young man. I am not guilty of writing that order. Out of the four months I have been in London, I have worked all the time, except nine days, at a confectioner's shop, and I then commenced buying small pieces from tailors for tailoring, in proof of which the scales which I used to weigh them were taken from me at the station. I come from Berlin, and came to London with the intention of afterwards going to America.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the London Gas Light Company, and have been so nearly ton years—I know the defendants' premises, 1, Mark ham-street, Chelsea—they are smiths, bell-hangers, and gas-fitters—they were formerly in the Imperial Gas Company District, but since 1857 that district has been supplied exclusively by the London Gas Company—I walked past the premises twice to observe the gas burning, and on 18th January I went into the premises about 11 in the morning—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made by ray directions—it accurately describes the premises—there is an iron railing running along the entire front, a portion of which is open for the entrance—there is a sort of shop here for the exhibition of goods, and on the right are the work shops—I was accompanied by Mr. Pearce, the inspector, and I had workmen waiting outside—there were two lights burning in the show shop, but turned down to a blue flame, as low as they could be without going out, and in the smith's shop three burners were full on—I did not see either of the defendants then—I saw a brother, Frederick, I believe his name to be—I afterwards saw Charles—I asked to see Mr. Dobbins, and Frederick said that he was not in—I then asked to see the meter, and ho showed it to us—I turned on one of the lights in the show shop full, and desired the inspector to go to the meter—Mr. Frederick stood between the inspector and me—I directed the gas to be turned off at the meter, which was done, and the two burners in the shop went out as they should, but the three in the work shop continued to burn—in order that there should be no mistake I bad the meter disconnected from the pipes and shifted some yards from its position, but the gas still continued burning in the workshop—there wore two small pipes from the motor, and a third pipe going to a light in the kitchen, with a larger pipe going apparently to supply the workshops, which we disconnected, but no gas escaped, though the gas was at that time burning in the work shop—I judged from that that there was some stoppage in that pipe, and in addition to that the lights in the show shop would not have gone out—there were seven lights in the show shop supplied from the meter—I went round to every light in the work<lb/>shop with the inspector and my assistant—we tried every light, and found we could got gas from fifteen lights, all of which had largo burners, some of which would consume seven or eight feet per hour—we got as much gas from them as we required—that was after the meter had been disconnected—when the workmen came in I directed them to dig up the ground inside the railings in the defendants' presence—while they were doing so I went away for a short time, und returned and found the ground laid open as far as it was possible, but they had not interfered with the private part—when I came I caused that to be opened, and found a three-quarter inch service pipe going into the premises, and up to the meter, and then a "T" piece—this model</p>

               <p>accurately shows the position of the pipe—I had it made from what I saw—I directed the workmen to sever the pipe, and it is in Court—the meter was a ten light one—the pipe would probably have been an inch and a quarter one for twenty-two burners—if twenty-two burners were supplied through a three-quarter inch pipe you would get a light, but not a proper one if they were all lighted at once—the pipe was four or five inches underground, and there were iron plates and pieces of paving over it—the ground had not been recently disturbed—one of the pieces of plate went over an old drain, and herbage was growing there, showing that it had not been disturbed for a long time—my opinion is that the "T" was put into the ground at the same time, or thereabouts—I saw Charles Dobbins, but did not address him because he did not make himself known to me, and no explanation was given to me—I told Frederick Dobbins, as I could see nobody else, that they would have no gas that night, and had better provide themselves with other means, and appeal to the Board—he attended at the Board, and they declined to see him—I was not aware that they were burning gas in any other way than by meter.</p>

I am a warder in Millbank Prison—on Saturday morning, 30th January, shortly after 6, I saw the deceased in one of the passages of the prison—he was getting a tub down with some cleaning flannels to clean the passage—shortly afterwards I saw him lying on the floor, with the prisoner standing over him—he had one knee on his body, about the middle of his stomach, and he struck him a severe blow in the body with his right hand at the same time—I ordered the prisoner to his cell—he went—I picked the deceased up, and called another person to support him—I locked the prisoner up, and then led the deceased to his cell—he was bleeding at the nose at the time I took him up—he was not bleeding more than usual after a blow—I left him in his cell—I saw him again about half an hour afterwards—he was bleeding from the nose then—it was nothing more than an ordinary bleeding—he took his breakfast after this—he drank his cocoa, and returned his loaf to the kitchen—I saw him again about half-past 7, when I gave him his breakfast—he made no complaint then—I asked him if he would go to the surgeon—he said, no, he would rather stop in his cell—I saw him again about twenty-five minutes' past 8 when I went to his cell—he then complained of pain across his to stomach—I brought him down to the principal officer to take him over to the surgeon—he was able to walk with assistance; I had hold of his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at Millbank Prison—on Saturday, 30th January, I saw the deceased man Daley, a little after 9 in the morning—I found that he had had a severe contusion between the eyes, involving the upper part of the nose, and lower part of the forehead—I also found that he was very faint and exhausted from loss of blood—he was not bleeding then, but I saw that he had been bleeding—there was some coagulated blood upon the nostrils—I judged from that that he had been bleeding from the nose—he seemed to be suffering from a nervous shock—I saw him several times in the course of the evening—about 5 next morning I was sent for—I went immediately, and found that he was dead—I made a post-mortem examination on Monday morning, 1st February—I then found in addition to the contusion on the forehead, contusions on the fore-part of each thigh, contusions of both shins, and on the top of the left foot there was also an abrasion on the back of the right-hand, and a slight cut at the back of the right shoulder—there was also a contusion on or near the left temple—on opening the body I found there was blood effused into certain bony cavities at the back of the nose, at the lower part of the forehead—that was caused by the rupture of blood-vessels—that was one of the results of the blow on the nose and forehead—I also found a large quantity of blood in one of the intestines—he had swallowed that blood—it had passed through the oesophagus—it was not the result of any injury of the intestines—I carefully examined the intestines—my impression was that there being a discharge of blood from the nose, he swallowed it; there was no rupture of the intestines—the other parts of the body were healthy, but they were very pale throughout from loss of blood; in my opinion the cause of death was the loss of blood and the shock to the nervous system—the loss of blood arose from the injury to the upper part of the nose, and the lower part of the forehead—his brain was quite healthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Millbank Prison, and came from there this morning—I knew the deceased man, Daley—I remember the Saturday morning when this affair took place—about a quarter past 6 that morning, I was taking a table and bucket into my cell; at that time Daley passed behind me, carrying a tub—he was going towards the centre—just after he had passed, I heard a noise that attracted my attention—I turned round, and saw Hayes strike Daley first with his left fist, and afterwards knock him down with his right—Daley bled at the nose from the blow—I did not hear that he cried out—I ran up to Daley, and called out for Hardiment, the warder; he came up—I heard him ask Hayes what he had done this for, but I did not hear the answer; upon that the warder locked Hayes in his cell—I assisted the warder to take Daley to his cell—he was bleeding as a person ordinarily would from a blow—he was left in his cell at that time—I saw him again about an hour after—his nose was still bleeding—I saw him again at half-past 8 that same morning—I went to him then, as I thought I heard some one groaning—I told Hardiment, and we went into his cell and asked him if he was worse—he said, "Oh! I am fainting"—he was holding his handkerchief to his nose at the time—both the blows struck by Hayes were in the face.</p>

On 26th December, about half-past 5 in the afternoon, I was standing in the Mile-end-road, not on duty—there is a smartish slope from Globe-road into Mile-end-road—I saw two carts coming down Globe-road one after another—the prisoner was with the first cart; they were coming at a pretty good pace—I was standing at the south side of Mile-end-road, about twenty yards from where the deceased was, exactly opposite the Globe-road—the carts were coming down on the north side; I might be about twenty yards from the crossing—I saw the cart the prisoner was driving; it might have been twenty or thirty yards before it reached the crossing—I took particular notice of the cart coming down; I was watching him when he came through the mob of people that were pass<lb/>ing, and I saw the deceased fall—the prisoner pulled up directly the man was knocked down—there were a great number of persons about; it was on the Saturday night after Christmas, and a great number of persons were passing—I should not like to say any particular pace at which the prisoner was driving, because I am not much of a judge, but he was going at a pretty fast trot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and practice in the east end of London—I was called in to see the deceased on 26th December, about 5 in the evening—he had a lacerated and contused wound of about three inches long on the front surface of the left leg just above the ancle—he complained of considerable pain over the right hip, but there was no external appearance of bruise—the injury to the leg was such as would be caused by being run over; it struck me from what I heard, that the shaft of the cart might have struck him in the hip—I continued to attend him for nearly a fortnight—during the first two or three days he progressed favourably—I had known him for some years—his health was good prior to the accident—he was an active healthy man for his age—after the lapse of two or three days the wound assumed a very unhealthy cha<lb/>racter—there was effusion under the skin, and sloughing; erysipelas set in which extended up the leg to the knee, and ultimately to the hip, and from that time he rapidly grew worse day by day—I did not order the stimulants until after he became exhausted from the sloughing—I don't know the date of my last visit to him, but I think it was one day within the fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you order him to take as much as a pint of wine or more a day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not order him any given quantity till he began to sink—that was after—the two or three days, when erysipetal inflammation set in, and when the sloughing and discharge were going on—I directed a wine<lb/>glassful about every four hours—I attended him daily—I had an opportunity of seeing what effect the stimulants had upon him—they have a very different effect upon a man when he is in suffering than they have at other times—a pint of wine would not be too much for him—I have seen a man take a quart of brandy in a night—this man's friends complained that there was a difficulty in getting him to take anything, and I pressed it upon them—I don't think it would have a considerable effect upon the muscles of the brain—I don't think it would account for the effusion—it was serous effusion.</p>

I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I was called to see the deceased on 8th January—I found him in a very low state, with excessive sloughing of the left leg, and extended erysipelas as far as the upper part of the thigh—I continued to attend him till 29th January, the day of his death—he was very low, and required to be sus<lb/>tained by beef tea and wine, and those kind of things—I made a post<lb/>mortem examination of his body—I found all the organs of the abdomen and chest in a healthy state, particularly so for a man of his age—there were some slight adhesions of the pleura, showing some former trifling mis<lb/>chief, but nothing of any consequence—upon examining the brain there was serous effusion to the extent of three ounces—I have heard the account of the accident from the witnesses—the wound and the subsequent conse<lb/>quences were such as I should have expected from such an accident—the effusion of blood on the brain, I consider, was the product of irritative fever, and mischief which he had been enduring for five weeks, as the result of the accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you able to form an opinion as to the length of time this effusion had lasted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it did not occur in the earlier part of his illness, because he was so extremely conscious of everything that was going on—he did not seem to labour under any bad effects—I should say it had been gradually coming on for three or four days perhaps—if I had not heard of any accident, I should have said it might or might not be attributable to natural causes—by serous effusion I mean watery effusion on the brain—that produces unconsciousness—for the last two or three days he required to be raised in order to understand, but at the first part of his illness he was clear and collected; the unconsciousness came on during the last day or two—I will not say that was entirely attributable to the acci<lb/>dent; it might or might not be—under the circumstances, I consider the serous effusion was attributable to the accident—if I had not heard of the accident, I should have said it might have been entirely independent of any accident—I am not able positively to say that the one was a natural sequence of the other—in a person of his age it would be more likely to occur from natural causes—it arises from weakness of the vessels of the brain; they grow weak as we grow older—I desired beef tea to be given—I did not order so much as a pint of wine to be administered, but a large quantity was necessary to sustain life with his feeble powers—both beef tea and wine were necessary—I did not attend him at the same time as Mr. Atkins—I desired him to continue the wine-glass of wine every four hours—if they had given him a pint a day it would not have been too much—if they had told me they had given him a pint and more, besides brandy, I should perhaps have said it was too much: if it was much more than a pint, a glass or two more would not have been too much, or a glass or two of brandy be<lb/>sides; in fact, he required the stimulant to keep him in existence—latterly, for the last few days, I believe he rejected almost everything—I don't think too much was given to him—too much stimulant might, in certain cases, account for effusion on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it account for serous effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—a patient suffering from sloughing might take with safety stimulants that would not be given to another patient—I had no reason to suppose, from the action of the pulse or the tongue, that he bad taken more than enough—the abdomen was in a healthy state, and also the chest—looking at that fact, and at the lacerated wound on the leg, I consider the serous effusion was the result of the accident—I should have said it arose from some accident even if I had never heard of this accident, and that the ordinary course of life had been interfered with by some calamity.</p>

I take your watch! the man who has taken it has gone on before, and I am running after him"—there was no one running before him so far as I could see—I did not hear anybody call out, "Stop thief!"—Newgate-street was rather clear; there were a few people.</p>

I am a tobacconist, at 132, Holborn-hill—the prisoner was employed by me as shopman, and occasionally went out, at his own request—he was employed as traveller by me on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> December—he was to remit all moneys received by him by the evening post, if in time for it, with the exception of enough to carry him on to another town, enough for his expenses—on this occasion, he took goods with him I believe some<lb/>where to the amount of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not pay over to me a sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Masters, or account to me in any way for it—he did not tell me that he had sold him any goods—on the evening of 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, I asked him if he had sold anything—he said, "Yes," and he took a little book out of his pocket, and called out various sums, which I can give you from my day-book—he represents, in this little book, having sold goods to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Gray—he has never accounted to me for that in any other way than saying that he sold them—I gave him into custody for these robberies, without saying anything to him—before that, I found out that he had been robbing me in other ways, and I forgave him—at the police-station, I asked him if those were all the accounts he had embezzled, speaking of the accounts at Aldershot, Gray's and Master's—he said,. "No, they are all wrong, except Nurse, of Lynn"—I had forgiven him for taking goods out of my place and making away with them—I had not forgiven him in respect of these particular sums.</p>

               <p>he confessed he bad stolen some goods, he said his brother owed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd for cigars, and somebody else 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he would pay me; but I never received that money—I used to enter the goods in a sort of rough order-book—he would take the goods away, and either send me up word by letter what he had sold, or give me an account of them when be came back—I looked over the stock when he came back; it was settled, and I gave him a little extra for remuneration for going the journey, which he was perfectly satisfied with.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> State what conversation you had with the Prisoner at Ilford. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came up and asked if he could speak to me—I asked him if it was in reference to this case—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You had better speak to us all together; here are the other two trustees"—he said, "For God's sake don't go on any further in this matter, for if you do it will be my ruin; I have already lost my situation through it"—(that was not his situation as secretary, but his other situation)—"I will pay you the amount of all the defalcations, and any expense you have been at con<lb/>nected</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402290042"/>
               <p>with the case"—I told him I was extremely sorry for him, but I had nothing at all to do with the matter now, the court had placed it in the hands of Mr. Rawlins, the solicitor, and he had better see him on the matter—I believe the prisoner is clerk to a solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to Mr. Jower's house in company with your co-trustees, Mr. Bass and Mr. Mott? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that is not the time I am speaking of—I think it was in December that I went to his house—it was on the 19th December that he made this statement to us—that was after the summons had been taken out—we did not give him into custody but took out a summons; we were going to the court-house about the summons when he met us at Ilford; previous to that I had been to his house and asked him to deliver over the different books—after two or three meetings there, he gave them over to us—I went there with my co-trustees, Bass and Mott—I showed the prisoner a paper with certain amounts upon it—he did not ask to be furnished with a list—he said, "Ask the secretary to give me an account of all the defalcations, that I may examine the books"—I believe he afterwards came and examined the books himself—we showed him the account—I did not give him a copy of it—this is the paper I showed him (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) and he said to us at the same time, "I have received all these moneys; I must have received all this amount of moneys, or I should not have made entries on the cards for them," or "I should not have given a receipt on the card for them, and in the case of Davy, I remember quite well taking his money in the court-room"—I am certain about that last matter—I recollected it when I was at Ilford, and stated the same thing there, I think, or pretty nearly—I know this paper was put in evidence there—I will not swear that I mentioned about Davy's name in particular before the Magistrate—I will swear that the prisoner admitted the amounts of moneys he received—the accounts were audited every quarter—I never was an auditor myself—they were audited from these two books, and the contribution book; not from the members' cards—it is not the rule in Forestry to examine the members' cards, unless some<lb/>thing is found out—the auditors signed the accounts as audited and cor<lb/>rect, as far as regards these books; the contribution book would be there, but not the cards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, of course, the moment it appeared on the auditing that Davy had paid the June quarter and not the March, he would be pulled up for the March quarter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he would then produce his card, and we should have seen that Jowers had received it; we should not see that from the books—the arrear ought to have been discovered at the audit—some time before these defalcations were discovered, we caused an examination of the books; it might be a month or two before we suspended him that we first discovered these defalcations—he continued to act as secretary till we suspended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he offer to pay to the Society any sum of money that was discovered not to have been paid over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the only time he offered to pay any sum of money was when we met him at Ilford, after the summons was taken out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he asked to attend the court and explain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was summoned to attend the court several times for the purpose of ex<lb/>plaining the deficiencies, but he did not come at all—we might have summoned him two or three times—when we found he did not choose to explain it, we took out the summons; we consulted our solicitor—I cannot tell you when the audit was after the March quarter, unless I refer to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402290043"/>
               <p>books—it would be the next night after the quarterly night—the courts are held once a fortnight; the audit was always a week after the quarterly night—that audit would have been some time early in April—it was to suit the convenience of the secretary, he fixed the audit night, and went to the auditors and told them when they were to attend and examine the books, and they attended and audited for him when he was prepared with the books—he kept the contribution book at his own house—when the accounts were audited the contribution book was produced and compared with the other books—I cannot tell whether, at the time of the first audit up to 25th March, these items were entered in the contribution book; the book being in the prisoner's possession, it might have been made up after the audit—the auditors do not sign that book in any way—there is a balance<lb/>sheet made out which they sign—if the contribution book was made up subsequent to the audit, we should have no check from that, but the sec<lb/>retary can explain more about these matters—this is the piece of paper that was produced to the prisoner by me—the name of Davy, and the amount 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is on that—he admitted receiving all this money, and Davy's amount he admitted receiving in the court-room—the amount of deficiency alto<lb/>gether may be about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not on this paper, we have not got all on this paper—the amount here may be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. perhaps—I think there are 106 or 107 members altogether—the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consists of, perhaps, eight sums, of eight different members—Brayshaw's is the largest amount—I think that is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in June, August, and November—they are three separate items—there is one amount of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of a quarter's subscription.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would take twenty-four of those to make 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Brayshaw's is the first defalcation on this paper—that was in June, 1862—there are none in 1861 on this paper; in the course of the twelve months the amount of the blundering was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other deficiencies were before that—no; these are the first—I don't know of any item in 1861, I have not examined, or in 1860—the last date here is August—the prisoner was dismissed in September—the other items go on, perhaps, for three or four months after August—we did not go through the books, when we took out this summons—we suspended the prisoner in September, 1863—these amounts were all in 1862—we discovered the other sums between August, 1862, and September, 1863.</p>

I am one of the trustees of this Society—I was with Mr. Lock when we met the prisoner at the Rabbits at Ilford—he asked if he could speak to us—we told him "Yes, if we are all three together"—he said, "Yes; all three"—we went into an adjoining room, and he there and then asked us not to press the charge—he said he was ruined; that he had lost his place, and that he was prepared with any money to pay whatever we wished—we referred him to our solicitor, and told him we had no power to do anything of the sort—I was present on a previous occasion when this paper was produced to the prisoner—we had the contibution-cards of the persons here referred to, with us at the time—I believe that was in December—my co-trustees, Mr. Lock and Mr. Mott, were there—I produced this paper to the prisoner, and likewise, I believe, a card of Brayshaw's, and said, "We have examined about this, and we find deficiencies; we find the sums on the cards, but not in the books; can you account for it?"—he said, "That is my signature, and I acknowledge the money, otherwise I should not have put my signature to it, but I can't account for the money." <hi rend="smallCaps">MICHAEL LYNCH</hi>.

               <p>taken a piece of ground in the Barking-road, and he was going to build a house there, and if we would supply him with bricks he would give us an assignment of the ground as security for the payment—we supplied him with two barge loads to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we also made ourselves liable for building materials to the amount of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an assignment of the land—it is of no value until the house is built—I after<lb/>wards went to see the land; there was no building on it, and everything was moved away that had been taken there—the prisoner wrote to me about December, and I went down to him—he wanted us to send some more bricks—I said, No, I should not send any more bricks till I saw the others put in position on the ground—he came to us again in about a week's time—my partner was present—he repeated his request, and said, "Will you let me have another barge-load of bricks?"—I said, "Mr. Lowndes, this is the first transaction, you have done nothing at the work yet; you may be an honest man, but until I see you begin building I will not allow you to have any more bricks; when we know you are building, we will send you some more bricks"—if he had gone on in a proper way we should, of course have been glad to send them—my partner was sitting on the opposite side of the table and heard this—we had a customer of the name of Cham<lb/>pion of Mile-end, who was going to build at West Ham—I sold to him 30,000 bricks—I ordered those bricks from Messrs. Bazley White and Co. of Millbank and Erith—they were to be sent to Abbey Mills Wharf, West Ham—they were rough stocks, worth about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand—the prisoner had no authority from us to receive those bricks; we informed him most distinctly that we would not let him have any more—shortly afterwards I received a complaint from Champion, in consequence of which I communicated with Bazley White and Co.—I then went to the ground in the Barking-road, where the prisoner was to have built—I did not then find that everything had been taken away; at my second visit I found all carted away except about 5,000 bricks; carts were then carting them away—the whole contents of the three barges had been carted away except about 5,000 stocks, and sold in various directions; I mean those that we had previously supplied as well as these—we have never been paid for the first lot.</p>

I recollect hearing a talk between Newman and a gentleman in January—I was listening to what they were talking about from where I was at work—Mr. Standing is the gentleman; he had a cigar in his mouth, and he was sorting the bricks, looking to see whether he could get any face-bricks out of the lot that was there—he said he did not think it was necessary for him to send any more bricks of that sort, for he thought there were face-bricks <hi rend="italic">enow</hi>, if they could be sorted out—Newman, who I have known to work in a brick-yard, said there could be some face-bricks picked out of them—I heard Mr. Standing tell Newman that there might be a barge load of hard stocks on the road, and if there was not, he would forward them on, for he could see they were wanted—I don't know whether he mentioned the number—he said they would get up as soon as the tide was big enough to let them—he gave Newman sixpence, and I helped to drink part of the beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, of 171, Waterloo-road—about a fortnight before 18th January, the prisoner came and asked me if I purchased second-hand furniture—I told him I did—he said, "I have my household furniture to sell; will you come, and look at it?"—I went to No. 2, Clarendon-place, St. Andrew's-road, Southwark, and looked at the furniture—the prisoner said it belonged to him, and I agreed to give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Mrs. Burr was in the room and heard him say that the furni<lb/>ture was his—she called the prisoner by some name, and <hi rend="italic">deared</hi> him—she said he was her husband, and the prisoner said, "This is my wife"—he said that he should be compelled to leave London to go to Paris in about a fortnight, and I was to keep myself in readiness to move the goods at a moment's notice, and to pay the money—on 10th January, he called about 8 o'clock in the evening, and asked me whether I could come and remove his furniture—my shop was shut up, and I said, "I can't remove it to-night, it is too late"—he said, "My goods must be away to-night, as I must be at the station to take the 12 o'clock train to go to Paris"—I told him if he wanted me to buy the goods, he must bring them to my house—I showed him the way to Mr. Perry's to engage a van, and he and Perry went together to fetch the goods—I did not go with him—I saw the van start—the van arrived with the goods about 11 o'clock, and the prisoner afterwards came in a cab with Mr. Burr—there was a large box and a trunk on the cab—my suspicious were aroused after the "van had started, and I called in Brischlayer, and gave the prisoner in charge—I was talking to the prisoner when Brischlayer arrived in front of my door—he was waiting for the money for the goods, but I did not pay him.</p>

I am the sister-in-law of the last witness—on 18th January, a little before eight, the prisoner called—I answered the door—there was no one at home—he said he came to ask Mr. Kerr to go back with him to take some furniture that was agreed upon, and bring the money with him to pay for it—Mr. Kerr was then out, inquiring whether all was right—I said that I would tell him—between 8 and 9, the prisoner returned in a great hurry—he came into the little parlour, and my brother-in-law told him he could not remove the goods so late; he must bring them himself, if he must have the money that night, which he agreed to do—he did not know where to get a van, and my brother-in-law went with him to Mr. Perry—while my brother-in-law had gone to the police-station, the van and the goods came, and the prisoner and Mrs. Burr came in a cab—they had two lamps with them—she got out, and gave me or Mr. Perry one of the lamps; she then went back into the cab, and I kept the prisoner waiting for the money—I went to the cab and spoke to Mrs. Burr, when the policeman came—I took hold of her arm at the cab, and asked her if all was right—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Is this foreigner your husband?"—she said, "Yes"—I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear that—I asked her if the goods were his—she said, "Yes"—somebody at the cab-door then said, "No, they belong to a police-constable," upon which she looked out of the cab, and told him to go anywhere, or go to the devil—she mentioned something about going to Paris, and said that that was why they were in such a hurry—they wanted me to pay them while the goods were at the door, that they might go there and then.</p>

               <p>wark—I have been residing at 2, Clarendon-place, St. Andrew's-road, New<lb/>ington—about four years ago a female came and hired a room for the prisoner, for which she paid eighteen pence a week—she did not stop, but the prisoner did—after he had been there three months he left for a time, and came back about six months afterwards—he came to and fro several times, and I always treated him as a brother more than anything else—about six weeks before 18th January he came again and took a back sitting-room over the kitchen—on the two last occasions when he came he had the front par<lb/>lour—having known him so long we were like brothers; he was like one of ourselves—he was very poor—he came there once with only a pair of old goloshes on—he had hardly anything to wear, and in consequence of that I was not very pressing about the rent—I left the management of that to my wife—about seven or eight days before the 18th January I was told some<lb/>thing, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner about what he should have to say to another constable, and had some words with him about my wife, upon which he took out a large life-preserver from his pocket, which belonged to me, and I knocked him down to save myself, or else I think the blow would have killed me, in the way he came at me—on the evening of 18th January I was at home, I took some keys out of my pocket about six o'clock, unlocked a drawer, and gave my wife a bill to go and pay some money—I looked the drawer again and put the keys on the drawer—they were there at half-past 9, when I went out to duty—I was on duty at half-past 11, and was called to the police-station, where I found a van laden with my own goods—the prisoner and my wife were both sitting together—those are the goods which the prisoner was indicted for stealing—there was a box there containing my wife wearing-apparel,—I said nothing to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>and he would leave, and my husband would bring him back next day—the prisoner paid the rent to me and my husband, and a great deal more than the rent—I never noticed that he came in goloshes, and without shoes; I should not like to swear it—he took our room the second time he came, at half-a-crown a week—it was a very small bedroom; and he was almost a stranger to us—he stopped two days, or rather slept one sight, and the second day fetched his things away, and we never saw him for twelve or fifteen months—he came then, and Mr. Burr drank with him—he asked for a room again, but I declined—I did not decline when he came for the six weeks, because ray husband wished him—and he did not have a room to himself, he bad a sofa in the front parlour—he came from Paris on the last occasion to our house, or rather he wrote from the Half Moon hotel in the Borough—my husband wished me to answer the letter to say that he should come to our house, but I refused, and my husband met him the next day, and sent him to our house—I did not often go to concerts without ray husband—he frequently took me—he gave me full liberty to go wherever I pleased—he was not unkind to me in that respect—I do not know that Mr. and Mrs. Shadwell are here—I always had the whole of my husband's wages—we paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week rent, and I leave you to judge whether we could have bought furniture with the remainder—I bought it myself, I did not put my earnings to what came from my husband—about a fortnight before this the broker was called by the prisoner to see the furniture—I spoke to Mr. Shadwell about my husband's unkindnees, and said that I should leave him—I did not object to the furniture being sold, because I wanted the money to get clothes to go to service with—I considered myself perfectly justified in taking away the furniture—my husband gave me full leave many times—I swear that most earnestly—I have seen Mr. Lewis, my attorney, every day this week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistant matrons of the Female Convict Prison, Brixton—the prisoner was one of the convicts in my charge—she was undergoing a sentence of four years' penal servitude, and had passed a great part of her sentence, and for good conduct she was what is called a first-class prisoner—she attended to the room of Mrs. Brown, one of the matrons—on Sunday, 24th January, about a quarter to 1, I went to her cell, and found it full of smoke—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "Nothing," and closed the door as quickly as possible—I re-opened it, smelling, as I thought, something burning, and I went in and asked her what it was—she said, "Nothing"—I discovered in one corner of the cell, two candles lighted—she said she was going to boil her cocoa—I asked her to give me the candles, which she did—I took them from her, and closed the cell—it was my duty to make a report of this to the authorities of the prison, which I did on the Sunday evening—on the Monday morning I went to the cell as usual, about half-past 7, when I went round to serve the bread—a prisoner of the name of Melvy carried the basket—when I came to the prisoner's cell I opened it, and was in the act of stooping down to take out a loaf from the basket, when I felt my bonnet pulled off my head, and I received a blow on the top of my head, a second blow at the side of my left ear, and a third on the left cheek—the prisoner's hands were then raised to give me a fourth blow, but I held her by the wrist—I had two prisoners, Collett and Melvy, assisting me with the breakfasts, and they raised their hands as though they were going to assist me—the prisoner said if any one assisted me, she would serve them as she had served me—she said that I had reported her, and it should be the last I should ever report—I saw something glittering in her hand at this time—I bled from the head and face, and felt very faint from loss of blood—I have since seen the bottle that was taken from her—I did not see it taken from her; I only saw something glittering—it was a small substance held in a handkerchief, which was rolled round her hand—I was taken to the infirmary, where I have been ever since—I was in bed for fifteen days—no one assisted me at all—I managed to get away somehow—Melvy went between me and the prisoner, so that I could manage to escape from her—she threw the loaves of bread that remained in the basket at me as I walked along the corridor.</p>

               <p>—you may have asked me to forgive you, but it was not in my power to forgive you; you knew that—I did not, that evening, take down the roll on which all the prisoners names are registered; I knew your register without that—it was my duty not to make any report without first consulting the principal matron who was in charge of the wing on the Sunday—when I came with your breakfast in the morning my left hand was towards you; Melvy, who was with the bread, was on my left; the woman with the cocoa on my right, and you were in your cell facing me—it is a very narrow ward—when I opened the door there was not sufficient room for you to come out; you remained at your cell door when you struck me—I was not aware at the moment who had given me the blow—your cell door was not open when I came up; I unlocked it myself—no one could give you the bread but myself—after you threw the loaves at me you threw the basket over into the lower part of the wing.</p>

I am a general dealer, and live at 5, Little Chatham<lb/>place, Lock's-fields—I came out of prison on 30th January—on Wednesday night, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> February, I found my wife in the street, and took her to Mrs. Edwards's—she was alone, just coming out of a public-house in Blackfriars-road—I afterwards went to a place where the prisoner had taken her to lodge and took some goods of mine away—that was on the Thursday, the day this happened—I removed the things to Mrs. Edwards's in a cab—I did not see the prisoner till he came to Mrs. Edwards's between 5 and 6—Mrs. Edwards ordered my wife up stairs, and told the prisoner she hoped he was not come there to have any disturbance—he said he was not—I said, "I suppose you have come after this woman (pointing towards my wife who was then on the stairs), if you are, I wish it was in a public-house or some other place, that we could see the result of it, for what you have done for me"—he jumped up off his seat, and said, "I am ready for you now, you b——,"—the table was in the middle of the room, and as he rushed towards me, my wife was on my left hand, and I met him, and he struck at me—I thought it was a blow from the hand, but I found it was a blow from a knife, through my lip—the next thing I found was a stab in the abdomen, and the next was across between the stomach and the heart—J cried out, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed the is letting my belly out"—I closed with him and took the knife from him, and it ran into my thumb—I saw the knife from the first time, after he drew his hand back, when he cut it through my lip; I saw the blade of the knife glitter in his hand—it was a small pen<lb/>knife—when I found I could not get the knife from him, I threw my arms round him, and threw him down, and held him there for half an hour, till the constable came and took him out of my hands—while I had him down on the floor, I saw him make an attempt to convey the knife away, by throw<lb/>ing his arms towards the grate—I called out to the doctor's son, young Mr. Dry, "He is conveying the knife away now; it is somewhere about the fire-place"—I was afterwards taken in a cab to St. Thomas's Hospital—I remained there nine days—I have no medical attendance now.</p>

I was sent for trial, and when I had been locked up three or four hours they came and said, "There is another charge against you." I said, "What?" He said "There is a bad shilling among your good." I said, "Nonsense; why did you not find it out be<lb/>fore?" Is it likely? It must have been put in. The Magistrate said, "Very likely you got it where you got change."

I sent the boy for a screw-driver, gave Mr. Lenton the keys, said I would go through the accounts with him the next morning, and went out. If he had come on the Thursday I should have been prepared to have met him as I have always done. <hi rend="smallCaps">
