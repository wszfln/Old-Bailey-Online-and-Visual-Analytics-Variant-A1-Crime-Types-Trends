I am vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Cloudesley Square, Islington; I reside at 24, Milner Square—on the night of 3rd March I was called up about half-past twelve, and went to the police-station—I found the prisoner detained there—I knew him—he had lodged in the house where the old beadle lived, who had been pensioned off, and he had done deputy work for him, but with not any real consent of ours—I was shown this piece of red sateen—it belongs to me—it was kept in one of the drawers in the Albert desk, in the vestry—the prisoner has ceased to act as deputy to the beadle for a year—we had no sateen of this colour in use then—after seeing the prisoner at the station I went to the church—I found the south door had been broken open with violence—we had been in the habit of keeping the moneys collected in the church until recently in one of the drawers of the Albert desk—the prisoner must have known that the money was kept there—we</p>

On 5th March, at 11 a. m., I was in plain clothes in Old Street, St. Luke's—I saw the prisoner come down Old Street in the company of a woman in the direction of the City Road—when they arrived at the comer of Tinley Court, leading out of Old Street, the prisoner left the woman standing there—he went down the court to No. 5; he was in there about a minute; then he brought a paper parcel out, which he handed to the woman when they got to the top of the court—the woman walked away, the prisoner followed about ten yards behind—she went up Old Street, through Bath Street, into the City Road—I told another constable to arrest the prisoner, but he did not understand me—I stopped the woman with the parcel—when I looked round I saw that the prisoner had made his escape—I asked the woman what she had in the parcel—she said, "I don't know"—she was taken to the station on the charge of unlawful possession—I then went to 5, Tinley Court, and found this box under the bed, and this remnant and six cards (photographs)—the box has since been identified as the box, containing the costumes, and the remnant was in the box—I found out the owner—the woman was charged, remanded to the 11th, and then discharged on 9th March—on the 9th, before her discharge, I arrested the prisoner at 3, City Garden Row, City Road, at 9 a. m.—I told him he would be</p>

I am the wife of William Waller, and live at 3, City Garden Row, City Road—I am a machinist—I am not living with my husband—on Tuesday morning, 5th March, about a quarter to ten, I was going to work, and met the prisoner, whom I had seen once before—he said, "I have got you now; I want you to stick to me"—I said, "Want to stick to me, for why?"—he said, "I want you to live with me; I hear you are not living with your husband"—I said, "No, I am not; I am not going to live with you; I am going to work"—he said, "Which way do you go to work?"—I said, "To the Barbican, along Old Street; that is the way I am going"—he went with me—in Old Street he said, "Stop a minute"—I stopped; he went down a court close by the side of a public-house—I did not know where he was going; he came back again after two or three minutes, and gave me a parcel to hold, saying, "Hold this while I light my pipe"—I took the parcel and walked on, and he with me—he said, "There is some one I want to speak to; I will catch you in a minute"—he was walking slow, hanging behind a little—then a constable came up—I was taken to the station, charged, remanded, and then discharged—on the 9th the prisoner came to my house—I had been to several places to see if I could find him, and he heard where I lived I suppose—I asked him in, and sent for beer and tobacco, as he wished me to, and asked him to stop to breakfast, and in the meantime I sent for a policeman—he said if I did not stick to him when he was at my house he would shoot me—I asked him what made him give me the parcel, and he said, "Because I thought you were a straight woman"—I said, "You ought to know better than to get me in this dreadful trouble, "and he said, "I thought you were a straight woman, and that no one would suspect you would take such a thing"—nothing passed as to knowledge of the things being stolen—he said, "I will stick to you if you will be good to me"—I said, "Could not you get a different living to that?"—he said, "I will do so for the future."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of George Flewitt, a bootmaker, of 243, Cambridge Road—on 12th March, about 3 p. m., a basket containing seven pairs of boots was stolen from a van at his door while my back was turned—these are four pairs of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but they have been finished since—they were then in the rough—on 18th March I saw one pair in the possession of Thin, a boot finisher who works for us—he came in with them on his arm, and I recognised them—in consequence of what he told me, I went with Sergeant Enwright to Raynor's house, 1, Albert Grove, Moffat Road—Enwright asked him if he had got any boots—he said no, but that George, the lodger, had some upstairs in his room; and Mrs. Raynor took him up there, but the door was locked, and they came down again—I was on the stairs—Raynor then said to his wife, "You had better tell him where the boots are, as you know"—she then took me to a coal cupboard under the stairs on the ground floor, close to the room where Raynor works—I saw some coal at the bottom, and there</p>

               <p>was a rail of boots hanging on two strings, about eighteen pairs, and among them four pairs which I identify, finished as they now appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Raynor distinctly said, "George, the lodger"—I said so before the Magistrate, and cannot explain why it is not in my deposition; I made a mistake, it was Mrs. Raynor who said that—both Mr. and Mrs. Raynor described George as the lodger, not the landlord.</p>

I am a boot finisher, of 97, Penton Road, Hackney—on 15th March Raynor's wife brought me six pairs of boots, and I had received twelve similar pairs from my wife the day before—they were in the rough, and were brought to be finished—on the Saturday evening at six o'clock I called at Raynor's for my money, and Mrs. Raynor gave me three more pairs, not similar to the others—she had called on the Friday evening and took away six pairs which were finished, and on the Saturday morning she sent some children's boots—Mrs. Raynor paid me—on Monday, 18th March, I called at Mr. Flewitt's, and had a pair of the boots on my arm which he identified—I had only been employed there a few days—these four pairs are what I finished—Raynor did not know that I had been working at Flewitt's.</p>

               <p>to this house and saw the two prisoners and Mrs. Raynor in the front room, and on a table in front of them four pairs of boots, which Hughes said had been stolen from his trap and finished since—from what Enwright told me I went through the passage to an ante-room on the first floor and saw about seventy pairs of boots, shoes, slippers, and odd sample boots, thirty or forty pairs of boot and shoe uppers, and from twenty to thirty kid and skip-skins, seventeen odd Russia leather sample boots, two pairs of boots and twelve pairs of shoes with initials and numbers on the soles; a piece of cloth, a portmanteau and a bag—the press and knives are used for shoemaking—there was very slight evidence that Raynor worked in that room; the machine was dusty, as if it had not been much used—in the passage on the ground floor opposite the coal-cupboard I saw a case containing about thirty pairs of boots, none of which have been identified, under which was a case containing eleven bottles of port wine, and bearing a name and address and initials—those two cases were between the front and back parlour doors in the passage—I told the prisoners that unless they could account for the boots they would be charged with receiving them, knowing them to be stolen—Raynor said, "You are not a Justice of the Peace; I shall not tell you anything"—George was about to make a remark, but Raynor said, "Don't tell him anything"—I found in a box in the room said to be occupied by George, a pawn-ticket relating to a watch—Mr. McDonald and his salesman identified the boots Raynor was wearing at the Police-court.</p>

God strike me dead, I did not do it; I was not there"—about twenty-seven minutes past twelve the same morning I saw, the two prisoners at the corner of Bangor Street and St. Clement's Road, about two hundred yards off said, "Well, Jack, how are you?"—he said, "All right, I am going away; I think of going to Canada"—I said, "The best thing for you; you will have to work out there"—he said, "Yes"—I went with the last witness, and we found the purse about twenty yards from the place—there was nothing in it—it was lying open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of 26, Old Jewry—I prepared this plan of the bar-parlour of the Rose and Crown, Little-Britain, and also this model, which is a correct representation on a scale of an inch to a foot—there are two bullet marks on the wall, about eight feet from the ground, one at this end of the room, and one on the elevator in the corner at the other end of the room—the room is eight or nine feet wide and sixteen feet long—a kind of bookcase is fixed against the wall over the sofa, and comes down to two feet above it; it has drawers in it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a plumber—the deceased, David Danby, was my brother-in-law—he was single—he took the Rose and Crown public-house last October, and has lived there since—the prisoner is his brother-in-law, and he and his wife lived there, and assisted in the management—I visited at the house, and saw them there—I spent the evening there on February 24, and the deceased and the prisoner were on good terms, as far as I could judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have known the prisoner since about three weeks after they went to Little Britain last October—I met him once before by accident—I did not know him when he was manager to Jardine and Co., the diamond merchants, or at the time of his marriage—I did not visit him—I went to his house with my wife about six months after his marriage, but he was not there; we looked all over his house, 5, St. Michael's Gardens, Notting Hill, and went into his bedroom—that was eight years ago—my wife and I made an observation about the danger of having firearms, as there was a revolver at the corner of his bed—I believe the prisoner had a pecuniary interest in the business; I believe they were partners—I was there about twelve times, and sometimes spent some little time there, and always found them on friendly terms—I had known Danby much longer; he was not a man of sullen temperament, or quick, or bad-tempered; he was an ordinary-tempered man—he weighed about twelve stone three.</p>

Some time ago the police woke them up at the Rose and Crown, because the cellar doors were open—they did not go down and find that it originated in a cat—I never heard that it was the practice of these two men to go over all parts of the house with pistols before closing, but I told the Magistrate I had been told so—before I left on this night there was a dispute between these two men about a half-sovereign, which was the cause of my being half an hour late; my time was eleven—when the money was counted up Danby said that there was a half-sovereign short—no one else was present; my wife was waiting outside—Danby was like the rest of us in the trade, he used to have some glasses with customers; I daresay he would take fifteen to twenty glasses in the day sometimes, but I am not always in the bar—I saw him have several glasses of beer on the 25th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> They were both sober when I left, as far as I could judge—the prisoner had had several glasses too during the day—Danby had been the worse for drink during the day, but he was not the worse for it then—Mr. Danby, though he had a lot of money, was not in the habit of handling money; I could count more in ten minutes than he could in half an hour—there was a half-sovereign short, and he was trying to find it out; I put it down that it was a mistake of his counting, and that it would be all right in the morning—the prisoner said that it was a mistake.</p>

On 25th February, about thirty-five minutes past twelve, I passed the Rose and Crown—the lights were still burning, and I saw Mr. Danby in the bar in his shirt sleeves—he was alone, so far as I saw—he was putting something into a bag, apparently money—he was smoking a clay pipe—about one o'clock I heard what had happened, and went back to the house—the Inspector and other police were there—I assisted in searching, and found these two bullets on the floor, about a foot apart and a foot from the lift; they are flattened, and have plaster on them, showing that they struck the wall, and I saw the marks on the wall, one on each side, one on the lift, and one on the wall at the other end of the room—I found this clay pipe on the floor close to the lift, with a very small piece chipped off the mouth end of it—this other piece has been broken off since—I did not find this little piece, it was found in the deceased's mouth.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 26th February, about a quarter to one o'clock I was on duty in plain clothes in Little Britain—I heard a cry of "Police," and saw the prisoner in Bartholomew Close, dressed, except his hat; he had a jacket on—I asked what he</p>

               <p>wanted; he said, "I want a policeman—I said, "I am a policeman"—he asked me to produce my warrant card; I showed it to him, and then he said, "I have shot my brother-in-law at the Rose and Crown;" and asked me to go inside—I asked if he was dead; he said, "I have been trying to get him round some time, I think he is"—I went with him to the Rose and Crown, twenty yards off—he took me into the parlour; two candles were burning in flat-bottomed candlesticks; one was on the hot plate near the lift—he pointed to the deceased, and said, "There he is"—he was lying on a couch on his left arm, in a kneeling position, as appears here in the model—I lifted his head and saw that he was dead—the poker was on the ground near the door; as I went in the handle was pointing towards the deceased—the prisoner pointed to it, and said, "That is the poker he struck me with"—I lifted the man's head, and the prisoner said, "He is dead enough, for I shot him four or five times"—he then handed me this six-chambered revolver from his pocket—I examined it afterwards, and found six empty cartridge cases in it, apparently recently discharged—I told him he would have to go to the station with me; he said, "I feel as if I could shoot myself"—I told him to put on his hat and coat—he said, "Had not you better get another officer?"—I said it did not matter, I could take him—he said, "I shall make no noise"—I took him outside—he said, "I must have been a d—d fool; of course I suppose I shall be hung for this; but never mind, I can only die once"—he also said "He should not pick up the poker to me"—I took him to the station, and handed him over to another officer—I told the sergeant on duty that he had given himself up for killing his brother-in-law at the Rose and Crown—the prisoner said, "That is quite right"—when I went into the room the furniture was just as it appears in the model; nothing was disturbed but the poker—there was a hearthrug in front of the fire, and a carpet on the floor; I cannot say whether it was nailed down—there was a pillow on the sofa and a rug under the deceased's arm—either the sofa nor the pillow was disturbed, as far as I could see—I returned to the house and got in at the first floor window by a ladder, because I had shut the door when I left—there was nobody in the house—Dr. Adams came shortly after—in the second floor back room, the top drawer of a chest of drawers was open—when I went back to the station the prisoner asked the Inspector if he was dead, and he replied, "Yes, he is dead"—he said, "I knew d—d well he was"—the Inspector asked him what the quarrel was about—he said, "We could never agree; we have had several trivial disputes lately," and then, hesitating, he said, "Well, twopence," and hesitating again, "Well, nothing; he picked up the poker and threatened to strike me, and I told him if he advanced one inch I would shoot him; he came quite close to me, and I fired. I was on the sofa then; that was before we struggled. We then struggled together, and I fired as fast as I could pull"—the Inspector asked him where he got the revolver from—he said, "I took it from my pocket; I have done it, and I suppose I shall have to suffer for it"—somebody called attention to a black mark across the back of the prisoner's hand, and a slight abrasion of the skin underneath—the black mark rubbed off; it looked like black lead—the prisoner said it was nothing—I did not hear him say how it was caused—when we were searching him the Inspector noticed a button</p>

S. practise in Aldersgate Street—on the morning of 26th February I was called soon after twelve, and went to the Rose and Crown, and saw the deceased in the bar parlour, leaning on the sofa with his knees on the floor—he was quite dead, a small quantity of blood was coming from his mouth and nose, and a small piece of a day pipe was in his mouth, which fits the clay pipe which was found—I found three wounds, one on his right collar-bone, as if it was a bullet wound, penetrating through the cloth; one on the left side of the chest, some six inches from the middle of the chest—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination, and traced the wound in the right collar-bone four inches—where I found the bullet lying on the collar-bone, it was covered by the skin only; it was quite superficial, but the bullet was very much flattened by coming in contact with the collar-bone—wound No. 2 was on the left side of the chest, four and a half inches from the middle line, and two and a half below the collar-bone, going through the third rib and through the pleura and left lung, through the aorta, just at the point where it is covered by the pericardium, and out through the pericardium, through the middle lobe of the left lung, striking the eighth rib, going right through backwards and downwards—that must have caused death very soon—the next wound was in front of the right hip, just below the hip-bone; it went backwards about three inches; it was superficial; it went merely under the skin, and there it was found—the next wound was on the inner side of the right thigh, in the middle, going backwards and upwards, and the bullet was found very near wound No. 3, just on the buttock—it had gone through the femoral artery, which would cause death very soon if not attended to—the clothes over the bullet-hole of wound No. 2 were slightly singed, showing that the shot must have been not more than twelve inches distant—the wound on the right hip was also singed, rather more so than the other, showing that the shot was fired somewhat nearer—I found the bullets in each of the four wounds; they had all entered from the front, showing that the men were in front of one another—the wound in the leg travelled directly upwards—no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080030"/>
               <p>inference arises from that, as bullets are turned by very slight things—it could be done by both men standing up—you cannot tell in what direction the leg was—if it was bent it would do so, or the bullet might be turned by the muscles or tendons which it came in contact with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The position of the wound on the thigh was consistent with being fired when the deceased was lying on the couch—I cannot say that that is the most probable way in which it could be caused, but it would be possible—that is the wound from which he would have bled to death if it had not been attended to—it would not disable him for a few minutes—the wound through the lungs would cause almost instantaneous death—I cannot say that he would be likely to fall forward on his face rather than backwards—he was a much bigger man than the prisoner; I should say he was over thirteen stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The trousers were so stained by blood that any indications of scorching would be obliterated, and I cannot say at what distance the shot in the thigh was fired—there was no singeing over the collar-bone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the prisoner was allowed to make his own statement. He said that he had been in the habit of carrying a revolver far years when he travelled with large quantities of jewellery on his person; that on the night in question the deceased's money was a half-sovereign short and he told him he would find it all right in the morning; that the deceased said</hi>, "You <hi rend="italic">are a d—d liar; how about that shilling you gave the baker too much, and found out your mistake?" and attacked him with the poker, and seized him by the throat, endeavouring to get the pistol, and therefore he kept pulling the trigger as fast as he could to exhaust all the shots before it was taken from him, and they both fell together; that he tried to lift the deceased on to the sofa, but finding he was dead, went out and gave himself up; that the deceased was a much bigger man than himself, and if he had not acted as he did he should have been the dead man, and the deceased would have been taking his trial.</hi>

               <p>October Walton asked me to go to Clapham to see if there were any letters for him, as he had given up the City Road office, as no business was doing there—I went to 14, St. John's Road, Clapham Junction, taking the key with me—no one was in occupation there—they had a parlour there—I found no letters—I returned to Finsbury Pavement; Arnold told me not to go to City Road again, but to go to Finsbury Pavement—on my way I went to City Road, and found Miss Pope there; she had succeeded me—Walton had said in October that the office there did not pay, because it was such a dirty place; people would not take the trouble to go up the stairs—I went the following morning to 85, Finsbury Pavement—Arnold told me Walton had taken several large offices and was doing a large amount of business, and was always employing a number of young ladies to manage the offices—he said he had spent a great deal of money; he had opened a registry office for servants and a partner agency, that it was only just opened, but it would be a success because they were very busy then, I was to go to the office at St. John's Road, Clapham Junction, for the future; it was one of their oldest offices, and a great deal of business would be done, I should not be at all lonely there—I went to Clapham, and continued there till November; I was the only person there—I addressed envelopes, which Arnold told me to buy, from the same directory—I saw no business at all—I used one room; I believe there were two in the office; there were two keys—the one contained a table, four chairs, an armchair and form, and a bookcase—I don't know if they were furnished apartments—a card was nailed on the door-post, "George Walton, Auctioneer, 85, Finsbury Pavement and St. John's Road, Clapham Junction," and there was a large auction bill in the window, referring to a sale that had taken place in July—the last week I was there I wrote to Walton, asking for the return of my deposit—he wrote that he would see me in a day or two—I left on 14th November and went to the City Road—Walton wrote asking me to meet him there, and bring all the envelopes I had addressed—I brought away the keys of the Clapham office—I remained at the City Road office till 11th December—I stamped the envelopes at the back with his name—I found Miss Pope had left—I asked for my deposit a number of times before I left—I wrote this letter of 28th November. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for the money to be returned, as her friend wanted it at once.</hi>) Walton several times said a great deal of money was owing to him, and when he was paid he would pay me—I received my salary up to 24th November—I left the City Road office on 11th December, as I had a letter from Walton telling me not to go there till he could attend to me—on 17th December I met Walton accidentally in the Strand, and asked him when I should return—he said he was so very pressed with the business and so very busy he could not give me any work, and he would pay my wages just the same, and I was to stay at home till I heard—he gave me a sovereign on account of my wages, and said he did not mind if I stayed at home and received my salary—Arnold gave me three bonds of £25 each to take care of—he took two away and left one with me—I gave it to my solicitor, who has it—I parted with my £25 because Walton said it was a very old-established business, and that I should have care of a great deal of money and valuable papers—not a farthing passed through my hands—I thought before I parted with my money that it was a valuable business, and that I should do a great deal</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. There is nothing in the agreement about teaching the business; I told Walton I did not know it, and he said no experience was necessary—I never looked at the papers at the City Road office, I don't know what they were—the City Road office had all that was required for an office—there were papers on the shelves and in pigeonholes—I was there for twelve weeks—I was instructed that if there were any applications I was to refer the people to Finsbury Pavement—I was at Clapham two weeks, from October 30 to November 14—then I went back to the City Road for four weeks—my salary was paid regularly for sixteen weeks—Walton paid me 2s. 6d. for money I had spent in the business, as well as the £1—I only hold one bond for £25; my solicitor has it—Arnold gave it me to take care of—I think he gave it me for Walton—Walton said it was a very old-established business—I knew it was a branch I was going to; I don't remember his saying a new branch—he said he had been a great many years at Finsbury Pavement—I took his word for it that he was an auctioneer and estate agent; I did not make inquiries about it—I do not know if he holds an auctioneer's certificate—I have never seen this certificate before—there was a plate on the door "Walton, Auctioneer and Surveyor,"I think—after I met Walton in the Strand I met Miss Pope several times—I went to the office in the Strand—I saw Miss Yeo there three or four times—I was not to go to the Finsbury Pavement business at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWLESS</hi>. I don't think Arnold was present at my first interview with Walton on 3rd August—the terms were settled with Walton, and he represented what I was to do—on 4th August both were present, and then the agreement was prepared and signed—Arnold wrote it in my presence, and Walton signed it—I am not aware that Walton has lost half his right thumb, and finds difficulty in writing—I paid the money to Walton, and regarded him as my employer—I looked on Arnold as a clerk then—I saw two clerks, King and Andros, in the office subsequently—Walton told me at the end of September he was going to open another office, and I should leave the City Road as it was too dirty; and another time after that Arnold told me Walton had opened several offices—I did not know about 10th December that Arnold had left Walton—I met Arnold some time after, and he told me he had left him—that was shortly before Walton's arrest—I finally broke off with Walton about the middle of December—I do not know if Arnold left before that; I saw him a week or so previous—I saw him in connection with the business up to the first or second week in December—afterwards I saw him, and he told me he had left, that he could not put up with Mr. Walton any longer; he said he could not get his money—he knew I could not get mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. Walton said he was in difficulties when I asked for the £25—at first he said there was a flaw in the agreement, and afterwards he said it was correct, and he made several promises to pay me, and did not, but put me off from week to week—Walton was arrested about 12th January; since then he has had no opportunity of communicating with me; but my deposit money was due in November.</p>

I am single, and lived at Stoke Newington—in October I saw this advertisement—I wrote this letter, and received this answer back (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went next day to 85, Finsbury Pavement—I saw Arnold, and told him I had come in answer to the letter I had received—he told me he was manager to Walton, that "Walton was out, and he would do as well—he went over a bundle of papers to pick out mine; he said he wanted someone respectable to manage a branch business, a servants' registry office and apartments agency—he showed me a book of forms for the servants—he said they had several offices, at Clapham Junction, Stoke Newington, City Road, and 42, Moorfields—I did not know 42, Moorfields and 85, Finsbury Pavement were under the same roof—he said a young lady who had been at one of these branch offices had gone away with £80, and that was why they wanted security-from me; a gentleman had stood security in £100 for her, and they had gone off together—I believed what Arnold said—I understood it was an old-established business, and that a lot of money would pass through my hands, and that I should have charge of valuable papers, deeds, and leases—Arnold asked me to call again to see Walton—I did so—Walton then said my salary would be 15s. a week and commission of 10 per cent, on the profit of all the business done at the office—Walton told me it was an old-established business, and he should want me at Finsbury for a few days to instruct me—Arnold said I could make from 25s. to 30s. a week with the commission, and Walton agreed to it—Walton asked me when I could pay the £25—he said, "Has Mr. Arnold explained to you about the £25, and are you willing to pay it?"—I said I was—Walton said he had been robbed, but I don't think he mentioned the amount—I got my money out of the Post-office Savings Bank two days afterwards, on the Saturday morning, and went with it to 85, Finsbury Pavement—I saw Arnold—he said Walton was too busy to attend to me, but that I could pay it to him (Arnold)—I gave him the £25 in gold—he gave me this receipt, which he wrote in my presence—I saw this agreement-partly drawn up—I signed it a day or two afterwards, on 8th October. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was similar to those before-mentioned</hi>)—I went to Finsbury Pavement for a few days to be put into the way, and at the end of October I went to 90, City Road—they said nothing about its being too dirty for people to go to, or about the young lady coming away from there—I thought it was doing very well—Walton said he was arranging the offices to suit the young ladies' convenience, and he thought it would be convenient to me to go there—I saw a young lady there after I went—I employed my time copying forms of letters for apartments to be let—they gave me paper with a printed heading, "Mrs. Walton's Apartment Agency"—I wrote a number of them; Arnold told me to do so—sometimes Walton took some away, saying he would send them off—some were left on the premises—I addressed no envelopes—I saw a lot of papers there, they were too dusty to touch—no one came on business—I took no money—I remained from 30th October till 10th November, and then I told Arnold I had taken no money, it was not business-like, and that I was getting no commission—Arnold said that Walton was giving that office up, it did not suit him, and I should go to another one—on 10th November he told me to leave the City Road and go to Finsbury Pavement—then I was told to copy this old ledger into another one—I did that for about a week by Arnold's direction—the book was not referred</p>

               <p>to during the week I had it—it goes back to 1882 and 1883—it has nothing to do with the City Road—they were out of apartments papers, Arnold told me, and this was to fill up my time—I was at Finsbury on the 12th and 13th November, and on the 14th Arnold took Miss Yeo and myself to another office on the ground floor of 278, Strand; there was one large room and a small ante-room at the back—Arnold said something about some rooms upstairs, and "Walton once showed me the rooms, but no one ever went there that I know of—it was a new office—Arnold and Walton said they were doing very well at the other office at 377, Strand; the young lady there was deluged with work, and so they had opened this—I remained there till 12th January, the day that Walton was arrested—while I was there three or four people called on business, but they did not pay a fee—one young lady paid 1s. on 7th January, but I have returned that since to her—Miss Yeo and I made these books by Walton's instructions—we got the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, and cut out suitable advertisements, and wrote letters—that book represents our petty cash—they did not pay us for that—Walton said I was to have the fees if I had any, and pay myself—4s. 6d. he owes me for that—he owes me £4 5s. for wages—I copied these advertisements about public-houses from newspapers into this book by Walton's direction—he said he would send the circulars to people—I asked Walton for my £25 back a day or two before it was due on 4th January—he said he was in difficulties, he could not pay me for a time, but he would allow me interest on it as long as it was overdue—he said he had a lot of money to come to him—I complained at the Police-court—I continued at 278, Strand—Arnold's misrepresentations influenced my mind in parting with the £25—I thought it was an old-established business, and if a lot of money was to pass through my hands, I thought it reasonable they should have a deposit—I believed they were doing a good business, and that a lot of money would pass through my hands—I have never had my money back—I did not sue—Arnold told me, I think the first time I saw him, that he had paid a young lady £3 the week before for her salary and commission.</p>

I was at Finsbury three weeks, City Road two weeks, and 278, Strand, eight weeks—I was paid my salary regularly for six weeks, and then Walton gave me £1 on 17th December and a postal order for £1 on 27th December—I did not agree with Walton on 6th January that my money should be paid in a fortnight—he promised, on or about 6th January, to pay it, out he could not say when—I caused him to be arrested because I did not believe him when he promised me—I talked the matter over with Miss Yeo—a workman who called for money which Walton owed him said we should go to Bow Street—I had Walton's permission to go for a walk whenever I liked—I did not stay away for a number of days—I was there every day—the office in the Strand was a new one—some circulars were sent out—I had work to do at Finsbury—I was only there a few hours a day at the commencement—there was furniture at the City Road—Baker told me there had been more things, but he had moved some away—I saw Miss Yeo and Miss Speed at the Lord Mayor's Show—we were introduced, and talked together—Walton and Arnold were there—I had spoken to Arnold before that about the City Road place—I had not complained to Walton—on all occasions I spoke to Walton about the money he promised to repay it.</p>

I should earn from 25s. to 30s. a week—he said Miss Speed was literally deluged with business, and he had just paid her £3 as one week's salary, she had done so much business—he said she was in the Strand—he said one young lady had gone off with nearly £100, and that was the reason for their needing security—he said they were opening two or three other offices because the others paid so well, and that he had had five other candidates that day before me, but none of them suited—he asked me whether I would accept the situation, and I said I would—he asked when I should be able to pay the money—I said on Saturday—he showed me this form of agreement—I asked what security I should have for the £25—he said he should take the agreement to Somerset House and get it stamped, and that would be the security, and that I could have my money back at any time by giving fourteen days' notice—on Saturday, 27th October, I went again with my sister—we saw Arnold first—he asked me if I was prepared to sign the agreement—I said yes—he went out and fetched Walton in—I and Walton signed this agreement—Arnold said he had been too busy to make two copies—I paid £20 in gold and this cheque for £5—Arnold took the money and put it in a drawer—I had a receipt which was torn out of a book—Arnold filled it up and Walton signed it—my salary commenced from that day—I was to commence my duties on 29th</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Robert Beauchamp, a solicitor in Dublin, having offices at 5, Foster Place, and a private residence at 25, Fitzwilliam Square—in November last, with the sanction of my employer, I was collecting evidence to be used, if it was thought fit, before the Commission here in London—in the course of my inquiries I learnt of the existence of the prisoner, and in consequence of what I heard I put myself in communication with him; first of all I called at his father's house in York Street, Dublin; I did not see the prisoner on that occasion, I left word for him to call on me at the Hibernian Hotel; I think that was on the 20th November, Tuesday—that evening I wrote a letter to him, asking him to call on me next day at the Hibernian Hotel—I signed that letter in the name of Thompson—next day, Wednesday, the 21st, I sent a message asking him to call at twelve, but I was not able to be there at that hour—I met him at three o'clock at the Hibernian Hotel—I asked him to meet me at the same place in the evening at seven—he assented—I returned to the same place about seven and saw him—I arranged with him to go to 25, Fitzwilliam Square, the residence of Mr. Beauchamp—we went there together between seven and eight—we went into the study on the ground floor—there he showed me a book for which he was canvassing, it was some sort of directory—I looked at it for a minute or two, and then told him I did not want to see him about the book at all, that I wanted to see him with reference to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Commission—I think he said that he could not give me any information about it, or he did not know anything about it, some words to that effect—I then asked him if he had been a clerk in the Land League office—he said no—I asked him if he had been a Fenian—he said no, that I must be misinformed—I said that I know that ho could give me information that would be useful before the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>

               <p>Commission—he repeated that he could not, that he did not know anything about it—I repeated that I knew he could, and asked him to consider it, and meet me the next day, I think at twelve; that would be Thursday, the 22nd November—I think I saw him at the Hibernian Hotel—I then told him we could not very well have a conversation in the hotel, and I asked him to come again to Fitzwilliam Square, and he came over with me—that was I think about four o'clock, I know it was early in the evening; no, I think on this occasion it was about seven or eight—I then asked him if he had reconsidered the matter, and after some conversation he said he had—I then asked him to tell me about his connection with the Fenians—he told me how he had joined the Fenians when he was a boy of 15 or 16—before that he wanted an assurance that if he gave information he should be provided with the means of leaving the country, or something of that sort—I think also on this occasion he said that his father and mother would probably require to be provided with means to leave the country—I told him I thought there would be no difficulty about that—when that was arranged he told me how he had joined the Fenians when he was about 15 or 16 years of age, that he was introduced, I think, to the Fenian Society by James Carey, and that he was not at first formally sworn in to the society, but that he was sworn in a year or two afterwards; then he told me that he did not attend the regular meetings held in a place called Cuffe Lane—he told me he had been sworn in, I think, by Michael Fagan—he said that the Fenians were engaged in secret efforts against the Government, and in conveying firearms from one place to another—that he had never actually himself conveyed firearms, but that he handed them over to Michael Fagan—I asked him when he had joined the Invincibles—he asked me how I knew that he was an Invincible—I said he might assume that I knew all about it, or I would not have cared to see him—he told me he had joined the Invincibles in the beginning of 1881 or 1882, I cannot remember which very well, and that <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Kelly had sworn him in, and he mentioned people whom he had met as Invincibles—he mentioned Joseph Brady, Michael Fagan, P. J. Fitzgerald, I think, and he also mentioned Patrick Egan and other names—he said he had met Egan at one meeting in the Winter Palace Gardens public-house, when the murder of Judge Lawson was discussed (at least the time and place were discussed for carrying out the murder) he said that Egan had remained during the whole of that meeting until the business was all over, and then Egan went away by a side door into Cuffe Street or Cuffe Lane—he also said that he met him at another meeting of Invincibles in a public-house in Britain Street, where the failure of the attempt to murder Judge Lawson was discussed—he told me also of another meeting of Invincibles, where the murder of Mrs. Smythe was talked of; she had been murdered, and some men from Westmeath wanted to get Mr. Smythe's address where he was staying at that time—there was a great deal of conversation at this time, but I don't recollect it very particularly—he told me that Egan was the treasurer of the Land League, or rather I asked him if he had met Egan, the treasurer of the Land League, and he said, "Yes"—he said that at that meeting Egan was wrapped up in a great coat, as if he did not want anyone there to know him—he said that he himself knew Egan personally very well, that he had met him in a sort of social way, and he mentioned two places, a restaurant called</p>

               <p>the Ship and another place Wynne's Hotel; he told me that he himself was in the habit of going in and out of the Land League offices, but this was merely to account for his knowing Egan; he did not say that he himself was in any way connected with the Land League—he did not want any money then—I think he also mentioned the names of Dan Curley, and a man named Hanlon—I could not say definitely any others—after he had made this verbal statement it was arranged that I should not take it down in writing—this was part of the arrangement about the money; I was not in a position to give him a definite assurance in arranging about giving him means to leave the country in case he gave evidence; it was part of the arrangement that I should not take down any statement in writing; the assurance that he wanted was that means would be provided for him to leave the country—I said that I would communicate with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and see whether I could give him the assurance, and I arranged with him to go to the Star and Garter Restaurant every day between one and two, and I was to go to him there, if and when I had anything to communicate; then the interview closed—I then put myself in communication with Mr. Soames in London, certain correspondence passed between us, and in consequence of that on the following Monday, the 22nd November, I went to the Star and Garter about two o'clock, and there saw the prisoner—I said, "This evening at five, at the same place, in Fitzwilliam Square"—I went there at that hour, he came there after I had arrived, and I saw him again in the study—I told him then that I was able to give him the assurance he wanted, and that I wanted to take down a statement from him in writing—he said that was all very well, but he did not know me or know my name, or that I had any authority—I asked him if he knew Mr. Beauchamp, the solicitor, who had his offices in Foster Place; he said he knew him by reputation, he did not know him personally—I then told him it was Mr. Beauchamp's house we were in, and I asked him if Mr. Beauchamp told him that I was an agent for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and had authority to give him that assurance would he be satisfied—he said, "Yes"—it was arranged that he should go to Foster Place and inquire for Mr. Beauchamp, so that when he met him again in the evening in the house he should know he was Mr. Beauchamp, the solicitor—he then left the house to go to Foster Place, and I followed shortly after; I did not see him till I got into the office, I found him there with Mr. Beauchamp, he was showing him the directory—I said to Mr. Beauchamp, "It's all right, I will want you later in the evening," and I think I said to Molloy, "Meet me at eight o'clock," or something of that sort, or just simply, "Eight o'clock"—Molloy then went away; I remained with Mr. Beauchamp in the office until it closed; I had some conversation with him at that time—after that I went to Fitzwilliam Square, and Molloy came; I think I let him in, and we went into the same room, the study—Mr. Beauchamp was then in the house—I told Molloy that I had explained to Mr. Beauchamp the assurance that he wanted, and that the money involved would be about £50, in case Mr. Beauchamp would have to make it good, that he would be on his honour to do what was necessary—Molloy said that was all right—we collected from Molloy that to go away, and his father and mother to go away, it would take about £50—I then rang the bell for Mr. Beauchamp; the servant came, I met her at the door and asked her to send Mr. Beauchamp to the study—he came almost immediately, and I said this was Patrick Molloy,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The statement was then put in and read as follows:</hi>—"Am now twenty-six years of age. Have been a member of Fenian movement for ten or eleven years. Joined in 1877 or 1878 when between fifteen and sixteen. Was not sworn in then, was sworn in two or three years later. All who join were supposed to take an oath, I believe; but I did not take it, as I have said, until two or three years after. I was introduced to the Society by James Carey, whom I knew from a very early age. We met weekly, not at any stated place, but on the street or in some public-house, such as Fortune's, of Grafton Street, Cleary's, Grafton Street, The Winter Palace, St. Stephen's Green, and in a house in Britain Street, I think then owned by a man Connolly. We generally met on Sundays. There were, I know, regular maetings held in a house in Cuffe Lane. I never went there. I did not care to associate with many of those who were members, and I tried to keep aloof, only attending such meetings as I was called to. The ostensible objects of the Society were "The Freedom of Ireland" when I joined. I had no definite idea beyond this. Before I was very long in the movement I saw there were some things to be engaged in which meant some sacrifice, namely, engaging in secret efforts against the Government, such as conveying firearms and ammunition. I have never actually conveyed arms myself, but I have handed them over to others. I remember handing over rifles and revolvers and ammunition to Michael Fagan (since hanged as an Invincible). I was sworn in formally in or about 1881. Timothy Kelly (since hanged) swore</p>

               <p>me in He was a schoolfellow of mine. The oath I do not perfectly remember; but it was generally to establish independence of the country, and to lose, if necessary, life in this. The Invincible organisation was started in 1882. I was invited to join by Tim Kelly. Was sworn in as an Invincible about February or March by Tim Kelly. Attended the meetings. Met there, among others, Dan Curley, Tim Kelly, Joe Brady, Tom Caffery, Joe Mullett, and Patrick Egan, the treasurer of the Land League, and P. J. Sheridan. I met Pat Egan at two or three of the meetings; one I remember at the Winter Garden Palace in St. Stephen's Green; another in a public-house in Britain Street. I think Reynolds is the name, it is No. 70, at the corner of Moore Lane and Britain Street Hospital. I remember him at other meetings, but can't just now recollect the locality. Egan generally was wrapped up in a big coat, giving me the idea he did not want to be known by any who did not know him. I knew him well. I met him several times in a sort of social way in the Ship and Wynne's Hotel in Abbey Street, and knew him well. At the meeting in the Winter Garden Palace, at which he was present, the removal of Judge Lawson was under discussion. The best time and place was discussed. The method left in the hands of those who were to do the work. Joe Brady, Michael Fagan, Tim Kelly, and Dan Curley were also present. Kavanagh was there with his car outside. Egan went out when the business was over by side door into Cuffe Street. This meeting, I think, was held in November, 1882. At the other meeting at which Egan was present in Britain Street the failure of the attempts was discussed. I remember another meeting held in the Winter Garden Palace (Egan was not present at this), Joe Brady, Dan Curley, myself and Fagan were there. Some men from near Mullingar were there. The subject under discussion was Mrs. Smyth's murder. The men from the country wanted to know Smyth's address. It was not known (that is, where he was staying at the time). I believe Pat Egan supplied the funds. He gave money to Joe Brady and Dan Curley. The latter told me this himself, and it was generally believed and accepted that funds were forthcoming from Egan. I went to America early in 1883. When I went to America I went to a situation, in which I stayed till I got sick. I was afterwards at a lot of things-peddling, canvassing, etc. Frank Byrne employed me for a little in his public-house in New York. I also called on Mr. and Mrs. Ford. They were unable to get me anything to do. They have no influence there"—The date was added subsequently—the letter A at the beginning was the letter selected—when Molloy handed the statement back to me I told him that I should take it over to London, and arrange about his being examined, and we had some general conversation about himself personally—in reading the statement, when he came to that part where he said if necessary they were to lose their life, he got very much agitated, and said something about coming to that or coming to this, meaning the giving of the statement I suppose—he was so much agitated that he could not go on, and I said, "Here's what I have written; if you cannot trust me I will take it and burn it, and all that is in it and what has passed between us will remain between us"—he said, "Go on," and then we continued—he spoke of how different people had been affected by this movement—he said some had got their thousands of money, and some had got their thousands of acres of land (he mentioned P. J. Sheridan in America),</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080057"/>
               <p>and some had got the rope—he mentioned the number of acres of land that Sheridan had got in America; whether it was a thousand or thousands—I said that as far as the law was concerned the Commission would make that all right for him—that he had an opportunity now of getting rid of the consequences, as far as the law was concerned, referring to the certificate which the Commissioners had power to give, and that he could start again, and leave that all behind him—he simply assented to that; he did not say very much; it was not an observation that called for any reply from him—the interview then closed, after lasting close on three hours, and I arranged to meet him at the Wicklow Hotel when I came back from London—I said I should go to London with the object of giving his statement to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and getting a subpoena for him—he said he could not go without one—I think I was to leave a message for him at the office of the Directory, in Fleet Street, Dublin, before 12 on the following Friday, the 30th—directly Molloy left Mr. Beauchamp came into the room—I went to the door with Molloy and showed him out, and as I came back to the hall door Mr. Beauchamp was coming down stairs—we met in the hall, and we both came into the study together, and I took up the statement and showed it to him, and pointed out to him that the paper had a Government stamp upon it, and some conversation ensued between us—it could not have been more than a minute or two after Molloy left that I showed the statement to Mr. Beauchamp—the two dates that are on it were put on at the same time in London—when I was asked to put the date on which it was taken down, I made a calculation in my own mind, and I immediately remembered it was a wrong date, and I struck it out and entered it again—I think it was the 22nd, the tail of the two is like a four—that was struck out and the date was put in—on the 27th I came to London with the statement, and saw Mr. Soames—I obtained a summons for the attendance of Molloy as a witness before the Commission—I received certain instructions from Mr. Soames, and returned to Dublin on the night of Thursday, the 29th, arriving on the morning of the 30th—I went to the office of the Directory, and left a note for Molloy to call at the Wicklow Hotel—he came there—I told him I had got a summons for him—I went over to 8, Dorset Street, a gymnasium—he came there, and I gave him the summons, and asked him to arrange to go across to London that night, and I gave him £4 for his conduct-money—he said he could not go without letting his friends know about his having got the summons, and I think he said he was not sure about going, but he arranged to meet me later that afternoon at the same place—it was at the next interview that he said that he was not sure that he could go at all; he was to meet me later in the afternoon at the same place—I met him—he then said he could not go away without paying some debts that he owed up and down, meaning that he owed several debts—I told him that I could not help him in that, and that there was no reason why he should pay them; that they would not expect him to have money to pay his debts, or something of that sort—he said he had got one name, and he did not want to get another—I then asked him to tell me the amount of the debts, and to whom he owed them—he said he owed £6 to one and £5 to another; he would not say who the people were—I expressed some surprise at his owing so much money to anyone—he said they had lent it to him when he needed it—I said that I could not pay it—he said that unless he got the money to pay his debts he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080058"/>
               <p>could not go—I asked him if his friends knew that he had got the summons—he said, "Yes," and expected that he would not go—an appointment was then made for a third meeting on the same day—between the second and third appointment I wrote a letter, and took it with me to the third meeting—no then repeated that he could not go without his debts were paid—I told him I could not give him the money, but I handed him the letter—he read it; he tore it—I told him he had better keep it—he shook his head and said "No," and he went and put it in the fire and it was burnt—(<hi rend="italic">A press copy of the letter was put in and read as follows:</hi> 30th November, 1888. Dear Sir,—I have considered your proposal that I should advance you £11 before leaving, and I have come to the determination that I ought not to do so. I am willing to give you the guarantee you require for your father and mother, if your giving evidence should lead to the necessity for their going. I think it also fair to give you a guarantee that you will be provided with means to take you wherever you want to go, because, as you say, you could no longer remain here. I will also give you a guarantee that, as this is taking you away from a present means of remuneration, living, and paying your debts, you shall get a full equivalent; and further, that you will not be dealt with in any niggardly spirit in considering these matters. Beyond that I do not think it would be honourable to go, and I am sure, upon reflection, you will agree with me. P. S.—I gave your statement to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> solicitor, after satisfying myself I was at liberty to give you this assurance.")—I asked him to think it over again, and to meet me that evening at the same place at nine or half-past, I am not sure which—that was a fourth meeting—I returned to keep that appointment, but he did not come, and I saw him no more that day—next morning (Saturday, 1st December) I did see him; I think I sent a telegram to him—I met him at the Wicklow Hotel in Wicklow Street, and either there or in Dawson Street I asked him if he would go to London with me—he said he would not go, and in the end I asked him, either at that interview or a subsequent one on the same day, if I met him next morning (Sunday) at the mail train Westland Row Station with the money he wanted, would he fetch two envelopes and post the money to the people he owed it to there, and go on to London with me by the mail—he agreed to do that—between that time and the next morning I got the money, a £5 Bank of England note and a £5 Bank of Ireland note, and £1—I took the numbers of the notes—next morning I went to Westland Row shortly after six; the mail train leaves at seven, I think—shortly after the prisoner came alone—he produced two envelopes addressed, and I put £6 into one of them and a £5 note into the other, and we both went down to the letter-box outside the station, and he posted them—we then came back to the ticket office together, he following me—I got a ticket for myself, he went as if to get his, but turned back and said, "I don't think I can go," or something like that—I said he had bettor come—he said "No"—I urged him a little still to go, but he said "No," he would not go until he was fetched, or unless he was fetched—as I had returned to the platform in front of the prisoner I noticed two men sitting on a seat there, and when Molloy came on to the platform I observed that he caught sight of them, and I thought their eyes met—I think that was before we had posted the letters—I am not very sure whether it was or not—we both passed in front of those men, at some distance from them—beyond the</p>

               <p>meeting of their eves I did not see anything pass between them, but they both seemed to recognise each other—I think it may have been after posting the letters, because I think at first he did not come right up to the platform, I met him on the steps, I am not quite positive; if it was after the posting, it would be as I was making my way to the ticket office—when I found he would not go I handed him a notice stopping payment of the bank notes, which I had prepared the night before—I said I would put that in the papers—he said I might—he then went away—I did not see any more of the two men—I did not come out the same way—I came to London that night, and saw Mr. Soames on Monday, the 3rd—on the 4th I swore a joint affidavit with Mr. Soames, on which a warrant was granted for the prisoner's arrest, and to bring him over to London to give evidence before the Commission—I was in Court on 7th December when he was called into the witness-box, sworn, and examined—I heard the evidence which he then gave.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>). There are two Mr. Beauchamps, solicitors; one in Dublin and one in Limerick—the Dublin gentleman is my employer; he is in no way connected with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Commission—I know nothing beyond what I see in the papers, but I believe Mr. Beauchamp, of Limerick, is connected with the Commission—I first began to collect evidence for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> early in November last or the latter end of October—I was asked to do it by a letter direct from Mr. Soames, directed to Mr. Robert Beauchamp—my salary with Mr. Beauchamp was a yearly one, and averaged between £200 and £300 a year—I was managing clerk and confidential clerk—I was never in the service of the Crown Solicitor in Ireland; I was in three solicitors' offices before Mr. Beauchamp's—none of them were Crown Solicitors when I was with them; Mr. Gibbons became so years afterwards—I am in the habit of taking evidence and taking proofs—I have seen several witnesses besides Molloy; not half a dozen; I have seen a good many persons who were probably witnesses—I think I have taken the proofs of four persons, including Molloy, and a man named O'Connor—two of those witnesses have been called before the Commission—I did not go to Limerick or Kerry; I have never taken evidence out of Dublin; I have not seen people out of Dublin; I have never been out of Dublin</p>

               <p>to collect evidence—I should say there might have been nearly a dozen I have seen—I saw them sometimes in my business hours, sometimes not—sometimes they came to Mr. Beauchamp's office; Mr. Beauchamp left me free in the matter—in the first instance Mr. Soames's request was a very limited one, but it drifted altogether beyond my ideas and beyond Mr. Beauchamp's—at first the duty put upon me was a slight one, but it developed in a way we could not foresee—I know Mr. Houston now; I believe he is the secretary of the Irish Patriotic League; I do not know it; I only know it as anyone else knows it, by reading it in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, or hearing it in society; I never met him over here till I met him after I was engaged by Mr. Soames—I think that was before Molloy gave evidence—that was the first time I had seen Mr. Houston, or the first time I had any connection with him in reference to this case—I have not received any payment as payment from the <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi> what I did in taking the proofs of witnesses was at the request of Mr. Soames, and I suppose Mr. Soames does not intend to take my work for nothing—it was not exactly in the expectation of a reward when Mr. Soames asked me to do what I did; I did not care whether I had money or not; I am expacting more than my money out of pocket for the service I have rendered in this case—Thomas O'Connor was one of the witnesses called before the Commission—I was in Belfast two or three years ago—I have been engaged in an action against the <hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal</hi>, the case is pending; they had been holding me up to ridicule—I saw O'Connor about the same time I saw Molloy—I did not ask O'Connor to try and tell what he knew about moonlighting and about Mr. Harrington, a Member of Parliament—I did not force him to make a statement; the declaration was made by him of his own free will—I did nothing but put it in shape—I think I should know O'Connor's handwriting if I saw it—it is not an easy thing to speak offhand to handwriting—I have a recollection of his handwriting (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I can't say this is his—it is as likely not to be his as it is to be his—I am certain it is not his composition—I introduced myself to Molloy as Thompson—that was the first time I have taken the name of Thompson, or any other name—I did not tell Molloy that I had a friend a director of a railway company—Mr. Day is a clerk in the office of the Patriotic Union—he is a friend of Mr. Houston; he is not a friend of mine—I can hardly say how long I have known him—I have been for months past at the office of the Irish Royal and Patriotic Union—I went there because I knew the assistant-secretary, Mr. Cox—I never met Mr. Houston there—I did not take the guarantee from Houston in the first instance—I never took a guarantee from Mr. Houston—I understood it came from Mr. Soames—I did not tell Molloy's father and mother that I had a friend a director of the London and North-Western Railway Company—I did not tell Molloy that I would buy a number of copies of the directory if it was a good advertising medium—I think on the Sunday after Molloy would not come across to London I sent him a memorandum in pencil which was something to that effect—I then had his statement—I wrote that memorandum because I had heard that Molloy had been got hold of by the Land League, and that he was trying to get money from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and I went to see Mr. Soames before I could know what was to be done—the memorandum is "Sunday, 1st December"—when I first went to Molloy I knew it was to get evidence</p>

               <p>to establish a connection which they believed to exist—I did not know the names mentioned before the Commission—I knew the class of evidence I was to get up—I did not know the names the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> thought most material to get evidence about—I mean to say that I had not the slightest idea of the evidence Molloy was to give me—the evidence wanted was to prove the connection between the Land League and crime—I had not in my mind any person—I did not care about the names; as a fact I did not know them—I did not suggest Patrick Egan to the prisoner, I swear that, and I was surprised to hear him say so—I never suggested the name to him—he said that Egan was present, and then I said, "Is that Patrick Egan, the secretary of the Land League? <hi rend="italic">n</hi>—I mentioned the name of Eugene Davis, of Paris, but not till after his statement was taken—I mentioned the name of Michael Davitt after his statement—I did not mention Mr. Parnell, or John O'Connor, or Mat Harris; no other name but Michael Davitt and Eugene Davis—we had a great deal of general conversation, and I said, "I have never heard Mr. Davitt's name in connection with anything"—I was referring to the character for honesty which Davitt has among friends and foes—I did not first hear of Davis's name from Mr. Houston; I think it was from Mr. Cox; not in connection with letters—my recollection is that I simply heard that Davis and Davitt had been in Dublin together—I had no object in mentioning Davitt's name—I knew that he was a prominent leader in the Irish party—I mentioned Davis's and Davitt's names without any object; I swear that—I did not ask Molloy if he could give any information about them—I did not mention Mr. Biggar, or any other name—I first told Molloy I was an accredited agent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> the evening I met him in Fitzwilliam Square—that would be 21st November, I believe, and it was next evening, the 22nd, that he first gave me the verbal statement—I took his written statement on the 26th, it was almost the same that he had told me on the 22nd—I showed that written statement to Mr. Beauchamp—the alteration in the date was made in London; I can't say the date—I think it was made in Mr. Soames's office, I am not sure; both were made at the same time, with the some pen; you will see there is a difference in the ink, one is in plain ink, and the other in copying ink; they were done at one and the same moment—when I said I would like to have more particulars as to the terms of subscription for his book, I wanted to give him the impression that I had fallen into his trap—I don't think I was trapping him except about the money; it was a deliberate trap his wanting to get the money, I have no doubt about that—I don't think it was a question of diamond cut diamond—when I wrote the letter I did not know into whose hands it might come, and I did not know the extent as to which he was in communication with other persons at the time—he mentioned to me a man named Boland, and I knew enough of Boland to think he would probably try and get Molloy to get money from me—I did not write this letter in order to entrap Molloy into a reply, I simply wanted to keep him there till I should see Mr. Soames—when he came to the part in the written statement about sacrificing life he was agitated, I don't say with fear—he was not laughing at me, I think it was because he could not reflect upon what he had gone through; if he was at all a human being he could not but be agitated by what he had passed through—I can't say when he first knew my real name—there was no attempt to</p>

               <p>conceal my name after I explained to him who I was—I don't know whether he knew it before—he may not have known it on the 26th, but there was no attempt at concealment—I think probably he may not have known my name was Walker, and that I was in Mr. Beauchamp's office, because he said afterwards, "I do not even know your name;" he was satisfied that I was an agent for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—the paper I took the statement bears the Crown stamp—it is not such as was in on which use in Mr. Beauchamp's office, it is such as Government officials use, it is Government paper—Molloy told me at the second interview that Boland knew more about these things than he did—this guarantee was communicated to me, as I understood, from Mr. Soames, not from Houston; there was no communication from Houston, or from me to him—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the meaning of your swearing at the Police-court,"I communicated first with Mr. Houston as to the guarantee previously spoken of?"—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not directly with me at all; that was done through Mr. Cox; I never wrote to Mr. Houston myself at all, it was not done at my dictation; Mr. Cox wrote of his own motion—I asked Molloy if he had met Egan at a meeting which he mentioned—I did not say "at a meeting of the Invincibles," not till he told me—I can explain that—that was at another meeting; I was taking down his statement that there was a meeting of Invincibles where Mrs. Smythe's murder was discussed, and I asked him if he had met <hi rend="italic">Pat</hi> Egan, the treasurer of the Land League, at that meeting; that was after he had told me that he had met Egan at a meeting where Judge Lawson's murder was discussed—when I got this statement in writing I did not intend that he should sign it; I did not ask him to sign it—I got it to give to Mr. Soames—I did not reduce into writing what he told me on 22nd December, because I told him I would not do it—I told him at 25, Fitzwilliam Square that Mr. Beauchamp would become personally bound to the extent of £50—Mr. Beauchamp was in the room then; it was mentioned in Mr. Beauchamp's presence—. I have not told the jury that after that was discussed between me and Molloy Mr. Beauchamp was rung for—we had discussed it before, the sum that would be necessary, in Fitzwilliam Square on the 26th, not at the interview you are talking about, at another, later—he came there twice that day—he first came there, and then went to Foster Place—I did not describe it to the jury as all one interview—he first came about five in the afternoon, and we talked over the amount that would be necessary; then we went to Foster Place, merely to identify Mr. Beauchamp, and then in the evening I told him I would get Mr. Beauchamp to give the guarantee—the interview when I took the written statement lasted about three hours—if I was merely copying the statement it would not perhaps take more than twenty minutes—he did not dictate it fluently, we discussed it, as anyone has to do who is taking down evidence from a witness; you must always discuss evidence to get it—the reducing it into writing did not take three hours; there was of course Mr. Beauchamp's interview, the whole of it would take some time, first arranging to get Mr. Beauchamp, then his coming, and his having it—Molloy said he was committing himself to me by giving me the statement; that was his view of it—I should have asked him to sign it in the first instance if he had made no objection, of course it was no use asking him to sign it when he objected to his name being on it—I believed that he was telling</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080063"/>
               <p>me the truth—I asked Mr. Beauchamp to explain how the Crown-stamped paper came there—I had never seen paper like that at Mr. Beauchamp's before, it is not an ordinary thing to find Government paper in a private house—of course I had seen paper like that before—I had not been at Mr. Beauchamp's house before—my object was simply to ask Mr. Beauchamp how it came in his house—it was not for the purpose of identifying the statement that Molloy had made; I had no thought of that kind in my mind—I don't know that I would apply the word "dishonest" to Molloy—it first struck me that he would go back from what he had said when he began to ask for money; I then knew he had been tampered with, that some influence was brought to bear upon him—I was not trying to trap him at the latter end—I wrote one letter to him, that was intended to deceive the persons who were influencing him—I did not write one letter at the beginning to deceive him, not when I wrote as Thompson, that was with a desire to bring about an interview; not that I wanted to see him about the directory, but that I wanted to see him—he spent some time with me during these two or three hours at the Star and Garter, and visiting me both morning and evening—when I arranged to meet him at the Star and Garter I gave him a pound to pay for his dinners every day—on the day that I gave him the subpoena I gave him a pound—he said he wanted to get some underclothing; that he could not go across without—I suppose he meant shirts—I gave him one or two pounds then—altogether I gave him £7—I don't consider that I gave him the £11—Mr. Soames gave me £5—£4 of that was his conduct-money—I did not give him anything for loss of time, or promise him any, nothing beyond what was in the letter—I did not tell him that I knew Davitt was in touch with Eugene Davis—I did not say that I knew Davitt was a Fenian, or that I knew Davis was a Fenian—I did not say that I knew Mr. Kerry—I have said before that I did not suggest that Davitt and Davis were not in any way connected with this case—it was a matter of gossip after his statement was closed—I began by asking him if he was a member of the League and then a Fenian—I was not anxious to establish a connection between the Land League and the Fenians—my asking him if he were a clerk in the Land League was a slip at the time, I confused him with some other name—I know that name, but I would rather not tell it you—I would rather not give you the names of the other two persons who were not called as witnesses, because I believe it would endanger their lives—I communicated with Houston the day after Molloy made the verbal statement, on 22nd November, it came to me from Cox—I consider that Mr. Soames must have heard of me through Houston, but I had never met Houston.</p>

I am a solicitor, practising in Dublin, at Foster Place—I have a brother in Limerick, also a solicitor—I have done no work for the Government or for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Mr. Walker is my managing and confidential clerk—in consequence of a communication from Mr. Soames, in November last, I gave Mr. Walker permission to inquire into evidence for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—on 22nd November I recollect Mr. Walker being in my study at my private house in Fitzwilliam Square—he asked my permission to bring somebody there that evening—on Monday, 26th, the defendant came to my office just as I was signing my letters; it was after five, he came in and asked me about a book; I did not know him at the time—I said I had not time to buy books—Mr. Walker came in immediately afterwards, and said it was all right; of course, I guessed then that it was some evidence about the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he said something to me about his seeing me afterwards—I saw Molloy again that evening at my private house, in the study—I knew he was to be there—Mr. Walker asked me not to be out of the house—the servant came and said I was wanted, and I went down into the study—Walker asked me would I give a guarantee to Molloy that he, Walker, was engaged for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I said I would, and I told Molloy he was quite safe in anything Mr. Walker promised him to do—Mr. Walker said my promise would involve me in about £50—I said I was quite willing to give my promise; I knew that it was to pay for Molloy and his family—I left the room immediately afterwards—when Molloy went, I heard the door shut, and came down immediately, and met Mr. Walker in the hall, coming from the hall door; we went into the study together, and the first thing he asked me was what was the meaning of the Government stamp on the paper which he had used—I said, "Oh, that's all right; it is easily explained"—my brother-in-law had just been engaged on relief works in the West of Ireland under the Government, and when they were finished he came to my house to stop with me, and left a few sheets of stamped paper in an open drawer in front of my table in the study—at the same time that Walker showed me the statement he showed me another sheet of paper with something on it; of course I looked for myself afterwards, and there was "Pa" on it; I saw it at the time—there were three sheets of paper with the statement—he handed them to me afterwards, and asked me to read them—I said, "No,"I did not want to read anything out of curiosity—when I came down on being called by the servant Mr. Walker turned to Molloy, and asked him whether he would like me to take the statement or himself, and because I looked surprised he said immediately afterwards to Molloy, "Perhaps it is better I should do"—Molloy said he would sooner have Mr. Walker take it, and I walked out of the room; my-brother-in-law is now in Mexico; he is an engineer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The desk in my study is on a writing-table containing notepaper and a lot of my own loose papers and brief papers—the Crown paper was on the top—Mr. Walker appeared vexed, and said, "How did this come here? it is awkward"—I quite understood that he meant something might be said about the Government being mixed up with it, there was a paper in his hand; he might have shoved this aside, and</p>

               <p>taken other paper underneath if he had liked—I don't remember ever having seen the statement after that night; I don't remember ever seeing it again—the other piece of paper he handed to me when he walked out of the study; he asked me would I like to read it; I did not read it; I had no curiosity in the matter—I was not examined at the Police-court—this is the first time I have given evidence in this case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The evidence given by the prisoner before the Commission was put in and read. In substance it amounted to a denial of Mr. Walker's evidence, and that he had ever made the statements attributed to him.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY TAGAART</hi>. I live at 59, Mount Pleasant Square East, Dublin—I was for many years a client of the late Mr. William Stewart, a solicitor, of 5, St. Andrew's Street, Dublin-; he died in October, 1882—I am not in any profession; I am of independent means—I am now a client of the son of Mr. Stewart—for about, sixteen years I have been in the habit of going to the office at 5, St. Andrew's Street; that is a street off Dame Street—I saw the prisoner from time to time when he was employed in that office; I think he went to the office very young—in January, 1883, I had not read in the newspapers the examination of Robert Farrell before the Magistrate—one Monday morning, towards the middle or end of January, I remember going to Mr. Stewart's office; I could not fix the date; it was about half-past eleven to twelve—as I was going there I saw the prisoner in Grafton Street, about half a mile from the office; he spoke to me; I cannot actually fix the words he said, but he gave me to understand that he was the Molloy that was mentioned in the paper that morning, and that Farrell was after swearing against him—he did not say where he had seen what Farrell had said, but every person in Dublin at that time knew who Farrell was—I did not know Until I read the paper; I read the paper after I had seen Molloy, the next day, I think—I saw no more of Molloy until he came back from America, twelve months or more afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. He said nothing more to me than I have stated; he did not say that he was the Molloy mentioned in the paper that morning—I knew him for five years in Mr. Stewart's office, and if I met him in the street I could speak to him—he did not go on to say what he was going to do, or why he wanted to tell me this, and I did not ask him; I did not want to know anything about him. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. He seemed to be in a hurry, and a little nervous, that was all; I was not three seconds speaking to him—I think it was next day that I read the paper; or perhaps that evening—I could not fix more definitely what was said—I always Knew him to be a decent fellow in the office, and I never thought of his having anything to do with the Phoenix Park—he mentioned the name of Farrell, and that he was after,. swearing against him; he did not say when, it should have been the Saturday before—I read next day some of Farrell's evidence—the name of Molloy was in the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a convict undergoing a sentence of penal servitude for life for the murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke—the first conviction was on 3rd January, 1883, for attempting to assassinate Judge Lawson—my sentence for that was 10 years—it was two or three months afterwards that I was sentenced for the Phoenix Park murders—I was first sentenced to death, and that was commuted to penal servitude for life—I was a Fenian first in 1869, when I was about 19 years of age—the object of the Fenian Brotherhood was to establish the independence of Ireland by force of arms—I became a member of the Invincible organisation at the latter end of 1881—the object of that organisation was to assassinate all the Government officials in authority in Ireland—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance in 1880—I met him at James Mullett's public-house in Dorset Street—I do not know whether Molloy was a Fenian at that time, but there was no one present at Mullett's but Fenians; it was the Anniversary of the Manchester Martyrs—James Carey was there; Thomas Brennan, then secretary to the Land League; Daniel Delaney, my brother; Daniel Curley, John Tarff, and several others—I knew Michael Fagan; he was at that meeting—there are officers in the Fenian brotherhood called Centres, Sub-centres, and B. 's—the prisoner was a Sub-centre to Michael Fagan at the latter end of 1881 or the commencement of 1882—Fagan was afterwards hanged for his participation in the Phoenix Park murders—arms were served out to Fenians by the Fenian organisation at large—generally the Sub-centres handed them over—Molloy gave me a short Snider rifle and a sword bayonet—I had a long rifle before that—James Mullett had some rifles for the American organisation; that was how they came to that Circle—there were different Circles—the Centres were duly elected from the body of men they represented—James Mullett was a Centre at one time; he was the Centre of Molloy's Circle; after him Thomas Fitzpatrick, he was before Fagan—Fagan was not Centre at the time—Molloy was Sub-centre; he was on the directory, and chairman of the Centres at Dublin; he would be duly elected to be put on the directory—I first knew Patrick Egan about 1875—I knew him to speak to—I knew Thomas Brennan about that time too—Egan was then manager of the North-East Millen Company in Dublin, and he was the recognised leader of the Fenian organisation in Dublin at that time—about 1880 I saw Egan several times; I saw him at a Land League meeting in the Rotunda about that time, I am not sure—all the prominent members of the Land League at that time were there—when I became an Invincible in 1881 there were also among the members James Carey (I knew him to be a leader of the Fenian organisation in Dublin in 1875), P. J. Sheridan, Thomas Curry, county Sligo; No. 1, Tynan, he would not tell his name, he used to go as No. 1; James Mullett, Peter Carey, brother of James Carey; Daniel Curley, he was hanged for his part in the Phoenix Park murders; Joseph Brady, he was also hanged for the Phoenix Park murders; Tim Kelly, he was hanged; Thomas Caffery, Edward McCafferty, Joseph Hanlon, Laurence Hanlon, he got penal servitude for life; Robert Farrell, William Maroney, Edward O'Brien, Thomas Doyle, James Boland, Michael O'Dwyer, a man named Duffey, I don't know his Christian name; and several others whose names I can't think of—I have met the prisoner at the meetings, I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080067"/>
               <p>sure of that, because the Invincibles allow no person except Invincibles to be present at their meetings—the principal leaders of the Invincible organisation were Patrick Egan, Thomas Brannan, and P. J. Sheridan—all their funds were supplied by the Land League—I have seen money passing from Frank Byrne, the secretary of the Land League in London, to Joseph Brady; he was an Invincible—Daniel Delaney was present when the money was given, and Joseph Mullett—I do not know what money passed at that time—all the money was sent from Paris at that time for the support of the Invincible party—they got no money from any other source except the Land League—they had an oath administered to them when I joined—I had the oath administered to me by Daniel Delaney, my brother—in 1882 the Right Hon. W. E. Forster was Chief Secretary for Ireland—I attended meetings as an Invincible in relation to him; the first meeting about Mr. Forster was on Queen Street Bridge, Dublin—the object of that meeting was to assassinate the Chief Secretary; that was the first meeting I attended, there were several before that—at that meeting there were present James Carey, Daniel Curley, Joseph Brady, Timothy Kelly, Laurence Hanlon, Joseph Hanlon, Henry Rose, Patrick Molloy, I am sure he was there; William Maroney, Edward O'Brien; I don't remember any others, there might be, unknown to me—they would watch Mr. Forster every meeting; he was to be assassinated that morning in passing the Quay—the parties I have named were told off to watch him, with the object of assassination—I watched him, where he was to pass near the Quay, that was Ellis Quay; I think that would be a road he would go from the Phoenix Park to the Castle, that was the way he would have to pass—on that occasion I saw the prisoner coming from chapel with James Carey that morning, whilst I was standing on the bridge where I was posted—they were coming from Arran Quay Chapel towards the bridge—Mr. Forster did not pass that morning—he was watched again in the evening by the same party—the prisoner was there—Mr. Forster did not pass that evening; I think his carriage passed with luggage in it, but he was not in the carriage—he was watched next morning at half-past six; the prisoner was there—Mr. Forster did not come—Joseph Mullett and Michael Fagan always accompanied the prisoner on these occasions; they always went together—the Phoenix Park murders were on 6th May, 1882—after that a man named Hines was executed—he was tried in Dublin before Mr. Justice Lawson—Mr. Anderson was Crown Solicitor at that time—after Hines's trial there was a meeting of the Invincibles with the object to assassinate the jury that tried the case, and the Judge and the Crown Solicitor—at that time I had never seen Mr. Justice Lawson or Mr. Anderson—the prisoner was present at the meeting I have spoken of, in the Four Courts, Dublin—he was not present at the meeting to consider the assassination of Mr. Justice Lawson, the jury, and Mr. Anderson; it was only the executive and leaders of the Invincibles who were present—four of them were elected to carry out that deed, and then they would elect the party they would bring with them—Molloy and Boland were not at the meeting I am talking of, they were afterwards; it was Molloy that pointed out Mr. Justice Lawson; he knew him, also Mr. Anderson—he also got means to find out the addresses of the jury, their capacity of life—they could do it better than any other men because they had more time to themselves during the day; that was arranged at a meeting; I do not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080068"/>
               <p>whether Boland and the prisoner were at that meeting—Frank Byrne brought the orders; No. 1, Tynan, was there before him, and said that Frank Byrne would come—I am speaking from my own knowledge; I was there—the Crown Solicitor and the Judge were to be assassinated one night, and the twelve jurymen on another night, all together—I remember going to the Courts to have a look at Mr. Justice Lawson; James Mullett, Brady, Laurence Hanlon, and Patrick Molloy were with me—the Court was sitting when we got there; we went out before the Court rose, and went to Chancery Place at the back of the Four Courts, and stood against the private gate coming out of the Four Courts for Molloy to point out Mr. Justice Lawson and Mr. Anderson—the Judge had his robes on in Court—while we were standing at the gate, the Judge and Mr. Anderson came out through the gateway; Molloy pointed and said, "This is Mr. Anderson and Judge Lawson now"—this was on Friday evening, the 9th or 10th November, 1882, I am not sure—we followed Mr. Anderson and Mr. Justice Lawson to the Law Temple, the King's Inn, Bolton Street; the prisoner was there with Mullett, Brady, and Laurence Hanlon, and myself; he was on the opposite side of the street—I and Brady followed the Judge and Mr. Anderson, and Joseph Mullett and Laurence Hanlon followed after—the Judge and Mr. Anderson went up Henrietta Street to the Temple, and Molloy and Laurence Hanlon were left there to watch them coming out; the remainder were told to return at half-past eight—we did so—on my return I saw James Mullett and McCafferty coming down on Kavanagh's car—Molloy was there and Laurence Hanlon—Molloy and Hanlon were told off to watch the way the Judge and Mr. Anderson would go from the Temple—we all retired then to Little's public-house in King Street, where the remainder of the Invincible party was—Molloy was there; he came in immediately afterwards—orders were given to be at Fitzwilliam Square at ten next morning, and Merrion Square South—the Judge was to be assassinated that morning in passing; that would be the Saturday morning about 11th November, I think; every person was told to have a six-chambered revolver with him—I had three to carry that morning, one belonging to Brady, and another belonging to James Mullett; I think they were afraid of being arrested with them on them; they gave them to me the night before to carry—I met Molloy that morning at the Queen's Quay, Brunswick Street, going there; he was the first I met—I complained to Molloy at having to carry the revolvers without having the price of a car—he said my brother had got plenty of funds for that, and he should supply me with it—I know that Molloy had a revolver; I saw the mark of it on his coat, he had a short light coat—it was one of the revolvers which James Boland brought—Molloy showed it to me; I did not see the pattern of it before that; it was a different pattern to what we had—we went to Merrion Square South, and more went to Fitz william Square and Fitzwilliam Street—Molloy showed me the revolver in a laneway as you go in to Merrion Road, I think, leading from Westland Road to Merrion Square—I went to Merrion Square, and there met the same party of the Invincibles—the Judge did not pass, or he passed some other way, and he was missed—the party then retired to a publichouse in Bagot Street, and an arrangement was come to to be in the same place at half-past four; I went there at half-past four—the prisoner was there, James Mullett and Joe Brady; I and Laurence</p>

               <p>Hanlon were at the comer of Fitzwilliam Square; I was along with him; Molloy was at the corner of Bagot Street, and just as the Judge left his house, with four men guarding him, Kavanagh's car came down with Mullett and Brady on it from Fitzwilliam Place—Mullett said to me, "Follow on, <hi rend="italic">Pat"</hi> and he went straight down to Merrion Square on the car; we passed the Judge and his four men—Mullett and Brady told Molloy the same as me, to follow on—I know that of my own personal knowledge; I heard it—the car went on to the corner of Holles Street, Merrion Square North—I followed on the Judge and the four men; two of them were walking behind him and one on each side of the street; I followed the Judge until I was arrested—the car stood at the comer of Holles Street—Molloy and the others were intended to go round Denzil Street and Great Brunswick Street, and meet the Judge in the face coming round by the college—the car went by Denzil Street, Westland Road and Great Brunswick Street to meet the Judge that way—after passing Lincoln Place I plucked one of the guards on the opposite side by the arm or elbow, and told him to mind the Judge; he took no heed of me; I was on the opposite side of the Judge then—when I got to Kildare Clubhouse I plucked him again by the arm, but he took no notice—I then crossed the street to where the Judge and the two men were behind him; there was a young man along with the Judge at this time—just as I left the street getting into the tow-path I was knocked down; I was just getting on the tow-path to tell the other two policemen behind the Judge as I was knocked down—I can't say who knocked me down—I was just tripped on my knee; I was not knocked down altogether, just tripped up on the left knee—I have been in custody ever since—at the time I was tripped up I had a six-chamber revolver on me—the other two I gave up to the persons that owned them, Mullett and Brady—the last time I saw Molloy was driving on the car the way they were to come round to meet us—I knew Robert Farrell; he turned informer—I have since heard a statement of his read from a paper in Court—it was Robert Farrell, Kavanagh and James Carey who identified me—Carey turned informer—the places where the Invincibles used to meet were Little's public-house in North King Street; the Winter Palace at the corner of Cuffe Street and Stephen's Green was a favourite house; Clarey's public-house, off Grafton Street; Ready's public-house in Britain Street, opposite the Rotunda Hospital; the Royal Oak, Park Gate Street, King's Bridge—James Mullett's public-house was in Dorset Street; it had no sign—at all these public-houses the Invincibles used to meet; there was another favourite house, Doyle's, in Great Brunswick Street, the corner of Shaw Street—there were several drill-rooms for the Fenians, except the Centres, they met in private houses by themselves—one drill-room was in Cuffe Lane; one at 39 or 49, Bolton Street; one in Peter Street, and one in Upper Bridge Street—these houses were used as drill-halls for the Fenian organisation—different circles used to have them, because the men of one circle did not know the men of another—the offices of the Land League were in Sackville Street—I have seen several of the Invincibles whose names I have mentioned go into those offices; Molloy I saw several times going in and out of them—I know the prisoner well—he was a lawyer's clerk at some place off Dame Street, and was a Sub-centre to Michael Fagan.</p>

G. Fitzgerald is not an Invincible to my knowledge—I don't know the year he was tried in Dublin—I gave evidence against him while I was undergoing my present sentence—I identified him as the Supreme Councillor of the Irish Republican Brotherhood—I mentioned that in the hearing of the Dublin jury—the Invincibles were started about the latter end of 1881, shortly before Thomas Brennan's arrest under the Coercion Act; that was the last time I saw him—I never saw him after he came out—I represented to the jury that he was leader of the Invincibles; he was one of the principal starters of it—I have not met him at the Invincible meetings—I do not know that he was arrested in 1881 and released in 1882—the Invincibles were started before I knew anything about it—I have met P.

               <p>mentioned to Mr. Shannon that the object of the Land League and the Fenian movement was the same—I am not sure whether I mentioned it to Sir James Ingham at Bow Street, a man in my position in prison has something else to think of; the more questions are asked the more it is revived in my mind—it occurred to me, several times it occurred to me, to-day, on your cross-examination, and before, but I have not mentioned it up to the present time—I saw Egan shortly before he went to Paris, and bid him the time of day—I think I identified five letters of Egan's before the Commission which I had seen before, James Carey had shown them to me and I read them—I do not remember the whole of the contents—it was at the end of 1882, it might be September—I think there were three from Paris—I remember one undertaking to pay £200 sterling—that was Egan's, he sent that to Mullett—this is the letter; I swear James Carey gave that to me in 1882 in Hines' publichouse—Carey showed me the letter: "March 11, 1882, Dear Sir,—I understand you cannot act as directed unless I forward you money by Monday next; here is £50. Yours truly, Patrick Egan;" and at the end of 1882, October or September, he had the bundle in his hand, and he showed that—I identify that as Egan's writing—I swear that letter was in existence in 1882, I saw it—it offers £50; that was in it—the letter said that I might speak with confidence to Mr. Shannon; that was the nature of the letter, I did not hear it read, but I guessed so; I knew he would not come to prison to visit me unless he was a person who could be depended on—I knew he was a solicitor, because he said so—I knew he was not solicitor to the Land League—I declined to see anybody in prison unless he was a Government official, and I thought he was one—I recollect Mr. Michael Davitt asking me that question before the Commission—Mr. Shannon did not state to me that he was a Government solicitor, but that was the impression left on my mind from what he told me—I believed him to be a Government official from what he told me, and I made a statement, and he swore me—I saw Byrne give money to Joe Brady on the night that he came; there were three at the table, Joe Brady, Delaney, and Mullett; that was the occasion when he took the purse out of his pocket, the second occasion I think—on the first occasion Peter Carey and the same three were present—I saw the money given on the second occasion—Brady never gave money in my presence—Sheridan never gave money—I have never stated that Byrne gave Carey money in my presence; I really mean to adhere to that—James Carey was in prison at the time Frank Byrne came to Dublin—James Carey was a stonemason; it was Peter Carey that Frank Byrne gave money to—I never stated that I saw Frank Byrne give James Carey money, because he was in prison—I only saw him give money once—I never saw him give money to James Carey—I am giving my information more from love of justice than anything else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was at two meetings at which Frank Byrne was; money passed I think at the second meeting, but not at the first; the first was at 49, Conbasson Street, the vocal lodge—I was placed as sentry there to let no one pass—it was an Invincible meeting—I was standing close to where he got off the car, and at the second meeting I was standing at the back of the house—there was a glass door between us, and I saw through it—I have seen Boland with six-chambered revolvers, they came from some part of England; he was sent specially from Dublin</p>

               <p>for them as an Invincible, in the summer of 1882, shortly after the visit Frank Byrne paid—Boland and Molloy were known personally, they belonged to the same Fenian organisation—after I gave evidence Mr. Road applied that I should be detained a few days to be recalled if necessary, and that Mr. John O'Connor desired to be confronted with me, and I was brought down to Mr. Soames' chambers to wait to see if I was wanted again, and I think it was while I was waiting there that I found I had made a mistake in the date of the Saturday—there were two O'Connors—I was not recalled—I saw Egan write several times in 1874 and 1877 at the Mechanics' Institution, sending notes to some of the delegates of the Amnesty Association—I saw Sheridan in the disguise of a Roman Catholic priest several times in Dublin in 1881 and 1882, but never spoke to him—I was told not, because it would rouse suspicion—he was one of the recognised leaders of the Invincible Association, and previous to that he was one of the Supreme Council of the Fenian organisation—that was previous to the Land League—I made a statement in 1883 in my own writing to Surgeon Carty, J. P.—that is the gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>), he was the doctor of the gaol and a resident Magistrate—I saw the letters in Carey's hand, with regard to which I have spoken to-day, this and others—five of them are in Egan's writing, to the best of my belief.</p>

I am Chief Superintendent of the Dublin Metropolitan Police—in May, 1882, at the time of the Phoenix Park murders, I was Superintendent of the detective department in Dublin—I had charge of the investigation of the Phoenix Park murders and other crimes committed there—in January, 1883, I heard Robert Farrell give evidence; he was one of the Invincibles who became an approver—on Saturday, 20th January, he was examined before Mr. Keys, the divisional Magistrate—at that time the following prisoners were in custody in the Court, Joseph Brady, Henry Rose, Thomas Martin, Timothy Kelly, Joseph Hanton, Laurence Hanlon, Peter Doyle, Edward McCafferty, William Moroney, John Dwyer, Daniel Delaney, Joseph Mullett, Peter Carey, Daniel Curley, Patrick Whelan, George Smith, Edward O'Brien, and Michael Fagan—: those persons were then under charge for conspiracy to murder certain Government officials in Ireland, and others—that was a month or six weeks after the attempt on Mr. Justice Lawson, Mr. Forster, the Phoenix Park murders, and Mr. Field, one of the jury who tried Hines—I heard Farrell's evidence at that time; I did not know Patrick Molloy, except by repute—after Farrell had given his evidence, I directed two officers to inquire for and arrest Molloy, for conspiracy to murder—I have the warrant here; it was issued by J. R. Curran (<hi rend="italic">It was put in and read</hi>)—the officers entrusted with that warrant were Sergeant Wilson and Detective Gibling—Molloy was not arrested under that warrant—I knew him by sight before that, in October or November, 1884, that was the time ho returned; I don't know where he was; he was out of Dublin; he returned to Dublin in October, 1884—I did not arrest him under that warrant when he returned; he has not been arrested on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a detective in Dublin since 1881—as a rule, a great number of people go to Glasnevin Cemetery; I would not say half Dublin, I say about 2,000 visited there last year; the prisoner was one among them—I have heard he is about twenty-six years old—I think the Manchester execution was in 1867—I think the young men who met him at North Wall on 19th December belonged to an athletic association.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They will leave no injurious effects—I examined them a week afterwards, and they had all healed.</p>

Box" written over it in ink; that I had seen the postman, and he had given me a description that referred to him, and I believed that he signed the receipt—he said, "Yes, I did; it was for a young man that I met about six months ago. I don't know who he is, only that he is a grocer's assistant"—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "John Box; I met him at the City News Rooms, Ludgate Hill, the next morning, and gave him the letter, and he said that he had got £5 from his father, and he changed the note at the Post-office opposite the News Rooms"—I said, "Has he ever been here, at this house?"—he said, "No, I saw him last Thursday, and he told me he was going to Liverpool last Saturday"—I asked him if he had received any other letters for him—he said, "No," but he expected some—he has not given any further explanation—I searched him and found this paper on him with some addresses on it in pencil—I produce this, written by the prisoner in my presence, "John Box, 59, Bedford Street, Commercial Road East"—I compared that with the address, "F. Seaton, 6, Hermitage Street, Harrow Road," on this paper, and said, "What is that?"—he said, "That is the address of a friend"—I said, "Is it John Box?"—he said, "No"—on the Bank note there is "Thos. Curtis, 14, Wyndham Road, Camberwell"—I have compared these documents with the prisoner's writing, and in my opinion it is the same writing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 148). On the night of February 28th I was on duty in Shirland Road, Paddington, and passed the prisoner's premises at 11.10 p.m., 12.5 p.m., 1 a.m., and 1.50 a.m., everything appeared correct then—about 2 o'clock I heard a police-whistle; went there and saw some people leaving the house; I went inside and saw two policemen there—I assisted in extinguishing the fire and came out—about an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner—he said, "It is a bad job"—I said, "Are you insured?"—he said, "Yes, I don't think I shall get my insurance money as there was a fire two months previous, and I believe there is a statement on my papers that if a fire occurs within a stated time they won't pay the money"—he afterwards said that he wished he was not insured—about a quarter to five I was called to the back parlour and saw a roll of paper smouldering, and there was waste paper and old books in a cupboard; the waste paper was smouldering—a chair had been moved from the cupboard—the plan represents it correctly—I remained till 6 o'clock, and was relieved by another constable; two firemen were left in charge.</p>

I am the engineer in charge of the fire station, Hermitage Street—on March 1st, about 2.6 a.m., I was called by the fire alarm from Warwick Road, and turned out the engine, and went to 1, Shirland Road, where I found the prisoner's shop on fire—the door was closed; I knocked and got no answer—I kicked it open and went downstairs and saw Perrett throwing buckets of water—I went up and found the shop on fire—I got to work and deadened it, and then went down to the bakehouse, and did the same thing there——at the back of the bakehouse there was a thin wooden partition, which divides the bakehouse and makes a store-room—I went round the yard, and pushed open a door in the basement, which was closed with an ordinary lock; I did not notice whether the key was in it; I did not look, because at the fire they had before it was not there—when I got into the store-room I found a lot of sacks alight, and part of the wooden partition burnt away, the side nearest the wall, by the boiler—I threw the sacks into the yard—after that I went into the shop, and had the shutters lifted—I discovered three different fires in the shop, one on the left side behind the counter going in, between the counter and the wall, one in the centre part of the counter by the parlour door, and the third going in by the shop window, between the counter and the lift—the door is between the two windows—the three fires were at three angles of the shop; there was a distinct space between each—there was a quantity of paper biscuit bags in all three places, and in one place a lot of Child's night-lights—the bags had never been used; they were piled together on the floor under the counter, and the floor was alight—the bags covered two or three feet, and were, I think, two inches high—at the second fire there were paper bags partly burnt, and the woodwork was burnt—fire No. 3 had just the same appearance—the night-lights were mixed up in the corner where the fire was, several in boxes, and some loose on the floor—these are two of the singed bags—some of the boxes had the lids on them—there had been a fire in the bakehouse between the two kneading-troughs, which are three or four feet high, and about ten inches apart, and we found several pieces of firewood when we raked it out afterwards, and a lot of <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>, which might have been shavings—there were coverings right along between the two to keep the fire underneath, but we put a branch of the hose in at both ends—there was no fire alight near it to have caused the fire—the furnace boiler was about ten feet off, and the partition, which was alight, thirteen feet—the fire in the big furnace was laid but not alight, the other was alight when I arrived, about 2.15 a. m.—they told me they kept it alight all night—the other fire downstairs was by the partition, by the storeroom—I found several feet of the wooden partition alight, and some sacks which were spread all over the store-room; about 18 of them were alight, but some were hardly damaged—I did not see the fire in the cupboard till some days afterwards, when I saw a lot of paper bags partly burnt, with Mr. Ashby's name on them—there was no connection between the kneading-trough and the furnace, and no connection between the two fires in the basement and the three fires in the shop—the floor near the cupboard was not burnt at all, although things in the cupboard were burnt—I examined the flue and found some plaster broken away—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080086"/>
               <p>probed it with an iron rod but found there was no aperture—the lower part of the flue was blocked up, but the upper part was all right—the flue at the top of the boiler went into the chimney—I examined to see whether any sparks could come through into the shop, and found it was quite impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The vertical boiler has a narrow flue much smaller than the top of the boiler—I did not notice that the iron pipe was quite loose—if the flue was imperfect, burning matter might fall from it on to the floor—I heard that the floor had been put back since the last fire, about Christmas—it was not mentioned that the iron pipe constantly got red hot owing to it being smaller than the boiler—the fire I went to at Christmas was close to the vertical boiler; I cannot say that it arose from it, and I do not suggest that it did not—I saw no marks of burning on the ceiling near the pulley on which the band would run; I examined it on the Saturday after the fire, but did not get on a ladder to look at it—I saw no marks of burning on the lift—I did not pull it up and down—I do not think there are two inches all round between it and the shoot; I did not notice marks of fire there—it was dark, but I had a candle—when one man was above and another below you could not see the light of a candle through the burnt floor in the centre of the shop; the whole of the ceiling was intact, there was not a crack—I picked up over a dozen night-lights loose, and there were four or five boxes not loose—there is some plate-glass on the sides of the shop, that on the right side by the lift was cracked—the front windows were not cracked by the flames—I did not examine the outside at all—when the revolving shutter is down it leaves no door, and there is no door in the shutter, the only exit would be by the side door—I got there about 2. 13 a. m. with a horse machine and a manual engine; we carried a hand pump on the engine—I did not know when I got there that the family had escaped—I' went to the basement first, but I had to pass the shop—I kicked two doors open; one was the door by which the people had gone out and the police had gone in; it had a small catch lock, and no doubt the draught blew it to, but I felt no draught—I do not think the partition was more than seven-eighths of an inch thick—no water had been thrown on the sacks; I carried them out into the yard; six or eight or more had been touched by the flames; I cannot say whether they were the closest to the partition—the furnace is for heating ovens which go under the pavement, and in one I found wooden shavings placed for lighting it—the other fire had burnt out and was warm—I was not a minute in the basement the first time; I then went up to the shop, and they were pumping into it—we opened the shop door from the passage; it was closed but not locked; no one had entered before me—I did not see flames in the shop then, but there was fire burning on the floor, but it never was a full blaze—there was a good deal of smoke in the shop—it is impossible that there was sufficient flame through the revolving shutters to be seen by the people outside—there was plenty of heat in the shop to crack the thick plate-glass, and there may have been a little flame, but not enough for me to take notice of—I could not see across the shop, but when it cleared off we went behind the counter—the floor by the parlour door was partly burnt through, downwards; it was black and charred—I do not suggest that a person holding a candle in the basement would show a light through that part unless they broke the plaster away—I saw some japanned tin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188904080087"/>
               <p>biscuit cases on the shelf above the plate-glass; I did not take them down; I do not think the varnish was entirely peeled off—when the door leading from the shop to the parlour was open there was an aperture between the hinges, and the paint was blistered by the heat on the lower part of the doorpost, within three or four feet of the cupboard—I saw the prisoner, but did not see him helping; I did not see him downstairs; he was in the shop passage half an hour after I went in—I did not see where he came from—he had trousers on, and I think he had a coat—he was not fully dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was in the basement about twenty minutes the second time putting the fire out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in charge of Faraday Road Fire Station, North Kensington—on March 1, about 2. 30, I received an alarm, turned out four men, and went to Shirland Road—I found smoke issuing from the front shop—Totnell was there before me—I found three separate fires in the shop, one in the centre, and one on each side—I found some paper bags—there was no charring on the floor between them—I found two distinct fires downstairs, one between the kneading-troughs, and one at the wooden partition between the furnace and the store-room—the bakehouse ceiling was intact—some days afterwards I found that there had been a sixth fire in a cupboard, and some paper bags were there—it is impossible that those six fires could have originated in a common cause—I found some paper bags partly burnt, some night-lights in boxes and some out, which had probably fallen out—this one appears to have been ignited; part of the tallow is burnt away, others were melted; there were a lot of them together—we cleared out the cupboard on the 9th, and found paper bags, the same as were in the shop; we picked them all out, and there was a square place under them, where the floor was not burnt; there was a mark where they had lain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the paper bags had been crumpled up they would possibly burn more regularly than when flat—the bulk of the nightlights were in boxes—I have been on duty at nineteen stations in twenty three years, and my experience tells me that fire is a very eccentric element in the way it seizes and burns, but not in this case—I have known a fire taking place, and igniting paper, and going out immediately, the floor not being touched—I attended the Christmas fire, I gave the vertical boiler as the cause—the pulley was not moved at my suggestion, but it is further away than it was before—a quantity of sacks were damaged at that fire, and about six feet three inches of partition burnt—I did not get on a chair or ladder, and did not see that the fire had burnt the pulley, or that the band, was blistered by the flame, or that the flame had gone through the apertures of the roller shutters and burnt the facia—no doubt that was through the heat inside the shop—I never saw any flames—the flames in the shop were sufficient to crack the plate-glass and blister the varnish and the canisters—you could walk with comfort between the three fires in the shop—the hand-pump was being used when I arrived, and the shop was full of smoke—I did not see the prisoner till half an hour after the fire was out; he was then in the passage; he had a coat and trousers on, I do not know what else—I saw marks of heat above the canisters—I examined the lift minutely, both top and bottom, as soon as it had cooled down, about a quarter of an hour afterwards; it was partly down when I got there; the case</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman, of Hermitage Street—I went to this fire with Totnell—there were three distinct fires in the shop, and two in the basement—I was the first to go to the cupboard about 4. 45 a. m., and found bags burning; the door was closed, and an arm-chair against it, which I had to remove to open the door—I found inside a quantity of paper bags and waste paper alight, smouldering—the cupboard doors were quite closed; that is in the parlour, which communicates with the shop by a wooden door, which I opened—the cupboard is about ten feet from the nearest of the three fires in the shop—there were no signs of fire outside the cupboard—before I extinguished the fire in the cupboard I asked the prisoner if he knew anything of it; he said, "No, nothing whatever"—I saw a servant on the premises, and the prisoner's wife and a young man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Totnell kick the side door open—I was only a moment in the basement; when I got into the shop I saw a little flame, not much—I did not notice that the show boards had fallen to the ground through the cords being burnt—I could see nothing for smoke—the fire was put out in about twenty minutes; the engines stayed about thirty five minutes—I heard the prisoner say that he thought he could smell fire on the premises; that was earlier than 3.45—I opened the cupboard door at 3. 40—he said, "Don't you think you can smell burning here?"I said, "You have been out in the fresh air, any person coming in from the fresh air will smell fire"—that was before I opened the cupboard door—no one sat down in the easy chair, nor did I see anyone move it to the cupboard door—I did not notice marks of scratching the paint inside the door leading to the parlour.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector X</hi>). On 1st March I received information, went to the prisoner's shop, and told him I was an inspector of police, and as it appeared to be a very suspicious fire, I intended putting some questions to him—I asked him how many persons were resident in the house; he said himself, his wife, nine children, varying from 20 years downwards, two assistants, John and David Trussell, and a servant, Mary Ann Brown; I asked him where they slept; he said that he slept on the first floor with his wife, the two assistants in the room adjoining, and the others above; and in reply to a further question he made this statement in the presence of witnesses, which I read to him, and asked him if it was correct; he said, "Yes," and signed it (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been in business forty-seven years, and had a mortgage of</hi> £1,000 <hi rend="italic">on the house, and had no interest in destroying it; that he fastened the door overnight, and found it fastened when he was aroused from his sleep by the alarm of fire, and had no reason to suppose anyone had entered during the night.</hi>)—I asked him the value of the stock in the shop, he said about £5; I saw he had only seven sacks of flour in the basement—one fire was between the troughs, which are in the form of a "V" with the top covered—the second fire was three feet from the furnace in the partition, and the third in the left-hand corner—I went there again on the Saturday with Totnell and Williams, and carefully examined the flooring, and cleared it away to see that there was no communication from the basement—we also examined the flooring in the back parlour, and the fire had burnt downwards through the floor, but had not reached the ceiling—the prisoner said he had not</p>

               <p>done it; he was perfectly innocent—when I arrested him I found these two letters on him. (<hi rend="italic">One from the London and County Bank, stating that his account was overdrawn</hi> £6 17s. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and asking him to provide for the payment of a promissory note for</hi> £35 <hi rend="italic">due on March</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st; the other was from Mr. Mumford, a miller, pressing for payment of an account</hi>)—he pointed out a hole where the back fire was in the basement, and suggested that a spark might come through the chimney on to some sacks—the superintendant of the Salvage Corps examined it, and failed to find that it was so, but on the second visit I knocked the plaster down and traced that hole to its base, and found it was impossible for any spark to have come through from the flue to the chimney, I found it covered with mortar—the prisoner was present and made no remark—there was no communication between the basement and the shop, only the lift; the flue joins the two, but it was blocked up—the smoke from the engine could be conveyed into the chimney—I said, "There appear to be six distinct fires, can you assign any cause for it?"—he said, "No"—I asked if he had any suspicion of any person, or if any person had got in from the outside—he said, "No—I examined the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> between the troughs, and found a lot of firewood, and a board cutting off the trough towards the end of the oven; it is ten feet from the side of the trough to the furnace fire, and three feet to where the sacks were burnt—I found eighty-two night-lights in boxes, ten or twelve were loose, lying with some paper bags on the floor under the counter, one box had the top off, the others were entirely closed as when they were bought—I think they were under the paper, and they were not destroyed; they were put there as if kept there for sale or use—there were new paper bags all round the counter where the fires were, and in the front parlour there was a lot of old rubbish, toys, and odds and ends, eight or nine inches high, and a lot of rubbish, showing that the cupboard was not in use—there were no night-lights at fires 4 and 5, only paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first examined the cupboard on 1st March, at 1 or 2 p. m.—I think that was after I took Williams's evidence—I asked him if he smelt oil or paraffin—that was before I had been to the premises—I had not made up my mind that I should have to prosecute somebody—I did not say before I put the questions to him that I was going to prosecute him—I had the wife questioned, but did not take any notes—I asked her if her husband came to bed and stayed with her all night, and she told me that from the time she went up till they were knocked up he was by her side—I took the son's statement—it was not necessary to ask him to be a witness—this prosecution is wholly on my responsibility—I never had a complaint from the Insurance Company; I made inquiries there, and took a note—I went there for the purpose of seeing whether his statement was true—the policy consisted of furniture, fixtures, and other property—I had the policy—no notice had been given to me either by the Law or by the Sun—I do not know whether the offices have settled the amount—the Treasury gave me assistance, but would not instruct Counsel, they left the prosecution entirely to me with the exception of advice—I have given notice of the witnesses I intend to call; Mr. Mumford is one of them—I said at the Police-court that I thought the height in the basement from floor to ceiling was 14 feet; I understand I was entirely wrong, and that it is nine feet eight inches—I said that the lift was twenty feet from the boiler, and I have not been told to the contrary—it is four or five feet</p>

               <p>from the lift to the nearest part of the kneading-trough—I did not notice that at the point where the pulley rotates, the ceiling had been cut away for the purpose, exposing four laths—I took two engineers with me to examine every part, and the prisoner was present to point out anything he liked—I asked for legal assistance, and was told that the insurance companies were rich enough to defend their own interests, but they refused, for fear of an action—I have no fear of an action—I think the plate-glass was cracked on the left side, and the Japan canisters blistered—I did not notice that the show-cards were on the floor through the cards being burnt—I differ with the other witness as to the nightlights having fallen out of the boxes partially burnt—I do not know of flames being seen outside through the holes made to ventilate the revolving shutter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fixtures were £400, and the stock £200 under the same policy—the gaselier in the shop was a fixture—when he sent in the claim for £83 they talked it over, and the surveyor said, "This is rather a big claim; what can we settle it at?" and he said, "Well, I will take £37"—that is how it was done—the dough mixing trough was specially exempt; that was struck out at once—he kept the salvage and got £37, which was not to include the fixtures—the mirrors against the wall were fixtures, and the shelves above them with tins on them—all the items enumerated here were in the shop; I went through them; there is no appearance of fraud in that column; they put down all they can remember, and then we see whether the articles are really insured or not, and £15 went off at once.</p>

I assist the divisional surgeon at 2, Spital Square—I saw the prosecutor at the Police-station on this morning—I found several burns and stains of acid, some on his face, one on his neck, on the backs of his hands, and his clothes and cap—those on his face were one on his chin, one on the side of the bridge of his nose, close to his eye, one on his forehead—if it had entered his eye I think undoubtedly it would have blinded him—he had already lost one eye—the nitric acid in this bottle would have produced those burns.</p>

On 3rd March, about 11. 30, I was on duty at the corner of Fore Street, by Finsbury Pavement—I noticed the two prisoners and two other men come from London Wall and turn the corner towards the City Road—they were all together—I particularly noticed Baker, because he was the smartest dressed—when I first saw them they were in front of and close to the shop, which is at the corner; the window broken is in London Wall—all four passed me, and</p>

               <p>directly afterwards Price turned sharp round to the back of me and went down Fore Street—I walked down the street, and then Goldsmith came along and caught hold of Price, and said, "Hold this man, I shan't be a second or two, and gave Price into my custody—I said, "Do you know what I am holding you for?"—he said, "No, I believe the gentleman has made a mistake; would you mind leaving go of my arm? I want to get my handkerchief out of my pocket"—I did so, he took his handkerchief out"—I said, "what have you got in your handkerchief"—he said "Nothing," and shook it; he bound it round his right wrist—Goldsmith brought back Baker, who was one of the four men I had previously seen—when they were charged at the station Goldsmith said to Price, "What is the matter with your hands?"—they were covered with blood; a piece was knocked out of the back of his hand, and his cuffs were smothered in blood—he said he had just fallen down—Baker's hands had a little blood, which he said came from a out on his lip—there was no blood on his lip.</p>

Baker was a little smarter dressed than he is now; he had a tie on, and a cleaner collar and shirt and a ring; he was much smarter than the other men—I looked closely at his lip; I saw no mark on it or crack—the back of his right hand was smeared with blood; I only noticed that one; I did not look at the left.</p>

On Sunday morning, about 11. 30, I was on duty in Finsbury Pavement—Goldsmith came up to me, and in consequence of what he said I ran after two men (not the prisoners) he pointed out—I lost sight of them up the City Road—I came back to the place where I saw them start running, about 100 yards from the prosecutor's shop—I there found a case containing six knives and six forks, which I took to the station—I there saw the two prisoners in custody.</p>

I examined the window of 1, Finsbury Pavement on the Sunday night, and found it broken—I found this plate on the window board—I found some recent blood marks on some broken plate-glass, which would require considerable force to break it—there is blood on it now—the hole was big enough to crawl through, only there were iron railings in front.</p>

McCarthy, and asked the landlord if that was one of the three, and he said "Yes"—I then told him I should take him for being concerned with Hunt and his brother, William McCarthy, in stealing money from the till of that house a short time previously—he said, "I know nothing about it, and I shan't leave or go to the station"—ultimately I took him to the station; they made no reply to the charge—I searched Wm. McCarthy, and found eightpence in bronze on him; on Thos. McCarthy I found nothing—I was about to search Hunt, when he said, "I will give you all I have about me," and produced sevenpence in bronze, a pawn ticket, and a small wooden box—I then searched him, and in the waistband of his trousers I found two separate shillings and three sixpences—I went back to the Victoria—from the taproom you can see anyone go in and out of the public bar door—the distance from the edge of the counter to the till is 2 ft. 9 in.—a chair stands between the bar and the till; in the private bar there is a stool which reaches up to the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, of 18, King John Street, Stepney—early on the morning of 3rd April I heard a terrible noise outside, like somebody being thrown on the pavement—I opened a door and heard someone say, "Give him another one"—I went outside, and saw the prisoner and another man heaving a man up and dropping him down on his back—the prisoner had his head and shoulders, and the other man had his legs, and they picked him up and dropped him down again—I said, "Hallo there!"—the prisoner had his hands under him, and the other man took off his other boot; they had one off already—they dropped him on his back, and ran away—I followed the prisoner to the top of the street; he turned round, and threw the man's waistcoat at me—I followed him to the next street and attacked him; he made a kick at me—I knocked him down, and he got up again, and we struggled, and we went down several times together—when I was on top of him, I saw another man coming across the road—the prisoner said he would knock my brains out—he got away, and I followed him 200 or 300 yards; a constable came up and caught hold of me—I explained what was the matter as well as I could—we could neither of us speak, as we were exhausted, and we then brought the prisoner round to where Welsh lay in the gutter—we stood the prisoner against the wall, and the constable blew his whistle, and Dutch came up—the prisoner put his hands behind him, and put this tin-box on the window-sill—I told the constable to hold him, while I went in and lit the gas—Dutch and I then helped Welsh up from the gutter—his hands were over his face, and he was bleeding from his face and neck, and was insensible—Dutch took the</p>

I am manager of the Horseshoe Hotel, Tottenham Court Road—I have known the prisoner using the hotel on several occasions when in this country—I believe he is an American—on February 12th he came at 9.30 p. m. and took a room—there are four or five different bars, one of which is called the Cafe, and I saw him there at 11. 15 drinking and talking with several people, who were strangers to me; and seeing him exhibit some American notes I stood back and beckoned to him, and said, "You are doing a stupid thing there, exhibiting your money in a public place; you don't know who sees you, and after what you told me in the early evening the best thing I</p>

               <p>should do, if I were you, is to go to your bed—he seemed excited—he had said on his arrival that he had a very rough passage, and had just come from Queenstown, after a fifteen days voyage, and had a terrible time of sea-sickness, and felt upset—I advised him to have something to eat and go to bed—I took him to the grill-room, and saw him served with a steak, and left him there—when I advised him to go to bed the second time, I said, "If you have any valuables on you, you had better give them in my charge—he gave me his gold watch and fifteen or twenty dollar notes—he was wearing a diamond pin—it was then near 12 o'clock—at twenty-five minutes to one someone told me something, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's bedroom and saw him sitting on the bed in a state of great excitement—I said, "What have you been doing?"—he said, "What I have done I have done in self-defence; I could not help it; they set on me and robbed me"—I smelt gunpowder, and said, "Have you been using a revolver?"—he made no answer—I asked him if he had one on him; he made no answer—I pushed aside his great coat, and saw the handle of a pistol sticking out of a pocket on his right hip—I took it out and put it in my pocket, and advised him to go to bed—it was examined at the station; there were five chambers, and one charge was left—he was sober—when I left him at a quarter to twelve I told the hall porter in his presence to see him upstairs and see he did not go out again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am hall-porter at the Horseshoe—on the night of 13th February I saw the prisoner in the hall; I had seen him at the hotel before; I spoke to him about going to bed, in consequence of what Mr. Atkins said, and he went about half-way up the staircase, between the hall and the office door—he showed me a pocket-book or purse; I should call it a purse, and wished me to take care of it—I said, "No; as you are going to bed, take care of it yourself"—I accompanied him to his bedroom door on the third floor and lit a candle for him, and saw him go into the room, and heard him lock or bolt the door—I then went down and remained at the hotel door—he did not pass me to go out by the main door—about twenty minutes to one o'clock I heard a rap, opened the door, and saw the prisoner there—I said, "Halloa, have you returned?"—he said, "Yes; I have been robbed"—I noticed that he had a blow on his right eye; I saw the mark on his cheek—he made half a halt—I called him back, but he just looked round, and continued going upstairs—immediately afterwards I heard a noise outside; there was a crowd there and some constables—I went up to the prisoner's bedroom, and found him lying on his bed with his coat and waistcoat off; his trousers and boots were on—Mr. Atkins was in the room before me—the prisoner said, "What I have done I have done in self-defence; there was a gang attacked me and tried to rob me, and did rob me"—when he came into the house his clothes were buttoned up and were perfectly clean, but he had no collar or tie or scarf; I saw a diamond pin in his scarf in his bedroom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he had shown me the pocket-book he put it back in his side coat pocket—he spoke perfectly clear; there was no sign of intoxication, and when I saw him afterwards he appeared sober; I remained with him eight or ten minutes, and then the police came; he said that he had been robbed by a gang who set upon him, and if he had not done what he did do, he thought he should have lost his life.</p>

I live at 19, Lamb's Conduit Passage, Red Lion Street, and am an unfortunate—on Tuesday evening, 12th February, I went to the back bar of the Horseshoe, from 11 to half-past—I saw the prisoner standing right round the back bar, a little way from it—three or four girls, and a lot of fellows, and <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi>, who was shot, were with him—I did not know the other men; I had not seen</p>

               <p>them with <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> before—they were all drinking—the prisoner seemed as if he was on the drink; he did not look drunk nor sober—he asked me to have a drink—I said I did not mind, and the deceased said, "No, she does not want none"—I walked away and had a drink with another girl in that bar—I went out and met Jenny Wilson, and went with her to the A 1 public-house—I left with her and went towards Hanway Street—we saw the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> walking together in front of us, calling for a cab—some fellows and girls were following behind them—I cannot say whether they were the persons I had seen in the bar—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> called the hansom cab; it was going towards the City—it stopped; the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> got in—I heard <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> say to the driver, "Drive me to a club in Dean Street"—I do not know any club there—I was passing the cab when I heard that—after they got in the cab there was a quarrel—I heard the window smash—I walked on as far as Hanway Street with Jenny Wilson, and then we turned back—we saw <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> jumping out of the cab, and the prisoner following him—that was five minutes after they got in the cab, and two shops away from the corner of Hanway Street; it was very quickly done—I only walked to the corner and turned back; it would not take me five minutes to do that—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> seemed to get off the cab front wards, and then turned round—then the prisoner got out—when the prisoner was on the platform he seemed to fire in the air twice—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> seemed to face the man, because this young woman, Ellen Johnson, was screaming by the head of the cab, and he went to pull her away, I think—she was on the pavement by the back of the cab, by the cabman's feet—she was by the wheel—I had not seen her do anything before the man got out of the cab, only screaming—she was one of those walking behind <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi>—when the first shot was fired, <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> like went towards the girl that was screaming—then the gentleman shot again, and he fell right on to the shutters of a shop—the third shot was right towards where <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> had fallen against the shutters—he seemed to stagger at the third shot—at the time of the third shot he was against the young woman, pulling her away—the third shot he fired towards Oxford Street after that, and the man falling against the shutter, he fired the fourth towards Hanway Street, and then ran away—after the prisoner fired the third time he could not have seen the effect of the shot man falling against the shutter; he seemed so mad; he turned so quickly and fired again, and then ran away down Hanway Street—I ran after him with Jenny Wilson—I did not wait to see what became of <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill.</hi>

I live at Storey's Lodging-house, Great Smith Street, Westminster—about a quarter to one on the night of 13th of February I was speaking to Maud Pegler at the corner of Hanway and Oxford Streets—I had not been to the Horseshoe—I noticed a cab by the kerb between me and the Oxford Music Hall, and I saw eight to ten men and women coming towards the cab.—I knew some of them by sight, I knew one man as <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi>, and one girl as Ellen Johnson—I had my back to the cab till I heard the smash of glass, and then I turned round because I heard it; I looked towards the cab, and saw the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi>, who is now dead, coming out of the cab; they stood a moment or two on the footboard—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill came</hi> out with his back to the pavement—he and the prisoner had hold of one another; they both got down on to the pavement together; the prisoner was trying to push <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> away; they were talking together—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> was patting the prisoner on the shoulder and talking to him; then the prisoner fired; his coat was open, the revolver seemed to come from his back somewhere—at the first shot the pistol was pointed upwards—as soon as that shot was fired <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> let go, and as the second shot was fired he ran towards the Oxford Music Hall—the second shot was fired upwards—I should say <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> had got ten yards from the prisoner when it was fired, about as far as I am from you—the third shot was fired straight outwards as the prisoner stood near towards the kerb, towards the shops like, towards the Oxford Music Hall—<hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> was running towards the Oxford Music Hall then; I did not see what happened to him—I saw the fourth shot fired outwards in the same way, and then the prisoner put the revolver in his coat pocket somewhere, and randown Hanway Street—I tried to get hold of his sleeve—he passed close by the kerb where I was standing—I could not stop him—as he ran along Hanway Street he fell on the kerb; he got up and ran on—I lost sight of him; when this matter happened I was standing still—the next time I saw <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> he was in the hospital, he was alive—I saw him again when he was dead—I saw Ellen Johnson, whom I knew by sight, close to the cab in the road—when <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> had got off the footboard of the cab and was on the pavement she came by the cab and was pulling <hi rend="italic">Bill's</hi> coat—I did not hear if she was calling out; she came through the cab and then ran round the horse's head way—I had known <hi rend="italic">Brummagem Bill</hi> for some time—I only knew one or two of the other people by name; <hi rend="italic">Nanty</hi>, and another man named <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> I knew—I don't know the names of the others—I did not see a constable in Oxford Street—I ran through Hanway Street; I had not come past the corner of Tottenham Court Road; there was a constable there.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Carpenter, a pawnbroker, of 195, High Street, Deptford—on 2nd March the female prisoner brought this boy's overcoat, between 6 and 7 p. m., and pledged it with me for 2s. 6d. in the name of Ann Smith, 51, Hamilton Street—this is the duplicate of the ticket I gave her—I asked her no questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and tea-dealer at 258, Southwark Park Road—in February I engaged the prisoner as my manager at that shop as a weekly servant, and he lived there with his wife—after about a fortnight I thought him not suitable for the post, and on the morning of 11th March I said to him, "I am sorry to say what I am going to say, but I have come to the conclusion that you are not suited to the berth, therefore I am disposed to give you a week's salary and pay the cost of your removing, 7s."—he said, "What for?"—I said, "I hardly think it necessary to go into that; your references shall not be impaired"—while speaking to him a customer came in, and the prisoner left the shop while I was serving him—he returned in about a minute in an excited manner, with something in his hand, and said, "You have given me the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>, and I will shoot you"—I was at the end of the counter near the door, and I passed out of the door—I had just turned the corner of the window when I heard the report of a pistol—I went across the road and spoke to a Mr. Clark, and then to a constable, who went to the shop—since the prisoner has been committed for trial I received this letter from him; it is his writing (<hi rend="italic">This expressed his sorrow for what had occurred, and stated that he was so nervous and excited, thinking his wages would not be paid, that he did not know what he said or did; that he had no evil intent, and that he purposely aimed the pistol against the ground</hi>)—I did not know that he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He seemed unnecessarily excited directly I spoke of his leaving; he seemed to take very little notice of what I said—I did not return with the constable—I had a fifteen months' character with the prisoner—his references were good as to the grocery business only—I have since heard that he has been under medical treatment.</p>

               <p>March, about half-past eleven in the morning, as I was walking opposite Mr. Bridge's shop, I felt a thud on my right side, and before I could turn round I heard the report of a pistol—I saw Mr. Bridge running from the shop, and the prisoner presenting a pistol at him—he was standing just inside the doorway, three or four feet away—I saw the pistol in his hand—I would not be positive whether it was cocked or uncocked—I found a bullet in my coat, and here is the hole in the coat—I had in my pocket this glove and handkerchief—there is a dent in the glove—I rather think my spectacle-case stopped the bullet from going further—I took the bullet out, and left it at the station—the prisoner was there then.</p>

I am a cabmaster, of 28, Paradise Street, Lambeth—on Sunday, 17th March, about 11p. m., I was in Paradise Street, and passed under the railway arch, which has a lamp in the centre of it—the widening of the line makes it a long arch—somebody came behind me, put his arm round my neck, and tried to pull me back—I overpowered him, turned round, and saw the prisoner—I said, "What do you want?" and struck him three times on his face with my stick—he had loosed me then; two others then sprang on me and knocked me down, and went to the other side of the road, and the prisoner laid on top of me while the two others rifled my pockets and kicked me—I had £51 16s. 6d. in my pocket—they tore my trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) right down from the pocket—I struggled, and got the prisoner's hand out of my pocket, and called out, and the two others ran away without taking my money—Mr. Mar came up and released me from the prisoner; he took my stick out of my hand, and knocked the prisoner across his legs—a constable came and took him, and he drew the constable's attention to his face, which was bleeding—I do not know the prisoner—I am sure he is the man who first put his arm round my neck.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 17th March, I was with Dockrell, and saw the prisoner and a man named Miller leave the King's Arms, Walworth Road, at 3 o'clock—we followed them to the Elephant and Castle, and there lost sight of them—I saw them again in Westminster Bridge Road, and followed them to the Borough Road; the prisoner went to No. 3, a tobacconist's, and Miller went to the other side of the road; the prisoner came out in a hurry, ran down the Borough Road, and turned round New Street; Miller came from the corner of Mansfield Street to the corner of New Street, apparently watching the shop—he made a sign up New Street—I went into the shop, and Mr. Edwards told me something, and gave me a coin—I followed Miller, and Johnson joined him near the Elephant—I went to get assistance to arrest them, and Johnson disappeared, and I did not see him again that day—I arrested them on the 29th, and told Johnson it was for uttering a florin at a tobacconist's in the Borough Road on the 17th; he said, "You have made a mistake; I don't know anything of any uttering"—when he was charged he said, "I can prove where I was on that Sunday; I was at Champion Hill Infirmary, visiting a man named Kick; my name, Johnson, is entered in the visiting-book."—he had on a different jacket to what he had on on the 17th—I had him under my observation three</p>

               <p>delivered at 24, Prince's Road, on 3rd November, in the name of Mary Jane Saffin—he said, "I don't remember any letter coming there for me; I don't know anything at all about the letter"—I said, "Do you know Mary Jane Saffin?"—he said, "Yes, I know a Miss Saffin"—I said, "Is she the Miss Saffin who lives at 4, Prince's Road?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How long is it since you saw Miss Saffin?"—he said, "I could not say"—I said, "When, did you come down to Cambridge?"—he said, "In November, but I could not tell you the date"—I asked him if Mrs. Harris had accompanied him, he said yes—I said, "Do you still wish me to believe you know nothing of the letters addressed to Saffin, 24, Prince's Road?"—he said, "I don't remember any letters"—I said, "Mrs. Harris tells me you took the letter to her at No. 4"—he said, "I don't remember it"—I said, "The letter was a Savings Bank warrant for the payment of £8 to Miss Saffin; Mrs. Harris admits having signed the receipt to the warrant, she says you went with her to get the money; you waited at the door; have you anything to say about that?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I showed him the notice of withdrawal, and asked him if he had seen it before; he said no—he said he knew the Red Cow public-house when I asked him—I asked him if he had ever been there with Mrs. Harris—he said, "Yes, I have been there several times"—I said, "Mrs. Harris tells me you wrote the word Mary on the notice of withdrawal, and she thinks you wrote the word Saffin"—he said, "I am sure I never did"—I said, "She says she and you filled up the names at the Red Cow; do you still deny having done so?"—he said, "I deny it"—he was given into custody—two days afterwards, as he was being taken into Court, he said to me that he hoped I should do the best I could for him.</p>

I practise at 175, Kennington Road—on this Sunday morning, at a quarter to four, I was called to the station, and saw the prosecutrix—she was quite sober—I found four punctured wounds on the top of the head, four or five severe contusions on the back of the head, distinct from the wounds, and caused by a different instrument—the wounds were triangular in shape, widest at the middle, and were caused by a pointed, wedge-shaped instrument, such as a tin-opener—the contusions might have been caused by the knob of a poker or tongs—the wounds were serious; she had lost a very large quantity of blood—she was in a state of great shock from the assault, and faint from loss of blood—she was under my care till the Friday—I anticipated there might be erysipelas; there was none.</p>
