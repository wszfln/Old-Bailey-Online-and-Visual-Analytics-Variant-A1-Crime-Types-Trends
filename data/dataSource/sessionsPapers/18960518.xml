I am assistant to Mr. Chard—on March 12th, Allman came to the shop—my employer made a communication to me, in consequence of which I followed the boy, and I saw the prisoner cross the road—he saw the boy—he spoke to him—he then walked away—I took hold of him, and said I should take him to the Police-office—he said nothing then; after a few minutes he said, "I don't know the boy"—the boy asked him if he was going to give him his threepence—he said, "Not now."</p>

On March 12th, about half-past six, I was on duty in Courtfield Road—I saw the prisoner waiting about between Dr. Dudfield's and Gloster Road—later on I received information from Mr. Chard, and went to 14, Ashburn Place, Dr. Dudfield's, and saw the prisoner being detained by Pearman—I told him I should take him into custody for attempting to obtain £7 7s. by means of a forged cheque, and asked him what he had to say—after a time, he said, "How can I know anything about it? I have only just left the Free Library"—I told him I had seen him waiting about for about ten to fifteen minutes—he made no reply—I told Mr. Chard to take the cheque to Dr. Dudfield to see whether it was the signature of his son; I remained outside on the doorstep—whilestanding there the prisoner nodded his head towards Pearman, and said, "Is this man going to charge me?"—I told him he was already in custody—at the station, after the charge was read over, he said, "I do not know anything about the letter or cheque, neither have I seen the boy."</p>

That morning I knocked at the door, old Levy himself opened it, and I walked in. He said the girl was upstairs. I then went upstairs, and found her in her own bedroom; she had just got her dress on, and leaning over her own bed, which appeared to me not to have been slept in. She always slept with old Levy. When she saw me, she shouted and began struggling, but I soon stopped her kicking. I then came downstairs, and soon put the old Jew's lights out. After the job was finished I heard someone keep knocking at the door. I stood behind the door, considering whether to let them in or not. If I had opened the door I would have soon floored them, so as they would not have walked out of that house again alive; they would have been carried out stiff with the others.

I live at Millwall, and am the wife of Christopher Bowater—the prisoner lodged at our house up to April 4th, in the namo of William Saunders—I last saw him in the house late on the Friday evening; next morning, when I came down at eight o'clock, he had gone out—on April 7th I was taken to the London Hospital to see him—Mr. Smith, the surgeon, was present—I asked the prisoner, Was it possible he had done such a terrible crime?—he said, "I did do it"—I asked him what his motive was for doing such a thing; and he said, "Revenge"—I asked him "What revenge could you have against that poor old gentleman?"—he said, "He did me the greatest injustice that one man can do another"—I said, "Why? was that woman your wife?"—he said, "No, she was no man's wife"—the police then stopped me from talking further to him, and would not allow me to ask him any more questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising in the Commercial Road—on April 4th, at 1.40 p.m., I was called to 31, Turner Street, by the police, and was taken to the basement—I saw the dead body of Levy in the w.c.—the body was quite warm—I thought he had probably been dead from fifteen to twenty minutes at the outside—there was a large semi-circular wound in the throat; it would probably have caused death—it might appear to a lay person as having nearly cut off the head, but it was not so actually; the wound severed the wind-pipe and gullet, and one of the large arteries on the left side was divided—I saw there were a great many injuries to the head and scalp—next day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the lower margin of the wound in the throat was about eight inches, from end to end—I should say its direction was from right to left; it was much deeper at one side than the other; very likely such a knife as this could have caused it—some of the wounds on the scalp were contused, some were cleaner cut; they could have been produced by some blunt instrument: the door being burst open might have caused some—there were, perhaps, a dozen altogether, varying in sizfc from three-quarters of an inch to two inches, on different parts of the head—most of them appeared to have been produced by some instru<lb/>ment—onthe side of the head was a large lacerated wound, down to and exposing the bone, and another smaller one just at the outer side—there was an incised wound just over the left eyebrow, leading down to a com<lb/>pound fracture of the nasal bones—there was a partial fracture of the bones of the forehead—two ribs on the right side and four on the left side were fractured—considerable force must have been used to cause those injuries—the wound in the throat would be quite sufficient to cause death—a man could not live with such a wound; death would have ensued instantaneously.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Muswell Hill—I was employed as gardener to Mr. Henry Smith, at Muswell Lodge—I had been in his service ten years—he lived quite alone in the house—I occasionally assisted in the house work—he was nearly eighty years of age—his habit was to get up early in the morning—I used to get in by the front gate; Mr. Smith used to get up early to unlock that gate—he would be up as early as three in the morning in the summer, and in the winter as soon as it was light—he was a robust and active man; he worked in his garden</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180020"/>
               <p>—it was his habit to lay the kitchen fire overnight, and to light it him<lb/>self in the morning—he had no woman to clean the house—I was the only person that assisted him in the house—the garden runs down at the back of the house to what are called the Coldfall Woods, separated by a fence—since I have been there there was the alarum gun in the garden, to which a wire was attached; the wire was stretched across the garden at the back; this red dotted line on the plan shows exactly the way the wire was fixed; the gun was fixed just at the corner of the rock work—Iused to set it at night and unset it in the morning—it was set on two iron supports; you had to lift the wire from the gun, and set it on the supports; it was about two feet from the ground—the wire was set tight; if anybody ran against it the gun would go off—in the morning I should simply lift the wire off the supports and lay it on the ground, and then we used to put it into a basket and take it away—on Thursday, February 13th, I left the house about half-past five, as usual; I set the gun before I left—at that time my master was on the premises, in the house—I returned to the premises at 11.30 that night—I went to the shed to bank up the fire of the greenhouse, next to the vinery—I got in through the front gate; it was locked; I had a key—I had not to go past the wire—I did not see the wire; I don't know whether it was all right then—both the gates are front gates—I went in at the upper gate, the one nearest the vinery—I left the premises by the front gate—I should not be five minutes doing it; I left by the tradesman's gate—I did not see anyone about at the time—next morning, the 14th, I went to the house about a quarter to seven—I found the front gate still locked, that is the gate leading directly to the lodge—I unlocked the gate and knocked at the door—I received no answer—I had a key of the gate; I unlocked it—I went round to the back of the house—I saw that the small shrubs had been taken from the sill of the kitchen window—the window was shut; I saw marks on it, as if it had been prised open at the bottom by a chisel or something—I then examined the alarum gun—I found that the wire had been lifted off from the supports—the gun was in its position, and not exploded—I went back and looked through the kitchen window, and saw that there was something on the floor—I then went for Mr. Stanbrook, a neighbour; he returned with me, and went for the police—soon after, a policeman named Gobell, Dr. Webster, and Major Challen arrived—Major Challen opened the kitchen door—it was unlocked; he simply turned the handle—it was usually locked—on going into the kitchen I saw the body of Mr. Smith lying on the floor in his nightshirt, stockings, and one slipper—the door leading from the kitchen into the hall was open; it opens inwards—shortly afterwards I went with a policeman upstairs to my master's bedroom over the kitchen; that door was open—there was an iron safe in that room; that was wide open, and the drawer was pulled out—the safe stood on a pedestal about two feet high; there was a bunch of keys hanging in the lock of the drawer—the drawer had been unlocked, and the safe was quite empty—there was a tin box on the hearthrug, that was empty, and papers were strewed about the floor—the bed clothes were all in a heap, in the middle of the bed—the mattress appeared as if it had been disturbed, pulled up to see if there was anything under it—afterwards, on going into the kitchen, I saw in the sink a bull's-eye</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Elm Road, Tetherdown, Muswell Hill—I am a retired major in the Volunteers—I knew the deceased in timately for about twelve years—I visited at his house—on Friday, February 14th, I was called about 7.25 a.m., in consequence of which I went at once to Muswell Lodge, where I found the gardener and Stanbrook—I looked through the kitchen window—I then opened the kitchen door, finding it unlocked—I there found the body of Henry Smith lying on the floor—the dotted line on this plan correctly represents its position, with the cross for the head—his legs were bound together at the ankles and at the knees—his hands were bound to his side—his head was bound up in pieces of rag and dusters, and the external cloth was this red table-cloth tied with string just below the chin—(<hi rend="italic">a quantity of blood-stained rays were produced</hi>)—under the table-cloth the neck was tied round with a duster, and sundry pieces of rag appeared to have been placed over the mouth—rags were secured tightly over and round the nose and mouth by a towel, as if for a gag—the mouth was open, and some rag inside, but there was nothing absolutely stuffed into the mouth—on removing the rags I saw several wounds on the head—the limbs were cold, the chest just warm—soon afterwards Dr. Webster arrived, and in about two and a-half hours. Dr. Stott, the divisional surgeon—I noticed this drill<lb/>brace on the kitchen table—the drill was in it, as it is, with the exception of the cork—the kitchen cupboard was opened—I found a canvas bag, similar to this, lying on the kitchen floor, close by the deceased's head—the kitchen fire was laid, but not lighted—in the scullery adjoining I found a small basket on the floor, by the side of the pump—in it were a gold watch and chain, the watch was going, a gold-plated pencil-case, a silver pencil-case, I am not sure as to the gold seal, a gold brooch, a brooch with pearls and hair, I am not sure about the locket, a pair of gold spectacles, three gold rings, and portions of a necklace—I was with the gardener when he picked up this tobacco-box in the garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of Rutland House, Muswell Hill—on February 14th I was called to Mus<lb/>well Lodge, at 7.22 a.m., and arrived there at 7.37—I went round to the back, and entered the kitchen by the door from the garden—in the kitchen I found Major Challen, Mr. Stanbrook and Mr. Webber—on the floor I saw the dead body of Mr. Smith lying on his back diagonally, with his head beneath the sink, which stood behind the door—the deceased's foot was against the leg of one of the opposite tables—he was bound hand and foot—there were wraps about his head—they had been unbound be<lb/>fore my arrival, but I stooped down and took a jack towel out of his mouth, with which he was gagged—the back of the head and chin had marks of blood upon it—these wraps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were marked with blood—his lower jaw was fixed by <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>; it was quite rigid—finding from that sign that he had been dead some time I lifted his legs, and found they were stiff—his fingers were clenched, and in his left hand he was grasping this string, which we had to open his fingers to pull out—this apron, with the string to it, was lying with the blood by the side of his arm—he was only attired in slippers, stockings, and this flannel dayshirt—the uncovered parts of his body were comparatively cool, but underneath it was quite warm—his ankles were bound in a duster like this, and on his legs, just above the knees, was a portion of a red figured table-cloth, such as this, which had been torn—the wrists were bound to his hips by a similar piece of table-cloth—the blood was dry on the body, except where he was lying—there was a pool of blood, in which he was lying on the left side, which soaked the wraps, a shirt, apron, and handkerchief—the knots were not unfastened till the police and divisional surgeon arrived—I thought they ought to see the position in which the deceased was, so I did not interfere, except to make a cursory examination—I saw he had a black eye, which was very much swollen up from his forehead—I wrote my note on the corner of the kitchen table, that I thought he had been dead between five and six hours—on the arrival of Dr. Stott and the inspector, I made a more complete examination, and, of course, a more complete one at <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—en that morning I noticed he had wounds on his forehead, lacerated and some contused, and all round the left side of his head; about a dozen of them—I saw the injuries to the hands—the following Sunday, the 16th, with the assistance of Dr. Stott, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have my rough notes, and a clean copy has been supplied—I said the deceased was six feet high, corpulent, weighing about seven<lb/>teen stone—his body was well nourished—the <hi rend="italic">riyor mortis</hi> was going off—</p>

               <p>he was a healthy man, but I do not think he had much power, because of his excessive fat, and he had enormous hernia, reaching to his thighs, nine inches in length by seven inches in width, which would not allow him to reach about, or strain very well—his vessels were not de<lb/>generated—the wounds were done by a blunt instrument; the skin was torn—I cannot exactly say all were inflicted during life; the wounds in his knuckles gaped, and he had a simple fracture of the skull—all the wounds were on the left, from the centre of the forehead to the occipital protuberance, and it was the left eye that was black—his knuckle<lb/>joints were laid open, and there was a compound fracture on the middle finger of the left hand—the wrists were very much discoloured, and the back of the left hand was very much cut and bruised—there was a out and lacerated wounds on the inner side of the thumb on the right hand, and the back of the hand and the knuckle of the middle finger swollen—the thumb, middle, and little fingers were much bruised—there were no marks on the legs of the bandages with which they were tied—the cause of death was concussion and loss of blood—I found a bruise on the opposite side of the brain to the fracture of the skull, which would come from the shaking of the brain in the skull-box—there was some blood coming from his nose—I saw marks of blood not only close to the tablet but on the fireplace, on the mantelpiece, and under the sink—on the two sides of the room where the head had been a quantity of blood was under the table and in the coal-scuttle, where there was a night-cap blood-stained—the coals had been tipped up and there was a pool of blood by the coals, a smear of blood over the coals and along the carpet, and a pool of blood under the table where the head was—in the wraps in which his head was wrapped were one or two pieces of coal—that indicated that he had fallen with his head under the table where the coal-scuttle was, and then the body had been moved across the carpet to where I saw it—I should think he lost nearly thirty ounces of blood—the wounds might have been caused by such an instrument as this jemmy—it would have required considerable force—the wounds were the result of separate blows—the inspector came a little after nine; I got there twenty-three minutes to eight—I looked into the sink to see if there was any trace of blood, but there was only a jam-pot, washings of the jam-pot, and the basin; and when I lifted up the basin the policeman said, "Here's a lantern"—that was at the corner of the sink—then I went from the kitchen into the bed-room, but found no traces of blood except in the kitchen.</p>

I am divisional surgeon for the Highgate Division of Police—I arrived at Muswell Lodge about 9.10 a.m. on February 14th—Inspector Lambert was there—Dr. Webster had just arrived—the bandages were still on the deceased's legs and on his hands—I made an independent examination—I untied the bandages of the hands and knees—I saw them untied about the ankles—the knot about the knees was a left-handed knot—the knot round the ankle was right-handed—I saw no blood on the knots—I assisted Dr. Webster in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion—judging from the amount of blood round the deceased's head, he lived an hour or so after he fell on the floor—he had fallen on the side of his face, with his head in the coal-scuttle and on the coals, and had been moved carefully from that position on his back and then tied, because the wounds on the side of his head correspond with the coals—they were marked with the coals—there was no disarrangement of the clothing, and no rubbing of blood along the floor—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I made a rough sketch of the wounds on the head (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it shows the top of the scalp—it is a bird's-eye view—as the head laid on the table I stood and drew it—you have a sight of the nose and the two eyes—there are five wounds on the forehead, seven posterior to the ear on the occipital protuberance at the back of the head. (<hi rend="italic">This sketch was shown to the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>.) The wounds on the forehead are smaller—I noticed the wounds on the hands—I formed the opinion that all the wounds were probably caused by more than one person, and while the deceased was standing.</p>

I would say it is scarcely possible for the wounds to be caused by one man—those on the forehead and in front of the ear were inflicted in front—I do not think they would be caused by the left hand, or by striking downwards, because their direction was almost vertical from the back of the head, sideways—if given in falling, the resistance would not have been so great—that was scarcely possible; I would not say that it was utterly impossible, judging from the position—I have not heard Dr. Webster's evidence—I was not called at the Police-court—I made my report to the Inspector of Police after visiting the deceased, on February 15th—I have given another statement recently—I made my notes at the time—Dr. Webster and others were at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem.</hi>

I am police inspector at New Southgate Station—I arrived at Muswell Lodge on February 14th, about 8.50 a.m., with Dr. Stott, the divisional surgeon—I examined the premises—I found that a jemmy had been unsuccessfully used at the back drawing-room window—here are the marks on the sill-piece, which I have brought with a piece of the sash—I also found on the scullery window marks of the same jemmy, and the middle bar bent—the bars were outside—the pots had been removed from the kitchen widow, and the window had been forced from the bottom, (<hi rend="italic">The sash was also produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department, Scotland Yard—on the morning of February 14th informa<lb/>tion was received at Scotland Yard with regard to the burglary and murder at Muswell Hill—I was instructed to put myself in communica<lb/>tion with the local police there—that same morning I went and made a care<lb/>ful examination of the premises—I have heard Lambert's description of what he found—I confirm what he has said with regard to the condition of the premises—from that date I was engaged with other officers, especially with Inspector Nutkins in the investigation of the matter, and in con<lb/>sequence of what I learnt from time to time, up to March 28th, I was in active pursuit of the two prisoners—on April 9th I went to 133, Southam Street, and went into the room there occupied by Mrs. Miller, and with her found there, in a teapot, a pawn ticket—I went with it to the shop of Mr. Harvey, and there saw the bundle that had been pledged, including the child's frock—the police had been in possession of the lan<lb/>tern found in the sink at the house at Muswell Hill from the time the murder was discovered—I examined that lamp carefully—I purchased a lamp at the shop mentioned by the boy, Henry Miller, in Goulbourn Road; I produce it; it has upon it marks of varnish—inside it there is a red and green glass, so that a red or green light can be shown—the wick of that lantern is much shorter than the one the boy had—that lamp was sold without wick or oil—the lamp found at Muswell Hill had on it part of a pen-holder put on it by the boy; that lengthens the burner very much—there was a wick in that lamp; I examined it, and compared it with the dress material that I found at the pawnbroker's, and it is pre<lb/>cisely the same; the piece used as wick is discoloured—I tried the effect of a similar wick cut off the gown piece, and found it discoloured in the same way, but not quite so much, as it had not been so long in use—I traced the two prisoners from Swindon, Chippenham, and other places on to Bath, and ascertained that they were staying at 36, Monmouth Street—I kept observation on that house on Sunday, the 12th—I had with me Nutkins, Burrell, and other officers, who could identify the prisoners, and about eleven on Sunday night I saw the two prisoners, with Sinclair and two women, go into the house—I had found out the room thoy occupied there—I waited outside till they had got into the front room first floor—I saw they were in, from the light in the window—I knew that they had been in possession of revolvers—I had with ine Sergeant Smith, of the</p>

               <p>Bath Police—lie crept up first to see if the door was fastened—as soon as he found that the dcor was not fastened we went up with a rush into the room—Nutkins and Smith, I think, were the first that got in, and I fol<lb/>lowed with Burrell—Nutkins shouted "Hands up," and I shouted that we were police—Nutkins made for Milsorn, someone made for Sinclair, and I made for Fowler—the room was very poorly lighted, quite a simple gleam of a lamp—we could not see very much—I seized Fowler, and another officer or two seized him almost instantly—he became most desperate—he aimed a blow which caught me across the top of the hat I was wearing, and smashed it, and I think I smashed his—there was a general row—he nearly swayed some of us down—I drew my revolver, and struck him across the head with it—Nutkins presented a loaded re<lb/>volver—that seemed to have no effect, and as a last resort, I struck him with an unloaded revolver, I think two or three times, that caught his forehead—he fell down eventually, and we got the handcuffs on him—search was made for revolvers, and one was found—we tried to search him—we were afraid he had got it in his pocket; but he had not, it was at the head of the couch—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it was loaded with these six cartridges—we then took him from the house on a stretcher, assisted by the Bath police, to one of the hospitals, where the wound on his forehead was attended to by the medical gentleman—he was detained there for the night up to about three that afternoon, and was then taken to the Bath Police-station, where I told him what he would be charged with—I had visited him at the hospital earlier in the morning, and told him who I was, and at the station I told him the charge—I first cautioned him, and told him that anything he might say I should have to give in evidence against him—I told him the charge on which I had arrested him was for burglariously breaking and entering Muswell Lodge, Tetherdown, Muswell Hill, during the night of February 13th last, and murdering the occupier, Mr. Henry Smith; I said, "You will be charged with being concerned with Milsom in this occurrence"—he said, "I did not; I was not along of the man; I do not know anything about it; I was not with Milsom; I was at a lodging-house at Kensal Town, and I am innocent of the charge"—I then said to him, "We are most anxious to do what is right and fair in this matter, and if you care to give me the address and name of the people with whom you were staying on that night, I will take good care to call them up on your behalf"; he then said, "I do not know the name of the lodging-house, or the people; I thought you wanted me for not reporting"—I said that I did want him for that offence, too, but that was a minor charge; and "I am rather surprised that you should have shown such a desperate resistance, as you thought that—he said, "I was in beer"—with assistance I brought them both to London that afternoon—the case was first heard against them before the Highgate magistrates on the 14th—on that day I gave evidence, not only as to the arrest, but as to the circumstances surrounding the crime—they were re<lb/>manded to the 22nd—the boy, Henry Miller, was then examined with re<lb/>gard to the two prisoners being together, and about the lantern—after that hearing, the pawn-ticket relating to the jacket and waistcoat was handed to me by Fred Milsom, and they have been produced—they were subsequently submitted to Dr. Stevenson—I had the sill and frame of the drawing-room window cut out, and the scullery-window taken out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180036"/>
               <p>and they were produced yesterday—the case was remanded from April 22nd to the 29th—on the 28th I received a letter from Milsoin; it is annexed to the depositions—this is it—<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To Mr. Marshall, Chief Inspector, Scotland Yard, from Holloway Prison, Holloway, April 27th, 1896.—If you can kindly call and see me to-morrow, I shall be much obliged, as I should like to make a statement with regard to this dreadful case which I am now under charge with.—Yours truly, A. Milsom"—in consequence of that letter I went with Inspector Nutkins to the prison on the 28th, and there saw Milsom—I said to him, "I have come to see you in response to this letter you have sent me"—I held the letter in my hand—he said, "You are too late; I have just made a statement to my solicitor, and instructed him to take it to the Treasury. He has gone on there with it. It is hardly worth while making two"—I said, "Very well; it is a matter for you; I am here to write down anything you may wish to state"—he again said he had already made one, and I was preparing with Nutkins to leave; where upon he said that he might as well make the statement to us as well—I then sat down at the table, and reduced to writing exactly what he said, first writing down the conditions upon which the statement was made, which I read over to him before he started on his statement—then I took down his story precisely, as he told it, word for word—when I had finished read it over to him, and he signed it—when he had signed it: I said, "If you do not mind I should like you to initial every sheet; so that there shall be no mistake about it, and he initialled every sheet. Read: "H.M. Prison, Hollowav, April 28th, 1896.—I, Albert Milsom, now under remand in the above prison for being concerned, with Henry Fowler, in the murder of Mr. Henry Smith at Muswell Lodge, Muswell Hill, during the night of 13th February last, after having been cautioned that anything I may say may be given in evidence against me, and also told that no promise or hope whatever can be held out to me, do hereby voluntarily desire to make a statement about the crime, and request that it be put forward, and read to the proper authorities. "That is what I wrote before the statement was made. "In the first place, I wish to say that I had nothing to do with the killing of Mr. Smith at all. I never put a hand on him, and wasn't in the room. Fowler came to my place about eight o'clock on the night of the 13th February, at 133, Southam Street. Fowler said, 'I have had a look round with another man who done a lagging with me, and he pointed out several places. There is one place especially, where an old miser lives. You know what them people are. Any little hole or corner they put their money in. We might find some<lb/>thing there. Will you come?' After a lot of persuasion, I said, 'Yes' He said, 'Have you got a bit of candle?' I said, 'No.' Fowler, on turn<lb/>ing round, saw the lantern on the dresser. I said, 'That belongs to my little brother-in-law,' meaning Harry Miller. Fowler said, 'We will take that, it won't throw the reflections so.' We then went to Kilburn, had a drink with three or four of Fowler's mates, and he asked them the best May to get to Muswell Hill. I don't know their names, but two of them had been with him at Dartmoor. We then went to a station near there (I think, Kilburn), and he took tickets to a station near Muswell Hill. After arrival there, we went to a public-house (corner house), and had a drink, and then Fowler and I went straight to the deceased's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180037"/>
               <p>premises. Fowler got over the front gate, and I followed. It was the first gate we came to. All of a sudden Fowler pushed me and said, 'Be careful, there are electric bells here; we shall be surrounded by the police.' He said,'Step over.' We then crept to the lawn, where there are a group of shrubs in the centre. We lay there for about an hour. Then Fowler said, 'We will get to work.' With that, we got up and tried the drawing-room window, but it would not yield to Fowler's strength. Then we tried a little window that opened, but it was found to have bars, and prevented our entrance there. We then went to the next window, and took all the flower-pots down. Fowler putting the chisel under the window, it gave way; Fowler then got in, and had scarcely been there a second—I was outside, and see a light coming down the stairs that showed under the crack of the door. I said, 'Bunny, out you come, as there is somebody coming down the stairs.' But he stood his ground, till the key was turned and the door opened. I made a run for the front entrance, and scarcely got there before I heard shouts of 'Police!' 'Murder!' I stood for some minutes, trembling, thinking I should be surrounded by police. I looked this way and that way, and also up at the windows, and saw no lights, to give me suspicion they had heared anything; and, seeing no police, I thought nobody could have heard the cries. I then crept back and saw Fowler standing at the back door. He was covered with blood—his face, coat, and hands. I said, 'Good God, Fowler! What have you done?' He said, 'It is outing do's. And it's all through you, you cur, for leaving a man on his own.' I said 'I am surprised at you, who brags about your strength, to kill an old man.' With that he raised his hand to strike me. I said,'If that's your game, I'm off. 'He cooled down, and said, 'Oh well; it's no good crying. Stop there! I'll go upstairs, and see if I can find any money.' He came down after some time, with a watch and chain and some jewellery. He said, 'I have found the "Peter,"' meaning the safe, 'and the key in the old man's trousers.' He said, 'I won't take the jewellery, in case of detection.' Fowler then washed himself, and rubbed the blood off his coat with the towel in the kitchen. We then crept to the same place as I told you, in the cen<lb/>tre of the lawn, and buried the tools, which are a brace, a worm-bit, chisel and screw-driver. After a lapse of a few minutes we made for the woods. Creeping about, we came to a tree or stump of a tree, and sat there three or four hours, waiting for six o'clock, when the police would be scarce, think<lb/>ing of escaping detection. We came out on to the same path as we went on, then walked all the way home through Kilburn. Fowler wore my brown coat to hide his blood-stained clothes. We got as far as Goldbourne Road, near home. He said he would go to his brother's to breakfast, and see me in a couple of hours' time. I went home, 133, Southam Street, and went to bed. Fowler called on me about ten o'clock in the morning, and had a parcel under his arm that contained new clothes. He said, 'Send the missus out, so that I can change my clothes.' She went out while he done so, leaving his old clothes at my place. Fowler then gave me £50, and said, 'That's more than some would give you after leaving a man in a hole.'I took the £50, and said nothing. He said,'Ain't you going to buy new clothes?' I said, 'There is plenty of time for that.' A few minutes after Fowler goes out, and I never saw him any more till about six in the evening. He had a ring on his finger and a chain, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180038"/>
               <p>no watch attached to it. He said he had been to see some of his old friends, as I understood, who had come home from penal. He said he had come home in a cab to the Craven—that is a public-house. He stopped, and had tea; him, I, and my wife, and Fowler's sweet-heart went over to Kilburn to a concert at a public-house, the name of which I don't know. We stayed till about 12.30. I, seeing Fowler the worse for drink, and violent with his girl—he knocked her down several times—thought the best thing I could do was to get a cab, and so fetched a hansom. After a lot of persuasion I got him and her into it, my wife and me getting in also. We rode as far as South<lb/>ampton Street, paid the cabman, and bid Fowler good-night. I see no more of Fowler till one or half-past the next day, Sunday. He said, 'I am off; I have got to show myself on the 16th, and don't intend to give my face away. Will you come abroad?' I, having been abroad before myself, had a longing desire to go, and said 'Yes.' We walked to Kil<lb/>burn, hailed a cab to Edgware Road. We changed cabs there, and then rode to Mile End. I called upon my aunt, Mrs. Waddell, 62, St. Peter's Road, and introduced Fowler as Mr. Jarvis. We stayed to dinner, and in the course of conversation I said the reason I had come was to say 'good-bye,' as I was going abroad. During the evening, I and Fowler, and my cousin, Jack Waddell, went to have a drink, and, whilst drinking, I asked my cousin to get an envelope, paper, and stamp. I sat down in the public-house and wrote a letter to this effect: 'Dear Mother,—Call upon me to-morrow as early as you can at aunt's; also my wife and two children, as I am about to go away, and want to see you.' We returned to 62, St. Peter's Road, and aunt gave us a lied for the night. We slept with my cousin Jack. Before going out I said to my cousin, 'Put this away,' and Fowler and I both handed over our revolvers. We had bought them on the Saturday before, with fifty cartridges, at Thompson's, pawnbroker, High Road, Kilburn. On Monday my wife and children and mother and father came to aunt's to see me. I stayed with them for a couple of hours, and then had a parting drink. I said, 'Well, I must be off.' Aunt said, 'Would you like your wife to come a little way with you? We will mind the children.' I and my wife and Fowler went to Mile End Station, and inquired for the next train to Liverpool. Being too long to wait for the train, we hailed a cab and rode to Kuston Station just in time to catch a train for Liverpool. I bid my wife good-bye at Mile End before getting into the cab. We lodged at a place in Liverpool for a week. I wrote home to my wife, and let her know where I was. Bunny was with me, andsaid I hadn't been very well. She sent me a telegram to say Fred would be there to-morrow. He brought a closed letter from my wife that ran to this effect:—'Dear Albert,—The police have been down here asking where you are. They know you are alonj: with Fowler, and you'll get twelve months for being in his company, as he is wanted on his licence.' My brother stayed one night, and went home the next day. My wife and my brother knew nothing that I was in any way concerned in the Muswell Hill affair. As regards our travels, we left Liverpool and went to Cardiff. The reason we left Liverpool was that Fowler brought a low woman to the house, and the landlady objected. Fowler took her at her word, left the house, and we stayed at an hotel one night, and then went on to Cardiff.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180039"/>
               <p>While in Liverpool I went with Fowler to a dentist, and he had some artificial teeth put in. He said he was short of teath on his licence; that is why he had them. We met the Sinclairs at Cardiff, at Madame D'Arc's waxwork show, where they were engaged for a month. Whilst there we had a private consultation about phrenology. After that was over Sinclair followed us down to the door. Fowler asked him to have a drink. We had several, and agreed to see him at night We asked each other questions at the meeting, which was at the Ship and Castle public-house. Sinclair asked us where we were going to sleep. We said we wanted lodgings. He said, 'Come along with me and took us to a place. There we had rooms at 10s. a week, and stayed there till Sinclair broke his engagement. He went to Newport, leaving me, Fowler, and Mrs. Sinclair at Cardiff. He went to find a shop, and sent a telegram to say he had succeeded. We then all went on to Newport to the shop there. Sinclair can say I am not a violent man, but that Fowler was most violent, and chased him with his revolver and fired up the chimney at Bristol. He is a most violent man. I had to pay Sinclair's lodgings one night to prevent Fowler doing him an injury. I have to-day made a statement to my solicitor before you arrived, and told him where the tools are in the grounds at Muswell Lodge, on the lawn. Fowler had the job put up by another man. (Signed) A. <hi rend="smallCaps">MILSOM</hi>."—I instructed Macey, a sergeant of police, to go and search the grounds for the tools mentioned in that statement—the tools handed to me by Macey are produced—the marks on the back drawing-room, scullery, and kitchen windows are such as could have been caused by tools like these, and by the jemmy found at Bath by Nutkins—the marks on the drawing-room window were very distinct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOODFALL</hi>. I ran my hands over Fowler hurriedly to feel for the revolver—I struck him on the forehead, probably on the head, severely two or three times—he was partially stunned—he fell down, at any rate; I think he struck other people as well as me—his head was plaistered in the infirmary that night or the next day, when he was brought to London—his head was in plaister on April 14th at High-gate, but not on the 22nd—the marks were on his forehead, as they are now, discernible with his cap off; his cap was smashed, and I bought him a new one—he ought to have reported himself on February 16th; he was liberated on licence—I do not think police supervision had commenced—he was liable to arrest for not reporting himself—he would then have to serve the remainder of his term, and perhaps something else—Harlesden is four or five miles from Muswell Hill—a little metal leg was produced at the Police-court as part of the property of Mr. Smith—in conse<lb/>quence of what I heard from Mr. Iffer, I got it from the Swindon Police—they got it from Mr. Price, a publican at Swindon, whom I have seen—it was not found in possession of either of the prisoners—frum information I received, I went to the pub<lb/>lican, who bought it, I was told, from an associate of the prisoners.</p>

There was £112 in the bag in the safe, and I gave him £53 and some shillings, which was an equal share of the money after what I had spent. Is it likely that I should give that to a man who stood outside? He put his foot on the old man's neck until he made sure he was dead; and then we went upstairs, he first, and found the old man's trousers, with the keys of the safe in the pocket; but thieves would cut one another's throat for half a loaf."</p>

                  </hi> (46 <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>). On April 29th I was assisting in taking charge of Fowler at the Highgate Petty Sessions—at the mid-day adjournment I took him to the prisoners' room in company with Sergeant Reynolds—neither of us had spoken to him—I can remember, without referring to my book, that he said, "My pal, the dirty dog, has turned Queen's evidence, and our mouthpiece is no use; but I could tell a tale as well as he. There was £112 in the bag in the safe. I gave him £53 and some shillings, which was an equal share of the money, after what I had spent. Is it likely that I should give that to a man who stood out-side? But thieves will cut one another's throats for half a loaf"—there was nothing else—I made a note of it about 6.30 the same night, after I came back from Holloway Prison—in the meantime, I had been in charge of the prisoner—I had no communication with Reynolds before I made a note about it. (<hi rend="italic">The witness ivas asked to read his note,</hi>) I have left out "He first put his foot on the old man's neck until he made sure he was dead. Then we went upstairs, he first, and found the old man's trousers, with the keys in the pocket."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, Lecturer on Juris<lb/>prudence at Guy's Hospital, and Scientific Analyst to the Home Office—on April 25th I received from Inspector Marshall this overcoat and jacket, waistcoat, pair of trousers, and damaged felt hat—on April 30th received from Sergeant Macey these two iron chisels—I have carefully examined those articles for blood-stains, as well as this pair of boots pro<lb/>duced from the pawnbroker—the jacket is the only article upon which I found blood-stains; on its left sleeve there is a small spot near the arm<lb/>pit, on the right sleeve a spot or smear an inch above the edge of the sleeve, and two small ones about three and a-half inches from the edge—they are stains of mammalian blood of the same age—when I received them I formed the opinion they were a month, or it might be two or three months, old—there was this peculiarity: the front of the coat had a different feel from the rest, such as would be produced by wearing it in rain, and rubbing it down, or by washing; the surface of the texture is a little different from that of the rest of the jacket—the action of moisture and the process of rust would destroy any blood-stains on the chisels when they had been buried; the earth is most destructive of blood—when I received the bits there were still traces of soil upon them—it corresponded in character with the soil upon the chisels and the brace and bit, the ordinary London soil—if blood were quite fresh, wetting and rubbing would be an effectual means of removing blood-stains to such an extent that any traces would disappear in a few weeks.</p>

I am a carman in the employ of Mr. Lighten, of Leather Lane—Read hired vans of him from time to time—on April 21st, about 7.30 a.m, I took out a covered van, and met Read in Leather Lane—he told me to drive to Aldgate—I drove to the Saracen's Head Yard, which is next door to Messrs. Compton's—Botham brought some bags, Read loaded them—I did not see where they were taken from—Read said, "Go over Tower Bridge"—that is in the direction of Deptford, not in the direction of his shop; that is in Hatton Wall—after we had gone some distance, a detective caught hold of my horse's head—I have driven to Deptford once or twice before, but cannot tell you the name of the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is an ordinary van—the licensee's name was in front, where everybody could see it—Read rode at my side—when he has hired a van before, which I have driven, he has gone quite openly, always with a van with a name on it—I did not think there was anything wrong—I have driven for him very often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. I</hi> have driven to Compton and Sons about six times, about eight a.m.—when I go to Compton's I always load up the van.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of J. and A. Dandridge, metal merchants, of High Street, Deptford—we have from time to time bought cloth cuttings of Read, similar to these, by the hundredweight, and took receipts from him—a sack holds a little more than 1 cwt.—the price we paid varied from 15s. to 42s. per cwt.—you would go over the Tower Bridge, from Aldgate, to our premises—I can<lb/>not find any receipt for fine blue cuttings or green; we paid 28s. for violet—I have not got any cotton down; these are woollen, but we paid him 15s. 6d. per cwt. for cotton, and 26s. for list—I have fine blue here at 43s., but no green.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We bought 2 cwt. 10lbs. of pilots on January 14th, and 2 qrs. 1 lb. on the same day, and 1 3/4 cwt. of blue—those prices differ according to the price of wool, but they were all fair prices—we have dealt with Read seven or eight years, and in all the transactions, as far as I know, have been perfectly straightforward, and he bears a good character, as far as I know—we are in a bigger way of business than Read; he is not much of a scholar; he signed the receipts—it is usual for rags from large houses to be bought by small men, and they usually take them home to sort them, as they are mixed—there is nothing unusual in the stuff being cleared away at eight or nine a.m.—that is the best time; I should not think it suspicious.</p>

What is his name?"—he said, "I don't know," but he went back, and pointed out Roberts—I said, "What did you pay for them?"—he said, "I have not paid for them; I am going to take them home to get them weighed"—Roberts said, "I know nothing about it"—I went into the van, and found eight sacks—these are samples taken from each—he was not going towards Hatton Wall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. It was the prisoner's duty to procure 600 wrappers every week for the purpose of sending out these contents bills, and for that purpose alone—when Weekes and I called his attention to the matter he suggested that possibly the money would be required for certain show cards—money would be given every week for general postage purposes, and that money would have to be accounted for by this postage book which the prisoner kept—on January 18th there is an entry of "nineteen show cards, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on January 25th "ten show cards, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and on January 31st "forty-five show cards, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," all in the prisoner's writing—during those weeks the show cards postage money was taken out of the general account—Minton had nothing to do with the £1 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the interview in February, when the prisoner was asked to account, he said nothing about the colonial issue—I think the colonial issue was sent out in December, February, and March—I do not think any were sent out in January—the charges for sending out that issue would be entered in the petty disbursements book—the prisoner had nothing to do with the colonial issue; I and the cashier had to do with it.</p>

I will read this to you, and then tell you what Minton and the boy said"—I read to him a memorandum which I had made on the 11th. (<hi rend="italic">Thin was to the effect that the prisoner had stated that the wrappers were for contents bills, and were sent out each week as per the list produced, Minton giving the cash to the boy to get five bundles of wrappers, which the boy addressed during the week and posted after they had been called over by the prisoner.</hi>) I said, "Minton says that he gave you the cash, £1 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., each week, and that you therefore debit yourself with it here, and that he has never on any occasion given it to the boy"—Mr. Moseley took down what was said—the prisoner replied, "I have the impression that Minton has given the boy the money sometimes. However, why are you putting these questions to me? Am I suspected?"—I replied, I did not suspect anyone; I was only getting information in order that the cap might be fitted on the proper head—he said he would admit that Minton had given him the money, and he would take the responsibility of having sent the wrappers out—Mr. Moseley read to him what he had said, and said, "Have you anything else to say?"—the prisoner said, "No"—he said, "Sometimes all the wrappers have not gone off; sometimes the ne<lb/>cessities of post have occasioned inroads upon the money which Otherwise would have been used upon wrappers"—Mr. Middleton said, "Oh, that is nonsense; because your postage book shows that you have always had £3 or £5 in hand; so you never had any necessity to go to him for money"—the prisoner said, "Well, I have had £1 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each week, and I take the responsibility"—the three weeks I spoke of were those</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant, at 48, West Regent Street, Glasgow—in February, 1892, when I lived at Streatham, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> and answered it—after that the prisoner called on me, and said he was Arthur Jameson, and that he was engaged in the jewellery trade at 8, Doughty Street; that he had some orders in hand that would produce him a large return, and he wanted £35 for a short time to carry out the orders, and he would repay me within a few days—he offered me £8 interest, as he expected to make so large a profit—he gave me eight or ten pawn-tickets for jewellery as security, and this promissory note—he represented that the articles had been pawned for about one-third their value, and that there would be ample security for the loan I made—I advanced him the money in cash—after eight days I called at 8, Doughty Street, which was a private house, and I made inquiries there—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I put the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I called at 8, Doughty Street a great many times—I kept the pawn-tickets for a time; I redeemed one of the articles, a gold chain; it was pawned for £10; I paid the pawnbroker £12, capital and interest—I sold it for £9 10s. to a melter in Clerkenwell—I did not redeem any of the other pawn-tickets; I do not know what has become of them—I got no money through my solicitor in reference to this matter—I wrote to 8, Doughty Street; the letters were returned to me through the Post Office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think there were about ten pawn-tickets; I won't swear to the number; I think the aggregate value on the face of the tickets was over £100—the £8 offered as interest influenced me, but I believed the security offered was good—I also believed the bonus was</p>

               <p>good—I did not calculate the rate of interest; he offered me the £8—it was not denied at 8, Doughty Street that the prisoner had lived there—the prisoner did not state he had a shop there—I took his representations as true—I could not say whether the business of a jeweller was carried on there, nor whether he had orders or not—£9 10s. was the fullest value I could obtain for the chain from an assayer for the intrinsic value of the gold.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Greycoat Gardens, Westminster—I am married—on April 14th, 1892, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph. (This advertisement stated that a tradesman wanted to borrow</hi>£25 <hi rend="italic">for ten days, to enable him to complete a profitable cash order, and that the lender would be paid most liberally, and could hold security value</hi>£100; <hi rend="italic">it was signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Brett,</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">Tysoe Street"</hi>) I answered that—a day or two after the prisoner called on me, and gave the name of Arthur Jameson, and said he was a working jeweller, and wanted the money to complete a very profitable transaction; that he was going to buy stones on the market, and could get them at much better advantage if he had the cash—I asked him what security he offered; he said, "Pawn-tickets"—I said I did not know anything about those; they were of no use to me—he said he did not wish me to keep them; he should come back for them; they were much too valuable; the articles were worth three times more than they had been pledged for—the tickets were for a diamond bracelet and a diamond necklet, pledged with Brabbington; the necklet for £70, and the bracelet for £16, I think—he also gave me this pro<lb/>missory note, dated April 16th, for £45 at ten days—I lent him £35, and he said he would give me a bonus of £10—I kept the tickets and the promissory note—on April 19th he came again, bringing a ring; he said he was a working jeweller, and had an order for about twelve dozen of these rings, or some large number, and would I mind lending him another sum?—I lent him £30, I think it was—he gave me about ten more pawn-tickets for jewellery; he only wanted me to keep them for a day or so; he said they were pledged for one-third their trade value—he gave me this promissory note for £35 at four days—I got this letter on April 23rd, signed "A. Jameson." (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had had a money disappointment, but that he would call on Tuesday, and then take up both his bills.</hi>) He never came again, and I did not see him again till he was in custody—I went with a friend to 8, Doughty Street; it was a lodging-house—I made inquiries there about the prisoner—there was no appearance of business at the place; there was no name of a working jeweller up there, and no name of Jameson, Clifford, or Knight—this was the £30 cheque for the second advance; I have my own banking account—I made inquiries of the pawnbrokers about the articles in pledge, but I did not redeem any of them—in May, 1892, I laid an information before the Magistrate, and a summons was granted—I attended on the day of hearing; the prisoner did not appear.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The warrant remained unexecuted from May, 1892—I am speaking of events that happened four years ago—I have lost the contract note for the diamond necklet pledged with Mr. Babbington—I forgot, when I was before the Magistrate, about the prisoner bringing a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, at 318, High Holborn—F is a contract note for a ring pawned with me for £10; it was never redeemed, and, in accordance with the usual practice, the ring was sent to Debenham and Storr's auction sale, and we bought it in there at £9 10s.—I suppose we have sold it since—its trade value was not more than £10 10s.—the trade value of jewellery is what it would fetch under the hammer, or out of a shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know, by nearly fifty years'experience, that the prices arrived at under the hammer are a fair, reasonable, approximate value—we can very nearly tell what things will fetch before they are put up—we anticipated buying this ring in when it was put up—the law re<lb/>quired us, after keeping it for a certain time, to send it at an auction; we knew it would not fetch the amount for which it was pawned—it was a public auction—I have seen other people than those in the trade there—for the most part, the buyers are dealers—if we find we have lent too much, we sometimes buy in for more than was advanced, and then try to self it afterwaids to a private person—the value in a shop would be greater than the auction value—we should put a fixed profit on it; it would not depend on how much a customer was willing to give—there is a difference between prices in the West-end and the City, but, in the one case, cash is given and in the other generally credit—the value of this ring could be defined exactly, because the diamonds would be worth so much per carat, and the cost to make could not exceed 30s.; a justifiable selling price is a different thing—diamond goods of this kind do not become second-hand in the trade when once pawned; there is no fancy workmanship here or fashion to pay for—it was a marquise cluster—I should not send goods for sale at Debenham and Storr's if I did not think it a good place to get a fair price at—things sold there are sometimes afterwards resold, among the people attending, at an increase—this ring will fetch me 25 per cent, more than I bought it in for—I presume it is sold; I cannot say for how much—Parliament considered that the difference between the actual value of an article and the amount lent upon it by a pawnbroker was 25 per cent., and, by an Act, a pawnbroker has to pay that difference of 25 per cent. more to the pawner if goods are destroyed by fire—it was estimated that the pawnbroker would not advance more than 75 per cent, of the value of an article.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The difference between shop value and auction value is 25 per cent., and you would expect to make that 25 per cent, upon selling the article at Debenham and Storr's—sometimes we make losses—if we buy things in we take them back to the shop and sell over the counter, and we expect to get 25 per cent, more than we have bought in for—it is absurd to say that this ring was pledged for one-third of its trade value—we charge 20 to 25 per cent, interest on these pledges.,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Debenham and Storr's is conducted on much the same lines as Johnson and Dyinond's—the auction value is the true value—I should be able to accurately determine before an article was put up what it would fetch; there would not be two opinions in the trade as to what it would fetch—it is a matter of opinion with regard to different people's valuation—the value may be a matter of opinion before the sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have had somewhat over forty years' experience—a number of pawnbrokers of many years' experience would put the value of an article at within a few shillings of each other—the actual price is not ascertained till the sale, but there are very few shillings' difference between what it realises at the sale and what our opinion of its value was—I do not agree that we advance 75 per cent, of its value and leave a margin of 25 per cent.; we lend as much as we think the article will realise at a sale; we do not suppose that any article will be left with us to realise on; we rely on pledges being redeemed—eight out of every ten pledges are redeemed, I should say, and the interest paid—because they are redeemed, we are able to advance more nearly to the real value.</p>

I held the warrant for the prisoner's arrest in 1892, in consequence of McDonald's complaint, and endeavoured to execute it, but could not do so until March 31st this year—I then arrested him at Bow Street, and read the warrant to him—he said, "Yes"—I conveyed him to the Kilburn Police-station, and searched him, and found £20 in notes and £14 in gold, nine pawnbroker's contract notes for jewellery and seven pawn-tickets for jewellery, two blank promis-sory notes, a cheque-book, and a number of letters and postcards, with American stamps upon them, addressed to boxes at newspaper offices in New York—the prisoner went abroad in November last, and there ad<lb/>vertised about loans, and these letters and postcards related to proposed loans—he was passing in the name of Knight when I arrested him—I found a list of passengers crossing from New York, in which the name of James Knight appeared—I left the summons in the Mrs. McDonald's case at 8, Doughty Street; I found it was a boarding-house, with no trace of any business carried on there.</p>

In this case, false pretences were made to the prosecutors, upon the faith of which they parted with money, and the prisoner at the same time handed a negotialble document, upon which he was liable at a future date; in so obtaining credit, he was acting under the false pretences that he would pay at the date named in the document, and that the transaction was a genuine one, and therefore the false pretences by which he obtained the money might be attached to the charges of obtaining credit (Q. v. Pearce, 16 Cox's ruled Case, Q. v Lord Mayour and soloman). The</hi>

(<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Brewer's Wharf, and was an authority to deliver the goods to Fastnedge's order.</hi>) It was arranged that I was to sell the goods if he did not pay, and if they realised more than was enough to pay his debt, the balance was to be handed to the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner detained at Moor Lane Police-station on April; 20th—I read to him a warrant which had been obtained against him on the 17th—he said, "I had no intention to defraud"—I bad a counterclaim against Mr. Ramsay—I searched and found on him a pawn-ticket for a piece of check coating, a duplicate of the one produced by the pawnbroker—I also found these three printed memorandum forms of Messrs. Ramsay, similar to the one on which the order is written; and a ticket for the other two pieces of stuff which were at the cloak-room of Liverpool Street Station—I said, "I have traced the two pieces of lining to Liverpool Street Station"—he said, "Yes, you will find the cloak-room ticket with those papers," which I had just taken from him; and he said he had pawned the other piece at Hounds-ditch—I went to Liverpool Street Station, and got the other two pieces there—Mr. Schreck identified them.</p>

               <p>Co., East India merchants, of Suffolk House, Laurence Pountney Hill—I have known the prisoner for fifteen or sixteen years as a traveller in the soft goods line, and also in business for himself—he was never in our employ—prior to April 13th he had once or twice ordered goods on our account without our authority—I got no invoice of those goods, but I got a statement a month afterwards, and I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he said he was very sorry; he would never do it again without my permissions—he had a general authority from us that if he got orders on our account which we accepted, we would give him commissian; we should have given him commission if he got an order which we executed—he had no authority to order goods in our name without our consent—he had no right to have any of our memorandum forms in his possession—I did not know he had any—the whole of this order is in his writing, which I know—he had no authority to sign our name,"Ramsay and Co., pp. D. R.," without my permission—I never spoke to me about the order in this document; I knew nothing about it till I got the invoice from Mr. Schreck—this order was not written by me, or sent with my authority in any way—I never had the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Priwner.</hi> You gave an order with my authority, twelve months ago, for goods from Walker and Co., to the value of about £20—I believe you sent an order by telegram in June, with my permission—I have the book here—you used to come to the office to tell me what you had done—goods were purchased from another tirm with my consent—if an order was given in July to Walker and Co., it was with my consent; there is no record of it here—you had to get my authority before acting; nothing could be done without my authority—everything that was bought before this last case was put before me—in all cases you consulted me first—in the majority of cases the orders are copied on regular order sheets; I do not know why it was not done in these cases—we got patterns from manufacturers for you, and you went out and sold at different prices from those we paid the manufacturers; you would not get your commission till you resold—you did not bring the goods personally; they are on our order forms; I cannot show from these copies whether they were on order forms or not—you bought goods last May with my permission—you only had the right to use the invoices given you with our office—you came there perhaps once a week; you had a table in the outer office and a book—a clerk would not give you a lot of invoices; I should not have thought anything of your having three or four of these order forms—I have settled up with you about your commission—I have no statement of your commission account made out—we cannot settle up with you, because there is an outstanding debt due from a man who is gone; you sold £100 worth of goods to a man who is not known, and we cannot trace him; you have been paid, in all cases except that, more than the com<lb/>mission was altogether—if the £100 is a bad debt, we have overpaid you; I have kept you really—during the last twelve months I have given you hundreds of pounds out of my own pocket; the books do not show it—I told you if we got in the £100 I would give you a lump sum—if the £100 were paid you would be entitled to commission; perhaps a little would be due to him upon the accounts—before buying the goods in each instance you had to consult me or the firm.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I allege that the defendant obtained the goods by means of false representations—I never spoke to him, or his brother, in my life; but I was dealing with the firm, I knew Coppen, Deacon and Co. only—I only knew the defendant by sight—I do not know that the acceptance was in his writing, upon which my claim in bankruptcy was founded—I have taken warrants for tea to the bank, but I do not buy on four months' credit, I buy at public sales, and pay before delivery—if a person came to me and bought tea, I would take his bill if he gave satisfactory, references—those were the terms on which I dealt with the defendant—the moment he gave me the acceptance I should hand him over the warrants for the tea so sold—he would be entitled to sell them for cash next morning, although the bill was at four months, and put the cash in his pocket, but he certainly would not be entitled to take them to his bankers and deposit them for a temporary advance; if I knew he was doing it, I should refuse to give him the warrant—he has the warrants from us for the purposes of his trade—we have lodged warrants at the bank as cover, which have been paid for, but not warrants which have not been paid for; we cannot obtain warrants till we pay for them, because we buy at sales—when acceptances are given, warrants are delivered, but it would be wrong to deposit them for a temporary advance at the bank—this is right: "The general rule is three months' credit, and in some cases longer, if we draw on a customer at four months, and receive his acceptance, he is entitled to his warrants for trade purposes; he may sell the goods at a profit for cash, and put the cash at his bank and draw out the cash next day, and if he likes to go to the next sale at Mincing Lane, and buys goods for cash, he may take the warrants to his bank."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Peek Brothers, of East-cheap, and have had experience of the tea trade of London—it is not the custom for a person who buys goods, and does not pay for them, to deposit them for cash at his bankers, and if after having obtained the goods he sells them, and then pledges the warrants, that would be doubly duhonest—pledging warrants which are paid for, is perfectly legitimate and com<lb/>mon—there never was an arrangement for paying once a month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is true: "A merchant in the ordinary way may deposit warrants with his banker as cover, even if he has given an acceptance in respect of the warrants which is not then due"—but that is an hypothetical case; no such case arises in legitimate business—we gave credit to his firm for £1,000, and he was not to exceed that—that was on a four months' acceptance—the goods were applied for one day, and the bills given the second day. and they wore taken to the bank on the third day—that was not legitimate business—he had a credit of £1,000, but not for fifteen years—his firm has very likely been paying us £2,000 or £3,000 a year for upwards of fourteen years, but there have been hitches—I think we have made complaints during that time, but I cannot recollect without the books—I have left the City for more than twelve months—I have only deposited warrants which have been paid for, with my bankers—I cannot get them without paying for them by cash, not by acceptances—I have not known of cases where warrants have been delivered on arceptances, and then used by way of temporary cover to the bankers—I have not done it myself, nor has my firm, to my knowledge—I deny it—I do not recollect the prisoner's father being in our service.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180077"/>
               <p>May and June—we were creditors in his bankruptcy to the amount of £1,057;10s. 11d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was seven years with Mr. Peek as ledger-keeper—his transactions for many years were somewhere about £3,000 a year, and we never had a bill returned—there was four months' credit for tea only, but we had transactions in coffee—if a con tract was made the purchaser was entitled to the warrants at once, and it does not mutter whether he gives the acceptance first or afterwards; it is simply a matter of convenience between the contracting parties; there is not a general custom in the matter, so far as I am aware, but on the contract it says, "All warrants and goods in bond are held as security against the debts of the arm"—when he makes purchases he is not entitled to his warrants, according to the custom of the'trade; I should say there is no custom; it is a matter of courtesy—it is not the general custom of our firm to deliver warrants to customers directly the contract is clear, but it is done in cer<lb/>tain cases; we always did it with him, but not in many other cases—it is usual, directly the acceptance is given, to hand over the document of title; but if I had any idea that the buyer was anything but a good firm, we should not do so, we should not take the contract—Coppen made no representation to me as to his financial position; he paid our firm £20,000, or perhaps £30,000 during the seven years that I was ledger clerk—we occasionally paid duty for him; at other times we delivered the warrants—it did not matter to us, when we had once made the contract, whether it was fur export or for home trade, but the word "export" being on it, we should expect it to be shipped abroad; all that that would convey to my mind is that there would be no duty to pay—he could change his mind afterwards, we had no control over that—there' would be nothing wrong commercially in it; but it does not happen frequently in my experience.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This was an exceptional arrangement with Coppen as to handing over the warrants; it is not customary; it was founded on our absolute belief in his solvency.</p>

                  </hi>. I live a Cheltenham—in January, this year, I was confined of female child—in March I saw an advertisement in a Bristol paper, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy: "Couple with no child, want care of or would adopt one: terms £10. Care of Ship Ex<lb/>change, Bristol"—I wrote 20th: "Kensington Road, Oxford Road, Reading, Berks. To Mrs. Scott. Dear Madam,—In reference to your letter of adoption of a child, I beg to say I shall be glad to have a little baby</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180082"/>
               <p>girl, one that I can bring up and call my own. First, I must tell you, we are plain, homely people, in lairly good circumstances. We live in our own house, and have a good and comtortable home. We are out in the country, and sometimes I am alone a great deal. I don't want the child for money's sake, but for company and home comfort. Myself and husband are dearly fond of children. None of my own. A child with me would have a good home, and a mother's love and care. We belong to the Church of England. I would not mind the mother or any friend coming to see the child at any time, and know the child is going on all right. I only hope we may come to terms. I should like to have the baby as soon as you can arrange it. If I can come for her, I don't mind paying for one way. I could break my journey at Gloucester; I have a friend in the Asylum there I should be so glad to call and see. It'you will let me have an early reply I can give you some references.—Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARY HARDING</hi>."—I replied to that letter, and received this, dated March 22nd, in the same handwriting, dated "45, Kensington Road, Reading. To Mrs. Scott. Dear Madam,—Many thanks for your letter this morning. I shall not answer anyone else till I hear from you again. I assure you I will do iny duty to the dear child I will be a mother as far as possible in my power. If you like to corns and stay a few days, or a week, later on I shall be pleased to make you welcome—it, is just lovely here in the summer. Tnere is an orchard opposite our front door. You will say H is healthy and pleasant. I think Doris a very pretty name; I am sure she ought to be a pretty child."—I answeied that, and in reply received this letter of March 24th, in the same handwriting: "My dear Madam,—Your letter just to hand, and I shall only be too pleased for yourself and any friends to come to us; we don't have many visitors out here in the country. I assure you it would be as great a treat to us as to you. I shall feel comfortable to know that the dear child has some one to care for her. I will do a mother's duty by her, and I will bring her up entirely, just the same as my own child. Every care shall be taken of her, and when you come you will see I do my duty by her, dear child. I shall only be too glad to have her; and I will take her entirely at the sum of £10. She shall be no further expense to her family. I will come on Monday next. I will let you know later on what time train. I have not a time-table, but I will find out, and let you know.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">HARDING</hi>." "If Tuesday will suit you better, kindly let me know, as either day will suit me.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HARDING</hi>"—I received another letter, dated Friday morning, in the same handwriting: "My Dear Mrs. Scott,—Just a letter to say I have not heard from you to say I must not come on Monday, so I take it for granted I shall come on Monday next. I shall leave here at nine, and get to Gloucester about twelve; and go straight to Woottou Asylum; then I will take the next train to Cheltenham. I fancy I can be at Manchester Street not later than two. I hope it will be a fine day.—Faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">HARDING</hi>." "My husband says, if the mother would like an agree<lb/>ment, would you kindly draw one out, and we will sign it?"—I replied to that, and then received this, of Sunday, the 29th, in the same hand-writing: "My Dear Madam,—Your letter came this morning, so I will come on Tuesday next, by the 9.50. Bring a warm shawl to wrap round baby an the train. Fearfully cold here to-day.—Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">HARDING</hi>."—On</p>

               <p>Tuesday, March 31st, the prisoner came to my address at Cheltenham about mid-day—she said she was Mrs. Harding, and had come for the baby—before she came I had prepared this agreement—I put it before her, and she read it, and signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "dated March, 1896." "I, Ann Harding, of 45, Kensington Road, Oxford Road, Reading, in considera<lb/>tion of £10 paid to me by E. E. Marmon, agree to adopt the child, and to bring up the same as my own, without any further compensation over and above the £10.—Signed by <hi rend="smallCaps">ANN HARDING</hi>, E. E. <hi rend="smallCaps">MARMON</hi>, witnessed by <hi rend="smallCaps">MAKTHA POCKETT</hi>."—that was my landlady—I paid the prisoner the £10, and she signed the receipt at the back of the agreement—she left Chelten<lb/>ham with the baby by the 5.20 train—I went with her as far as Gloucester—I took with me a cardboard box containing baby clothes; handed that to the prisoner at Gloucester—the baby was dressed in a ✗fawn-coloured pelisse and a white bonnet—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it went away in that—these are the actual things it went away in—the child was quite well when it left me—she said she was going to take it to Reading—she promised to write to me the same evening—at Cheltenham she fetched a carpet bag from the cloak room, and took it with her in the train to Gloucester—this is like the bag; I could not say it is thesame; it is the same style of bag—I next received this letter from her on April 2nd—it is in the same handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Pervis Road, Kensal Rise. Dear Mrs. Scott,—When I got home last night, a wire was waiting for me—my sister dangerously ill; so this morning I came up. My dear little girl is a traveller, and no mistake. She was so good; did not mind the journey; she slept all the way. I shall stop now till Saturday. Sunday I will write again, if not before. In great haute.—I am, Yours, A. <hi rend="smallCaps">HARDING</hi>. A long letter next time.") I heard no more from the prisoner—I wrote to her on April 4th—on April 7th a police constable called on me at Cheltenham, and on the 11th I went to the mortuary at Reading at the request of the police, and there saw the body of my child—it was ten weeks old—this powder box is one of the things I sent with the child, and the cardboard box is like the one she had—it has some of the clothes still in it—there were a number of diapers in it when it went away; this is one of them; it was found round the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not make any inquiries about the prisoner before the 31st—I did not ask her anything about the asylum at Gloucester; she told me it was her sister-in-law that she wes going to see there—I did not ask her for any references; I did not think it necessary—I did not take the trouble to inquire whether the statements in her letters were true—I did not go and sew her—she was not excited when I met her on the 31st—I asked her if she was Mrs. Harding, and she said she was—I noticed nothing strange in her conduct or behaviour—she did not tell me that she herself was in any asylum—I did not ask her about her previous history, she told me a lot of things—she told me about her husband and about her circumstances, that was all—she said she was fond of children—she appeared to be an affectionate woman, from her appearance and her conversation I parted with my baby; I was satisfied with her looks—I should not have thought she was capable of committing such a crime as she is charged with—she told me that the carpet bag contained eggs and clothing.</p>

               <p>recollect what she said, or if she said anything—my deposition was read over to me; this is my signature to it—I asked my mother to give the child the titty to keep it quiet, and she said something then, but I can<lb/>not remember what it was—my mother had no food or bottle for it—I wanted my mother to give it the indiarubber titty, just something to suck—the child did not seem hungry—my mother gave it the titty, and the child was quiet for a little while; but it broke out again, and then I gave it some bread and butter, and it was all right till about six o'clock—my mother shook the child before I gave it the bread and butter; she was cross with it, and called it a little devil, but I could not understand exactly what it was—she said she should not keep it, and called it a little devil, and passed a remark that I cannot quite remem<lb/>ber now—she passed a remark which I understood to mean she should not keep it—we had got back about two p.m.—about six that same evening the prisoner asked me if I was going to put my little boy, Harold, to bed, and I said, "Yes"; and she said either "I will put mine, too," or "I will put this one, too"—she undid his pinafore and frock—I took Harold into the other room—as I left the room she said, "Don't be many minutes," or "Don't come in for a few minutes,"I could not he positive which—I might have been out of the room for ten or fifteen minutes—when I got back to the sitting-room the baby was lying on the couch, covered all over with her shawl—I did not see its face—I asked the prisoner if it had gone to sleep, and she said, "Yes"—I went to look at it, but she pushed me away, and said, I was not to touch him, or I should wake him up—be<lb/>fore I went into my bedroom it had been crying—it had stopped crying a few minutes before I left the sitting-room—when I came back I did not know it was the baby on the couch, any more than it looked like the child; I only saw the shape of the child covered up with the shawl, and I did not see it anywhere else—I did not want to see it for anything particular—I did not think it peculiar for the prisoner to push me away when I went to look at it, because she is very apt to do it when I want to do any<lb/>thing she does not want me to do—soon after my husband came into the room—he asked if we had been to fetch the child—I said, "Yes"—he looked acrosa at the couch, and asked if that was the little <hi rend="italic">nipper</hi> there, and he walked towards the couch—the prisoner told him not to go to him or touch him, because the child was asleep—just before we went to bed, between ten and eleven, I asked the prisoner if I should make a bottle of milk for the child, and the prisoner said, "No, if he wants one I can make it myself"—between 7 and 7.30 I went out with the prisoner and my husband—before going out the prisoner asked me if I could lock up her carpet bag in the box—I said, "No," and asked her what she bad in it to want it locked up—she said she had nothing in it particular, but she did not want other people in the room pulling her things about—when we went out of the room she locked the door of the sitting-room—at that time the carpet bag was under the couch, and the child was still asleep on the couch, completely covered up by the same shawl—it had been on the couch from the time I went into the room, about 6.15, till we went out, about 7 or 7.30—I had been in the room all the while—I had not noticed it move or utter a sound during that time—nobody had gone to look at it in my presence; I had not—I was in the room—I had given it some bread and butter and milk before it was put down on the</p>

I examined the prisoner at Holloway Gaol—the first time I saw her Dr. Scott was present—I had a long inter<lb/>view with her—I had not read much about the trial, nor formed an opinion before I saw her—T asked her a great many questions; after that I considered she was a person of unsound mind, suffering from delusions and hallucinations—a delusion is a belief in something which has no</p>

               <p>said, when the boy enlisted she was unconscious for three weeks, and when she woke up she fancied that the rats were crawling all over her—I then went back to the subject of the crime, and asked her when she first knew of the occurrence, the crime she was in custody for—her reply was, "On Easter Sunday or Easter Monday, or it might have been on Good Friday"—I said (<hi rend="italic">referring to his notes</hi>), "Can you tell me anything, about the two children found in the river? how did you hear about it?"—she said, "I cannot tell; when I try to recollect dates I cannot do so. It might have been months or years; that is when I get mystified"—I said, "What were the names of these children?"—Mrs. Dyer thought for a time, and then replied, "I am sure I do not know. I cannot tell the names now"—I passed on to "When did you first hear about what had happened?"—her reply was, "Good Friday or Easter Monday, or perhaps it was Tuesday"—I asked her if she had not missed the children. Her reply was, "I cannot tell"; she never thought a bit about them—I asked her when she saw them last—she said she did not know—these are the chief things in the conversation I had with her—I formed my opinion, on examining her twice, that she is a person of unsound mind, and not responsible for her actions.

I have heard the evidence given to-day—the transient or re<lb/>current form of insanity is the most formidable of its kind—predisposition to an attack is greater in a recovered lunatic than in. one who has been always sane—it depends upon circumstances generally—she would be predisposed to an attack at any time—insomnia is a concomitant symptom of insanity, but not taken <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> and not always.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LAWRENCE</hi>. The defence of insanity had been raised when I was first consulted, on May 14th—I got my instructions on the 15th—depression in a sane person, charged with murder, is not unnatural; I mean low-spiritedness—I put the question about the voices—that was the first I heard about them—she had not mentioned them till I put the question—I knew she had been in an asylum—she did not say she had been an attendant in an asylum—one question I put was, how she got her children when she had no children; she said she had been a monthly nurse, a surgical nurse, and a medical nurse—I put the question, "Do you ever see visions?"—I asked her, with regard to the voices, "Do they speak to you?"—that was the last question but three on my second visit—the first I heard about visions was on my second visit, about the voices I heard on the first—I should not have expected signs of excitement, because in melancholia and monomania there are no out<lb/>ward evidences of lunacy—excitement shows quite a distinct type of insanity from what I saw—the strain of being charged with a serious crime would be likely to shake the firmest nerves—I asked, "Do you ever see visions?"—her reply was, "Do not ask me"—I continued, and then pressed the question, "What do you see?"—her reply was, "I cannot tell you; that is why I keep awake at night; sounds and sights, and one thing and another; I keep it all to myself"—"Won't you give me some notion?"—she hesitated for a moment, then said, "My poor boy! my poor mother!"—"Do they ever speak to you?"—"Frequently; I hear them talking, telling me to come to them;</p>

When my poor boy went awny and enlisted I never slept for three weeks. I knew no one. I beat the rats off. Everything seemed to fly to my head, and I feel I want to fly to my boy"—it constantly happens that people with trouble conjure-up visions and dreams—the greater the trouble the more extravagant sometimes the vision—I am not surprised either way, if they have them or not—visions appear to people when they are wide awake and conscious; dreams cannot—melancholia would disclose itself by a tendency to suicide.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KAPADIA</hi>. I made a report—I say, "Having to-day seen the above prisoner at Holloway in the presence of Dr. Scott, the medical officer of the prison at Holloway, and having seen the news-paper reports of the trial, and the various reports as to her life's history, and her conduct before and after the trial, also the reports of her early history, I come to the following conclusions"—all the evidence influenced me as an unbiassed person—if the whole mass of premisses were wrong, ray conclusion would be wrong—I was informed of the crimes by the reports—I relied entirely in my judgment of her insanity upon my ex<lb/>amination; the rest is a statement of facts to make perfectly clear the conditions under which I examined her—I say, "symptoms always of a transient nature"—that is not necessarily the worst kind of insanity—sometimes it is very formidable when it is sa called impulse—there was no evidence of that before me in this case—the evidence was that of state<lb/>ments of medical officers of asylums when admitted, when discharged, and statements, in case-books at asylums, of medical officers of those asylums—I should not say that such persons are generally liable tohomicidal mania—some who hear imaginary voices are liable to homicidal mania, not generally; those voices are of two distinct descriptions, some command<lb/>ing, some merely indicating—the instances are not rare among those who commit crime—hearing voices and being impelled to do certain acts are symptoms of homicidal mania—one attack of insanity frequently pre<lb/>disposes for another, and if two or three, the person would be still more liable—the intention of violence or feeling would be dormant for awhile, or it would not be impulse—homicidal mania is not necessarily periodical—I should think so in the majority of cases fortunately—homicidal per<lb/>sons have commonly attempted suicide—they have expressed a wish to die—I should not think confession of guilt a common characteristic of it—the sight of a weapon or an intended victim would be an incentive—the patient, perhaps, could not resist the temptation—he might write sensibly and clearly—you may detect insanity in the writing or in the conversation—I wrote, "There seems to be no doubt that the mother was insane, and it is likely that she has a defective power of self-control, and might be induced to do wrong more readily as a consequence"—I have since my report heard the mother was not insane—I began my examination by tell<lb/>ing her I was a doctor—I made no note at the moment, but I made my report immediately on my return home—I told her I had come to examine her—I asked her if she knew why she was in the gaol—she said, "Yes"—"Do you know the nature of the crime you are accused of?"—she said, "Yes"—"Can you explain it in any way?"—"No, I know nothing about it; I know I am accused of this, but if I did this" or "them, I must have been mad when I did them, because I am so fond of children"—then I began to ask her history, whether she had been married more than once, what occupations her husbands had respectively, how many children she had herself, what had become of those children, how many were still living, then as to why she went to be nurse, and as to the two years' regular training she had had at medical, surgical and monthly nursing; then she told me she had been some months, I think, attendant</p>

               <p>at this Fishponds Lunatic Asylum, but she did not care for that very much—that fact was verified by Dr. Scott—I heard it from the prisoner—I accepted nearly all she said—then I examined her as to whether she saw properly, heard properly, and whether her taste and smell were correct, trusting to her reports in most cases—then I asked whether she was troubled, whether she slept well or badly—she said she had been sleeping very badly, and dreamed a great deal—I did not allude to hallucinations—I have heard of them—presently she said, when speaking about sleep and about being disturbed, "I hear voices"—"What do they say?"—"They say 'Do it'"—"What does 'Do it,' mean"—"Well, I had better kill myself; I am constantly hearing these voices"—"By day as well as by night?"—"Yes"—I said, "Were there many kinds of voices?" and tried to get further information, but I got nothing beyond that—at the time she did not give me any clue to her having visions, though I asked—I heard of the certificate given by Dr. Logan in 1893, where Dr. Logan described the symptoms—I heard Dr. Logan, bat he spoke of years gone by, and I have no right to deny or question it—that is not what I am giving an opinion upon now—I did not conclude the prisoner was suffering from homicidal mania or some kind of insanity—a person may be violent, without being homicidaliy maniacal—I got the information about her being confined in an asylum—she spoke only about suicide—she said the voices said, "Do it."</p>

               <p>in July last I went with the prisoner to make arrangements with his customers to pay their accounts direct to the firm—we went to 162 Grove Road for that purpose—I asked for Miss Weeks, and was told that no suchperson lived there—I asked the gentleman I saw how long they had been living there, and they said eighteen months—I said to the prisoner, "If these people have been living here for eighteen months, Miss Weeks could not have been living here at the time the agreement was signed"—he said he had delivered the piano there, and there must have been some mistake—I asked him whether he could give me Miss Weeks's present address—he said, "No"—I said, "Can you give me any information as to where I can find her address, or any information of her friends"; he said, "No"—I said, "Will you endeavour to ascertain her address?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How can you ascertain?"—he said, "She pays regularly"—I said, "Then, when she comes to pay, or sends, will you ob<lb/>tain from her her address?" and he said he would—I saw him on several subsequent occasions—I called at his house several times in August, but he was away from town—when I did see him again, I asked him if he had found out the address, and he said, "No"; though he says he has had money from her, he has not asked her for her address.</p>

On May 19th, 1893, the prisoner called and produced this agreement for the hire purchase of a piano for £23, and said he would send home the piano, which was one of his own, to Mr. Vines, of Ben ton Road, Hackney, and he asked me to pay him £12, and take possession of the agreement, which was in his name; on the back is written: "In consideration of £12 paid by you to me this day, I hereby absolutely assign to you all my property and interest in the piano"; that is signed by him—I paid him £12, and subsequently I paid him £2 com<lb/>mission—at the time I took it over I believed this was a genuine instru<lb/>ment, signed by Mr. Vines, and that he had delivered one of his pianos to Mr. Vines.</p>

About 11.45 a.m. on May 15th, I was on duty in Pritchard Road—Ruby made a communication to me, and I went to the Regent's Canal towing path, near 2, North Place—I saw the prisoner there insensible—I did not see the child then—I sent for a doctor, and the prisoner was taken to the hospital—about three hours after she recovered consciousness, and I took her to the Police-station—she was charged with attempted murder and attempted suicide—she said nothing in answer to</p>

               <p>the charge—she was taken to the infirmary, where she remained one night, and on the 16th she was taken to Worship Street Police-court—I could see the spot where she had been taken out; in the centre the canal is about nine feet at that place—the baby was brought in while the prisoner was being attended by Dr. O'Brien, for whom I had sent; it did not appear to have suffered at all—I made inquiry as to where the woman came from, and I found that she is a very respectable person, and lives in the neighbourhood.</p>

I was not examined at the Police-court; I believe the Magistrate made an order for me to attend here—I have known the prisoner for some time—I had medically attended her—I saw her on May 15th, just after she came out of the water—I did not hear her statement before the Magistrate. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows</hi>:—"I have been suffering from depression during the week, and Dr. O'Brien, out of the Broadway, had been attending me all last week. Yesterday my head was so bad, I did not know what I was doing.") I attended her on the Monday and Wednesday previous to the Friday when this happened, for symptoms similar to those—I am the doctor she refers to—she was at that time in a delicate state of health—on the Monday and Wednesday, when I saw her, she was suffering from depression, severe headache, and was evidently distressed—I have known her for six or eight months, and I can say that she is a very respectable woman—her husband is outside the Court to-day—I think that her statement, "Yesterday my head was so bad, I did not know what I was doing," is very probable under the-circumstances.</p>

I live at Frant Road, Clapham Junction—I am the mother of the prisoner's wife—she has been living for the past few months at 2, Fulham Palace Terrace, a shop—for a fortnight before April 13th I had been stopping there with her, her eldest daughter, Amelia, and two or three other children—on Friday night, April 10th, I met the prisoner and his wife together in Fulham Road—they had been separated—he asked her to take him back—she said she could not do so then—he asked to be allowed to see his children—she said, "If you promise to behave yourself better than you have done, and come and see them in a proper manner, I will allow you to see them"—he walked with us some distance, and we showed him where we were living; she told him he should see his children the next day at noon—on Saturday, April 11th, he called about twelve—he asked his wife to take him back again; she said she could not do so—he told her he had now here</p>

               <p>to go, and that if she did not take him back something very serious would happen; that perhaps it would mean years, and very likely the rope for him, if she did not take him back—I don't remember that she made any answer to that—she gave him some dinner in the room behind the shop—he said he had not much money to buy food—he saw his children—he was in and out nearly the whole of the Saturday—he asked her more than once, I believe, in my presence, to take him back—she said, having got the separa<lb/>tion from him, she really could not, as he had behaved so badly—she declined to take him back—he went away on Saturday night—John Kent has been in the habit of visiting my daughter's house for some time past—it is a cigar, tobacco, confectionery, and mineral water shop—the prisoner called on the Sunday; I was in the shop a good deal, and did not hear all the conversation—the prisoner asked her to let him come back—Kent was in the kitchen, and did not hear that—she asked him to get some work, and try and do better for himself, and come at some future time, and she might think better of it—he said he had tried to get work, and that he was not willing to wait and do as she asked him—he said he believed she and Kent were living together—that is all that passed on the Sunday, to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion—on the following morning, Monday, he called—he said he had been to a job, where he expected to have started work, but he had not been successful—he was there a long time, I think till dinner<lb/>time, on the Monday—I heard the conversation between them; I was in and out of the shop—he got very excited when he found she had really made up her mind not to take him back for the present—he said, "If you don't take one back I will shoot you"—I spoke to him; it was the first conversation I had really had with him—I asked him to try and go and get some work—I don't think his wife made any reply when he threatened to shoot her—he did not have dinner there on the Monday—he went away, after shaking hands with his wife—at eight o'clock on the Monday evening, 13th, Kent, my daughter Clara, and I, were sitting in the room behind the shop—my grand-daughter, Amelia, was in the outer shop—she opened the door leading into the room where we were, and said something—the prisoner followed sharply behind her—his wife was facing the door, between the door and the mantelpiece—Kent was at the far end of the kitchen, facing the door—it is a long, narrow kitchen—there was a long kitchen fire-range between him and the prisoner's wife—she was About in the middle of the kitchen—she got up as the prisoner rushed in; he stopped quite close to us—his hand was under the back of his coat; he drew a revolver from behind him, and said, "Now, you or me for it," and he fired, taking a deliberate aim for her head—he was not more than a yard from her, I should think, quite close—as he fired she raised her hand; she said, "Oh, Ted! Don't, Ted!"—he fired two shots at her in quick succession; I cannot say whether the first or second took effect—after the second shot I rushed out, pushing Amelia in front of me—after the two shots my daughter called out, "I am shot"—that is what took place, as far as I know—I afterwards saw ray daughter's wrist; she was taken to a doctor's, and then to a hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Fulham Palace Terrace—in September 1895, I obtained a judicial separation from my husband at the South<lb/>western Police Court; this is the document. (<hi rend="italic">This was an order made by Mr. Lane on September</hi> 10th, 1895, <hi rend="italic">that the husband, having been con<lb/>victed of an aggravated assault upon his wife, and she being in danger from him, sha should no longer be bound to cohabit with him.</hi>) I was then living in Usk Road, Battersea—after that I took furnished apartments, because my home was sold up—finally, I went to 2, Fulham Palace Terrace, and lived there with my three daughters, the eldest of them named Amelia—the front part of the house is a tobacconist's shop—for about a fortnight before April 13th my mother, Mrs. Panton, had been living with me—between September 10th and April 10th I saw my husband twice (once on Boxing Night), but I did not speak to him—on Friday, April 10th,. I met him in the Fulham Road—my mother was not with me at the time; she joined me afterwards—the prisoner called me "Clara" three times, and came back to me—he said, "Are you going to let me see those children? Will you let me see those children?"—I said, "If you behave yourself like another man"—I took him to the house where I and the children were living, and made an appointment that he should see the children at noon next day, Saturday, 11th—about noon on the Saturday he came, and I let him see the children—he asked me whether I would take him back again—I told him I would if he would work and keep me and the children—he said he must come back; he should not leave me; that he should have the rope for it, or something like that, if I did not take him back—I told him I would not be turned out in the streets of a night, and I should go to bed in peace, as I was doing so—I gave him some dinner—he kept asking me to let him come back—I said he could not stay—I would not allow him to stay—he said he knew this would come to some<lb/>thing if I did not take him back—I knew John Kent, who is called Jack—the prisoner said, "You won't have Jack Kent; I shall take your and Jack's life"—that was said three days running, Saturday, Sunday and Monday—he did not say anything particular about Jack being the cause of his and my separation—on Sunday morning he came again about the same time, and I gave him some dinner—I asked him to get some work—he said he would—he came to my place, on and off, till about six or seven p.m.—Kent was there at three p.m.; he went out and came back again—the prisoner came back at nine—there was not much said when he came back between six and seven, when Kent was there—the prisoner kept asking me on the Sunday to take him back, and I told him to get work, and promised to take him back when he got it—he said he could not leave me; he should not go away; there would be something happen to me and Kent—he said something would happen on the Monday to me and Jack Kent if I did not take him back again—I guessed what he meant—on the Monday, April 13th, he called—I told him he must not come into my place, because I should be breaking my separation, and I would not unless he got work; if he kept coming into my house he would break my separa<lb/>tion order, and I did not wish to do it—he said he could not stand it—I think he stayed in the shop—my mother said he must not</p>

               <p>do anything of that sort—on Monday evening I, my mother and Kent were sitting in the kitchen, and Amelia was in the shop—she ran in crying out something, and the prisoner followed her in—he rushed in with a revolver, which he took from behind him—I saw it in his right hand—I rushed in front of my mother and children—he fired at my head; he was three-quarters of a yard to a yard from me—he held the revolver facing the side of my head—I was stooping down; I put up my right hand—the bullet struck my wrist—he fired three shots at me altogether—as he was rushing in, before he fired, he said, "Now, me or you for it"—I said, "Oh, Ted, don't!" three times—the last two shots missed me—Kent took up a chair, and then I went out—I was behind the copper when the three shots were fired; there were some newspapers on it—I afterwards looked at them; there was a bullet-mark on them and on the mantelpiece, which was about half a yard from me, and close to the newspapers—I was standing between the prisoner and the newspapers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Russell first came to my stall there were about a dozen customers there, and after the charge was taken, two dozen or thirty—there were not above a dozen all the time King was there, but there were about fifteen when Russell came up first, when they tried top ersuade him to have some coffee—there is a clock at my stall, behind me, and I looked at the time—I knew Russell by sight, but when he came to my stall I had known him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that the man I saw pass my stall was the prosecutor; he was intoxicated—I had a good light on my stall, two paraffin lamps.</p>

I did not see or hear anything of the robbery till Russell came up—I know where it was; the spot is two dozen yards from my stall; a man might be robbed there, and I know nothing about it—when the policeman came up with Russell, and Russell said, "That is the man who stole my watch and chain,"I did not say to the policeman, "This man has made a mistake, this man, King, has never been out of my com<lb/>pany from a quarter to one"—I thought it was all right—I did not go tp the Police-court next morning; I was in bed; I had been up all night, and I did not think it was my place to go to the station and give informa<lb/>tion—I first heard on the Tuesday that he was committed for trial—I asked the policeman if my opinion was correct—I saw Sheehan; I do not remember when he came up.</p>

I am a decorator, of 119, Barnsbury Street, Isling<lb/>ton—on May 12th. about 12.50 a.m., I was at this coffee-stall in Penton<lb/>ville Road—when I arrived there a man was there whom I knew as Billy, that is the prisoner King—five or six other men came up, and I heard them say, "Have a cup of coffee, old <hi rend="italic">chap"</hi>—he said, I wish to get a cab, and go home—I believe Russell to be the man—I know him better by his action than his appearance—five or six men followed him; they looked a rough sort, who were taking advantage of his drunkenness—King was standing at the stall—he was drunk, and I advised him to go home—he was having a cup of coffee, and then left—I left at 1.10—I have been brought here on subpoena.</p>

                  </hi>. I live Jat Bass Wood North, Finchley—in December last I was living at 34, Harold Road, Upper Holloway—I was looking out for a business—I had some money, and so had my wife—my attention was attracted to this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph:</hi> "Advance £15 wanted, ten days, by Tradesman. Will pay Urge interest.—Postal Department, <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>"—I saw other advertisements of a similar character in the paper, and sent postcards, after which the prisoner Brooks called on me in December, but I knew him as Robbins—he showed me a card, "W. J. Robbins, Mounter and Dealer in Precious Stones, 51, Trinity Square, Borough"—he told me he had been there for some years, and required £15 to buy diamonds to complete orders, as he had run short on account of the Christmas and New Year's trade, and should be able to pay punctually in ten days—I was to get £5 and a present, but I refused the present—he said it would pay him well, as he made large profits—he gave me some pawn-tickets as a guarantee of good faith—he said that they represented goods from his stock, and were not pawned for their full value, but for the amount he wanted at the time—he showed me the pawn-tickets, and made out a promissory note for £20 in ten, days' time on a form which he had in his possession—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bundle of some of the pawn-tickets he gave me, not all—this was done at the Royal Oak public-house—he said he would write, and made an appointment to pay me; but I wrote when the ten days had elapsed, and then be wrote, saying he was going to Birmingham, and would call on his return—I did not see him again or hear from him till he was in custody—I believed the statements he made—this is Carter's advertise<lb/>ment, which I answered: "Cash wanted till June 14th, to complete con<lb/>tract. "Security value £50 will be deposited. J. D. Rendall."—Carter called on January 1st or 2nd; he said he was exceedingly pressedfor money,</p>

               <p>and was running short on account of the Christmas and New Year's busi<lb/>ness, ard that he was in a large way of business, getting up jewellery for West-end shops—he said, "I carry on my business at 23, Clarence Road, Canonbury, with my wife and nine children"—he showed me some designs for making up, and remarked that that was the first time he had had to borrow—I told him I was going into business, and it would be a most serious business if he did not take up the bill—he gave me this promissory note for £20, payable at the London and County Bank, Islington—I paid the money, and he produced some pawn-tickets, and said that they were so valuable that he should redeem them—my wife was present; it was partly through her that I lent him the money—he said, "I am in a very large way of business; it will be very detrimental to me if anyone knows"—I said he was borrowing a small amount, as I was believed to be a wealthy man and they would not place orders in my hands if I was believed to be short of money—he said that the jewellery came from his stock—he said he wanted the money to buy diamonds, and when he left me he said he should go at once to Hatton Garden—I was quite satisfied with the state<lb/>ments he made; I suggested going to a solicitor, but he said it would be throwing money away—my wife fetched the money from her bank—he and I were at the Southampton Hotel, and we went to the Birkbeck, and paid it over at a house near—my letter, addressed to 23, Clarence Road, Canonbury, was returned as being to a place unknown—I wrote on January 13th, and received a letter on the 14th, purporting to come from Huntingdon: "Dear Sir,—I am sorry to inform you I sliall not be able to meet my bill, and I shall be away. You had better dispose of the goods. If you wish to communicate with me, you had better write to General Post Office, Liverpool"—I never saw or heard of him again till I found him in the hands of the police—on January 8th James Wilson called and said that Carter had sent him, and he wanted to borrow £30, as diamonds would rise in value, but he could now buy cheap—he paid that he was a dealer in diamonds, and Carter and he were old friends, and that he (Wilson) had £1,000 at the bank—the money was to be paid in seven days, I think—I lent him £60, and received a promissory note for £75—he called next day and said he had made a very good thing—he had done very well, and would I make a concession of interest, and he wanted another loan—I lent him £50, and he gave my wife a ring—we arranged to meet on the 6th, at the Bodega, Chancery Lane—he knew I had an appointment with a friend to meet his clerk at the Birkbeck Bank, and when I arrived he introduced Clarke as his friend, and wished me to lend Clarke money—I said, "I cannot"—he pressed me very much, and said that Clarke was temporarily embarrassed—he said, "I usually finance him, but we are both short of money just now"—he said that Clarke wanted the money to purchase diamonds to complete orders; that he traded as a West-end tradesman, and was a real good fellow, and quite straightforward—I remarked to Clarke that it was a serious matter if he did not pay punctually—he wanted £40, and said that he was a well-to-do man; I said, "By straining matters I might lend you £30; shall I give you the name of a money lender?"—he said, "No, I have had experience of them; I am quite sure I can pay you punctually; in a few days I shall have £480"—I paid him on three days, Friday, Saturday, and Monday, and he gave me this promissory note—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180123"/>
               <p>Wilson lodged some jewellery with me—he said, if I would bring it back, a jeweller in Hatton Garden would give a very large sum for it, and he said he would give me a note for it for £50. (<hi rend="italic">A receipt was here put in, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">J. Wtison."</hi>) I saw Wilson on the day it became due, but I never got the money—Clarke never paid the money; I pointed him out to the police in Holborn on the day of his arrest—he recognised me after his arrest—on January 3rd Leigh called on me in answer to an advertisement, and introduced himself as a dealer in jewellery; he had called several times when I was out—he gave me his address, which was, I think, Millwood Road, Brixton—he called to borrow money; I refused to lend him any, and he left—a man named Mills called and described himself as a maker-up of jewellery—he left some, pawn-tickets with me, and I lent him £16, and never saw him again—I recognised Atkinson at Ludgate Hill Station; my wife was with me—he represented himself as a jeweller, and wanted to buy diamonds—I told him I could not lend him any money, as I had lent so much—he referred to an advertisement which I had answered—altogether I parted with £186 in a week, believing in the defendants' statements.</p>

Carter told me that his name was Carter, not Randall—I have not made a mistake between Clarence Road and Alwyne Road—he did not show me a letter with the address, 23, Alwyne Road, Canohbury, on it; it was addressed to Clarence Road—he did not leave it with me—he showed me some stones, and told me that his business was getting them made up, and he employed a man at £6 a week to do it—I agreed to lend him £15—this promissory note was drawn up in an office near the Birkbeck Bank—I handed the money to Carter—it was Robbins who said, "He is connected with me," not Carter; but after<lb/>wards I got this letter from Carter—I have been to the pawnbrokers in a few cases, and saw some jewellery, but I hardly remember what; it was pawned for £50; whoever got the goods out I should have great difficulty in getting them back—I did not take any of Carter's out—I have not inquired at a single pawnbroker's—I have heard that the pawnbrokers were called before the Magistrate, but I do not know in which case—Carter did not refer to Wilson by name; he suggested thatrthe people would come to him—there are about sixty duplicates in Carter's case—I have not inquired of any pawnbroker the value of the whole—I have been in business—I was a ledger warehouseman—I have never lent money for profit before—I told Carter that I contemplated going into business as a fancy stationer—I did not attempt to realise, because each prisoner men<lb/>tioned the value of the tickets, and I thought I might get into a bigger mess—I only know now whether I am secured or not only by judging, of the things generally.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">KEMP</hi>. Clarke wrote to me from the Diamond Merchants' Club, Hatton Garden—the pawn-tickets he gave me were to become mine if the bill was not met—he did not offer to give me a diamond necklace in addition if I was not satisfied, nor did I state that I was satisfied—he showed me a diamond necklace or a bracelet; I do not remember his saying he did not want to pawn it, if he could help it—those were made-up diamonds—he offered them as security if I wished for more—part of the promissory note has been paid—I took £10 in ignorance; I was told not to take any more, and I</p>

               <p>did not—I gave my address in Parrolles Road—that was correct—I left there on, I think, February 28th—I did not go to the Diamond Club—I saw the mother; she is a respectable lady with means, and could assist her son if he required it—she promised that the rest would be paid, and said that Clarke would pay it—I did not say that I was sorry for Clarke, because I did not think he would swindle me—I hesitate because I am slightly nervous and confused—I was getting £10, but that would not influence me—I put it in my pocket—I did not go a second time for the balance—she called, but I did not take it; I said that the police had warned me not to take it, or I might find myself in Holloway—she said she did not like the disgrace of her son being mixed up with it—I could, have got my money if I had thought proper to take it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I had been employed at Nottingham for four or five years—I had been at two or three retail houses, and in an insurance office—I answered five of the advertisements—I desired to in<lb/>crease my capital by means of the interest or bonus—when Brooks gave me the pawn-tickets I saw that they referred to jewellery of substantial value—if I had gone to Bobbins' place of business in Finsbury Square I should have done it without a promissory note—I advanced the money for the sake of the £5—I have not been to the pawnbrokers to see the jewels—I believe they were more valuable than the sums mentioned on the tickets, but that did not influence my view.</p>

It was after I had lent all the money that I saw Atkinson at Ludgate Hill; it was some day after January 6th or 8th—I met him by appointment—I answered an advertisement by writing on a postcard "Send particulars"—I saw his advertisement after I had lent my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I wrote two letters, and both came back through the Dead Letter Office—I was living in Parrolles Road, in January, this year—I went there at the end of November or early in December—I was certainly there the whole of January—I can't say whether I got the tele<lb/>gram on January 11th—that was the day after the bill was payable—Clarke was arrested on March 21st, and I remember his seeing me after he was in custody; up to that time nobody offered to pay me any money, but when Clarke was in the dock his cousin came to me and asked me to see his mother at her house—I did not see his father to speak to, I have seen him driving—the mother paid me £10—there had only been one hearing—when I told Inspector Denny what I had done he warned me, and I took no more money.</p>

               <p>consented to my money being drawn out of the bank—on January 1st I went with my husband to the Southampton Hotel, Chancery Lane, and was there introduced to Carter—he said he was a diamond merchant, of Hatton Garden, and wanted money to buy diamonds, and that he lived there with his wife—he showed us some orders he had in his pocket-book, and said that that was the kind of work he was engaged in—my husband said at first that he would not lend it, but afterwards he said, "I think it is all right"; he gave us some pawn-tickets as security, and said that only one-third of the money was advanced on the jewellery"—I said, "Sup<lb/>pose you do not pay at the date, what are we to do with the pawn-tickets?"—he said, "They are worth more to us," and showed us about sixty diamonds, which he had in his pocket—we also had an interview witb Wilson; he said that Carter had sent him, and he could put business in our way—Wilson had £110 of our money—Wilson introduced Clarke, and said that he was a diamond merchant in Hatton Garden, and wanted £40 to complete an order, and Clarke said that he was a diamond merchant, and would pay in three days, and that he had had £480 from a company, and paid it—I have seen Leigh come to our house, but have not spoken to him—I know Atkinson as Benson; he met me and my husband at Ludgate Hill; he said he was a diamond merchant—my husband said he could not lend any more—I saw a man named Mills, who got £184 in the same way—we went to a solicitor, and heard nothing more of these people, after the notes became due, till they were in custody—I went to Trinity Square, and found nothing but private houses; no business.</p>

I was at home when Carter called, but was not present at the first interview; I saw him—my husband would not lend the money without consulting me—I did not hear the address given, Alwyne Road, Canonbury; it was Clarence Road—he had the envelope in his pocket-book—he showed us some loose stones—Wilson said that he had financed Carter—the only time I saw Carter was at the Southampton—I think the envelope on which I saw Clarence Road had been through the post.</p>

I am of no occupation; I live at Nunhead—in December last I saw some advertisements, in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, of tradesmen wanting to borrow a small sum of money—I answered five of them, and the prisoner Robbins called on me, and handed me his printed card, describing him as a jeweller, of 20, Trinity Square—he said that he was a dealer—his advertisement asked for a loan of £30—he said he had got an order to execute, and wanted this money to enable him to cany it out—he produced some pawn-tickets, which he said were for part of his stock, and worth a great deal more than it was pawned for—I believed what he said, and gave him £30 by cheque—he gave me this promissory</p>

               <p>note for £37 10s., and cashed my cheque the same day—he did not come and pay the money at the end of the ten days, and I went to the house where his business was supposed to be carried on, and he was nowhere, and the business nowhere—I wrote to him, but got no answer—Leigh called on me, in reference to one of the advertisements, on November 14th, the same date as my cheque to Bobbins—he gave his address 20, Wansey Street, and said that he wanted the money to carry out an order—Iforget how much he wanted, but I only lent him £12 for seven days—Ibelieved the statements he made—I gave him a cheque, and he gave me this promissory note—it is on a blank form, stamped, which he pro<lb/>duced—heleft some pawn-tickets with me—when the time had passed he did not come to pay me, and I went to 20, Wansey Street, but did not find him or the business—I recognise Carter; he wanted money, but I did not part with any—Atkinson came, but I did not know his name—I did not lend him anything—what I parted with was £42—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the pawn-tickets left by Leigh, and these are the other lot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an investment broker, of Broad Street House, City—in 1891 Clarke called on me, and said, "I have heard that you have lent some money to some jewellers; I have an allowance, but have run short for the present; can you make me an advance?"—he produced some pawn-tickets, which he said were for jewellery he had pledged, which he said he would leave with me as security if I would let him have some money—to the best of my recollection, he wanted £25, but I did not agree to lend it—I know Carter, and I know Robbins as Baxter Roberts, and I know Leigh by sight—I have spoken to Carter and Roberts—I have seen Carter, Leigh, and Atkinson together at Hennessey's public-house, Holborn, more than once, but not for the last eighteen months—I have never seen Robbins since April, 1891—I have seen Clarke talking to Carter and Atkinson frequently.</p>

               <p>August, 1893, my attention was attracted to an advertisement in a local paper—I answered it, and the prisoner Clarke called on me at Deal, and told me he had come in answer to my letter—he said he was an artist, and lived at Broad stairs with his family, and had got into difficulties through Mrs. Dyer borrowing £25 to help him to overcome them; I asked what security he could give me for the money; he produced a number of pawn-tickets, which he said were for his family jewels; I told him I knew nothing about them; I never had a pawn-ticket in my hand in my life—he said that they were the best security, and worth four times the amount he wanted to borrow—he produced what appeared to be a valuable snuff-box, which he said had been presented to him by his friends, which he would not part with on any consideration, but would allow me to keep it as a token of good faith—I agreed to advance him £25, and he gave me this promissory note for £30, the form for which he took from his pocket—I saw him again next day; he said that he had good news to give me; he should be able to give me the money earlier than he expected, having received notice from his bankers that a cheque for £200 would be sent next week, and asked for a further loan of £25, as he had just discovered an oppor<lb/>tunity of purchasing some valuable Rembrandt pictures at Broadstairs, and being an artist, he knew pictures, and could get them a genuine bargain, and if I would lend him another £25, he was quite willing to divide the profits of the pictures with me, or would give me another promissory note—I objected that I had no more money to advance; he said, as he wished to keep it in confidence, he would rather have the money from me, and offered me a three-fold diamond ring, three rings joined together, which he said belonged to his sister, and two more pawn-tickets, and begged me to keep them secure, and not show them to anyone, as it was a condition that they should be kept strictly private—I left him in the office, and went and got the amount—he said, "Now you have the whole of the pledge-tickets of my family jewellery"—he put a good deal of affectation into his voice, and assured me that he would come within a week and take back the whole of the things he had left with me as pledges—I saw no more of him till I saw him at the Police-court—I wrote to Broadstairs, but got no answer, and I went to Brookman's and paid him £36 15s. 8d., and re<lb/>deemed four pawn-tickets, which had various articles on them—I then went to Sidney Smith, and redeemed a diamond crescent brooch and ring, pledged for £36 2s. 1d., paying an additional fee of £1—I took the snuff-box and ring, and all the jewellery I had redeemed, to Mr. Savage, a jeweller, of Kensington, and, as the result of what he told me, I went back to Brookman's and re-pawned them for the same amount as they were originally pawned for, and then went to Smith's, but did not re<lb/>pawn them—I have lost approximately £85 over the transaction—I never got my £50; I never touched the principal in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Daws, of Walthamstow—the prisoner came into my employment in April, 1895, and left on De<lb/>cember 1st—on a Sunday morning, early in November, she was in the kitchen with me—I took my rings off to make pastry, and put them on a hook on the dresser, and afterwards missed them—I did not look for them when I found they were gone, but my husband picked up another article, and put it in paper—the prisoner was in the kitchen—I said that my rings were gone, and I thought Mr. Daws had taken them, and spoke to him—after that I said to the prisoner, "If you have taken my rings you may keep one, but give me my wedding-ring"—my husband asked where they had gone, and we found one ring behind a plate on a shelf—I looked about the kitchen; the prisoner was minding the child—there was linoleum on the kitchen floor, and a rug in front of the fireplace—the linoleum goes nearly up to the wall, and then there is a gap; I did not take it up—I next saw the ring when my husband brought it home to me, after taking it off her finger last Tuesday fortnight—I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday in her father and mother's presence—my husband and De<lb/>tective Wrapson were present—I said that I would charge her—she begged me not to do so, as she found the ring in the girl's bedroom, and picked it up and put it in her pocket, but did not intend to keep it—that is not the girl who succeeded her—we did not keep a second servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She left at the beginning of December, and this year she came to work for me again for one day at the beginning of May, and worked all day—there was another servant there then—I did not help in the work in the morning—I was not there when she left after the day's charing—I had gone to lie down in the afternoon, before she left; that was Friday—I heard that she had called and asked to see me on the Monday, but I did not see her till Tues<lb/>day, when my husband brought this ring back to me—she told me that she found the ring under the carpet, and intended to give it back to me, but had been unwell—I had seen her father and mother when I made the charge at the Police-station.</p>

I keep a refreshment house, 27, Loam Pit Vale, Lewisham—on a Friday night, I don't know the date exactly, I believe it was two clear days before January 31st, three men came to my house, from half-past twelve to half-post one—one of my customers spoke to me; in consequence of that I looked at the men—I had two of them in the day before; the shortest of the two came in to dinner from six to seven in the evening; I was behind the bar—when the three were together, one was tali, one medium, and one still shorter—it was the shortest and the tallest that came in on the Thursday—I never saw either of those again—on April 17th I went to Holloway Prison, and saw a number of men, about fourteen or fifteen, I think; I did not count them—I recognised one, the middle-sized one, Hall I think they call him, the one nearest to me now—when he was in my house he was clean shaved, except his moustache.</p>

               <p>not stand looking at him for long, only a few seconds; I saw him before I got up to him, and I turned round to look back at him—he was dressed in a dark suit and overcoat, and, I think, a hard kind of hat—I cannot say what he had round his neck—I don't think he had whiskers, he had a moustache—he had no beard, I know—if he had whiskers, they were very light—his moustache was rather dark—my husband showed me a paper with a portrait, purporting to be that of Watts; I recognised it as that of the man I had seen; that was some weeks afterwards—when I went to the station I did not pick out the man like the portrait, but the man I had seen—I don't think the portrait was exactly like the man I had seen, but, still, I could recognise that it was intended for him—an officer came and spoke to me about going to identify the man at Greenwich Police Station; I cannot say the date—when I picked him out there were about nineteen or twenty men in the yard—he had a beard then—I did not hesitate before picking him out—Conquest said to me, "Is there anyone you think you have seen before?" and I said, "I think I have seen him before," pointing to Watts—now I am perfectly certain he is the man I saw on January 31st—when I picked him out in the yard he was dressed in a dark suit, and similarly to the man I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, carrying on business and living at 97, High Street, Lewisham—my mother, seventy-eight years old, lives with me—I have an assistant who does not sleep on the premises, but lives opposite—he shuts the shop up at nine o'clock, and leaves directly—my shop is a jeweller's, with the ordinary contents of a jeweller's window exposed—as a rule, after the shop is closed, I go out, and then, with my assistant gone, my mother would remain alone upon the premises—on Friday night, January 31st, the shop was closed about nine o'clock, as usual, by my assistant, who left at 9.5—I remained at home that night, and after the shop was closed my mother and I were sitting alone in the parlour—the shutters were up in front of the window, and the door was barred with chain and bolt—at 9.15 to 9.20 I heard a knock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180143"/>
               <p>at the shop door—my mother left the parlour, and went into the shop and asked, "Who is there?"—a voice from outside said, "I want to speak to Mr. Evans; I won't detain him a moment"—on hearing that I immediately went to the shop door—before opening the door I turned up two gas lights full, one an incandescent light over the shop counter, and the other an ordinary gaslight by the door—with those two lights, the light in the shop is very bright, like day—I then undid the bolt and chain, and opened the door—Watts came in first, followed by Carter, who was followed in by Hall—I recognise Watts and Hall as the men in the dock—I identified Carter here, when he was on his trial in February last—Watts was three or four inches taller than the other two men—he had this very thick oak stick in his hand—so far as I could see, the other men carried nothing—when they came in Hall bolted the door behind him—I said to Watts, "What is your business?"—the three of them pushed me towards the parlour—when they got to the par<lb/>lour door, they pulled their masks down from under their hats; I could not see the masks before that; the masks reached to about their mouths—Watts said, "I want your money and your keys"—he took a revolver from his pocket, and held it to my head—I do not know what became of the stick then—I said I had got very little money, and I had not got the keys—he said, "I am a Scotchman, and I am a desperate man; I don't want to be a murderer, and if you resist me or cause an alarm I will murder you at once"—they pushed me out of the shop into the parlour—my mother was in the shop, standing by the counter, when they came in, and she, as well as I, had an opportunity of seeing the faces of the men before they pulled down their masks—when they were pushing me towards the parlour door, my mother stepped at the back of me, and got into the kitchen, from whence a door leads into the garden—after they pushed me into the parlour, Watts said to Hall, "Where is the rope? Tie him up"—Hall got this rope out of his overcoat pocket, and out of apiece of brown paper, and Carter and Hall stooped down, and began to tie my legs down below my knees first of all; Watts was standing there, with the revolver pointed at my head—I then heard some conversation between them with regard to my mother—one of them said, "Where is the old bitch gone? Go after her; if she mokes an alarm murder the old bitch"—upon that one of them (I believe it was Carter, I am not absolutely certain) left me and went into the kitchen, whence she had got access to the garden—she was in the garden at the time—they said that because they heard the bolt go; I heard it, and knew that she had got into the garden—I heard the steps, which my mother had to get to reach the top bolt; the back of the premises was fastened up for the night—one of them left me, leaving me in the control of the two others—a short time afterwards the third man returned, bringing my mother—in the meantime they had not finished binding me up; they pushed me from the parlour into the kitchen—while I was there the third man returned with my mother—I heard shouting at the front door and knocking—I had heard my mother cry "Murder!" and "Police!" at the back—the men could hear that, too—when my mother was brought back the kitchen door was closed—the man who brought my mother back threw her on the floor, and one of them held something bright to her, I did not see what it was—he spoke to her; I could not quite hear what it was—I said, "Don't you hurt my</p>

               <p>mother"; and then I shouted, "Murder!" and "Police!"—they said, "Down him; down him"—I cannot say who said that, I was too frightened—they immediately struck me three or four heavy blows with some heavy instrument, I do not know what it was—the first blow cut me down the face and nose and cheek, and the other ✗lows were on the top of my head—I was very much hurt; I was in bed for nearly a week—I was stunned by the violence, and did not remember anything from the time I was knocked down till I found myself in the garden, and a policeman was getting over the wall; I don't know how I got there—immediately before they struck me I heard a disturbance at the front door—I don't know who it was, but it was in consequence of my mother's cries of "Murder!"and "Police!"—I cannot say who struck me, but all three men were in the kitchen at the time, two standing beside me, and the third over my mother, with something bright in his hand—I did not see them go away; I was unconscious at the time—I do not remember making any statement to Wright on that night—I remember seeing him at the station that night; he was writing something on a slate when I first saw him—I am not conscious of having given to Wright a description of my assailants on the night of January 31st—Dr. Hulbert attended me on that night—he saw me in the parlour; a policeman was present—after I had come to myself in the garden, I was taken back to the parlour, and there Dr. Hulbert saw me, within five minutes, I should think, after I regained consciousness—it was four or five days before I could speak properly—I could whisper—if anyone put their ear close to my mouth I could make them hear; but I had no sounding voice for a week perhaps—I suffered very considerable pain—it was a matter of about two months, really—I received a great shock; that was worse than the injury to my head, I believe, really—that remained my condition down to February 2nd; I was still without my sounding voice, and still suffering from the effects of the shock; I did not get out of bed for days after that—on February 2nd I gave Sergeant Newport a description of the two men who had escaped—I remember giving him that—I was in bed at the time; it was Sunday, I think—as far as I know, that was the first description I had given to anyone—on the night of January 31st I had about me a gold watch-chain, a silver sovereign purse containing £3 13s. in gold, and a £2 gold piece attached to my chain—the chain was broken into three or four pieces when they tried to rifle my pockets, while they were tying me up in the parlour—the £2 gold piece, the chain, and the sovereign purse were carried away—two watches which I had on one swivel in my pocket were left behind—the chain was broken away at the swivel—the articles taken were afterwards shown to and identified by me as my property—I saw nothing of <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I saw the stick in Watts's hand when he came in—I was present when it was found by Newport; it had been thrown behind the counter—my mother showed me two masks on February 1st; I was in bed at the time—they were identical with those the men drew down from under their hats the night before—a day or two after February 2nd Inspector Gummer brought me some photographs; I was in bed—in consequence of a statement to me by Newport I went downstairs, and in the kitchen Gummer produced to me about eighteen and twenty photo-graphs—I looked through them in consequence of what he said, and identified two of them—I made a statement to him, and gave him back</p>

I don't know how many times I have been examined in Court as to this occurrence; I think this is the fifth time—my memory is not so good since I was knocked on the head; Thas been rather defective since—it could be seen from outside, through the chinks of the door or window, that there was a light inside—we always kept the gas alight all night, not the uicandescent hght—when I opened the door the men entered rather hurriedly—it would not be cor<lb/>rect to say that they pulled down their masks as they were coming in—when pulled down they came somewhere about the mouth; they effectually concealed the face; you could not see thefaces afterwards; they were pulled down, it might be, perhaps, a minute after they came in—it was the third man that stooped down to fasten the door; as they all came in together the short one immediately stooped down to fasten he door—I asked the tall man what was his business, and almost immediately after that they tried to push me into the room; it was not till afterwards that they commenced to pull down the masks—it was the tall man that said, "I am a desperate man I am a Scotchman"—he spoke with a north country accent; but I did not take him to be a Scotchman—my mother almost immediately ran out of the room—I believe it was Carter went after her I am not actually certain—when I gave evidence in February and March I was very ill—when I gave evidence on March 9th I don't think I was confused—I said then that it was one of the short ones that went after her; I never knew the names of the two; which it was I am not certain; I thmk I sari the same then as I say now—before the Magistrate I described Hall as the short one—in February I think I said, "The tall man said, 'Go after her and murder her,' and the third man rushed out, leaving Carter and the tall man with me," but I was never quite sure which of the two it was—I have certainly talked tins matter over with my mother—I said, I saw the third man dragging my mother back from the garden, "but I am not certain which of the two it was, Hall or Carter; I was not certain at the time; I always spoke of Hall as "the third man"—I gave evidence against Carter here in February—I don't say it was Hall that went after my mother it might be Carter—before the Magistrate on March 9th, I said, "Hall commenced to tie my legs, etc., and left the</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness is my son. I live with him at 97, High Street, Lewisham—I was in the house on the night of January 31st—the assistant closed the shop and went away, and I and my son were in the parlour behind the shop, one on each side of the fire—there was some movement of the handle of the door—I took no notice at first, but my son did, and said, "Go to the door, or I will," and he went and undid the bolt, and these men rushed in—one said, "We won't detain Mr. Evans a minute, I only want to speak to him"—the tall man came in first, and the two shorter men came, and pushed me back, and got in—the man that came in last bolted the door—Watts is the tall man, and Hall is the man that bolted the door—I saw the faces of the three men, because I looked so particularly to see such rough people come into the shop—as they came we turned the gas all up again; we had a deal of gas in the shop—the tall man seized my son, and said, "I want your money and your keys"—my son said, "I have very little money, the shopman took my keys"—I rushed behind them, to get out, to make my escape; when I saw the revolver in the hand of the tall man, he presented it at my son—I made my way through the parlour into the kitchen, and into the garden, and I had to climb up the wall—I had to unbolt the kitchen door; I could not reach the top bolt; there were some steps against the door, and I had to go up those steps in order to unbolt it; it was a difficult job—then I got into the garden, and called out, "Murder!" and "Thieves!" and climbed up the garden wall, and they heard me next door, until I brought someone—some man came and pulled me off the wall, tearing my dress, and brought me back into the kitchen, and shut the door after him—he threw me down on my back, and knelt on me—he held a revolver at my temple, and kept saying, "One word, one word!"—I did not speak, I promised him not—that man was Carter, I am sure of that—when I was thrown down in the kitchen my son was there, and he was a dreadful sight to see, worse than my own affair; they had got him pinned up against the clothes horse, with a rope round him; I could see him all over blood, and that so upset rue I did not hear what they were saying—there was an alarm at the shop door; the people could not get in; the door had been bolted—they had slammed at the kitchen door, and then ran to the front, and made an alarm; that frightened the men in the kitchen, and two of them tore off their masks, and threw them on the kitchen table, and ran away, leaving Carter still over me; he ran away too, and was caught; before he left I saw him pick up one of the masks, which caught in my feet, and I caught it up, and threw it on the fire; he also picked up the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and took it away with him, but he left the stick and the knife behind, and his revolver—he took the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> off the kitchen table; I saw it there, and he put it under his coat; he put the revolver in his pocket, and ran out, leaving the shop door wide open; there were crowds of people there—I did not see him again that night; next morning I picked</p>

               <p>up one of the masks, and threw it on the fire; the other two I picked up, and gave them to the officers—when the tall man came into the shop, he took something out of his pocket, like a revolver; it was that which frightened me—they had the stick when they came in; I don't know whether it was used or not—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it? it was found close by where my son was attacked; I think the tall man had it in his hand, but I will not be positive; I did not see it used; it was found by the officer next morning; I saw it found in the shop, slipped down by the side of the counter—the men had the masks on when I rushed away; they had put them on almost directly they shut the door, but I had a good look at them before they did that—when the masks were pulled down they had hold of my son by the rope, surrounding him, and demanding his money and keys, handling him—next day I went to the Police-station and saw Carter—I knew him directly, and I afterwards gave evidence against him before the Magistrate and here—I was never shown any photographs by the police—on Saturday, March 7th, I went to the Greenwich Police-station, and there saw a number of men—I picked out two, Hall and Watts—I went and touched them—I have no doubt whatever that they are the two who were with Carter on the night of January 31st; I am certain—last week I went to Newgate Prison, and was shown two men at exercise in the yard, guarded by warders; they were Fowler and Milsom—I had never seen either of them before.</p>

On the night of January 31st I arrived at the prosecutor's house about 9.30—I saw the doctor, Mr. Hurlbert, there dressing the prosecutor's wounds, and attending to him—I spoke to the prosecutor, and he spoke to me—he gave me what I took to be a description of two men who had been in his house and had got away—I took it down as he gave it to me, "First, aged thirty-two, height six feet, moustache fair, dressed in dark clothes, black hard felt hat; second, aged thirty, height five feet nine inches, dressed in dark clothes, black hard felt hat; wore masks"—the prosecutor was then slightly dazed, suffering from wounds on his head, which were bleeding—the doctor was actually dressing the wounds at the time he spoke to me—he spoke in his ordinary voice—it was about 9.30 when he gave me the de<lb/>scription—at eleven o'clock that same evening the prosecutor came to the Police-station; he gave no further description that night, but he identified Carter—I never read over to the prosecutor the description I had taken down—I desired to circulate the description with all possible speed; I wrote it down, and sent it off to the station at once—I wrote the first part, "Wanted, for robbery and attempted murder, two men," before the prosecutor began to give the description—I picked up this two pound</p>

In my opinion, he was fit to give a description, or I should not have taken it—his manner showed that he was dazed; he shook a little when I first spoke to him, and his voice was a little weak once or twice—I thought he was dazed, because of his ap<lb/>pearance, and by his speech, and the substance of what he said—he gave how the affair occurred, and I think, from his manner, that he was suffering from the effects of a blow at the time—no doubt the blow had affected his head—he had partly recovered when I went in, but he was still stupefied—I do not know who had charge of the identification—I did not assist in taking any people to identify the prisoners.</p>

I attended him for about ten days afterwards—I should think that in four or five days afterwards the prosecutor could give an accurate description of the men who attacked him—after February 2nd he was in a proper condition to be so—he recovered his voice four days after injury—the sergeant took the description while I was dressing the prosecutor's wound—I heard him talking to the sergeant; I did not pay any attention to what he was saying, as I was occupied in dressing the wounds—I saw the sergeant writing as he spoke—the wounds were bleeding very profusely at that moment—I kept on saying to the prosecutor, "Keep quiet"; he kept on putting his fingers to his wounds, he was chattering to everybody—his brain over the speech centre was certainly affected during the four days—a person can generally remember after concussion of the brain if the injury is not too great—very curious things happen afterwards—it may be that a person who has had concussion of the brain has a recollection of facts different to what really happened, and is very positive of that inaccurate recollection; I do not know any cases of it—I have seen some cases of concussion of the brain—I attended Mrs. Evans on the same night at her house—she had an intermittent pulse, and there cannot be a state much worse than that, especially at her age—she was fairly well about a week afterwards—I attended both Mr. and Mrs. Evans that night at their own house.</p>

I am the schoolmaster at Holloway Prison—on March, 11th I handed Watts a blank form of petition, and received it back from him on March 12th, as it is now produced, dated March 12th—this first part was filled in in the office after he had it. (<hi rend="italic">This petition was read as follows:—"Sir,—I was discharged from Pentonville Prison on the 25th of January last. On the 27th, at twelve p.m., I left Euston Station for Liverpool; when the train stopped at Rugby, at two in the morning, I got out to have some refreshment, and the train started off and left me and two other gentlemgn, on the Station—The man that was in charge of the station told us we should have to stay in the waiting room till 7.12 for the next train, which we did. I landed in Liverpool between ten and eleven on the 28th. I "stayed with Mr. Bettie, No. 51, Islington, Liver-pool from the 28th till 1st of February. On the 1st of February I came to Birmingham, and I slept at Bradshaw's eating-house, Dudley Street, at the back of New Street Station, for five nights: then I stopped at a Coffee-house in Digbeth—Mrs. Sweeney's—for a week and also at the Temperance Coffee-rooms in Digbeth for a week; and then I took a room—79 Cheapside—with Miss Mullins. Sir, I was taken in Birmingham on the 6th, and brought to London on the 7th; I was charged at Green<lb/>with burglary at Lewisham. How could I be at Lewisham when I was in Liverpool on the 31st of January? I am a ticket-of-leave man, and I have failed to report myseff; that is what the police are trying to get me convicted for upon a charge I am innocent of. Sir, I ask you kindly if you will have Mr. Bettie, of 51, Islington Liverpool, and the station-man that was on duty at Kugby on the 28th of January at two o'clock in the morning—it was published in the papers that I left London after the Muswell murder—Sir if you will kindly have Mr. Bettie and the old man that was on duty at Rugby on the 28 January brought at two January brought up to London, I can clearly prove that I have never been within one hundred of London since the 27th of January last—Your humble Petitioner</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">BEN WATTS</hi>.")</p>

I am a warder at Holloway Prison—Watts was under my charge there while awaiting trial—on April 6th he handed me this letter, and this envelope, addressed to Mr. Frayling Solicitor's Department, Treasury," with instructions that they should be Posted—I handed it to the principal warder which is the first stage towards hav<lb/>ing it posted—"Kind Sir,—You kindly asked at the last Old Bailey Sessions to have my case put back to April Sessions to bring a witness from Livernool Sir, I went to Liverpool from Euston on the 27th of January and I stayed at Bettie's Coffee-rooms at the first of February. Sir I came back to London on the 1st of February and stayed till the night of the 3rd. I left Euston at twelve o'clock, and got into Liverpool on the 4th. My reasons for going back was that friends told me there was a registered letter sent to the post-office for me in the name of Mr. Benjamin. I receivod the letter on the 7th of February, and I signed the postal order in the General Post Office in the name of Moses Ben<lb/>jamin. Kind Sir, my reason for telling you this is that Inspector Gum<lb/>mer has tried to make the Magistrate believe at Greenwich that I did not leave London for Liverpool till after the robbery they are trying to</p>

When I went back to Liverpool on the 4th of February I stayed at an eating-house at the back of the Haymarket, but I do not know the people's names; if you think it is necessary, would you kindly send one of the Liverpool Police to me, so as I could describe where the eating-house is, and describe the man that keeps it. Of course, the people would know me again when they saw me. Kind Sir, I can't understand, after the prosecutor describing the man to two different police officers on the night of the robbery as having a fair moustache and brown hair, and being a North countryman, how he could swear to me, when my hair and moustache are both jet-black, and I am a London man bred and born. Sir, I have a wife and five children, and I have no money to pay for witnesses to come up to London; therefore, I beg of you, kindly, as a Christian man and a gen<lb/>tleman, to see that I get justice. I am truly thankful to you for asking to have my case put back, as I am innocent of the charge they have brought against me.—Humbly,"—on April 17th he handed me this other letter, also addressed to Mr. Frayling, at the Treasury, with a request that it should be forwarded to its destination: "Kind Sir,—I am one of the men you caused to be put back last Old Bailey Sessions. I had an interview with Inspector Conquest, and a de<lb/>tective from Liverpool, last week, and they told me they had been to the place where I stopped, and the lady knew me. Sir, the lady ac<lb/>knowledges me writing two letters the morning I came away, which I put in the post in Liverpool: that was the 1st of February, on a Satur<lb/>day. I came up with my with my friend to London to report himself to the police at Tottenham Court Road Police-station on the 2nd, which he did. if he two letters which I posted in Liverpool on the 1st had not "been destroyed, the envelope would have cleared me by the date. We stayed there on the 29th, 30th, and 31st, and left on the 1st of February. How could I be at Lewibhain at 9.30 on the 31st of January, when I was in Liverpool? Because the three nights I stayed at Bettie's Coffe-rooms, the 29th,.30th, and 31st, I never stayed out after ten at night; that the lady knows. The reason for going back to Liverpool the second time was this, my sister told me that a registered letter was sent there for me on the morning of the 1st of February. We both went back to "Liverpool on the 3rd, and I have told Inspector Conquest the name I signed the postal order in, and where it was sent to for me. Sir, Inspector Gummer at Greenwich did not treat us fairly, but I think by what Inspector Conquest says, he will give us fair play. Sir. if we get justice in this case we shall have much to thank you for. On the night of the robbery the prosecutor gave a description of the two men that got away to two different sergeants, and he described me as a man thirty-two years of age, fair moustache, and brown hair; I am fifty-six years of age, and my hair and moustache are both black.

(<hi rend="italic">Asking that Inspector Conquest might be sent to him, and hat he would give him the names and addresses of persons who could prove what he said.</hi>) In consequence of that letter I went to Holloway Prison on May 1st with Sergeant Hayter—Watts commenced to tell me the story—I said, "Do you wish me to take this down in writing, what you are going to say?"—he said, "Yes; I wish you to make inquiries; I am innocent of the charge"—I said, "If I write this down I shall submit it to the Treasury Solicitor, and whatever you say may be used in evidence against you"—he said, "I will stand by it"—he then made a state<lb/>ment I took it down in writing, and then read it over to him twice, and he signed it—it is the statement marked G:—"I, Ben Watts, a prisoner under remand, and detained in the above prison, after due caution as to what I now state may be used in evidence against me, say as follows:—The letter now shown to me by Inspector Conquest, and dated 29th April, 1896, is in my handwriting, and it was sent by me to the Commissioners of Police. My reason for asking Inspector Conquest to come here to see me is that I want to make it known that I was released from Pen<lb/>tonville on 25th January last, which was on a Saturday, at ten in the morning. I went straight to Scotland Yard, and reported myself. I then went home to 29, Tottenham Street, where my wife lives; she occupies two rooms on the second floor; she passes by the name of Mrs. Hilley. She was not at home when I arrived, so I left a parcel of clothing with the three youngest children, and went to the corner of Charing Cross Road, and met my wite and daughter and Mary Hennessy, who lives at 29, Tottenham Street, in the room on the first floor. We had drinks together, and she promised to be home in about half-an-hour with some steak, and they all came home as promised. We had dinner together, and then her sister Annie (Mrs. Harding) came upstairs. My wife dressed my boy George, who gave evidence last Tuesday, and then gave him and his brother Joseph some money to go to a theatre, I then went to my sister's, Mrs. Holliday, 2, "Rockliffe Street, City</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189605180165"/>
               <p>Gardens, City Road. I stayed there till nine in the evening, and then met my wife at the Bluecoat Boy public-house, opposite the Angel, Islington, and we went together to Mrs. Harris, I, President Place, Presi<lb/>dent Street, City Road, where we stayed till eleven at night. We then rode to King's Road, and from there to Tottenham Court Road, and I went" with her to the door of 29. Tottenham Street. She then said, 'Ain't you coming upstairs?' and I said, 'No, I have got a lodging. Before the boys went to the theatre I told the youngest one, 'George, to say that I lodged at 3, Colville Place, if anyone should call. I after<lb/>wards had a drink with Fred Ligo, the butcher, who has a stall at the corner of Goodge Street and Charlotte Street, and then I went home to 3, Colville Place, but before going I took home a quartern of gin which I bought at a public-house at the corner of Goodge Street. I gave this to the landlady, but she gave it me back the next morning (Sunday) as I was coming out. I slept at Colville Place on Saturday night, and on the Sunday morning I went again to 29, Tottenham Street, and had breakfast with my wife, and afterwards went out with my son Joseph, and we were together till three o'clock, when we returned to 29, Tottenham Street, and had dinner. I remained there till nine o'clock, when I went out by myself and met Jem Brady at the Grafton public-house, and I stayed with him till the public-houses closed, and I then went home. Jem Brady is now in prison for some trouble at Reading. I slept at 3, Colville Place, this night (Sunday), and about 9.30 the next morning (Monday) I went to Debenham's Stores, where I saw 'Markee,' who is a friend of mine, and I asked him to buy me an over-coat, which he did at Debenham's Stores. I also borrowed £3 10s. of him (Teddy Markee). I waited in the neighbourhood with several friends till about eleven a.m., and I then went to the Orange Tree, Euston Road, and stayed there till four o'clock. While there my boy, George, who gave evidence last Tuesday, came in with his sister Nelly and. said that my wife wanted me at home, but I didn't go. I then went alone to the Victoria public-house, King's Cross, to meet a friend, and I stayed with him till twelve midnight. He is called' Badger.' My friend was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> William Hall. My friend and I then went to Euston Station, and took tickets to Liverpool but we got out at Birmingham. when we arrived there we went to the house of a friend of mine in Great Bath Street, and I sat on the sofa till they got up, and we had some breakfast. My friend's name is Billy Matthews; he is a fighting man, and well known at Birmingham. His house is just over the bridge, a barber's shop. I met several friends at Birmingham, and was drinking with them till about ten o'clock at night, when my London friend and myself went to Bradshaw's Eating-house, at the back of New Street Station. We had a double-bedded room on the first-floor front. Two large iron bedsteads are in the room, and we paid 1s. each for the beds. Mr. Bradshaw was at the door, and spoke to me. I am positive that Mr. or Mrs. Bradshaw would know me, but we gave no names. The next morning (Wednesday) I left, and went on to Liverpool, where I met Hall accidentally, and we went together to" Mrs. Beattie's Coffee-house, 51, Islington, and we remained there till the 1st of February, and then came on to Birmingham, where I inquired about some things I wanted. We were in Birmingham about two hours, and then came on to Euston. It was just getting dusk when we arrived; it was a fast train. I have</p>

               <p>explained where I was after this in my previous statement to the Home Secretary. I also wish to say that Mrs. Hilley wants to make people believe she is not my wife, and she will do anything to get me sent away, because she has been cohabiting with a man named Charley Watson, who, I believe., is working for Crosse and Black well. She visited me in Pentonville Prison from December, 1888, till June, 1890, and sent me letters and received letters from me. In September, 1890, I was gent to Parkhurst Prison, and she received my letters and answered them, also visited me there. The children also visited me there. If this is allowed to be proved, it will show that my wife is vindictive, and send<lb/>ing my own child to Court to commit perjury agrtinst me. I am sure that she has got hold of the landlady at 3, Colville Place and tampered with her. I gave my solicitor, Mr. Gray, 67, Barnsbury Street, Liverpool Road, a statement in writing, on 20th April, to the effect that the land-lady at No. 3, Colville Place, had been tampered with to alter the date, to make believe that I was in London when I was in Liverpool—(Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">BEN WATTS</hi>." When the prisoners were committed for trial from Greenwich Police-court, on May 14th, Mrs. Ellen Borbidge. and John Beattie were bound over for the prisoners—they are in attend<lb/>ance here—in addition to those, there are brought, at the request of the prisoners, and at the expense of the Treasury, Mary Henessey, Miss Hilley, Annie Harding, Mrs. Holliday, Mrs. Harris, Mr. and Mrs. Brad-shaw, Joseph, Jane, and Annie Taylor, and Inspector Leybourne, of Liverpool—on May 28th I saw Henry Joseph Hilley and his wife, Agnes Hilley; he lives at Johnson Street, Westminster; they are separated—I produce the certificate of marriage of Henry Joseph Hilley to Agnes Hilley.</p>

I stayed at your house for three weeks, on January 29th, 30th, and 31st last. You remember on February 1st you supplied me with two sheets of writing-paper and two envelopes, and you sent the little boy with me to show me the Post-office, as I wanted some stamps, and bought the child some sweets. When I came from the post-office I wrote two letters in your parlour at the back of the shop, if you remember; it was on Saturday morning; your brother was out at the time. I asked for a few cards, and you had none by you at the time, so you gave me your address at the counter, and shook hands with me when I was coming away. I slept two nights in the top front room, and one night in the top back room, where the two beds are in the backroom. I am a tall, dark man; my friend is a short man. You can't forget me, as you was talking to me at the table for some time when you brought me my breakfast. Kind friend, I am charged with committing a robbery near London at the time I was staying with you. Kindly let me know if you will come up and speak the truth at my trail, as your evidence is of great importance to me.

               <p>landlord of the house—Mr. St. John and the prisoner occupied two rooms on the first floor for about eight years, a front parlour and a bedroom behind, with a door between the two rooms—the deceased gave way to drink periodically all the time he was with us—his allowance was paid quarterly, and that was the time when he gave way to drink—I don't know his age; he was of medium height, a little taller than myself—when he drank the prisoner also drank, never at any other time—when not in drink they lived very happily, on most affectionate terms—when in drink he used to quarrel with her very often—on Easter Sunday, April 7th, she called me up about a quarter to one in the morning—she said, "Mr. Prtston, will you please to come upstairs? my husband is very violent"—I went up into the bedroom—Mr. St. John was out of bed, standing on the hearthrug in his flannel shirt, nothing else—he was drunk; she was sober—she said, "He wants me to give him some whisky; I have already given him some; he has had sufficient"—I tried to persuade him from having any more drink, to have something to eat, and to calm him<lb/>self upon which he ordered me out of the room, and I went—that was the last time I saw him alive—prior to Easter Sunday he had been drinking for some little time; this last time it was about three weeks continuously—the prisoner had been drinking occasionally, not continuously, but at different times—on Wednesday evening, April 8th, about a quarter to nine, she came into our bedroom (my wife was there); she had been drinking—she ordered supper, a saveloy and peas<lb/>pudding, for herself and her husband, and retired to her room—our bedroom ad<lb/>joins their parlour—about a quarter to eleven I heard Mr. St. John calling in his usual tone for "Alice" (that was his wife) three or four times; then there was a sound as of a clapping of hands—that was all I heard; then he was silent—our servant was in our room at the time; she left the room, and I and my wife went to bed—I heard no sound during the night; I am a very sound sleeper, and so is my wife—about a quarter to six in the morning Mrs. St. John knocked at our door three or four times before she could rouse me—I opened the door, and she came into the room; she had on only an ulster, and she said, "Mr. Preston, Teddys dead; do come in with me, and look at him"—I went into the room with her and saw Mr. St. John on the bed, with his flannel shirt on, no other covering; I could see his body and legs—I merely put my hand on his wrist, to satisiy myself that he was dead; he was perfectly cold, as cold as ice; I had not the slightest doubt that he was dead—the room was verv dark; I could not see very plainly—his face was very much swollen—I did not see his bare throat—the prisoner was dreadfully agitated—she wished her husband back again; she wished he was alive—I advised her to send for a doctor, and she went and directly after<lb/>wards returned with Dr. William Kempster—I went into the room with him—the body had not been disturbed at all; it lay exactly as I had seen it—I stopped with the doctor a bit; I then left—he called me back, to witness his locking the door when he left the room, and it remained locked until Dr. Felix Kempster came at three o'clock; nothing was moved—there was a chest of drawers in the bedroom—nothing was said to me about that at the time—I went out and returned about half-past one—I saw the prisoner then; she was weeping very much, and was very distressed in her mind—she had something to drink in the morning, no doubt; I did not see her have any</p>

There is no one to help me"—I came back to the house with the doctor—she made no statement.</p>

For God's sake don't go into the girl's bedroom; you shall have the drink later in the day"—when I took the supper in on the Sunday night the prisoner was in a good temper—I had never heard the clapping of hands before—after that I heard the calling "Alice."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was only asked one question, but I said, "This looks like blood on your sleeve," and she then gave the explanation—she was put in a cell at one o'clock, and she had a constable and a matron with her—I received the result of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> by wire from another station, from Shuster, who is in our division—I did not suggest to Dr. Kempster that it was a case of murder, but he said it was a suspicious case—Sergeant Cooper was present after the prisoner's arrest; I think he saw me write down the answers she gave—I did not read them to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, living at the Albert Road, Battersea—I attended on the deceased in August, 1894, and January, 1895; on both of those occasions he was suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I did not see anything of him pro<lb/>fessionally after February, 1895, till I was called to see him on the morning of April 9th—the prisoner then came and saw me about six—she was in a nervous, agitated condition; her hands and lips were trembling—she smelt strongly of drink, and, in my opinion, was suffering from a state of debauch—her lips were covered with sordes, a brown crust at the meeting of the lips, which is very often found in persons who have been drinking heavily—I looked at them, and saw no sign of dried blood or anything of that kind on them; what I saw was a natural appearance of a person who had been indulging in excessive drink—in consequence of what she said, I went with her to 10, Stanmore Street, and in the back first floor room I saw the deceased lying on the bed—the room was very untidy, but there was no sign of disorder, and no sign of any struggle having taken place—I examined the body about six a.m., or a little after; it was perfectly cold; <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had set in—I should say he had been dead about six hours—he was lying diagonally across the bed on his back, with his right leg extended, his left leg raised, the upper part of the body on the left side of the pillow; the left arm raised towards the head; the right arm extended on the right side—the head was com<lb/>pletely discoloured and pulped, and about twice its natural size—I said to the prisoner, "How do you account for this con<lb/>dition of the deceased's head?"—she aaid, "He has been beating his head about the end of the bedstead the whole night"—I looked at the iron framework of the bedstead—I could find no mark or spot of any kind whatever to show there had been a beating of the head against it—the bed-clothes were off the man, and at the bottom of the bed; he was completely uncovered, except as to his night shirt—I came to the conclu<lb/>sion that only one person had slept in the bed that night—I said, "One person only has slept in this bed last night"—she said, "Yes; I have slept in the arm-chair in the front room"—before I left the house, the</p>

               <p>About the size of a finger-tip—he might have caused them by rolling over and hitting the corner of a fender or chest of drawers—in my opinion, all the bruises were caused by his being hit with this broom—continued debauches might have the effect of producing very slow and general paralysis; if he suffered from that, he would be confined to his bed from loss of use in the limbs—if he got out of bed he would be liable to fall about—very frequently, in a chronic drunkard, the small vessels of the face are greatly distended—that would not account for the swelling or pulpingof the head—the superficial vessels about the nose and cheeks might be reddened and swollen, but it would not account for the pulping or swelling to the smallest extent—I had seen him <hi rend="italic">in delirium tremens</hi> a little over a year before—the face of a man sodden with drink would bruise more readily, but the deceased was a lean, spare man—it is not easy to confound extra<lb/>vasation of blood with cadaveric lividity; you can tell the difference on section, because, in bruising, you find blood under the bruise—I was qualified in 1891, and have been in practice since then in Batterses, in partnership first with my father, and afterwards with my brother—in my opinion, the hyoid could not be fractured by a fall alone; it is so protected by muscles, and so mobile, that it cannot be fractured without the exercise of great violence, and falling with great violence, or meeting with enor<lb/>rmous force; accident could not do it unless accompanied by extreme force—in this part of a skeleton, there are perfect hyoid, thyroid, and cricoid and larynx—the hyoid is at the top; it is called the bone of the tongue; it is very slender, and is shaped something like the section of a stirrup—in a dried preparation, you could snap it between your fingers directly—when you applied force it would be pushed on one side in its situation in the body; it is perfectly movable in the live subject—I have heard of Holme's Surgery—the hyoid could not be fractured by a fall on a projecting object unless there was something on the other side to act against it—have never before seen a case of a fracture of a hyoid bone; it is very rare—the fracture of that bone would not itself cause asphyxia; you could have it put right again—if the thumb were in a certain position (not as it was here) the thyroid and cricoid would be likely to be broken, and not the hyoid—the cricoid is cartilege, but breakable—in a case of strangulation, the larynx is usually injured, and not the hyoid, as it is usually affected by pressure on the larynx—there was no sign of com<lb/>pression of, or injury to, the larynx; the bruise was above the larynx—whatever did it must have been done very rapidly, and must have been all over in a minute—it is a difficult spot to get at; it is hidden away in the jaw, and among the muscles; the pressure would more naturally be on the thyroid cartilege beneath—I am certain that the deceased did not die from any other cause than strangulation; I found no other cause—I looked for every other cause—we did the <hi rend="italic">post-morten</hi> thoroughly—in such a subject there would be a probability of there being an effusion of serum or blood on the brain; we found a small quantity—we examined the brain very carefully—asphyxia by strangulation means such pressure on the tubes and vessels leading to the chest that life cannot be continued—I attribute that as the cause of death in this case, because of the livid face and projecting tongue and the clenched teeth—those might be symptoms of other forms of death—I did not examine the blood—an unusual fluidity is not a recognised</p>

               <p>symptom in oases of strangulation—I have heard of Dr. Husband's book—I did not specially look for fluidity of blood, but, in cutting through the vessels it was noticed as being present—I made no special note of that; I took heed of it—the left base of the lungs was congested, and a frothy, mucous fluid exuded on section—the right side of the heart con<lb/>tained blood; the left was empty—the kidneys were enlarged, the capsule partially adherent; they were healthy but enlarged; there was no patho<lb/>logical condition—all the organs were in a more or less healthy state—the stomagh was congested, the spleen healthy, the bladder full, the liver serotic, such as you would find in a man that drank heavily—his organs were not disordered, except that the kidneys were enlarged, the lungs congested, and the liver serotic—I found no foreign body in the mouth—there was nothing to notice about the lingueal artery, or I should have noticed it; I did not specially examine it—the only marks on the throat were a small mark on the right side, under the jaw, and the whole of the left side was congested and bruised, from the jaw to the collar-home, and right down the arm—that could not have been done by mere pressure of the fingers; it was completely bruised—on the right side the mark was most distinct; it was very narrow, and just under the jaw—such pressure as that could fracture the hyoid bone—a person in a state of frenzy, caused by intoxication, could not break his own hyoid, because directly he pressed sufficiently he would become partially unconscious, and his hands would drop away—if he had pressed enough his fingers would leave bruises—before he became powerless he might effect the injuries—a drunken man, and especially a man suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> does not feel pain much; he is. very frequently violent, and prone to jump out of window or cut his throat, or it may be to commit murder, but not as a rule—he requires close watching—if he strangled himself he could not afterwards inflict the blows on his head; if he inflicted the blows on his head he would be so insensible that he could not have strangled himself—he might have fallen—<hi rend="italic">sordes</hi> is not exuded blood, bat a sort of brown serum round the lips of a person who has drunk heavily the night before; you also get it in cases of typhoid fever—there are no blood con<lb/>puscles in sordes—it is difficult for an unscientific witness to distinguish between sordes and a blood crust.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner practising in partnership with my brother—I was in partnership with my father—I have been qualified about thirteen years—about ten a.m. on April 9th I went to 10, Stanmore Street, and saw the dead body of the deceased—he had then been dead some eight to ten hours—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> was well marked—the whole of the face and head were extensively bruised—the bruises had been created within twelve hours or so of the death, approximately, I should say—there were scratches all over the face, more apparent on the right side, owing to the Absence of bruising—there were scratches on the neck—the scratches had been occasioned by finger nails, I should say—the left arm was extensively bruised from shoulder to fingers—on the right arm were bruises, as if from finger marks, about the centre of the biceps, as if it had been grasped by a hand—there was a bruise on the knee-cap—I noticed two brushes beside the bed; one con<lb/>tained ordinary hair, and this is the other—some bristles are missing from it—I saw on the bed, and by the bed, fibre corresponding to that of the brash—I took a solution of some of the stains on the brush; and made a microscopical examination, and detected the presence of blood—I also made a solution of a small clot of blood on one of the fibres handed to me by Sergeant Cooper at the first hearing at the Coroner's Court, and, under the microscope, I saw the red corpuscules of blood—I have not examined the stains on the pillow or bolster—they appear to be blood-stains, but I am not able to form a decided opinion about them, because I made no microscopical test—in the other cases I speak positively—later that same day, and under the Coroner's order, I, assisted by my brother, made a full and complete <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of this body in order to arrive at the cause of death—I found two trifling lacerated wounds, one behind the ear, and one On the nose—there was slight bleeding from each, but not much—the face and head were much contused, the left arm was extensively bruised—there was the mark of a thumb below the angle on the right side of the jaw, and two or three indistinct wounds on the left-hand side; but that side was so bruised—that it was impossible to say—the eyed were contused, and had extravasated blood between the lids—the tongue protru ded between the teeth—I made a complete examination of all the organs of the body, and am prepared to give the result of that examination if it is desired—when I opened the throat I found extravasated blood around the larynx, and on the right side the great horn of the hyoid bone was fractured; it was separated at its junction with the body of the hyoid bone—I should imagine that considerable violence would be required to cause that—it could not possibly have been self-inflicted—in my opinion it was not a possible result of accident in the sense of an accidental fall or accidental violence—taken in conjunction with what I saw outside the throat, in my opinion that fracture was caused by excessive violence and pressure brought to bear on the right side of the hyoid bone by some person other than the deceased—the cause of death was asphyxia, or suffocation, brought about by strangling—the marks outside the throat and the racture would be indicative of the strangling—when I first saw the</p>

               <p>head it was double its proper size, but on the second occasion the eyelid had burst, and a quantity of blood had escaped, and it was not then quite so large—whei we reflected the scalp we found the muscles generally pulped up, so that we could scoop them out with our hands—that, in my opinion, was ocasioned by excessive violence inflicted by some blunt instrument before death—the banister brush might have occasioned it—those injuries to the head preceded the asphyxia—they were inflicted before death, and asphyxia was the cause of death—the injuries would cause the person to become insensible; and that, in my opinion, happened in this case—the man was first rendered insensible, and afterwards killed by the injury to the throat—the right cavity of the lung' was full, the left cavity empty—the heart itself was diseased; one side was full the dark, veinous blood, and the other side empty—that is an indica<lb/>tion you find generally in death from asphyxia—the indications generally spoke to death from the cause I have-named—there was no cause other than that of which I have spoken that I could find—on the evening of" that day I was at the Police-station and examined the prisoner—I was called there to examine her—I said, after the inspector had cautioned her, "You can object, if you like, to be examined; do you wish me to do me?"—she said, "Yes, I do; I will show you my marks"—she had five scratches on the inside of the left fore-arm and the wrist; they might" have been' inflicted by a human being or an animal; they were not very distinct—on the back of her left hand she had three linear scratches, not so broad as the others; I imagined they had been done by a cat—there is no ground for saying so, and it was not my opinion at the time—I pointed to them; she said; "He gave them to me"—there was a slight bruise on the right wrist, and three on the left upper arm, all quite recent—she said, "He bruised me, and used to beat me with a stick about the head and legs; he has bruised my head all over"—I ex<lb/>amined her head, and could discover no bruises—I found some blood' about a quarter of an inch up the cuff of her left sleeve; she said they were from the scratches—it was too high up for blood from the scratches to reach that point; it might have come from lifting the body about; or quite innocently—after that examination she was charged.</p>

               <p>room, but it is improbable, except with reference to the bedstead—I do not suggest that the bruises on the knees was made with the broom—they were likely to arise from a fall—there was one bruise on the skin of the right side of the throat—I also said there were other indistinct marks on the left hand side, but so obscured by the bruising of the skin that until I cut the skin open I could not be sure of them—I did not notice that there was no mention of the second bruise in the depositions—the injury to the throat could not have been caused by a fall—the man could not have broken his hyoid bone by rolling over on the floor and going against the fender—he might have caused the bruise on the skin in that, way—the hyoid bone cannot by itself be broken in any other way than by forceable power, in my opinion—it might be broken together with a lot of other bones, but it is so protected by the lower jaw, and is so mov<lb/>able that it can hardly be broken, except by seizing the bones and snapping together—Holme's Surgery is a very eminent work—if the violence was sufficient, I should expect to find the other bones broken—I have never before seen a fractured hyoid bone, except in general accidents where the whole of the body has been crushed—a steam-roller would do it, or a fall from a cliff—the thyroid cartilege and cricoid carti<lb/>lege were bruised, but not broken; only the hyoid was broken—the whole of the larynx was bruised—the pressure must have been just on this point—it is not possible to ascertain under the microscope whether blood is human or not—the blood on the brush might have been blood from a cat—I did not examine the blood on the sheets and pillow cases, only those things sent me by the Treasury—I examined all the organs of the body; they were in a congested condition—the heart and liver, and most of the organs, were diseased by alcohol—the heart was adherent to the pericardium, the lungs were congested at the left base, the liver was serotic, the kidneys enlarged and congested, and the spleen normal; the stomach was congested—practically all the organs were disordered—it is difficult to distinguish for certain whether death results from asphyxia, apoplexy, or drunkenness—I should say the signs would be very marked if a man died from apoplexy; both sides of the heart would be full of blood; in this case one side was full and the other empty—if a man was intoxicated, and became suffocated, he would have the same symptoms—the results would be the same as I found <hi rend="italic">if</hi> he died from the results of intoxication, except as to the injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In what I saw, except the injuries, there was nothing to occasion the man's death—the organs were those of a man who drank to excess—their congested condition was consistent with death from asphyxia—on April 13th I went to the house and saw the chest of drawers; there was no blood-stains, or mark, or anything of the kind to indicate that there had been a fall on them—there were bruises on the head, as distinct from wounds, but how occasioned I cannot determine—they were consistent with having been caused by this brush.</p>
