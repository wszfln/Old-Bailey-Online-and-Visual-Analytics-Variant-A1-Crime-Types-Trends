On the 6th of Oct I went with Gardener and knocked at the prisoner's door several times—he gave no answer—we knocked loudly with the heel of a shoe—Mr. Gardener went down stairs, and while he was down I heard the prisoner making a noise in the room, moving about, but he would give no answer—at last he opened the door—I searched his clothes and two beds but found nothing—at last I found the watch in some bedding which was tied up in the room—he said he was intoxicated, but he was quite sober—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a comb, and a knife.</p>

The prisoner came to the bar at ten o'clock, and asked for a bed—I showed him to the bed about ten or twenty minutes after ten—it was a double-bedded room—in going up we passed Mr. hardener's room, which was one flight of stairs lower—the door was then shut,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Park-road, Nottingham. I have five children—upon my husband's death I found I had an annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe myself to be a relation of the Rev. William Stokes, and was entitled to property from him—about June, 1845, I was introduced to the prisoner by a female cousin to investigate my claim—he told me that he could get the registers for me—I inquired shortly after if he had got them for me—he said yes, and had sent them up to London to a friend of his named Fitzgerald Strathern, a barrister—shortly afterwards he told me the barrister wanted 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take the matter into the Court of Chancery—I said I had not got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked two gentlemen at Nottingham to advance me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my annuity, but they refused—he then said, "You have no occasion to be be<lb/>holden to anybody for money, you have an annuity, you must sell it"—he said the money was in the funds, and there was a good deal of property to be recovered.</p>
               <p>

I am the brother of William Norman, who died the quarrel began about the lock not being ready—the prisoner said it was not his place to fill the locks—my brother told him it was—the prisoner said he was a liar—my brother said he was not, and he said, "You are a liar, and a b——y liar"—the prisoner replied, "Can you make one of me?"—my bro<lb/>ther said, "Yes," and he threw off his cap, and doubled his fists, and began to square at him—I begged him not to fight at all—I said, "There wants no fighting;" but he would, and he and the prisoner went down the road, a little distance from the lock—I got my lines ready, and went down after them<lb/>they got into the meadow, and began fighting again—my brother pulled off his shirt—he would not leave off—the prisoner had pulled off his shirt in the road—I went into the field, and begged my brother to leave off—he struck at me, and said he would have another round or two—they began to fight again, and fought for ten minutes, I dare say—when my brother said he would have another round or two, the prisoner said as he liked about that—he seemed willing to give it up—they fought a few rounds, and in the last round my brother tumbled down backward, and lodged his elbow in the ground for a minute, and all at once he fell back like a person in a fit—he made a kind of gurgling in his throat, and I never heard any more from him.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am member of Parliament for Halifax—my estate was at Turnwood, in Dorsetshire—I have lately sold it—in 1845, during the season, I resided in John-street, Berkeley-square—I had previously resided in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square—when I left John-street I had some articles of furniture—I arranged with my valet to leave them on the first and second floors of his house, and I was to make use of that lodging until I got a new house—in Nov., 1845, having left my valet in the country, I hired the prisoner temporarily for the job as valet—he went out of town with me—I resided at the house of my aunt at Exeter, and afterwards at Cheltenham—I staid at my father's house there, and then came to London for a day, and then we went down to Turnwood—he was with me one month from some time in Nov. until Dec.—we returned to town together—I returned with my regular valet—the prisoner had his account paid at Turnwood, and parted with me at the Nine Elms station—I lost sight of him for some months, except seeing him once or twice in the street, I heard nothing of him for three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260020"/>
               <p>months, I believe—I had delivered to me at the Traveller's Club, two or three, or perhaps four, small notes from him, requesting the loan of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I immediately destroyed them—I paid no attention to them—as well as my memory serves me I saw him in the street afterwards, and said I was surprised he did not know better than to write to me for assistance at the Traveller's Club, that any servant, however short a time he had been with me, ought to know that he should apply at my lodgings—about July last he called on me at my lodgings at Cottage-road, Chester-square—I do not remember what part of the month it was—I should say it was the end of July—I had some conversation with him—I do not think Sir George Hamilton's name was mentioned—he asked me for assistance, which I declined, alleging that I thought an able, smart, and active servant ought to have got a place if he chose, and I was displeased with his having written another letter to the Traveller's Club asking for a small sum of money, after I had forbidden letters to be sent there—I met him in the street in Aug. as I was going to the House of Commons—nothing was said on that occasion about Sir George Hamilton—he asked me to give him a written character—I said, "As long ail am in London any gentleman who pleases to apply to me will hear whit I have to state, that you have lived with me a month or six weeks, and, as far as I know, are a decent, respectable servant, I rather object to giving a written character; I will think of the matter"—while he was staying with me I rather believe I inadvertently gave him reason to suppose I had more power of getting him a place than I really had—he says so, and it seemed to be impressed on his mind—I forget how it arose—I said, "When a gentleman, a friend of mine, returns from abroad, if you are a good coachman or groom it may be in my power to recommend you, and I will do so"—Sir George Hamilton at that time was abroad—on the 3rd of Sept. he called on roe for a written character—I was in the act of writing it when he called to ask for it—he was bad up into the room—I delivered the character into his hands—this is it—it is dated 3rd September—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"James Newbery was engaged by me last winter to wait on me during my valet's absence.

It in mistake about Halifax—at the time I wrote it I was under the impression that he had been with me longer than he was—I was anxious to give bio the benefit of the best testimony I could, having learned from him my character would be of considerable importance to him, as his late master bid failed and was out of the way—I made the best character I could—he received the character, and I was very much surprised that he did not thank me for it—he complained that I had not got him the situation with my friend, and I think he said I had recommended somebody else, that I had hired all Sir George Hamilton's servants, and one word from me could have got him a place, and that I had also bought his horses—my answer was that I had new hired a single servant for that gentleman, that unquestionably I had been ready to recommend him, but it was a question whether I could recommend him since that period, that I had given advice to the stud-groom with regard to sending horses abroad, but he might learn that I had not bought any horses for him, that Lord Villiers was the person who was employed to buy them—he repeated the same statement, doggedly adhering to his assertion—that gave me the impression that he was endeavouring to pick a quarrel, or that he was not in his right mind—(I have condensed the conversation)—as he went out of the room he said something, the meaning of which I could hardly under<lb/>stand,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260021"/>
               <p>but which received its explanation from his subsequent conduct—he stood with the door half between him and me—he said, "I shall call at the Travellers'," or something of the sort—I think I went out of town, and did not go to the Travellers' that day—on the next day, the 4th, this letter was brought to me from the Travellers' Club—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—he has stated that it was—(<hi rend="italic">read—"</hi> Sept, 4th, 1846. Sir, I feel very much disappointed in not having the place with Sir George Hamilton, after having promised me; I should have thought, after what has passed between me and you, you would have got me the place; I shall go to the club, or clubs, which you belong to, and tell them what you are, which I can prove; I shall likewise let your father and mother know what you are, and likewise the public, and if you do not do something for me I shall acquaint a lawyer of it; you know very well what you wanted me to do to you; it is right the public should know who are these persons; you said that if I left my mistress you would do something for me; you have driven me to do what I have done, and you have acted very unhandsome to me; I can return to you, and if you do not answer by return of post I shall tell the committees of the clubs which you belong to, and if you like to vin-dicate yourself I am to be found in Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's; certainly I shall disgrace you; my address is, 'James Newbery, at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's' ")—on the receipt of that letter, (I am not very clear as to the dates,) as I was going out at that time, I took the name and direction down, and left the note at home—on my return from the City I stepped into Brooks's-club, and wrote a letter to him, which I did not send, because I thought I would condense it—I afterwards wrote this letter—I accidentally retained the draft of it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—</p>
               <p>" 12, Cottage-road, Chester-square, Sept. 4, 1846.</p>
               <p>"Some one has written, in James Newbery's name, a threatening letter to Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe that the letter is written by James Newbery. The letter is sent to Mr. Davis Protheroe's lawyer, who has orders to prosecute the writer, if necessary. Probably the letter is written to gain the benefits of a prison, or of transportation—one of which would certainly follow a prosecution; if this be the case, the writer's wish will not be gratified, as Mr. Davis Protheroe will treat this and all other letters with perfect indifference, and the writer may take what course he likes: it will not have any effect on Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe does not believe it comes from James Newbery, as only yesterday morning he received what alone he asked for—a letter of recommendation, testifying his good conduct when on a job in Mr. Davis Protheroe's service; and James Newbery only expressed some disappointment that he had not got a place as coachman to Sir George Hamilton; on which he heard, from Mr. Davis Protheroe, that he had never hired one servant for Sir George Hamilton, and had recommended James Newbery in the winter, when he thought he might suit the place. There being, therefore, no assignable reason, nor motive, for such an act, Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe the letter comes from James Newbery, who must be simply mad, if he wrote it. Mr. Davis Protheroe's answer to the writer is, that he will pay no attention to this or any other such letter. It is a threatening letter: threatening letters are punishable with im-prisonment or transportation, and nothing else will they ever get.—<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE</hi>. P.S. Mr. Davis Protheroe bad mentioned to James Newbery that letters should be sent to his house, and not to the Travellers' Club, out of kindness, as he thought it only creditable and respectable for a servant to seem to have the power of calling on a gentleman at his house. It is no annoyance (if annoyance is intended) for letters to be left at clubs: they</p>

I wish to inform you, E. D. Protheroe is guilty of that crine which is forbidden by God and man; I also consider it my duty to let the members know what sort of a man he is, for the short time I was with him I have convincing proofs of E. D. Protheroe; it is well known the steward of the other club which he belongs to lost his place, through accusing him of an unnatural offence, which I can prove he is guilty of; I sent him a letter on Thursday of what I intended to do, and what I have now stated in this letter; I hope the gentlemen of the club will take into consideration what sort of company they are in; if he E. D. P. likes to take me up, I am to be found at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's"—on the next day I came to town late in the evening, and lost not a moment in ascertaining whether my solicitor was in London, and put the matter in his hands—on my solemn oath there is not a particle of truth in the assertions the prisoner has made against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the Traveller' Club—I know the pri<lb/>soner. In Sept. last he brought a letter to the club for Mr. Protheroe—I do not recollect the date—I think it was in the early part of the month—the letter was conveyed to Mr. Protheroe's house, or delivered to a servant of his—at the time he brought the letter, I think he remarked that Mr. Protheroe had not performed a promise that he had made to him, which was obtaining him a situation with Sir George Hamilton—I saw him several times after<lb/>wards—he came and asked questions as to who the committee of the club were—I handed him a list of the club—he looked it over, and selected two names—one was Captain Barclay, and the other Mr. T. P. Courtenay—ha said from the disappointment he had received from the non-performance of Mr. Protheroe's promise, he felt so aggravated he should certainly write to those two gentlemen, and acquaint them of a certain thing respecting Mr. Protheroe, not naming what it was, but "a certain thing"—that he would be disgraced by such statement, or words to that effect—he said on one occa<lb/>sion, I think on that, "I am sorry I did not take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and moreover stated that he was determined to see the thing out, and unless Mr. Protheroe satisfied him, he would disgrace him—for that the steward next door (that was the Reform Club) had lost his situation through making an accusation against Mr. Protheroe, but his was on a stronger foundation, and he should certainly follow it up unless Mr. Protheroe satisfied him—I supposed he meant some emolument—I said I thought he was acting an unwise part, that at all times a servant was placed in a weak situation against a gentleman, let it be what it might—his answer was, he was so firmly satisfied, and could so firmly establish it, he would not refrain from it unless he was, as I understood, provided for—it amounted to that.</p>

The prisoner has been in my employ sixteen years—he was foreman of the wheelwright department—when I purchased timber he had to examine it, and give it to the men to make up, and when the wheels were done he had to pass them for payment—when coaches came in from different places and inns, he had to examine the wheels, and see if they were fit to go out—if so, they were washed, and sent out; if not, they were taken off, and other wheels put on—the old ones were put by to be repaired or sold—if customers came for them they were referred to the prisoner, he having the charge of the stock of wheels—it was for him to put the value on these, and, having agreed with the parties, he was to take them to the counting-house, to pay the money before the wheels left the premises—he was never to sell off the premises—I never allowed any old wheels or old metals to be sold on credit—on the 25th of Sept., from information I had received, I questioned my workmen, and I had an interview with Stocker in the counting-house—from information he gave me, I sent for the prisoner—Stocker was in an inner part of the counting-house, behind a screen—he was not seen by the prisoner—I asked the prisoner about a set of blue wheels—he said he did not recollect where these blue wheels went—he denied any knowledge of them—I then turned to Stocker, and said, "You took the wheels, did not you?"—then the prisoner said he did recollect they went to Hood's—I asked what he had done with the money—he was confused, and said he had not paid it in—he at first said, when Mr. Hood had any wheels he paid the money into the counting-house, but for these particular wheels he had not paid it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live in Curtain-road, Shore<lb/>ditch. I carry on business as a coach-broker—I have dealt with the prisoner—I remember in July buying four blue wheels of him—they were sent to me between the 3rd and the 10th of July—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them on the 10th of July, in the open street, in Golden-lane—he lived in Roberts-place—I went up to his house, and then I waited at the corner for him till he came down—I was in the habit of paying him at his own premises—I was aware they were Mr. Wright's goods—I went to the prisoner's house on the Friday night to pay the money, to enable him to pay the money in the counting-house on Saturday morning—both I and my father had dealt a good deal with Mr. Wright—I did not know it was not the practice of Mr. Wright to have the money paid off his premises—I have paid on his premises when I have fetched the goods away, but these were sent to me—I have seen Stocker taking wheels about—these wheels were sent to me, and it was an agreement with me and the prisoner that when there were two sets of wheels complete I was to go to his house and pay for them.</p>

               <p>years—the prisoner was superintendent of the wheelwright department—the parties requiring old wheels came to the premises and saw the prisoner, who was the foreman—they dealt with him, and paid him the money generally in the yard—it was his duty to bring the money into the counting-house to me, and it was my duty to enter it in the cash-book—I recollect an inquiry about four blue wheels off the Dorking coach, on the 25th of Sept.—the prisoner stated he sent away the wheels and received the money, and he had not brought the money into the counting-house, as be ought to have done—the book was produced to see what sums for wheels had been received for some time back—the prisoner said he had sold the wheels, and I understood him to say Mr. Hood had received them, and that he had received the money, and not accounted for it.</p>

Evans; if you do not give them up I will give you in charge"—he said it was the first offence, and he had got a wife and family, and kept urging me for mercy—he said he had been a faithful servant many years—when I first charged him I said, "Give up those things in your pos<lb/>session"—he said, "What things?"—I said, "The books and prints"—he never denied that he had them—on the road to my house, to which I first took him, he kept asking for mercy and forgiveness—I said it was not in my power—he then used words, the purport of it was that he was not the only guilty person, that there was another person as bad as he—Mr. Bryant asked him who, and he said Attwell—he said Attwell was to be found at Leicester-place—we went on to my house in Newport-street—Mr. Charles Evans had appointed to meet me, but we did not find him—I gave Hudson to the officer and we went to Leicester-place—Attwell was not there, but in half a minute we saw him come down Lisle-street—the officer told him he had a charge against him—he said, "What for?"—the officer said for stealing books, and he must accompany him—he then begged to put a parcel in the house, and we went on—in going to the station I was a little in advance—Attwell stepped up to me, and asked if it could not be settled by his paying for the goods—I said it was impossible—we went to the station, and from there to the Magistrates—Mr. Hardwick investigated the matter—in the course of the inquiry Hudson produced this paper, but it has been very much torn since—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Charles Reason, broker, White Horse-yard, Drury-lane")—Hudson said, Att<lb/>well gave him this paper—I believe at the time Attwell said that paper was his writing—he denied any participation in this transaction—this is the Bible and Prayer-book—they are very old—the date is 1508—I would be glad to give 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I rather think the officer took these books from Hudson—I have constantly works submitted to me for my opinion.</p>

On the 29th of July I was in possession at Messrs: Evans', No. 106, New Bond-street—the keys were delivered to Mr. Wilkins—I received them from him—Attwell was on the premises, in charge of the property till I came—it was then delivered to me for the purpose of having a catalogue prepared—this Bible and Prayer-book were not on the premises while I was there—I did not check them—I was there seventeen days—they were not there then—Hudson was retained there <hi rend="italic">to</hi> attend on me to bring the books—he remained the whole time I was there—Attwell called there once—on the 21st of Sept Mr. Mason gave me information about a Bible and Prayer-book being offered him for sale—I went and saw the books, and made a communication to Mr. Rodd—I went the next day with Mr. Rodd, and watched opposite Mr. Mason's premises.</p>

On the 14th of Sept., about four o'clock in the afternoon, Attwell came to the shop—he inquired for my husband—I said he was not at home—he said he would call in the evening—I said he would probably not be in the way, he had better call in the morning—he said he could not call then, it must stand over for a day or two—he said he had been recommended by a person named Reason, to Mr. Mason, to transact some business, and it would be to my husband's advantage—he went away, and two or three days after-wards Hudson came—my husband was not at home—he said he came from a gentleman who had been to me on the Monday afternoon, recommended by Mr. Reason, and he had two books and some prints to dispose of—he did not bring them then, but said he would bring them in the evening—he came again next morning or the morning after, and said he could not see the gen<lb/>tleman, and apologised for not bringing the books—Hudson brought them a few days afterwards, and saw my husband—on the 22nd of Sept. the property was given back to Hudson when he came for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Forrest, watch-maker, living in Wilmington-square: the prisoner was in my service about seven months. On Sunday, the 20th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I gave my hus<lb/>band a box from my pocket—it was not locked—on his examining it, he found it contained six good sovereigns, and a coin very much like a sovereign—it was a sort of medal—there ought to have been seven sovereigns in the box—on the Saturday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I had left my</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger. On the evening of the 15th of Sept. I was on the Barking road, and saw several persons collected there to see a foot-race between two men named Hall and Breman—I saw the prisoners there in a four-wheeled carriage with two horses—I did not see the men start—I got up behind the carriage, and saw the deceased come driving up just after we had passed the four-mile-stone—when he was driving up I heard somebody in the body of the chaise say, "Here he comes"—I turned round and saw Mr. Levett driving up—he put his thumb to his nose in this manner, and then Mr. Hey wood struck him with the whip, and he struck back again several blows—when they got near the New Inn Mr. Levett's horse took a start, and Hey wood followed and caught him—I do not-know whether the men ceased to run at the 3 1/2 mile-stone—I saw Mr. Levett with bis cart go beyond the place where the race bad stopped—when I saw Heywood begin to follow Mr. Levett in the phaeton he was from ten to twenty yards from him—it was beyond the 3 1/2 mile-stone, towards London—they followed as fast as they could go, when I saw him come up to Levett and Heywood and strike him again—Levett struck back again—they struck several blows, till Levett dropped his whip and pulled up the rein—Mr. Heywood pulled up too—he had then gone half the carriage length before him—Heywood then turned round on the box and said, "Get out and kill the b—r, I will pay the damage"—Boddy then got out and no one else that I saw—he tried to get into the cart by putting his foot on the wheel and his knee on the shaft, and while in that position Mr. Levett struck him—he pressed himself into the cart, pressed Mr. Levett backwards, and he fell with his head on the back of the cart, and while in that position Boddy took hold of the hair at the back of his head, and struck him several times about the head and body—Levett's feet were in front of the cart—there was a board across the middle of the cart—he was not in a position to make resistance—he was lying right on his back—there were a good many blows given—they were as hard as the position would allow—they were with his fist—Levett moved himself about till he got Boddy on the heel of the cart, and while there Heywood got off the box, ran round to the tail of the cart, and struck Levett with his fist on the head—he only struck him once that I saw—Levett's head was then hanging on the back of the cart—I saw Branch pick up Levett's whip, and strike him about the body with the thong, but not very severely—they then preceded him in the barouche—I got up behind, and we all went back to the Abbey Arms—as they passed the cart they jeered Mr. Levett—he was very much cut, and there was blood from several places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am also surgeon at the Magdalen Hospital—I attended Mr. Levett after the accident, until his decease—he died on the Sunday night, or very early on Mon-day morning, after the accident—at the time I first saw him his face was very much swollen, particularly the right-side, it was black—there were two wounds on the right-side of the face, one on the upper eyebrow, and the other just below the right lower lid—there were no wounds on the left side—the wounds had been dressed on the preceding evening—I therefore did not disturb the dressing—he appeared extremely agitated, and there was great tremulousness and weakness—he appeared very weak—I prescribed what I thought necessary, and desired to see him next day, when I took off the dressings from the wounds, and found that they were going on very well, both had nearly healed—this was on the Thursday—I continued to attend him till the Monday, when he died—the swelling of the face had considerably subsided on the Thursday, but the constitutional symptoms had increased—there was great tremulousness—I visited him next day, Friday, at his own house—he was then incoherent, and beginning to ramble—if I were to give a name to the disorder I should call it <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he was brought to me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the next day Saturday, not at my request, but I believe he would come, they could not keep him at home—I found him quite as bad as I had found him on the preceding day—on the Sunday I visited him at his own house again, and a few hours after that he died—in my opinion he died of exhaustion, of <hi rend="italic">delirium tre<lb/>mens</hi>, which I attribute to the shock that the system had received from the in-juries on the side of the face, at the time of the affray—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Thursday following his death—there was no fracture of the skull, or of the bones of the face, or of any bone whatever, and no rupture of any vessel in that part—the brain itself was not at all affected—the right lung was congested, and there were very numerous and old adhesions between the right lung and the right-side of the chest—I think they were in no way connected with the death, and would not at all account for it—the left Jung was also congested, but there were no adhesions—the heart was large and flabby—the liver and kidneys were not those of a sound person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any injuries that would cause death except those arising from the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination to account for death—my opinion as to the cause of death was the same after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination as it was before, that it was caused by the shock to the nervous system—the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> followed the blows—I was certainly surprised to see so serious a result from such injuries.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260038"/>
               <p>I could not say that particularly—the body was in a state of decomposition—I did not find any appearances that would have led me to suppose that death in a healthy man would have followed from the blows—I consider that <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was the cause of the shock received by the system from the affray in which he had been engaged—as he did receive blows, of course I did not look for any other cause, but I should say great excitement at the time would very materially aggravate, and of course cause a greater chance of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> coming on—I think excitement would produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> in a bad subject without any blows whatever—there are such cases on record—the scull of the deceased was the thinnest I ever saw, and if there had been any very aggravated violence I should have expected to find a fracture of something—the blows were about the face—they could not have been about the scull—they were not serious injuries at all, and they gradually got better—I saw no cut on the left side such as I have heard described by one of the witnesses—I cannot positively say whether the inflammation I observed, the slight flush in the membranes of the brain, was new or old, but should infer that it had come on with the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—that is a usual appearance in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—excite-ment and passion in a bad subject will produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, and the two together might have had their separate influence—I think either might have produced it, the excitement and passion without the blow, or the blow without the excitement and passion—there were three gentlemen besides myself at the examination—I cannot undertake to say that death would have arisen if there had been no blow—the blows were the material if not the sole exciting cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but had there not been considerable disorder or diseased state of the system I do not think the result would have been so serious—I consider the blows to be the main exciting cause, to be one of the exciting causes, if there was great excitement.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of Sept. the deceased was brought to my house—there were injuries from blows apparently over each eye-brow, the one on the right side more severe than that on the left, such an injury as might be inflicted by a blunt instrument, or the fist—that on the left side was so slight that he himself declined to have any application made to it—the other extended about two inches, being deeper in the centre—it was the natural depth of the scull—there was not much swelling—he was not bleeding much when he came to me—I did not see him again till after his death—when I first saw him I had not an idea that serious results would accrue—I examined the body with Mr. Coulson—I have heard his evidence, and agree generally with the opinions he has given.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHILD</hi>. I conducted this <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but I had pre<lb/>viously visited the deceased in conjunction with Mr. Coulson—I first saw him on Sunday, the 20th—he died on the Monday morning, about two o'clock, I believe—when I first saw him he appeared to be labouring under great excitement, and that disease called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he was rambling and incoherent, but perfectly conscious of all around—he did not ramble on any particular subject—he fancied different persons were in the room—I did not hear him make any observations about what they were doing—I have not known <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> occasioned by blows in this country—in my opinion, severe blows occasioning great excitement at the time in a man of weak body would not produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> without some condition of the wounds themselves—that would be papable externally, as to what would be the cause of death—I have met with such instances in the course of my reading, but not in this country—I think I have met with such instances in very hot climates—I have been ten years in practice—I slightly differ with Mr. Coulson as to the symptoms—I think I never saw a body in such a state of decomposition—the examination was made on the Thursday, four days after death—I opened the head—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the membrane covering the internal part of the scull, was of a pinkish cast, but certainly not inflamed, arising from blood stains, the result of appearances which you frequently meet with after death—there was no indi<lb/>cation of the cause of death in the brain itself—it was excessively soft, so much so that it fell to pieces on my removing it from the head—the heart was, as Mr. Coulson states, enlarged and flabby, and a quantity of fat was deposited round it, but the liver was diseased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in John-street, Mile-end gate. I know the prisoner by sight—she keeps a cook's-shop in Flower-and-Dean-street—on Saturday evening, the 3rd of Oct., I was in her shop between ten and half-past ten o'clock, and remained there—Van Spreeding burgh was there—the deceased, Daniel Crawley, came in after twelve o'clock—he asked for a quarter of a pound of beef—I cut it for him, and put it in the scale—the prisoner was standing near the door, outside the counter—I was inside the counter—she observed the meat in the scale, and said to me, "That will not do; that is how I ruined myself the first week I took the shop by wrong<lb/>ing myself like that"—she came inside the counter—I put the knife and fork on the counter and told her I did not understand it—she took the knife and fork, took the meat from the scale, and put it on the counter, and while she was cutting a piece off it Crawley put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand—I put it on the counter, and said, "There is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—she said, "That is not the price of the meat, it is 2 1/2."—Crawley said to me, "That is right countryman, is it not?"—I said, "I do not know, there is the mistress"—Crawley was then standing with his right elbow on the counter, and leaning against the wall—he wanted the meat—she would not give it him—he said he wanted it, and insisted that it was right, but she put it behind her on the shelf—she was talking to him—I do not particularly recollect what she said at the time—it was only a word or two—she put her hand to his face once or twice, and said, "You blackguard, I do not want your custom," and to be off—Crawley remained in the same position, leaning on the counter—the prisoner had the knife in her hand at the time—she was talking to him, and I saw her <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her arm across the counter and stab him—I saw the blood, and for a moment after I could not see.</p>

I was at the prisoner's shop between one and two o'clock in the middle of the night—I went for half-a-pound of pork, but it was not done enough, and I put it back—Crawley came in and asked for a quarter of a pound of the same pork—Brown cut some for him and put it into the scale—the prisoner was standing outside the counter near the door—Crawley produced 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—who he gave it to I cannot say—I saw it on the counter and heard the prisoner say she wanted another halfpenny—I did not see Crawley offer another halfpenny—the prisoner took the meat out of the scale and put it in a dish—Crawley said, "Give me my meat, I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which will pay for a slice of bread as well"—the prisoner was then on the door side of the counter—he did not produce the penny, and she told him to leave the shop—after that I asked for half a pound of beef, which Brown cut and put in the scale, and the prisoner said there was more than weight—she went inside the counter—it was my meat that was over weight—Brown laid down the knife and fork—she took the meat, cut a piece off, and put it into the dish—Crawley was then standing next to me in front of the counter leaning over the counter—I heard him say to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Nance</hi>, you and I have had many a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> together, and I hope we shall have again"—he said so several times, and she told him several times to go away—I cannot say I heard her call him a blackguard—I was in the act of leaving the shop after having mustard put on my beef by Brown, and saw the prisoner make a plunge at Crawley with her hand—I cannot swear I saw anything in her hand—I was not going out—my face was towards the counter, but my eye was not fixed on her further than seeing her arm plunge towards Crawley across the counter—this was almost immediately alter the mustard was put on my meat—I</p>

I am a pastrycook, and live in Church-lane, White-chapel—the prisoner was in my service on the 29th of Sept.—he had been in my service then for about four months, and he had been with me formerly—on the 29th of Sept. I went to a marine-store dealer's shop in Backchurch-lane—when I got opposite the shop I saw the prisoner just come out of the door—I went into the shop and found this basket, which lean identify as mine, and some ginger-beer bottles—I sell ginger-beer in such bottles as these, and I had missed a great many from my premises—Elizabeth Robinson was there—I then went to the prisoner's lodgings, and in a few minutes the pri-soner came in—I said, "William, I want you to account for the bottles you have been selling?"—he said, "All right, Sir," and ran off—he ran down Wellclose-square, and was found against the Dock-wall, lying down, apparently asleep—I missed two baskets of bottles the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner of the 7th legion in Spain, and live at Southampton. On the 19th of Oct., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going to Mr. Gray's lodging-house, and saw the prisoners together, in Pear-street, Westminster—I knew them well, and asked Watson how be was—he said he was not very well—I said, "Well, let us go in and have something to drink between us"—we all three went into a public-house, and some more besides—I do not know whether I-drank any—I had had a drop before—I had some silver, and seven sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, when X went in—I am not exactly certain where it was, because I took it out in the public-house, and do not know which pocket I put it into—I had ray coal under my arm—I think I must have put it back into my waistcoat pocket—I should say I must have put it into some pocket, but am not sure—I afterwards went to pay for some half-and-half and spruce I had had, and took a shilling out of my trowsers pocket, where I had my silver—I think the landlord gave me some halfpence in change—I was not sober, but knew what I was doing—I went out of the house, the prisoners followed me directly—Smith ran up to me, and said it was a shame I should take Watson's two shillings out of his hand, and not give it him back—I had taken two shillings, because I considered he owed it me—I said, "It is no use talking to me, I shall not give it you unless you take it from me; if you can; <hi rend="italic">here is, begin,"</hi> and hit Watson—I said, "I don't care for you two <hi rend="italic">chaps,"</hi> and offered to fight them both—we had three rounds—Watson said, "d—me if I don't hare my own, I don't care how it is"—I was down twice in two rounds—I knocked them down in one round—I lost all consciousness when I was down, and lost two silver watches, and all my money but a few shillings—one watch was in one pocket, and one in the other—one was an old-fashioned watch, silver turned—I could not have lost them in the house, therefore I must have Jost them then—I am sure I had them in my pocket just before I went into the public-house, but am not certain I had them when I left the house—I went to the police-office afterwards, and saw these watches—they are mine—I know I had them in the house—I pulled them out there.</p>

On Sunday night, the 11th of Oct., about a quarter to nine o'clock, I was in the Bethnal-green-road, and saw a female who said she was the prisoner's wife—I did not know her at the time—she was bleeding profusely from a wound in the head—she made a statement to me—I took her to a surgeon, got her wound dressed, and sent her to the London Hospital—I ascertained from her that the prisoner lived at No. 6, Albion-cottages, Holly-bush-gardens, Bethnal-green-road—I went there with some constables and saw the prisoner sitting at the window of the first-floor—the window-sash was out of the frame, and I believe he had it in hi! Hand—I heard him say he would throw it out on the first man who offered to come into the yard—I requested my brother constables to turn their lights on him, which they did, and 1 opened the door with a key which I had received from the woman who represented herself as his wife—I got into the house; the other constables followed me—when I got to the foot of the stairs I saw the prisoner standing on the landing above—he said he would shoot the first man who offered to come up—I did not at first see anything, but shortly after saw a poker in his hand—I went up the stairs: he attacked me with the poker and struck me several times on the back—I was then obliged to use my staff—I had not touched him before that—I had told him I came to take him into custody for assaulting his wife—I was forced down on my brother con<lb/>stable by the prisoner—the lights were extinguished by some means or other—the</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 7th of Oct., about a quarter to five o'clock, my son called my attention to five young men opposite our shop, at the corner of the Goat-in-Boots—I looked at them, so as to enable me to know them again—the prisoners were two of them—after they had been there a short time they went in a direction towards Stamford villas—the prisoner in the velveteen coat went first—two others followed him, and two crossed the opposite road—I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Rath bone-place. On the 16th of Sept. the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted some watches to show to a customer—he said, "I suppose you know who I am; I come from Jermyn-street; my name is Bruce"—I have had a customer named Bruce, sixteen or twenty years ago, a respectable jeweller, the father of the prisoner—he had lived in Cranbourn-alley—on the 18th he came again, in my absence—I was called down by my shopman, between one and two o'clock—the shopman said he wanted some watches again—the watches were selected, and a bill of parcels made out, but as I came down stairs I made up my mind not to let him have them—I said, "I cannot let you have these watches; I will send them to Jermyn-street"—he insisted on having them—he said he should not keep them long—I said 1 expected a customer who I wanted to show them to—he said he should only be half an hour; he was going to Fitzroy-square, to show them to a customer who was to select one—I was persuaded to let him have them to show his customer—he said he should be back in half an hour—I should not have parted with them for any purpose but for him to show them to a customer—they were worth 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had known they were going to be pawned I should not have parted with them.</p>

I went to Bayliss's lodgings—the prisoner Price was in the room with her—I found a quantity of the property which had been stolen on the table in the room—Bayliss said, "Oh, I know what you have come for; there they are"—pointing to the bundle, which was lying on the table untied—I asked how it came there—Price said it was brought there by a little boy in a dark jacket, but Bayliss said it wis brought there by Price and a boy in a dark jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to William Morgan, a hosier, of Middle<lb/>row, Holborn. On the 4th of last month, about eight o'clock in the evening the prisoner came to the shop, and purchased six shirts, six pairs of hose, one silk handkerchief, three cotton handkerchiefs, and a common green silk purse, with white composition rings like bone—I think I should know the purse again—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I did not notice how he was dressed, but it was rather dirty—I gave him a bill of parcels and a receipt—this is a copy of it, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>,) and has been given since he has been in custody—I made out this from memory—I did not know he was in custody when it was first applied for—I cannot say when it was—a policeman in plain clothes came first—I do not know whether it was Mount—it was about a fortnight ago—I gave it to a female—the policeman asked for a bill of the articles sold—I mentioned the purse—I swear the prisoner purchased a green silk purse that day—it had small silk tassels—it was new—there may have been a private mark inside it—I told my master afterwards that I had furnished a copy of the bill.</p>

I was en-gaged with somebody in the house who was mending some pipes, and heard a female servant scream out—I ran, and met her coming from the area—she gave me information and I missed a watch, which I had seen safe ten minutes before, from the pantry, which is in front of the house, next the area—there are two doors before you come to it—I ran out immediately—the area gate was locked, but the area door was open—they must have got over the area gate or railing—I ran out—a gentleman directed me round into Bernard-street—I saw the prisoners running very fast abreast of each other, and followed them—Davis turned round and saw me, and then they ran faster—I overtook' them near the top of Wilmott-street—Davis said he had been pursuing Jones; I said they must both come back—I had seen them running abreast of each other for about 300 yards, for a minute and a half—Davis could have secured Jones at any time, if so inclined—I asked where the watch was—Davis said he had got it, it was all right—he said he had seen Jones get over the gate, and ran after him—I said then he must come back as a witness against Jones—he followed me back to the house, holding Jones by the collar—when they got back I asked where the watch was—Davis said, "Here it ii," and produced it from his pocket—I took them down below, and discovered that there were two spoons gone from a drawer—I asked Jones if he had anything else—he said he had not—then Davis searched him, put his hands all over his person, and said he had got nothing—Jones was afterwards searched at the station, and delivered up two spoons from his jacket pocket—I cannot say whether Davis put his hand into that pocket, but he squeezed it up, and said he had nothing—this watch and the spoons produced are my master's, and have his crest on them.</p>

At half-past nine o'clock, last Friday morning, I saw the prisoners together be<lb/>tween Nos. 14 and 15, Brunswick-square, leaning over the railings—Mr. Dean's is No. 14—I am certain they were both there—I saw them for about five minutes, and then saw Jones get over the railing of No. 14—Jones came up in about five or ten minutes—Davis remained there all the time, and when Jones came up, Davis lifted him over the railings—they went down the square, and up Bernard-street—they were on the run, and turned up Wil<lb/>mott-street—1 did not see them again till the footman brought them back—I had never seen them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford. The prisoner was my apprentice—on the 30th of Sept., in consequence of information I received from my son, I went up stairs and spoke to the prisoner—I got no answer from him, he ap<lb/>peared to be asleep—I said to my son, "Never mind, go to bed; you will find it in the morning"—next morning I called the prisoner into the room, and asked what money he had got in his pocket—he told me he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Have you no more money in your pocket?"—he said, "No, not any more"—I told him there was half-a-crown taken out of my son's pocket since last night, no one had been there but him, and I insisted on its being brought for<lb/>ward—after a great deal of talk, for I suppose ten minutes, I told him he should not leave my presence till the half-crown was found; I should call in a policeman and have him and his bedroom searched—after that he turned round, put the half-crown on the round part of the sofa where I was standing, and said that was the half-crown—he fell on his knees and asked me to forgive him—I said, "This is not the first, second, or third time I have detected you, I shall put you in charge"—it was my half-crown—my son is fifteen years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am colour-sergeant in the Woolwich division of marines—I have been so nearly twenty-three years. I was on duty at the barracks on the 28th of Sept.—the prisoner was a private marine at the bar<lb/>racks, on active service—he was a prisoner at large in the barracks, for forg<lb/>ing a pass—I saw him at half-past nine in the evening on the 28th of Sept., at the time of the muster, at the calling of the roll in the barracks—he had his cloth trowsers on and check shirt and no jacket—the fatigue dress of a marine is a slop-frock to go to work in, the same as the prisoner wears now—his white jacket is his summer dress—I saw him on the 28th with his fatigue-frock on—that is the dress the marines use when they are cleaning the bar<lb/>racks and at dirty work—they are not permitted to wear that dress out of barracks—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at ten o'clock-the next day at Greenwich—the corporal of the guard came and called me up that night, about a quarter before one—I called the roll in the rooms, and awoke everybody up—I found that the prisoner was absent—I attended the police-court, and the police-constable came with me, with some lead, which I saw fitted on the roof of the barracks over No. 4 barrack-room—it is a piece of lead that goes against the chimney to keep the wet from lodging there—there had been holdfasts to keep it on, and on comparing the lead, the holdfasts fitted exactly—I had noticed the lead there safe at six o'clock in the evening on the 28th—it is my duty to look round the barracks—the lead was there then, and on the 29th it was gone—it had left a regular opening on die barracks—I examined the prisoner's kit on the night of the 28th, and his frock was not there—these are government barracks, the property of the Queen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On the 28th of Sept.

On the 1st of Oct., a little after five o'clock in the evening, I was driving my master's wagon and two horses along the Dover-road—Bassett came up to me and said, "I want the chain-horse"—I did not know him before—I said, "What for?"—he said he had left ray master at the bottom of the Dover-road, that he was gone up Kent-street, and had sent him to fetch the horse to carry a load of cabbages from the Kingsland-road—he said master had got his big cart and a chesnut horse with him, and was gone on to Kent-street with it. and had told him he would wait at St. George's church till he got there—I went there with him—my master was not there—he then said, "I dare say he is gone on towards London-bridge"—I went with him nearly to the Town-hall—he then ran forwards, and came back, and said he had overtaken master</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Little Guildford-street, Southwark. On the 16th of Oct., about tea o'clock in the morning, in con-sequence of information about my sister I went to No. 6, Butler's-buildings, which I understood was a bad house—I understood my sister was there—I saw the prisoner there—it was his house—I asked him if my sister lived there?—he said, "No"—I said she did live there—I came away, and heard at the top of the court that she did live there—I went home and returned there again between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I knocked at the door—the prisoner called me to the window—I went to the window—he lifted it up and said there was no Irish wh—e lived there—I said she was there—he said she was not, she lived at the Irish wh—'s next door—I made no answer to that, but was returning from the window—he lifted it up again, and said, "Here, I want you"—I returned, and he cut me with the poker over the back of my head—I staggered from one side of the court to the other—I did not fall till I got to the next door, and then fell in the passage—I remained there till the policeman and doctor came up, quite insensible—I have been very ill, and under the doctor's hands ever since—I have not rece<lb/>vered—it is very painful now when I stoop—I had a bonnet on At the time, but it flew back when the blow was given—I gave him no provocation at all.</p>

I found the gold chain hanging down, and the ring of it gone except a small part of it which was broken—I told the landlord the watcb was gone—he said be knew nothing of it—I saw no more <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prisoner till he was in custody—I did net see him when I got off the floor—I do not know whether he was in the room then or not.</p>

Bank-note—the money had been left me by a master I formerly lived with—I had put it in the Moorfields savings-bank, and had drawn out these notes on the 10th of Sept.—I was going to make use of it, as I had not any money—the prisoner accosted me in St. George's market, and asked me to stand some drink—we had a quartern of gin, and after that we had a pint of porter—I was induced to pull out my tobacco-box in the public-house to see that I had my money safe—the prisoner was there, but I was not aware that she saw it—I returned the tobacco-box to my pocket she asked me to accompany her home, and I went with her to No. 19, Re<lb/>vell's-row—after</p>

               <p>some conversation with the woman in the house we went to a room up stairs—I put my coat on the bed-rail—my tobacco-box was safe in my coat-pocket then—the prisoner then came and sat on the side of the bed<lb/>rail, and soon after she went down, saying she would bring up some gin and water—finding she did not return I put on my coat, and I missed the tobacco<lb/>box and the money—the witness Williams came up and said the prisoner was gone, and I had better go—I am sure the prisoner is the woman who was in the room with me—this is my tobacco-box, and this handkerchief is also mine—it is marked—I told the policeman he would find my initials on it, "H.H."</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Lynes—we now live at No. 3, Little Chapel-street, So ho—my husband is a servant—he has been in place about three weeks or a month—we were living at No. 29, Burton-street, Bur-ton-crescent. At Midsummer last we owed some rent for that house, and we were distrained on for that rent—the prisoner was put into possession—he con<lb/>tinued in possession thirteen or fourteen days—I afterwards made an arrange-ment with the landlord, Mr. Croxford, who is agent to Mr. Put tock, and the distress was taken out I think about the beginning of July—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he called once in a friendly way, and then I did not see him for some time—I remember his calling on the 17th of Sept.—I was very in-differently off at that time—I have seven children, two were away and five at home—when the prisoner called, my husband was not at home—he was not in a regular place, but was engaged at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the prisoner said, "How do you do?"—I said, "Pretty well"—he said, "How are you getting on?"—I said, "Very badly, I have bad an execution in for poor-rates, and for a security that we entered into for a person, and I expected an execution in for I my tuxes"—he said, "You may expect one again for your rent—I have seen I Puttock, and I shall have to come in"—he said Puttock had told him to get I ready to come into the house at quarter-da)—he said, "I would advise you to be in readiness, and clear off, or else you will not have a single thing left"—he</p>

               <p>said, "I have got plenty of warehouse-room in my shop, and have got a large cellar—I can put away all your things, and take care of all your things, and when you have got another house you can have them again"—he said, "I am coming here to the Euston station on Saturday; if you can get the things ready, I will take home for you"—I was very sorry I had got lodgers—I had let my house and my parlours—I should be able to for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and if I could have another fortnight, I should be able to pay my way—he told me if I left it over Friday, he would not give a d—n for any of my things—this was on the 17th of Sept.—I said I would rather stop in my house, if I were sure they would take my things, because it was more honourable to stop than to go—he said, "D—n honour, will that keep your childred?;—he said a should be going to the Euston station on Satur<lb/>day with a truck, and if I would get some things ready, he would take them with him—I parted with him on that agreement—I saw him again on the following Wednesday—he came by appointment on Wednesday evening—my husband was at home—me began to pack up the things, the prisoner and my husband and I together, and we went on till about nine o'clock—the first thing we took up was the drawing room carpet, and sent it by the can was not drawn up to secure the things for us, and he said, "I will give you a con<lb/>tract," which he never did—I gave him a shilling out of my pocket, and he fetched the stamps himself—the reason I gave him the shilling was, because somebody (but I do not know who) said, "who is to fetch the receipts?"—it was not myself said it—on it being asked, who was to go to fetch the receipts? I said, "Emma," meaning a servant that lived with me, named Emma Wood—the prisoner said, "I will go," and I gave him a shilling out of my pocket to fetch them—he went out and brought in three stamps—he put them in his pocket—there was nothing more done till the things were all packed—we went on packing, and the prisoner assisted—the went on pack<lb/>ing till three o'clock—that was three o'clock in the morning of Thursday, the 24th of Sept.—at three o'clock we had coffee, and the prisoner drew up the three receipts himself—my husband was asleep at the time—I said to him, "Business first, and sleep afterwards"—I awoke him up, and when he was awake he turned round and signed the three bills—I cannot tell you whether he looked at them—he put his name to the papers—when my husband awoke and signed them, the prisoner put them into his pocket, and I never saw them afterwards—the prisoner said, "We will sign them at different dates, or else they will look so like a fraud"—the prisoner wrote what he pleased—my husband said he did not understand them, he was not a man of business, and the prisoner wrote what he pleased—the receipts were not shown or read to me—the prisoner turned and showed them round to Emma Wood, and said, "I should think will do"—she said, "I should think it would"—the prison said he had engaged a van for five o'clock, and at five o'clock a van a two men came that the prison had engaged, and the prisoner, the two men, and my husband assisted to pack the things in—they would not all go into one one van, and the prisoner desired another van to be sent for—my hus<lb/>band's daughter went for one—the rest of the goods were loaded into that—the prisoner asked me for money to pay for the vans—I gave him half-a-sovereign, and he went away with the vans and the goods—he went without my husband—we had no goods left in the house—I and my husband went to look for a room for a lodging—in the afternoon I went out to look for a room, and I met the prisoner and my husband together—I applied to the</p>

I left eleven sovereigns in my drawer in my bed-room—I discharged the prisoner at night—the next morning, before I came down, I went to my drawer—there were only eight sovereigns in it, and the drawer was unlocked—I had left my keys about down stairs, not designedly, but my keys are frequently wanted for different things down stairs, when I am not at home—I am sure I had not taken the three sovereigns out myself—I left them safe on the 19th, and on the morning after they were missing—the keys had not lain about all that time—when I came home from my business on Monday, the 19th, the keys were on the mantel-piece—I then went out, and left the keys again—the sovereigns were not marked—when I went out on the evening of the 19th I paid the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her week's wages, for her to go before I came back—I did not know of the loss of these sovereigns till the next morning—when I took the policeman to the prisoner's I charged her with taking five sovereigns—(I had missed two sovereigns before)—she said she had not, and said she had been to London that day, and had the advice of a gentleman, and he said I should have marked my money before I put it into the drawer—what led to her saying that was, I had sent for her, and told her what I had lost—I charged her with having taken them—she said she had not got them, and I might do my best and my worst.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Smith, and live in Camden-street, Walworth. On Sunday night, the 13th of Sept., I was in company with Ball—he left me about two o'clock, at the Prince of Wales, in the London-road—I remained there about an hour after he left—I then went to the White Hart coffee-house—I did not see Ball again till I had been in the coffee-house about ten minutes—he was sitting opposite the prosecutor—I cannot swear to New only by his having knee-breeches—the prosecutor and three others were there, and Ball was one—they were talking together—Ball wished me good night, and he went out with two more men, leaving the prosecutor asleep—the man with knee-breeches was one who went out, but I did not see his face distinctly</p>
