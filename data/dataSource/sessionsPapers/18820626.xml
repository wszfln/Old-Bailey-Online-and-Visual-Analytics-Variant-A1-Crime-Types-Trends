I was on duty on the 20th May—I saw the prisoner at about 11. 15 a.m. I had seen him previously continually for about two or three weeks; I kept observation on him—I stopped him in Drury Lane; I said, "Will you come in the public-house a moment?"—when inside the door I said, "I am a police-officer; I have seen you for some time past in company with persons who have been convicted of passing bad money; I shall search you"—he did not say anything—I searched him—in his left-hand outside coat pocket I found this packet containing sis counterfeit florins wrapped separately in a piece of newspaper—I said, "These are bad; how aid you come possessed of them?"—he said, "I do not know; I did not put them there"—I then searched in his other pocket, and found one sovereign and two half-sovereigns; they were good—there was besides that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, consisting I think of two florins, one shilling, and 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze.</p>

On the landing that contained forks and spoons was broken open, and the spoons and forks gone—we next went to my bedroom and saw the ward robe and a chest of drawers were open—my bracelet and other articles had been in the wardrobe—I communicated with the police at once—I saw some of the articles the day the prisoner was caught, and I identified them—these things are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Turner—after this matter occurred I went into the yard where Mrs. Sullivan was—she was taken in from the yard, and the doctor came—she died while I was with her, about twenty minutes after I saw her, which was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; she never spoke—after the doctor had gone the prisoner came in—his wife was lying on the floor; he said "Good God, what have I done? I never intended to do it; I loved her as I love; my life"—after he heard she was dead he went out into the court.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 179). On Wednesday afternoon, June 7th, I went to 7, Commercial Place, and found the deceased lying dead on the floor in the room—I cleared the room—a little later on I saw the prisoner coming from the back yard—I knew him by sight—I took hold of him, and said "Sit down, Sullivan"—he sat down in a chair and answered one or two questions which were put to him by the Coroner's officer respecting his age and name and that of his wife—he said her name was Elizabeth, and she was about 43 years of age—he made a statement to me, which I took down at the time; this is it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I had a dispute with my wife. I lay down on the floor; my boy pulled off my boots. I lay down again. My wife said 'What a wretch you are to be like this every day. 'I said 'Never mind, that is nothing; we will get over all this. 'She said 'What are you jawing about now?' I said 'I am <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> about nothing. 'She said Hold your noise. 'I said 'Hold your noise or I will give you this at the same time. 'I sat by the fire. I seized the poker and flung it at her; it struck her on the head and she fell forward. I did not intend to do it.") He was taken to the station, and made a further statement, which I also took a note of—he asked me "She is not dead right out, is she?"—I answered "She is dead"—he then replied "I had no right to do it, she was too good a wife; it was a piece of flat sort of iron with the head on it, not a poker; I flung it back-handedly. I was at many places that day; I had a good drop to drink"—he was formally charged at the station, and made this further statement: "I threw it carefully back out of my hand backhanded. I did not do it intentionally. She was as good a woman as ever walked on this ground. Twenty-three years I have been married to her; I never raised my hand to her, and never had occasion to do it. She said '<hi rend="italic">Ted,</hi> why don't you chuck up the drink, late or early?' 'I will,' I said; 'hold your noise, we will get over all this"—I did not find the piece of the poker in the room; it has never been produced.</p>

I live in Commercial Road—I was called to see Eliza beth Sullivan at 7, Waterloo-Place, about 2.30—she was sitting in her chair in the yard at the back of the house—I had her removed inside and attended to her—I found a small punctured wound on the left temple—I dressed it and left her—I could do nothing for her; she never spoke—in about twenty minutes a person came and told me she was dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day—the wound I found penetrated about two inches in depth; there was a small quantity of iron in the wound; it penetrated into the brain, and that caused death—if a part of a piece of tongs had been thrown at her that would account for the wound; it had gone through the bone and into the brain—considerable force must have been used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was suffering from tubercular disease of the lungs and bronchitis—beyond all doubt the death was caused by the wound—the amount of hæmorrhage was quite incompatible with survival; it had severed an artery.</p>

I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on the morning of 1st June, about 1 o'clock, Hart was brought there by two women and a man—he had a stab about an inch long in the middle line of the abdomen, penetrating the cavity, and some small portion of the intestine was protruding—there Was another oblique wound on the left side, a little lower down—the first stab had gone right through the clothes; the fatal stab only went through the shirt, not through any other clothes—the one at the side went through the waistcoat, trousers, shirt, and under shirt—he remained under my care till 3 in the morning of the 4th—he died 74 hours after he was admitted—he died from the injury—I did not make the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I was present when the Lord Mayor came and took his statement—he was then in a dangerous state, but not certain to die; he was rational and quite able <hi rend="italic">to</hi> give an account of the matter—the prisoner was present.</p>

Rock Brothers and Payne, wholesale stationers in the City, where I saw Blake—I told him I was a police officer—I had some conversation with him, in consequence of which I went to Taylor's house in the Old Kent Road—it is a small newspaper shop and stationer's—I saw Taylor in the presence of Mr. Frugett and Mr. Payne—I said to him "I am a police officer; I have taken Blake into custody, and he has admitted robbing his employers, <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Rock Brothers, of a quantity of stationery, note paper, and envelopes, and he says you are the cause of his committing these robberies, and that he has sold the envelopes and paper to you "—he became very agitated, and said "I have known Blake about four months; he came to my shop and told me where he was working, and said that he could sell me paper and envelopes much cheaper than I could buy them elsewhere; I said 'I will buy them of you and give you the regular price for them if you have come honestly by them;' since then I have bought at various times paper and envelopes from him "—I said "Will you produce the paper and envelopes you have bought of Blake?"—he then produced 181/2 reams of note paper and 1,800 envelopes—this is some of the paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Frugett drew my attention to some pocket-books in a case—I said "Have you bought anything else?"—he said "That is all I bought"—I then said "Have not you bought some pocket-books of him?"—he said "Oh yes, I forgot"—he then brought from various parts of the shop 23 pocket-books, 8 bottles of ink, 3 of gum, 3 boxes of pens, 10 boxes of quill pens, and 2lb. of sealingwax (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him I should have to charge him with receiving the property well knowing it to be stolen—he said "I know I have done wrong, but I have not received it with a guilty knowledge "—I took him to the station and he was charged—the list of property really stripped the shop.</p>

Bock's service—after Christmas, Taylor sent for me to his shop, and asked me where I was working—I told him at a stationer's—he asked if I could get him any paper or anything, and I said "Yes," and I took him a packet the next day—I stole it from Bock Brothers—I asked him what he thought it was worth, and he said" 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—at another time I took him different paper, and he gave me different prices for it; sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked me if I could get him any pocket-books, and I took him some, for which he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I also took him some gum—I stole the books and gum from Bock Brothers—he has paid me about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, I did not keep any account—on 26th May Mitchell came and took me in custody, and I made a statement to him.</p>

P. "—I said, "I know nothing about that"—he said, "He is the next b—r that has got to go, may they all go, every one who calls himself a M. P. and an Englishman; I am an American Irishman myself, and you call yourself an Englishman "—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You English b——s accuse the Irish of committing that crims in Dublin"—I said, "No, it is hard to say who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, I don't know" he said, "It is not Irishmen, it is American Irishmen who did it, and I am one of the boys who did the deed "—I said, "I don't know, I wish I did "—he said, "May every b——y Englishman be served the same, shot down, or stabbed with this "—he was about three feet from me, and drew the thing out of his pocket again and rushed at me with all his force—I drew back with my back against a partition, put out my left arm, and seized his right arm just by the bend; the dagger touched me and pricked my flesh—I bled slightly—I have not the same tunic on now—I caught him by the neck and held his arm to stop the knife going any farther, and then threw him on the floor with the dagger still in his hand twirling it about, while I held his arm—I called out to Daly, who kicked at his arm, but kicked his head, and he became insenlible; a constable was sent for and he was taken to the station—he said on the way there "I did intend," or "I did not intend to take his life "—he was drunk when he spoke to me, and was like a man excited by temper.</p>

               <p>coming in?"—I said "All right"—I went in with my friends; I went in—I saw the prisoner and his friend in another compartment—I had no conversation, with them, but kept away—I never sold 41 bottles on May 18th to anybody.</p>

               <p>rushed on me and snatched my gold locket and chain off my neck—I did not see him till he snatched it—was is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I ran after him; he punched me in the mouth and said "Get away"—lie jumped over a coal-wharf—I had not a good view of him in the first instance—he took off his hat and jacket and put them down—I gave information at the police-station about 9.30 and a description of him—I saw the primmer at Shadwell Police-station on Saturday, 3rd June—I picked him out from nine others—they were about the same sort of men—I touched him—I am quite positive that the prisoner is the one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am perfectly positive—I am positive to the time within a few minutes; about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock—it was not earlier—I can fix the time by having left where I had been at a certain time—I had been on a tram and then walked the other distance—I am a stranger about there—Little Turner Street is a side turning, a small narrow street—I did not have a good opportunity of seeing the man when the locket was taken—I could not have identified him—I did after—it was about five or six yards before I overtook him—I was a little agitated—I was struck in the mouth—that increased my agitation—I was a good deal flurried afterwards—it lasted more than a moment or two—I went to the police-station after that—it was twilight; I do not think the lamps were lit—I went to the station again about 4 p.m.—1 saw some other men—the prisoner had got a coat on then—he was very near the middle of the men facing me as I came in at the door, the prisoner was the first man I saw.</p>

I live at the corner of Cable Street—on 1st June, about 9. 10,1 was standing outside my shop—I saw the prisoner running by—I did not see the prosecutrix—I did not look to see the time; it might be a little later—we had got a lamp at the shop door—there were a lot of young fellows crying "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran down Denmark Street—there were two policemen at the bottom—he was afraid to run down any further, and he came up again, walking—he had a black waistcoat, but no coat; his sleeves were tucked up—a lot of females spoke to him—they said "What is the matter with you?"—he said "There is a crowd after me halloing out 'Stop thief! I have only had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with my wife"—he then halloed out "Stop thief!" and then the people cleared away and he went—I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw—on the following Saturday I went to the King David Lane Police-station—I identified him at once among seven or eight people dressed like himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a clothier—I was not closing the shop; I stood outside with my father—we were talking—I know it was 1st June; it was a Thursday—I had stood at the door with my father every day that week—I had seen a good many people go by at all hours—I do not fix that day and time because the prosecutrix said that was the time—it was not earlier; we had been at the door about half or three-quarters of an hour before we saw the young man running by—our house is not quite half an hour's walk from Pennington Street; the shortest way you can go in less than 10 minutes—there are three or four different ways—I do not know how far it is from the scene of the robbery to my house</p>

               <p>—all I saw was the young man run by; he walked round the corner rather fast—I saw the same young man half an hour later;. I saw him for over 10 minutes in the crowd—I did not go with Miss Chapman to pick the man out at the station—they were the same men with the prisoner when I picked him out, as when Miss Chapman picked him out—he was not just opposite the door, a little way from it—he was about the first person I saw.</p>

I live at 19, Denmark-Street, and am the wife of Robert Jones—just before 9.30 on 1st of June I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I was in my room—I ran to the side door and saw a man at the bottom of the court, where my window is, in the act of taking his hand out of his left-hand pocket and throw something glittering down the area—he was about four paces from me—he turned round as if to strike me—he said, "What are you all looking at?" and, using a bad expression, "Can't a man run after his wife without being looked at?"—he immediately turned round and walked back again into the crowd that was following; I saw no more—I went down in the cellar and found a locket and chain—I had a full view of him when he made as if to strike me in the face—the prisoner is the man to the best of my belief, but I would not swear—he had on no coat, his shirt sleeves were tucked up to the elbow—I took the locket and chain to the police-station; I saw the man again on the following Saturday with a quantity of men—I did not identify him.</p>

Hardly had the arrest of comrade Merten become known when, still on the same evening, a meeting of members of the party took place in the provisional meeting-place of the first section of the Communistic Work<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. men's Education Association, in, the course of which it was determined what should be done in the face of the latest act of violence of the English Government. A party meeting likewise took place a few days later in the meeting-place of the third section, in which also a position was taken with reference to the conduct of the police. On the part of this meeting an enormously important resolution was taken, which determined that the future attitude of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> must be just as radical and just as revolutionary, as it had hitherto been—even, if posible, still more radical and still more revolutionary. This resolution is to be greeted with so much the greater joy, as through it, once for all, a bolt is pushed before the meaningless chatter of those who, as soon as any danger shows itself near, suddenly come with a lot of so called. good advice as to bow it is to be managed in order to evade such dangers. With full right, and with a right estimation of contemporary circumstances, did that meeting recognise unanimously that the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit,</hi> if it should have the right to existence at all, must remain so as it hitherto was. Notwithstanding that the complaint laid against the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> founds itself upon the published article 'The Rebels' Reply, on the occasion of the execution of Lord Cavendish-and Mr. Burke, not with standing it must; have therefore appeared dangerous and hazardous at the same time to treat publicly of this 'ticklish' theme again, and, indeed, entirely in the sense of the incriminated article, this, nevertheless, happened; and indeed in an assemblage of the people on Monday, 22nd of this month, with the order of the day 'The Attempt in Ireland' In what sense the different speakers who took the word in this assemblage expressed themselves is best shown from the following unanimously adopted resolution:—-'In view of the unreasonable oppression of the Irish people by the English Government, in consideration of the nameless cruelties and crimes with which England has burthened itself with respect to unhappy Ireland in the course of centuries until into the latest times, this day's assemblage declares that it discovers in the setting aside of Lord Cavendish and Mr. Burke by the gallant Irish rebels no crime; but a deed of daring popular justice, a deed of rightful self-defence, which was all the more opportune as it happened just in the same moment when the former leaders of the Irish agrarian movement were; on the point of concluding an abject agreement with the English Government. For these reasons this day's assemblage of London Social Revolutionist<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. declares itself at one in reference to that deed with the Irish revolutionists, whom it offers its hearty brothers' greeting. A resolution couched in the same sense was already, on Sunday, the: 3 th of this</p>

This short sketch of the last manifestations of the revolutionary spirit in London shows the foreign comrades that here we immoveably adhere to the revolutionary principle, and that nothing is in a position to turn us from the once-chosen standpoint. May, therefore, the comrades even—where do their duty! May they take it to heart that it concerns itself here, not only with one prosecution of a single revolutionary organ, but with prosecutions against the revolutionary principle as such, that it does not concern itself solely with one dealing of the English police, but with a common action of the international fraternised robber band against the fraternised proletariats. Whoever has been lukewarm hitherto, become warm; and whoever has so far done his duty, let him do it henceforth in greater measure, in order that we, supported by our comrades far and near, may be now, as well as then, in a position to hold on high the defiant banner of the forcible revolution, in defiance of the enemies', fur the protection of friends.

I am a bookseller next door to the prosecutor—on June 22nd, about 3 a.m., I was awoke by a noise and went to the back door—I saw something like a bundle of rags thrown out of the window and the head of the prisoner; I could not see his legs or arms below the pole—he got over the wail, and used the pole to prevent his falling into the dock—I heard Mr. Gibbons say "I know you, I know you"—I said "What's the matter?"—he said "Look, look; there's a thief," and then I looked and saw this figure sliding on the wall, and I could see him on the bottom of the dock; it was about 14 feet down—the pole was about 20 feet long—I looked at the prisoner over the wall; he was in an upright position then—he looked very defiant at me, but never spoke—undoubtedly it was the prisoner—I said "You thief"—he ran away—there was no mud for him to stick in, it is covered with straw—I then went to the front door and called "Police"—two were on the spot—I next saw the prisoner in custody—I identified him at the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dentist, of 6, Seaside Road, East-bourne—about the beginning of April I advertised for a servant, and received several answers, and one from Herbert Lay, which is destroyed, but I afterwards had a conversation with him on the contents of the letter—in the letter he offered himself as my man servant, giving a reference to Mr. Herbert, of 6, Charlotte Street, Portland Place—I then wrote to him, requesting him to come to East bourne, which he did, and told me that among other persons he had lived with Sir John and Lady Macleod; but that he had lived last with Mr. Herbert, who he had mentioned in his letter, whom he was leaving as he was going abroad—I was satisfied, and arranged for him to enter my service that day week if his character was satisfactory—I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of his fare to East bourne and back, and ho left—I then wrote to Mr. Herbert, and received a reply purporting to come from him, and giving the prisoner a character in excellent terms; but I had seen the prisoner's writing and noticed a similarity in the letters, in consequence of which 1 came up to London to make inquiries, and found that Mr. Owen lived at 61, Charlotte Street—I went there, Mr. Owen opened the door, and I had a conversation</p>

               <p>with him; after which I was shown into a room, and asked for Mr. Herbert—the prisoner came down, and I expressed surprise at seeing him there, as I thought he lived at Hampstead, where his letter was dated from; he said that Mr. Herbert had written to him to come and assist in his packing, as he was leaving sooner than he expected; I said, "I will wait to see Mr. Herbert"—he then said that he had decided not to take my situation, as he had been in correspondence with a gentleman at the West End, whose situation he preferred to mine—I said that he might do as he liked, but I should see Mr. Herbert—he left the room, and I called Mr. Owen, had a conversation with him, and he went up and brought the prisoner down again—I then said, "I have a suspicion that you have written your own character, and I shall communicate with the police"—I demanded the return of the money I had paid fur his expenses, for which he subsequently sent me a post-office order—he said that he was very sorry, but meant no harm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 61, Charlotte Street, Portland Place—on 10th February a person called Nelson Lay took lodgings at my house in the name of Nelson Herbert, and remained there nearly three months—he was visited there by the prisoner, his brother, and by another brother named Charles Lay—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the man who passed as Herbert—I remember Mr. Watford coming from East bourne, and asking to see Mr. Herbert—I went upstairs, and found the prisoner and his brother Mr. Herbert there—Nelson Lay told the prisoner to go downstairs to see who it was; I showed him into the parlour where the gentleman was, and they were there seven or eight minutes alone—the gentleman said in the prisoner's presence, "Are not they brothers? Is he not the brother of Mr. Herbert upstairs?"—the prisoner then left the room, and I had a conversation with Mr. Walford—I then fetched the prisoner down, and Mr. Walford said, "How is this? I find out that you are brothers "—he said, "Oh, no; we are not; he is my step brother"—he said, "I shall see into this"—he was very put about, and said that he should put it into somebody's hands—after they left, Nelson Lay came down half-dressed, and said, "For God's sake open the door and let me out"—he went out, and returned in an hour—he stayed in the house some time after that, and then I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM OSBORNE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi>). On the 27th April, about 4. 15, I went with Inspector Andrews to Mr. Bavington, a pawnbroker in Wardour Street, and saw Culliford there—we had some conversation, and Andrews searched him in my presence and found a cheque among other things—I have been engaged 15 months in watching the prisoners, and have seen Culliford and Rodway together twice about a month previous to May 2nd at the Railway Tavern, Liverpool Street, where the others used to frequent—there is a billiard room there—with the exception of Rodway, I have seen all the prisoners there, and also at another billiard room, the Crown and Cushion, London Wall, for two months right off—I have seen Bass with the others on several occasions from 11 a.m. till midnight for 12 or 15 months—Culliford and MacNamara were not there so frequently, but they have been at both of these taverns at times—I know Bass, Bode, and MacNamara by name, but I do not know the names of Culliford and Rodway—I knew Culliford as Williams, and MacNamara as Wilson, but I afterwards found who MacNamara was—on the second occasion that I saw Bode and Culliford together they met outride the tavern in Liverpool Street, and went into the bar—on 2nd May, in the afternoon, I saw Rodway at Middlesex Sessions prosecuting some person—Sergeant Godden was with me, who had the case in hand—I said "Your name is Rodway"—he said "Yes"—I said "I am a policeman of the City of London, and I am making inquiries respecting the champagne frauds; you moved a lot of champagne yesterday; where have you moved it to?"—he said "I removed nothing yesterday; I moved no champagne"—I said "Yes you did; you moved a load from Sherwood Street"—he said "I never moved anything"—I said "I must tell you</p>

               <p>I have Been your wife this afternoon, and she said that you moved a load of something, but what she did not know, nor where you moved it to; but you will surely remember, because that was the only load you moved yester<lb/>day and for some time before"—he said "Oh, I moved three or four loads <hi rend="italic">of</hi> stuff yesterday "—I said "You might as well be careful, because it is a particular matter, and she said it was only one load "—he said "I did remove a load of stuff, but it was from the City"—I said "What was it?"-—he said "Oh, a lot of empty boxes and rubbish"—I said "There was some champagne too "—he said "Yes, there were six or seven cases; I opened a bottle last night and got the headache all day through it" I said "Where did you remove that to?"—he said "My address where I live, down where you saw my wife"—I said "I wish you would accompany me there to see it"—he said "I can't get away; I am prosecutor here"—Sergeant Godden said "He can't leave, for he has a case here, and it is likely to come on next"—I said "Well, who did you remove that for?"—he said" For a man who I never saw before, and I don't know where I fetched it from; but it was somewhere in the City. He met me and went with me"—I said" When is he going to fetch it away, if it is at your place?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Am I to understand that for a stranger you moved a load of stuff from a place you do not know, and took it to your place, and do not know when it is to be fetched away, or what you are to be paid for it?"—he said "Well, I suppose I am ware housing it"—I said "I will make further inquiries about it, will you give me a note to your wife, so that I might see this case and its contents?"—he said "I can't write."—I then wrote "Let bearer see cases of champagne upstairs and contents," and said "Will you put your cross to that?—he said "Yes"—a witness who was present in his case, Mr. Leman, put his name to it, and I afterwards, in company with Mr. Richards, went to 335, Burdett Road, the address he gave, and in the front room I found a corking machine,-which weighs 3 cwt. and is not here, these branding irons (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a few corks and labels with the impressions on them—these irons are for the cases, also some leaden plumbs for the bottles, over the corks of Moet and Chandon—the inspector was with me—we waited until Rod way returned—I also found some of Moet and Chandon's labels, and labels of Heidseick's dry Monopole—the place was stocked with bottles in good condition—it is a six-roomed house, a greengrocer's shop with a parlour at the back, cellars beneath, and bedrooms above, but these things were all in a first floor front room over the shop—I found on the mantelpiece in a box a number of cards of Evans, the George <hi rend="largeCaps">IV.</hi>, Clare Market, and some other cards with the name of Stan hope on them—I have seen all the prisoners at 64, Basinghall Street—"F. Matthews, Johnson's Canterbury Ales" is over the door—I have traced a large number of cases of wine to different customers who are here, and also to 2, Finsbury Square, a basement taken by Bode—I traced wine to Martin, the "Black Swan," at Bow, to <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Up cross and Harris, of Albany Street, and a number of others—the wine found in the cellar at Basinghall Street has been examined and pronounced spurious—it purported to be Heidseick's, and some purporting to be Moet and Chandon's is also spurious;—I have seen Bass at Basinghall Street smoking, and be had a van there and waited two hours and went to Sheen's public-house, London Wall, and then to the Crown and Cushion, London Wall, and to the Railway Tavern, and stopped there till closing</p>

               <p>time, when he had to run to catch the last train, and when he left the house he stopped and loked round; so that we had to go another way to watch him, and therefore it took a fortnight to get his address—I remember his coming to the Old Jewry prior to April 19th, 1881, and having a conversation with me in the presence of Inspector M 'Willan who pointed to Bass and said "This gentleman has complained of you He states that he is a wine merchant, and that you have made inquires at different public-house customers of his, which has interfered with his business"—I said "At one place there was no licence, but I have only made inquiries in the usual way"—Bass said to me "If you had come to my store as a man, I would have told you all you wanted to know "—I said "With the inspector's consent I will come out and speak to you"—I did so—we went into the street—he said "We will go somewhere"—we went to Smith's public-house and had liquor together—he said "Why did not you come to my store as a man, and I would have told you all you wanted to know about the labels and the working of the whole thing? I have seen the solicitors to the two firms; there are two 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. offered, and we could have divided that between us. You don't know where it was done or where the labels were put on, do you?"—I said "You can tell me what you like, but I am not going to answer questions, if you can do any good I will see you again"—we parted, and I instructed a detective to watch him—on 6th May, 1882, I laid an information at Marlborough Street, and went with another officer to see Bass at Finsbury Pavement—I said "Mr. Bass, I am going to arrest you on the charge of being concerned with others and obtaining 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by false pretences of <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Bravington, of Wardour Street"—he said "Have you got a warrant?"—I said "I have not; a Metropolitan officer has it, and will read it in your presence"—he said "There is no money at home," and produced 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I allowed him to send that to his wife by his clerk with a message—that is the cheque found by Andrews on Culliford, "Pay J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. Bass was living at Walthamstow in 1881 with a person who represented herself as his wife—I found he left there without paying his rent—I don't know that any reward has been offered for the persons who are selling the false champagne—none was offered to me—I received this gold watch in May, 1881, from Mr. Richards, the chief of Heidseick and Co.—I was day and night making inquiries it was sent to Colonel Fraser first, after which I received it—I do not know that there is also a reward of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for any information which will lead to the conviction of the persons making the false champagne—I told Mr. Richards that Bass said so, and he seemed to <hi rend="italic">pooh pooh</hi> it—I saw Bass for about two months with the other prisoners from 11 a.m. till 12 p.m.—I was devoting my whole time to them—they were playing at billiards—I saw them at the window with their coats off, chalking the cues.</p>

               <p>February at Liverpool Street, and the corner of Broad Street, they went into a tavern—I did not see them come out—I saw them again a few days afterwards; I had an inquiry in that neighbourhood which caused me to go there—when I went to the Middlesex Sessions I spoke to the sergeant and lie called Rodway down from the gullery—when I asked him if he had received any champagne he said, "Yes," the third time I asked him—the corking machine was not packed, but there was a piece of canvas round it, and the furnace for the branding irons was open—these things were in boxes without lids, so that they were easily seen—he has never told me where he got the goods, except that they came from a stable, but I found that they came from Sherwood Street, Golden Square.</p>

Matthews and Co., aud occupied two kitchens converted into a cellar—they were there about 13 months; I left about September, 1881—while 1 was there Bass, Culliford, and MacNamara <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to come there occasionally and smoke a cigar and drink a bottle of champagne and talk about business—I know a Mr. Botwright, I always supposed he was a solicitor; he is a clerk to Mr. Vernede—the business carried on in Basinghall Street was that of a wine merchant's and just selling brandy from samples—there were also premises at 2, Finsbury Square; I went there very seldom—there were two kitchens there, front and back—no name was up—I used to see Bode there, and a man not in custody, named Salomons—at Finsbury Square sparkling wine was received from Hills and Underwood, and there was a corking machine and all the implements for altering the character of the wine, brands for the corks and the cases, and labels and wrappers—when the wine came in it was manipulated by Bode and Salomons—the corks were drawn and fresh corks put in with Heidseick's brand on, and labels attached and wrappers put on—having so become Heidseick's wine it went out in that capacity t about 300 dozen altogether went out—I know two or three places where it went to: Wright's in Old Street, and Reed's Wharf, and Cambridge Road, and some went to the Star public house at the corner of Old Street Road—the transformed wine did not go to Basinghall Street—in September, 1880, Matthews and Co. became bankrupt, and I left at a month's notice because they could not pay me my wages—Salomons took away the corking apparatus, in fact it was his money started the business altogether; MacNamara afterwards came to my house and engaged me, and I went to some premises at Clerken well where I saw the corking machines and the branding irons—I did not go to work there; directly I found them out I sent them a letter in a few hours declining to have anything to do with it, and telling him he had better look out, as he was being watched—I remember having to</p>

Moet and Chandon would pay very liberally for the result, and I explained that to mean that he must convict some of the principal offenders and not mere outsiders—something had been said about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward, but not on that occasion—I was to communicate with my clients and ascertain what reward they would give, and Bass gave me a bottle of the spurious wine, which I have here—I then communicated with Simon and Dale, and subsequently with Langham; and on December 6th Bass and Johnson called again, and I said that <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Moet and Chan<lb/>don were willing to give 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the conviction of the principal offender, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per head for every subsequent conviction, so that the whole amount should not exceed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Bass said he wanted 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first,</p>

               <p>—I was first introduced to this champagne by Salomons—I afterwards found out that it came from a person named Wilkie—I heard afterwards that it was forged—I did not know it at first; I think I knew it about six months after I had been at Basinghall Street; that would be in the summer of 1880—we then began to manufacture it, and for that purpose employed Bond, who I had known as working at Bevis Court for Bass—lie got the brands from Salomons; he suggested that we should do it on our own account—the difficulty was in getting the brands—Salomons informed me that he knew of a party near where he was residing at Islington, who would manufacture the brands, and that was Madden—the brands were then made by Madden, both for Heidseick and Moet and Chandon—he did both about the same time—the labels and wrappers were printed by Norris; I went to Norris and ordered them—Salomons had previously had some plates made by some friend of his who I did not know, and they were printed from them—we got a bottling-machine from Farran and Jackson's—those were got previous to employing Bond—we were under a difficulty; we did not know how to proceed in the matter, and Bond was employed to teach us—at this time we were intimate with Base, and he was a constant visitor at 64, Basinghall Street when we had the apparatus there—Salomons brought the brands from Madden's to Basing<lb/>hall Street, and they were eventually taken on to Finsbury Square—the operation of changing the labels and the corks was performed at Finsbury Square—we got the wine from Hills and Underwood, and when the labels and corks were altered we delivered the wine from Finsbury Square—I sold the first parcel to Bass—I told him that we had portions of this wine—we did not actually inform him how it was got up; we took it for granted that he knew; it was palpable; the cases were so different; and the landlord of the Windmill, alter he had tried it, told him what it was—I do not know the landlord personally—I have been to the house—I think it was about July, 1880, that we sold the first parcel to Bass; we sold it at something near 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, 41<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. odd; in fact it was lest, because we did not get paid for it—we eventually got payment of it from Bass, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. odd a dozen; we got it by pounds at a time, extending over a considerable period—he declined to pay—he sent a carman for the wine—Bass told me that he knew really what it was; he told me it was not Moet's champagne, and the landlord wanted him to take it back—we laughed at him, I and my partner did—Bass wanted some more of it—we offered to let him have it at a certain price, provided we were allowed to deliver it and receive the money and hand him the difference—we declined to let him have it without the money being, paid right down or being paid to us, and we to hand him the price it realised—I think we offered it to him at 44<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I can't exactly say to a shilling; it was Moet's wine—we found it was not good enough, and we stopped manufacturing Moet, and we then commenced manufacturing Beidseick's—that is, we begun to use Heidseick's corks and labels, and a different wine, a better class; it cost 44<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Bass came, and wanted 100 cases of this new wine—we informed him that we had stopped the Moet's and had commenced with Heidseick's—we told him we could not let him have 100 dozen; he could only have it in small quantities—the difficulty was that Moet's cases are so much larger than the usual cases in which champagne is packed, and we could not get any of the same size as Moet's—Bass knew that, because he had told me that he had compared the cases that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188206260085"/>
               <p>their wine was packed in, with MacNamara's oases, and he found a great difference in them; I spoke to him about it; it became known generally—there was no secret in the matter—I mean there was no secret about the wine; that the labels were false—Bass knew that the labels and brands were false—I did not go on supplying him with wine after that—he got us one or two orders after that, which we delivered ourselves—one parcel of 20 dozen was' sent to a person of the name of Steadman, who came to us for it, and it was sent to his, house, and Steadman and Bass took it to a party named Hill in the Borough—I can't say whether he got us further orders—several orders were got from a publican named Med worth, which we delivered ourselves according to arrangement; whatever difference there was we paid to him—I did not employ a man named Carter to deliver any of this wine; I don't know the name—we employed principally a man named Harris—I do remember a man named Carter from the Cock and Hoop who delivered wine to Weatherley's—I used to see Bass every day—I first knew that we were under suspicion, and that this was being inquired into, some time before—we received a notice from <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Jones, the solicitors for <hi rend="smallCaps">MESSRS</hi>. Heidseick—about a week previously we received information from Wright, of Broad Street, to whom wine had been sold; I think that was about November, 1880—the operations, I think, only lasted about four months; I mean the alteration of the corks and labels of Heidseick—Wright of Broad Street sent on to me at Basinghall Street wishing to see me, and I went to his office, and he then told me that he had some intimation about the wine not being genuine—I don't think we saw Bass that night, or if we did he was informed directly we saw him of what had transpired—I can't say what he said previous to that—we had had some slight intimation that the parties knew about it—we did not know whether it was Bass or MacNamara who had given information, and we accused them both of having done so, but we found out afterwards that Bass was the party who was negotiating to get a reward for giving information; he denied it—this happened in a private room at the Crown and Cushion; the landlord was a general customer of ours, and we asked him to let us go into his private room to settle a little dispute there—there was Salomons, Bass, MacNamara, and myself there—we thought at first it was MacNamara who had given information, but we found after<lb/>wards that it was Bass—they both denied it, and as we had no positive proof, the matter dropped—Bass advised me to get back the labels and plates that Norris had, and he went there with me and we got them, and I destroyed them—the transactions with Bass went on for about four months on and off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. The first time I had an acquaintance with the spurious champagne was in the summer of 1880; Salomons, my then partner, introduced it to me—I had previously bought champagne through Salomons' introduction, but that was genuine, and I sold it again—after he became my partner we started these transactions at his suggestion—the labels and corks were manufactured in Finsbury Circus—none of it was ever at Basinghall Street—there might have been a few cases of it there, I can't exactly say; we had samples there—the first parcel sold to Bass was taken to the landlord of the Windmill—I did not sell him that by sample—we had some Moet to sell, and he wished to buy it—we did not exactly tell him in words it was spurious, in fact the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188206260086"/>
               <p>word "spurious" was never used among us—we told him we had a parcel of Moet at 40 odd shillings—he paid us for it eventually in part that was what we termed "White Dry Sillery, Moet's first quality"—the wholesale price at that time was 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bass said he knew what the wine was; in fact we candidly admitted what it was; we took it for granted from his experience that he would know without our actually telling him—he said he knew that the cases were different—any one who saw the cases would know directly that it was not Moet's—we sent the first lot to his place of business at Walthamstow, by train, but it ultimately went to the Windmill—he did not refuse to pay for that wine, he paid us off; he showed us a cheque he had received, and said as soon as he got it cashed he would pay us—I think that was about July, 1880—we did not sell him any more of the Moet; the sale of that stopped within a week or so afterwards, but directly afterwards we told him he could have Heidseick's instead, and he began asking us to let him have parcels of it—we kept books; they are not here, Mr. Salomons destroyed them—we kept them until we received an intimation from Wright, then they were destroyed; no documents were kept—I was not present when Salomons destroyed them—I did not disapprove of it; I quite approved of it—we first heard that somebody was in communication with the solicitors a month or six weeks before—we actually stopped our transactions somewhere about November—we did not supply any more Heidseick to Bass after that—we supplied two parcels to him directly, and about 30 or 40 dozen indirectly—that was done principally through Medworth—he gave the orders; Bass told me the orders, and it was sent to Med worth's, and from there some of it went to the Knave of Clubs, Chapman's, in Bethnal Green—when we found that somebody was giving information we began to get very cautious, in fact we began to give it up—Bass was never at Finsbury Circus; no one was allowed there but Bond, Salomons, and myself—I had sold for MacNamara and Bass when they were in business together some years ago, for which I never got paid—Bass and I were friendly till this trial commenced—I was selling for him for six or eight months when he was with MacNamara—we had an arrangement in this way: I was to sell brandies and wines for him, and the difference between the cost and the price realised was to be divided between us—I cannot tell how much it came to—it was about £13 in the last transaction I had with them—they paid me considerable sums from time to time, but afterwards I found out that instead of giving me the actual cost-price of the brandies, they had added considerably to the cost-price, and only divided the extra price with me—that matter went to arbitration, and it was given against me by Mr. Cameron.</p>

Re-examined,</hi> Mr. Cameron is now at Millbank in penal servitude—I made Bass's acquaintance in 1879 through calling at different houses—Moet and Chandon's brand is well known in the trade—if this had been real wine of the quality represented I should have realised 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it without any difficulty—both MacNamara and Bass were accused of having given information, and both denied it—nothing was said about the nature of the information that had been given, simply that information had been given that we had been selling this wine to the public as genuine by means of these false labels—MacNamara was the principal spokesman in the matter; we chiefly suspected him, but they both denied it—it was at Bass's suggestion that we got the labels and plates</p>

I know Bass; I was introduced to him by a Mr. Rawlings, a friend of mine—it might have been in 1878 or 1879, I could not tell for certain; I could only tell by the date when the cellars were taken in Bevis Court—I knew him as a wine and spirit merchant in Bevis Court, in partnership with his aunt, I believe—he asked me if I could influence any business, and whether I could bring any capital into the business; I joined him there—that business was shut up in 1879, and I took an office myself in Fenchurch Street—I know nothing about any cellars in Finsbury Square—I knew that Mr. Bode had got a business at Basinghall Street—I sold a parcel of wine for Bode to a Mr. Coley, and on going another time to sell him another parcel Mr. Coley told me it was spurious; I laughed at the idea; I did not believe it—Mr. Coley told me that Messrs. Simon and Dale had told him that it was so, and that if I would call in three or four days he would know more about the matter—I did call, and went with him and saw Mr. Dale, who asked me where I got the wine—I at first refused to say where I got it, but on Mr. Dale saying if I did not tell him he should give me in charge, I told him that 1 got it from Matthews and Co.—I met Bass on several occasions after that, sometimes in the street and sometimes at his place of business in Walthamstow, and sometimes at the Crown and Cushion, London Wall, as mutual customers of Bass and mine—when we were in Bevis Court we did business with Mr. Medworth of the Crown and Cushion to the extent of some 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Bass has been in the wine trade for years; I believe he used to be with a gentle<lb/>man named Hoffman.</p>

I spoke to him about there being no property in the room, and he agreed to pay in advance—I never saw a bottle of medicine in the room; it was empty the whole time—from 50 to 100 letters came every day for a fortnight or three weeks—they were addressed "MR. Brinsley Richardson, Phosphoric Institute," at my house—sometimes Sutton called for them, and sometimes Brownrigg—Sutton introduced Brownrigg to me, that I might give the letters to him in case he was not well and could not come—they have paid me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—I reckoned the rent to the end of January, and then not receiving it, I detained some of the letters and then received this letter.

Had I not been taken up, the books would have been sent several days ago.</p>

I am the victim of others; men who join in a fraud generally participate in the profits, but I have not participated to the extent °i a penny. My only hope of recovering my position was that book which Brownrigg failed to get out, though he could have done so if he liked. No human being could have contemplated such a fraud, because the book was in existence in 1881, therefore I had good reason to expect it to be produced I have been deprived of the produce of my brains, and I hope you will say that I have not conspired with Brownrigg to defraud any human being.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, living at Blackheath—my offices are 13, John Street, Bedford Row—on Thursday night, 25th May, about 10 minutes to 12, I was going up the hill from Blackheath towards the Princess of Wales public-house; when I got nearly to the top of the hill I heard the report of fire-arms just behind me; 1 looked round and saw somebody running down the hill towards the village—the inspector and a constable came up in a very few minutes afterwards; I made a communication to them; while speaking to them I heard a second report some little distance off on the other side of the road by the church—we went to the Princess of Wales about five minutes afterwards, and saw the prisoner there in the private bar—I have known him a long time—I told him that I had had a bullet unpleasantly near my head—he said, "Oh, it could not be," or "Nonsense"—he was very drunk—I did not hear any bullet <hi rend="italic">whizz</hi> or see any flash; it was behind me—I did not see who it was that fired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The second report must have been a good way off, I should think about 100 yards—I have known the prisoner a good many years; he lives with his father in Morden Road; I know some of the family; he is the only son—I have constantly seen him about Blackheath, and going up in the train—I have always been on terms of friendship with him, there has not been the slightest difference between us—he has always behaved himself like a gentleman when I have seen him—he was sitting down at the Princess of Wales—I and Mr. Griffin went in together—we left him there sitting down in the same place—it was rather a dark night.</p>

I live at 18, Vanbrugh Park, Blackheath—on this Thursday night I had come from New Cross, and about 10 minute to 12 I was going up the hill—I had travelled down in the same carriage with Mr. Bannister, but did not speak to him—I was four or five yards in front of him going up the hill—I heard a report of firearms; it appeared to be very close, I imagine about 20 or 25 yards—I turned round immediately; I spoke to Mr. Bannister, and within a few minutes saw the inspector, and while talking to him I heard a second shot in the direction of the church, which was some 100 yards off—Mr. Bannister and I took a cab and went to the Princess of Wales, where I saw the prisoner—I have known him for many years—he was very much the worse for drink—I mentioned to him about the shot, but he appeared to be too drunk to carry on any conversation—I said that we had been fired at coming up the hill—I think he said it was all nonsense—I replied that he had better go and try it, or something to that effect—we left him there and drove home.</p>

A few minutes before 12 on the night of 25th May, I was on Blackheath—I heard the report of fire-arms, and saw the two gentlemen, who made a statement to me—I then heard another report about 100 yards off on the heath—I did not see the flash—about 12.45 I saw the prisoner standing under a lamp on Blackheath, close by the Princess of Wales public-house—Constable Esdale was with me—we were in uniform—we went towards the prisoner—when we were within about 20 yards he turned round and pointed a revolver in his right hand and fired at us—he raised his hand to his shoulder and pointed right at us, facing us—after firing he immediately ran away across the grass towards Morden College—I followed him; he was stopped by another constable outside the college gates—I told him I should take him into custody for firing at me and a gentleman on the heath—he said "I heard the report of fire-arms, and it appeared to be over there," pointing across the heath—I asked him if he had anything about him, and then secured his arms—the other constable searched him, and took from a pocket at the back of his trousers this five-chambered revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was in a pocket on the hip, an American style of pocket, made for a pistol—I examined the revolver at the station, and found that it contained three empty and two loaded ball cartridges, which I produce—the prisoner was much the worse for drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say I was from 15 to 20 yards from him when the pistol was fired; I am not able to say exactly—it was a little cloudy at that time, but there was a moon; it was not a dark night—I never lost sight of him; I ran after him—I did not see him put the revolver in his pocket; I did not take much notice of that; I merely kept</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper at Her Majesty's Stationery Office, Westminster—Harris has been in the employment of the office for about four years as porter—it was his duty to go with a van to the different offices and fetch from them the waste paper, and deliver it to the stores at the Stationery Office, and to assist in loading and unloading the carts—on the 18th May I went to Winter's premises, and there saw a number of bugs containing waste paper, except one of scraps and one of millboards—there were 38 bags of waste paper, the property of Her Majesty, from the post offices—they were not marked—we advertised for tenders for the purchase of waste paper about two years ago, and we received tenders for tearing up the waste paper and sorting it—the conditions were furnished to each applicant, I believe—Winter tendered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The paper collected should have come back to the Stationery Office—about nine-tenths of it is sent to a couple of Her Majesty's prisons, to be torn up and sorted previous to sale, and about one-tenth is disposed of in another way—if it consists of new forms it is cut into two, and sold as waste paper—I found a little over one ton of paper at the place in question—I should estimate it worth from 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been connected intimately with waste paper for eight or nine years—for sorting I should think the price would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—if it were what we call rubbishy or mixed, it would be a little more—a portion of it consisted of newspapers that did not want any sorting—the vans it is collected in are four wheeled covered vans, with a large "V. R."on them—there are four porters engaged in that work and six vans, with six carman, and four, as you may call them, assistant porters—those vans would not always necessarily be used—we should probably use one of Pickford's vans—for instance, at Deptford dock there might be 40 or 50 tons of waste paper to fetch away, and we should employ Pickford's vans in addition.</p>

I am barmaid at the Wellington Arms, Waterloo Road—the prisoner came there on the 20th May about 5 o'clock—he asked for half a pint of mild and Burton, and gave me a florin—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I put the florin in the till—there was no other florin there—there was a shilling in it—the prisoner took the change and left—10 minutes afterwards he came again, and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of whisky in cold water; he gave me a second florin—I looked at that, and found it was bad; I looked at the first one, and found that was bad—I said, "You have given me two bad florins;" he said he had not been in the house before—I called the landlord in, and said in his presence, "This man has been in the house before and given me a bad florin, and he has come in again and given another"—I gave both the florins to the landlord, Mr. Price—the second one I did not put in the till—I am sure the prisoner is the same man—I knew him when he came in the second time—he had paid for the whisky with a good florin to the landlord, and he gave him change—Mr. Price asked him where the change I gave him was—he said he had not got any more money; he bad not any change about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Wellington Arms—on the afternoon of the 20th May, about 5, the barmaid gave me two bad florins; the prisoner was present—she said, "This man has given me two bad florins "—he said he had not been in the house before; he gave one florin about 10 minutes previously to the other one—I did not say anything about the change—I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because he had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the first florin—I gave the two florins to the constable, and the prisoner tried to escape—when I went out at one door he went out at the other—he said, "I will go after the governor"—he walked sharply down the street, and the constable fetched him back.</p>

I was at the time of the robbery a commercial traveller—I live at 91, Great Suffolk Street, Borough—on the 2nd of June, at about 20 minutes past 11 o'clock, I was passing over Blackfriars Bridge—I had gone about 30 yards, when all at once an arm came round me, a leg underneath, and down I went—it was like a lot gathering about me—the prisoner McMahon jumped upon me, and his hands were in my throat—I was looking at him for a minute—he then screwed my finger ring off my hand—I did not see him screw it off—directly they released me I rolled over and tried to clutch hold of the other prisoner—they all ran away—I could not swear Mead had bold of my hand—I did not know that my pin was gone, but one of the witnesses said "You have lost your pin "—I said "They have taken my ring"—my pin and ring were both safe up that time—I ran after the prisoners and seized them, and kept them till a constable came—I gave them in charge—I have no doubt that McMahon is the man who knelt on my chest—I have a doubt about Mead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about 11. 20—1 was late at business that day—on my way home I called at a house in the City where I get lunch and had a glass or two—I did not have more than I usually take—I knew what I was doing—at the police-court I was under the impression that Mead was one of the attacking party—after further consideration I have some doubt about him.</p>

I keep a school at Carrington Lodge, Marsh Gate, Richmond, and have a house next door in which my masters live——in October last I had a lawn-mower; at the close of the season I placed it under a table in the back kitchen; the box and the shield were placed in a pantry which I do not use, and were locked up—it is an American machine known as the Excelsior, with "Burnett, Weight, Higgins, and Co., London and Paris," stamped on it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I purchased it from Mr. Clarke, who is a witness—when I wanted it in May this year it had disappeared, but the box and shield were safe—I employed the prisoner as a gardener—he was last employed at Carrington Lodge on 14th January—he knew where the machine was kept in the winter—on 3rd June I went with Sampson to the prisoner's house, 5, Park Villas, Queen's Road, and there found the machine—these two holes have been made in it since, they are lubricating holes, and a new box and shield have been made to it—I said to the prisoner, "I have lost my lawn-mower, and I understand you have one just like it; I should like to see it"—he said, "I bought it; it is not your machine, Mr. Older; your machine had not a box like that, nor the holes"—I said "No"—the detective then came in and said, "Where did you buy it?"—he said, "Of the firm at their premises"—I said, "I want to know where their premises are"—he said, "In Whitechapel"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—I said, "I suppose you have a receipt?"—he said, "No, I never had one," and that he sent a post-office order in payment—I said," Do you mean to say that these people did not send you a receipt for your post-office order? how did it come down to Richmond?"—he said, "By the South-Western Railway; you don't mean to accuse me of stealing it?"—I said," No, I don't like to do that, but you will have to show by the books of the firm that you bought it"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My real name is Mary Ann Carpenter—I have gone by the name of Williams about four years—I do so when I am with my mother, but when I stay with my friends I go by the name of Carpenter—I knew a man named Ferneux, I lived with him about four years—that is his real name I believe, but he went by the name of Williams he was convicted at this Court of housebreaking on the 18th of last October 12 months, and sentenced to five years' penal servitude, at the time I was living with him—I do not know a man named Fielding to my knowledge—I know Finsbury, but do not know Bowerbank's distillery; it may be that I know a man who was employed there—I know a clerk named Glover in Bowerbank's distillery—I may have told a lie when I said that I did not know Bowerbank's distillery at all—I never lived with Glover, I knew him about three months; he assisted to keep me—we did not occupy the same room; he has his own private residence—I do not say that he has not stayed with me all night—I believe he was prosecuted for embezzlement by his own father and tried here five or six years ago, and got five years' there are several beershops in Prevost Street, City Road—I have never heard of my being charged with stealing a watch from The Hope beershop, the property of Mr. Turner—I knew a man named Shovel by sight, about two years; I did not often speak to him, only for the last three or four months—it is over four months since I have seen him—I have not lived with him or been kept by him, nor lived under his protection—I have slept with him; I only know him as a friend of the prisoners, they call him their friend-—I do not know that he has been in prison for three months—I was discharged by the Magistrate on the charge of pawning this property—before I was discharged I saw Inspector Fox—when I took the knives to the pawnbroker's I did not not know that they were part of the proceeds of a burglary—I did not see any dentist's instruments, they were knives and forks; I knew they were stolen—I called my brother and a friend before the Magistrate to prove that I had these knives and forks six months before—I did not know they were coming to commit perjury; my brother knew nothing of it till 2 p.m., when I saw him at the House of Detention, he only went by what I told him—Mrs. Cummings was my other witness; she is not here; she swore she had seen a parcel similar to this about Christmas, but my brother never swore—he stood bail for me, and as I went out of Court I saw Inspector Fox, but had no conversation with him—I told my brother the truth—I do not expect to get anything by giving this evidence, I think it is my duty to do so—I arrived at that conclusion just lately—when I saw that two innocent men were going to suffer, I thought it was time to speak—it was for the love of justice, but it was after I had been charged myself—I was discharged at Southwark Police court, but I do not know how the case will end, I only know I am speaking the truth and I intend to do so—Griffiths was not a tenant, he was a friend of Henry's—I did not trouble about these <hi rend="italic">jemmies,</hi> I knew they had no business there; they did not belong to Henry, they belonged to Griffiths—I knew they were burglars' tools—I had not seen similar tools in Ferneaux's possession, he never kept anything at home; what he did out I don't know—I did not betray him or give evidence against</p>

               <p>him, but I do so now for the sake of two men who I never saw till last Tuesday—they were charged at Westminster before I was charged; I did not then make a statement, because I was living with Henry—my love of justice commenced after I was charged.</p>

The man who was convicted of house breaking went by the name of James and by the name of Williams; you asked me at the police-court whether I ever lived with any other persons who were convicted of felony, and I said I did not; I do not know whether the man was innocent, he was found guilty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased was brought there about midnight on the Wednesday—I did not see her till she was in bed—she was burnt on the legs, and back, and buttocks, and in front, but not higher than her waist, except a little on her her right arm, where the sleeve was loose—she was superficially burnt, not severely—the remainder of her clothes had been taken off when I saw her—she died on the Saturday, from exhaustion from the effects of the burning—Mr. Ellison took down her deposition in my presence on the Thursday, nearly two days before she. died——the prisoner was present, and had the opportunity, of cross-examining her. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Mary, Ann Smith was here read as follows:</hi> "I am now a patient in Guy's Hospital. I am a widow; I lived at 11, Gurney Street, with the prisoner as his wife. Last evening he came home to tea about 6 o'clock; he was sober then. He went out. We had no words. About half-past 10 I went out after him, and found him in a public-house near the Elephant and Castle. He was then very drunk. I asked him to come home, and he did after a time. When we got. home I poured out some tea for him. All at once he began. The first thing he did was he broke the cup and saucer. Then he broke the lamp. I had put it out of the way on the drawers, and he either threw it or knocked it over; I could not say which. It fell on the mat and blazed up, and I was close against it, and it <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> to my dress in a moment. I called out that I was on fire, and the landlord and landlady came up. Before they could get up, Taylor threw a pail of water over me, and then I was brought here in a cab. He is all right when he is sober; it is only when he gets drink. My face was not towards-the drawers when the lamp was broken. The lamp fell on the mat close to me; it did not hit me first. When they came upstairs he was putting water on the fire and on the mat. There was not much bad language used; he had not illused me. No one was in the room. "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was perfectly conscious, but as far as I remember she was questioned a good deal, because she was rather weak—the expression "catched" instead of caught was her own; that was quite voluntary—these are Very nearly the words she used—when she said "putting</p>
