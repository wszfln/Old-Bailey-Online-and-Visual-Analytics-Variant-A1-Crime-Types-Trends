                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Richardson at the Post Office, Chancery Lane—on Thursday, 8th May, I was at the counter there—about half-past four a boy came in for eight orders for 20s. each—I had to go to the safe for them; I took out about 130—I sold the first eight to the boy; the rest I put in the portfolio, lengthways, which was fastened by an elastic band—I afterwards sold two more; I do not remember at what time—the portfolio lay in the front of the counter, which was protected by a net work—there are two pigeon-holes through which we take the money and pass the stamps; the portfolio lay between the pigeon-holes—these seven orders are part of those that were stolen from the portfolio; none of these were issued by me—these have the signatures of Robert Reed, Robert Jones, and Lyon—there are no such persons in our office—I went off duty that evening at a quarter to seven, and Miss Mayne took charge of the counter—these orders all bear the stamp of the Greek Street Post Office of May 10th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is foreman Greaves's duty as a rule to check flour delivered at these premises; if he does not do it, whoever is there does it—I first saw the prisoner that day in the bakehouse, where I was at work; he came in, as he generally does, to see where to put the flour—I was in the bakehouse all the time—you cannot see from the bakehouse into the flour-room—the prisoner came through twenty-one times, with only one sack or bag at a time—I had twenty-two pieces of paper, and I checked him with a piece each time he came in; I only disposed of twenty-one pieces—when he had finished carrying them in, he asked me to check them; I said I was busy; he said, "You know how many I have left; you will find the sixteen down in the flour-room"—I did not see Greaves and Lucas while I was counting the number of times the prisoner passed through.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner only asked me to check the number of bags after he had passed through—I stood at the door of the flour-room, not at the door leading to the wagon outside.</p>

               <p>bring them from the van, nor place them in the flour-room—then he brought three sacks of superlative or patent flour, and then a bag, a special, and he continued bringing bags down until I heard him say to one of the men, "That makes twenty-two," and I stepped upstairs to the shop, and told the manageress—the carman was waiting in the shop for his ticket—I asked him what flour he had brought to the firm; he said six sacks and sixteen bags—I said, "Will you point them out to me?"—he said, "Yes," and both of us stepped down to the flour-room—he pointed out six sacks and six bags of flour, and said, "That is twelve, and here are ten bags of special"—I said, "Count them, please"—I had previously marked part of the sacks which we had in the flour-room—when he came to one of those I said, "Stop, that bag is the property of the firm, and was in the flour-room before you arrived; I have a special mark on it, and also a witness to prove that it belongs to our firm; I have had my suspicions"—he said, "It is a pity, is it not; I will go upstairs and look in the van, and see if there is another one"—I said, "Do just as you like; I will report this to my employer"—he went away—this is the invoice for sixteen bags and six sacks that he produced with the flour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw nothing that took place during the delivery of the flour in the flour-room—I told the Magistrate as something that I saw myself, that I saw the prisoner take a Dundas bag of our flour and put it near the other superlatives, and then he put it on the top of the other superlatives—I did not tell the Magistrate that that was something that had been told to me—I did not see it—I did not see the flour deposited in the flour-room—I don't think I was cross-examined as to whether I saw it done—every time the carman went upstairs for a bag of flour I stepped into the flour-room, and saw what had been done; but I did not see him deposit the sacks or bags—I cut a hole in one ear of the bag of Dundas, and two holes in the other ear—I did that after the carman had been once in the flour-room, making room for his load—the prisoner insisted to the end that he had delivered all the bags—I did not say it was a pity; he said so—he did not say, "You had better look in my van and see I do not take anything away with me"—when I said the bag was marked, he did not ask what the mark was—he said, "That was the bag I brought in"—only he and I were there then—Lucas was a little distance from the dressing-room, which is in a straight line with the flour-room, while the bags were being delivered; there is quite nine yards of space between the dressing and flour rooms, I should say—Lucas was in the pastry-room between the dressing and flour rooms, and he was outside—I was in the coal cellar part of the time; Lucas would have to see the length of the pastry-room, and through the dressing-room into the flour-room—from the dressing-room to the entrance of the flour-room is ten yards—I believe the large sacks were, placed near the middle of the flour-room, which is about nine yards across; it is lighted by one gas jet at the entrance—there are no windows; the gas was alight; it was between Lucas and the place where the sacks were piled—I was not on the premises when the prisoner called the same evening with his employer.</p>

I was present on 23rd July when the prisoner delivered this flour—I was standing at the dressing-room, close to the flour-room, and could see what took place in the flour-room—before the prisoner brought in any bag I saw him move a bag marked Dundas flour belonging to the firm from other of their bags, and put it about one and a half yards away from where it stood before—then he delivered his own flour—after he had delivered five sacks he moved the firm's bag on to the top of a half sack of flour of ours—after delivering some more sacks he moved our firm's bag off the half sack on to a bag of special that he had just brought from his van—then he delivered the remaining flour from the van—after he had brought them all down I found there were fifteen bags and six sacks, and the one bag belonging to the firm—they were lying on the top of one another.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Fowells Street, Lancaster Road, Notting Hill, and am a bricklayer—the prisoner gave to me these two postal orders on June 17th in Archer Street, about fifty yards, or not so far, from the sorting office, at six or seven o'clock, as near as I can say—he asked me if I was busy; I said, "No"—he said, "Would you mind doing a job for me?"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Will you take these orders into the post office to change them for me?"—the Norfolk Terrace Post Office was just across the road, it and the sorting office are all in one—I asked him if they were all right, and he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have I got to do with them?"—he said, "You have only got to sign your name"—I asked why he did not go in himself, and he said because he did not wish to go in then, because he appeared as if he had had a drop of something to drink—he was in uniform—I took the orders into the post office, and handed them to the lady clerk, and asked her to change them, and she said, "Yes, sign your name"—I did so, and she said that was not the same name as was on the top; I said, "No," but it was my name—she said, "I don't know what to do about changing these things"—I believe I said they were all right—and she said, "Will you give your address?"—and I said, "Certainly," and I gave her on the back of the orders, 46, Lonsdale Road, where I was then living—I received 7s. from her—when I came out I saw the prisoner across the road at the urinal, in the centre of Norfolk Terrace cab rank—I went and gave him the money, and he gave me Is. saying, "That is for yourself"—I had been laid up with a poisoned hand—I told him I had given my right name and address, and he said, "The more b——fool you"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "Oh, that is all right"—I went one way and he the other—I had known him by sight three, four, or five years, but I had been away in the country—I had spoken to him two or three times, or it may have been oftener—I saw him two or three times after he gave me the shilling, and before he was arrested—I pointed him out to Mr. Woodward, and had some conversation with him in the presence of the Post Office officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner, from the beginning, said that the story I tell is a lie—on 17th June I was living at 46, Lonsdale Road; I had been there over three months—from there I went to 23A, Bolton Road for about a fortnight, and now we have taken a house at 4, Fowell Street—I last worked for Fray and Son, Elgin Crescent—I finished there on Saturday—I had been out of work three or four weeks when I met the prisoner—I did not know his name then; he was a perfect stranger to me, with the exception of my having seen him about—I did not know there was anything wrong about this; there was no concealment about it—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189007280019"/>
               <p>gave me the orders quite openly in the street, fifty yards from his own post office—I did not know if they were stolen—I knew some of the postmen by sight, and three or four of the sorters by name—I did not know when the deliveries went out—the post office clerk did not ask me where I got the orders from; I did not say I got them from my master, who was a mason—she did not ask who T. Smith was; she said it was not the same name as that I signed—when I made my accusation against the prisoner the police came to me, and asked me if I knew these notes, and I said it was my signature on them—I told him I got the notes from the prisoner—I suspected nothing wrong—I thought as I was queer and out of work the prisoner gave me the shilling out of charity—he appeared to have been drinking—he could walk straight—I was in the station for a few hours one night for ill-treating my wife; my master bailed me out; my wife did not appear next morning, and I was discharged—that was nearly two years ago, I believe—I have never been in prison—I did not say I got these orders from my master, a mason, I never worked for a mason.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Notting Hill Post Office, which adjoins the sorting office—on the evening of the 7th of June, Parker came in between six and seven and presented these two orders for payment—I told him to sign them—when I saw his name and saw that they were payable to T. Smith and Co., I said, "I don't think I can pay them, because you have signed a different name to what is on the top"—I asked him if T. Parker was his name; he said, "Yes"—I asked him who gave them to him, and he said his master, I believe; I understood from him that someone had given them to him in payment for wages; I won't swear the word master was used—then, as he seemed to be an honest man, I asked him if he would give his address, and I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His appearance induced me to pay him; he seemed to be in trouble, and to want the money—he did not say his master was a mason; he looked like a bricklayer—I am perfectly sure I asked him where he got the notes from, and the impression of my mind is he said he got them from his master in payment of wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have since seen the prisoner's brother in the office, and asked how his brother was getting on—the rule is not to pay orders, when the signature differs; I have done it before—I told Mr. Hurst—he said he had received these from his master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the confidential department of the General Post Office—in consequence of inquiries I made on 18th July I saw Parker, who made a statement to me—afterwards I saw the prisoner at Notting Hill Post Office in the presence of Parker, Hurst, and the overseer—I said to him," My name is Woodward, I am from the General Post Office"—I pointed to Parker and said he had lived at 46, Lonsdale Road, and that he had informed me he had cashed the two postal orders on 17th June—I showed the prisoner the two orders, and asked him where he got them from—he said, "I never remember seeing them"—I asked him if he had ever given Parker any postal orders to cash; he said, "No, I have not"—I asked him if he had ever seen Parker before—he said, "I have known him for years, but I had not seen him lately"—I said to Parker, "You have heard this statement, what do you say?"—Parker replied, "I deny it"—he repeated the story he has told in Court to-day—I told the prisoner a letter addressed to Smith and Co., Chesterton Road, had not reached that address; he said, "There are plenty of letters for Smith, of Chesterton Road, and there are two or three Smiths in Chesterton Road"—I took the prisoner and Parker to the General Post Office, where Parker repeated his statement—the prisoner said, "I am quite innocent of this; I have never touched any postal order, nor did I ask him to cash those for me"—I asked him where he was living, and he gave the address 17, Cuthbert Street, Edgware Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 3, Enfield Terrace, High Hendon—on 14th June, a little after ten, I was outside the White Bear, Hendon—the deceased, Mr. Butcher, made a communication to me, and I went inside; I saw the prisoner there—the deceased came in with a friend—I saw the prisoner give the deceased two two-shilling pieces and a sixpence, at the same time saying to him, "You will be d——lousy and starving before long"—Butcher made no reply to that—he left shortly afterwards, and Minty left in about two or three minutes—I went out and saw him and Butcher about twenty yards from me, about seven or eight yards apart—Minty was in the act of putting down a parcel on the window sill, and he said to Butcher, "If you come near me I will <hi rend="italic">bash</hi> your skull in"—they then walked down the road, having some conversation together about the remark Minty had made in the publichouse—Minty had a stick in his hand, a dark-brown one, like a</p>

               <p>blackthorn or holly, very heavy, with a large knob at one end—some boys came up and spoke to me—I went on and overtook Butcher; he made a complaint to me, and showed me a lump on the right side of his temple, about the size of a smallish walnut; it was swelling considerably; I saw it later on in the evening, and it had then swollen considerably—several of us followed on as far as the pond, but no further—I did not see anyone else there at the time—Butcher said to Minty, "Here is Brown, if you have got anything to say against him come and say it now"—I said, "Don't make any bother now, wait till we get to the station"—Minty said to Butcher, "Come along, you b——, if you want anything," and he flourished his stick—they went on to the Hendon Railway Station; Butcher then said to Minty, "Are you going to withdraw those words you made use of in the public-house?"—Minty did not say anything; he did not have time; he lifted up his fist and hit Butcher deliberately on the nose, and he fell to the ground; he got up in about half a minute, and Minty hit him on the nose again and knocked him down again—after that he bled from the nose wonderfully, and felt so weak that if anyone had touched him with a finger he would have fallen down—I went with him into the railway-station, and found a constable there, but he refused to take Minty into custody, as he did not see the assault; he took his name and address, and I persuaded Butcher to summons him—after that I went home.</p>

I have been a master builder and a bricklayer—I have never had any quarrel or dispute with the prisoner—he is the ostler at the White Bear—I was on friendly terms with him, and also with Butcher—I never saw Butcher drunk; he was a most respectable young fellow; I had known him about two or three months—I had nothing to do with this matter; I was going on my road home, and it was from what the boys said that I followed them—I was not egging on the people to worry the prisoner—I did not hear him say to Butcher, "Go away, Jack; why don't you go home?"—there were seven or eight persons following them as far as the pond; I suppose they thought there was going to be a disturbance—I did not hear Minty warn Butcher to keep away from him three or four times before he used the expression about "<hi rend="italic">bashing</hi>" his skull—Butcher was not threatening to strike him—nobody but myself followed as far as the station; the boys were some distance behind—they got up to the station a minute or two before me, and as I got there the Mow was struck—before that I said to the prisoner, "If he interferes with you at the station with a stick again I will interfere, but not unless"—I only went as a kind of caretaker; there were not ten or a dozen people surrounding Butcher at the station; they collected after the blows were struck—Butcher was not standing with his back against the railings—I did not see any belt used—the prisoner had his coat off; I persuaded him to put it on—no doubt he intended to have a bother with Butcher; we thought so, that was the reason we followed him—I did not hear the prisoner say, "Get away from me; if you don't——," and then stop—I have not said that I heard him say so—I don't think I said so before the Magistrate; at any rata. I don't remember saying so.</p>

I live at Hendon, and assist my father, who is a greengrocer—I am fifteen years old—on Saturday, 14th June, about twenty minutes past ten, I was with Candler, going towards Hendon Railway Station—I saw Minty and Butcher on the road; they were jawing at one another—I saw Minty hit Butcher with a stick about the head about three times; he then swung the stick round his head—the last time Butcher was hit he fell, and as he fell he kicked at him; I did not see whether he kicked him—I was about three yards from them at the time—Brown came up, and I said something to him—I continued walking behind them to the railway station—when they got to the gates of the station, Minty said to Butcher, "Are you going away?" he repeated that several times—Butcher said, "No," and then Minty punched him and knocked him over—I did not see any belt—I saw Butcher's head at the station, I noticed a cut on his nose, and a bump on the right temple—the blows with the stick were hard blows; it was a long blackish varnished stick, an ordinary walking-stick, with a knob on the end.</p>

I said, "No"—he said, "Then drop it; our people have been talking about it; drop it for a week"—about a week afterwards I got him two more boxes, and took them to Peter Mazzolini's shop; some workpeople were there, and he called me round the counter and said, "Don't give them while there is anybody in the shop"—when they went out I handed them to him, he took them to the back, and I went back to George in Fore Street, who paid me 14s., and said, "Don't let anybody see you take them round, as it will make it hot for me"—I saw George pay Baston 2s.—on 19th June George said, "Can you get me any more shirts?"—I said, "Yes"—and on the first morning as we were takings the truck to Wood Street we left half a dozen in the truck, and Baston stopped with the truck while I went in—we then went to Whitecross Street, and I looked after the truck while Baston took</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, residing at Alexandra Road, Hornsey; the male prisoner is my uncle; I know his handwriting—this letter (A) is his writing. <hi rend="italic">The Utter woe as follows</hi>: "My dearest Georgie,—Twelve months have I now put up with a most miserable, struggling existence, and I really cannot stand any more; I am completely worn out, and relations who could assist me won't do any more, for such was uncle's last intimation. Never mind, he can't take his money and comfort with him, and in all probability will find himself in the same boat as myself; he never inquires whether I am starving or not. £3, a mere flea-bite to him, would have put me straight, and his security and interest might have obtained me a good situation long ago. I can face poverty and degradation no longer, and would sooner die than go to the workhouse. Whatever the awful consequences may be of the step we have taken, we have, God forgive us, taken our darling lamb <hi rend="italic">Arty</hi> with us, out of pure love and affection, so that the darling should never be cuffed about, or reminded or taunted with his heart-broken parent's crime. My poor wife has done her best at needlework, washing, house minding, etc., in fact, anything and everything that would bring us in a shilling, but it would only keep us in semi-starvation. I have now done six weeks' travelling from morning till night, and not received one farthing for it; if that is not enough to drive you mad, wickedly mad, I don't know what is—no bright prospect anywhere, no ray of hope. May God Almighty forgive us for this heinous sin, and have mercy on our sinful souls, is the prayer of your miserable broken-hearted, but loving brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR</hi>. We have now done everything that we possibly can think of to avert this wicked proceeding, but can discover no ray of hope; fervent prayer has availed us nothing; our lot is cast, and we must abide by it; it must be God's will, or he would have ordained it differently. Dear Georgie, I am exceedingly sorry to leave you all, but I am mad, thoroughly mad. You, dear, must try and forget us, and if possible forgive us, for I do not consider it our fault we have not succeeded. If we can get £2 for our bed it will pay our rent, and our scanty furniture will fetch another to bury us in a very cheap way. Don't grieve over us, or follow us, for we shall not be worthy of such respect. Our clergyman has never called on us or given us the least consolation, though I called on him a week ago; he is paid to preach, and there he considers his responsibility ends, the rich excepted. We have only yourself and a very few others who care one pin what becomes of us, but you must try and forgive us, is the last fervent prayer of your devoted friend and affectionate but broken-hearted and persecuted brother, <hi rend="smallCaps">B.

I am a registered medical practitioner, at Holloway—on 8th June, between six and seven in the evening, I was called to 27, Grove Road, and there saw the two prisoners in bed; the woman had lost a great deal of blood—I went into the back room, and in a cot I saw the body of the boy—he was lying on his right side, and was very rigid, more rigid than from the natural <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—I should think he had been dead more than six hours—in conjunction with Dr. White, I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—the rigidity was very marked in the lower jaw, what is commonly called locked-jaw—the mouth contained a quantity of solid particles of vomit—my opinion was that that would have been ejected but for the locked-jaw—the hands were clenched and the feet were curved inwards—the hands and feet were blue and livid, and the lips also—there was some backward curving in the legs, that is</p>

               <p>the body rested on the heels and the buttocks; it was not marked further than that, not to a greater extent—the internal organs were more or less congested, the surface of the brain more especially—the lungs and liver were more or less congested, the heart was partly contracted and empty, the bladder was empty—except for the congestion, the organs were healthy; there was nothing apparent to account for death—I formed the opinion that he had died from a convulsive condition of a titanic character—strychnine would produce such a condition—the appearances were consistent with death from strychnine—I afterwards put the stomach and intestines in one jar, and the whole of the liver, kidneys, and spleen, and a portion of the lungs and brain, into another jar, and they were sent to Dr. Luff—I also put into a tin box some of the vomit that I found on the night shirt and in the mouth.</p>

I am a Divisional Surgeon of Police, and practise at 428, Liverpool Road—on 8th June I was called by the police to 27, Grove Road—I there saw the body of a boy, and examined it—I have been in Court and heard Mr. Cowen's evidence, and agree with it—we stood the body on end, and so rigid was it that it stood by itself—the jaw was completely locked, and the food was in the vault of the mouth—I formed the opinion that the death was from strychnine poisoning—I heard the male prisoner say that he made the strychnine into a paste, and divided it into three portions—I don't recollect more—the inspector took it down in writing.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. and M.R.C.P. On the 11th June I received from the coroner's officer a glass jar containing a stomach, liver, a portion of brain, and a portion of a lung; also a second jar containing intestines, kidneys, and spleen; and a small tin box containing vomit, and a paper parcel containing sheets and pillowcase; I analysed all the viscera, and found no poison—in the vomit I found a trace of what I believe to be strychnine; it was too small to be weighed by the most delicate balance—in 
death from strychnine it does not necessarily follow that traces of it will be found in the contents of the stomach; if it does not produce death very rapidly, it undergoes absorption and elimination, mainly in the urine—the period within which death happens varies considerably, according to the strength of the dose and the constitution of the patient—it might be discoverable elsewhere—it would depend upon the length of time elapsing after it has been swallowed; I could tell of cases where three hours after death none has been discovered—the smallest dose that has been known to kill an adult is half a grain, and the smallest that ever killed a child between two and three years of age is 1-16 of a grain—vomiting is a rare symptom after strychnine—I have heard the evidence given to-day of the post-mortem appearances; they are consistent with death from strychnine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No poison was found in this viscera; I analysed it carefully—in my own experience I have always found strychnine in such cases—it is the rule that so much of the poison is absorbed as it takes to produce death, and whatever is over and above that remains—if it is absent from other parts of the body I should consider that the most likely spot to find it would be in the spinal cord—congestion of the upper part of the spinal marrow is not an uncommon post-mortem sign—the spinal cord was not sent to me—I agree with Professor Stevenson in this, that strychnine can hardly fail to be detected in the body within two hours—I stated before the Magistrate, "I should not, from my examination of the organs, be justified in saying that strychnine had been taken, or that the deceased had died from the administration of strychnine, judging from the organs that were sent to me, and from the results by analyses"—that is simply from the result of my examination of that which was sent to me—from my examination of the organs in this case I should not feel justified in saying that the deceased had died from strychnine, but after hearing the other witnessses, combined with my analyses, I say it is possible that it was a 
death from strychnine; that is my opinion now—if death ensues within two hours after the administration of strychnine, I should expect to find traces of it in the body—a grain would be amply sufficient to kill a boy of eight; if more were given in all probability death would be more speedy.</p>

Perkins—as far as I know all the parcels were booked—this is the regular parcels book, open for anyone to see; it is for any booking office—I have never known parcels sent to Green other than by Carter, Paterson's, or some other carrier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper to Mr. Morris, a corn dealer—I live at 6, Knight's Place, Holland Street, Southwark—on 8th February I was sent by Mr. Wood to Aldridge's to buy a horse—I went, but the horse was sold before I got there—I saw Wilson, whom I had never seen before, with two or three others in St. Martin's Lane, when I came out, talking about horses—I went into a urinal—Wilson came up and said he had a horse for sale, and was too late to get it into the repository, and he would like to sell it, as he came a long way—he asked me to look at it—I went with him to Neal Street, Seven Dials, and saw the horse; it was a chesnut cob, fourteen or fifteen hands high—I told him I did not want to purchase it, and turned to come back—two men came up and asked me to purchase the horse for them; they are not here,' they were talking to Wilson when I first met him about a horse they wanted to purchase, and which Wilson said he would not let them have because they had had it away and tried it, and they had insulted</p>

               <p>him—ho said he was a Salvation Army man, and he would not let a dealer have a horse that belonged to him—when he refused to sell to them, they asked me if I would purchase it for them, and they would give me ten shillings for my trouble—I went back to Wilson, and said I would buy it for £12—he said, "All right"—I came back to the two men to get the money, and Wilson followed me, and said he would not have anything to do with them whatever: if I was going to buy the horse I was to buy it myself; on account of his being a Salvation Army man he would not allow a dealer to have it—he said they were dealers—the two men said, "If you can buy it we will buy it off you"—he said, "Come and have a glass of ale"—I went with him to the Black Horse, Queen Street—the men followed—they said, "If you have any money of your own pay a deposit, and then you can do as you like with it"—I paid a deposit of £5, and went in and got this receipt, which Wilson wrote in the publichouse. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "Mandate," and was for a mare sold for</hi> £12 <hi rend="italic">to Mr. Baker on payment of £5 as deposit, the remainder to be paid before delivery</hi>)—Mandale was the name he gave me—I went out of the public-house to find the other two men, telling Wilson to wait there till I came back—I could not find the other two men or the horse—I returned to the public-house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I left it—I could not find Wilson—I next saw Wilson in Barrel! Street, Blackfriars, with four or five other men—they had been to Cox's repository in Stamford Street—I followed them, but found I could not speak to them, and so I gave it up; he went through the Subway—I next saw Wilson at Westminster Police-court, in custody on another charge—when I went to pick him out he was with about a dozen men.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a groom in Mr. Allsopp's employment—I hare lost my situation through this case—on 28th April I went to Tattersall's with a pair of Mr. Allsopp's horses for sale—after they were sold I went to have a glass of ale at the Packenham public-house, close to Tattersall's—I saw Wilson there—he said he had a horse for sale, and could I oblige him by putting my eye over the horse to see what I thought was his valuation, as ho could not get the horse into Tattersall's yard without giving a month's notice, or something to that effect—he said</p>

               <p>West wanted to buy the horse of him, but he wanted to knock him down in his price—West was present, and heard that—we went outside about the valuation of the horse, and then Wilson said he would give me £2 for my trouble, and I said, "Whatever you do you must be quick, as my time is precious; it is not my own time"—Wilson said he would not be beaten down in price on account of his religious principles; he would rather forfeit the horse than run away from his price—I went outside, and saw the horse in Trevor Square; a boy led it up and down—Wilson wanted me to deposit a small sum to bind the bargain, so that the horse could be passed through my hands, as he could not take the other man's money; he said he would sell the horse to me, but not to West—West said he wanted to send the horse away next morning to a tradesman in Kent—I said, in the hearing of both of them, that the horse would never be mine, because I had no use for it, and whatever I did I would do to oblige him—I did not want the horse—Wilson wanted to know if I could find anybody to be security—I said I did not want any security; I had only one friend in London, and I should not go to him—then we went to Tattersail's Yard; the men followed me—I put my clothing up, and went to my lodging to get £5, as I had not got it on me; Wilson came with me;. West remained—I and Wilson went back to the Trevor public-house; West went with us—Quint was in there, but he had nothing to do in the transaction with the horse—I paid my £5 in gold—we had a glass of ale when we first went in and another this second time—Wilson made out this receipt in a rough way, "Sold to Mr. Beazer a horse for the sum of thirty guineas Received £5 as deposit—<hi rend="smallCaps">N. WILSON</hi>"—after I had paid my money I could see I was swindled—West refused to have the horse; he said I had not paid the full value of the horse, and therefore the horse was not my property, and he could not buy it of me—I understood it belonged to Wilson, who was the seller—I asked for my money back—then Wilson said I had bought the horse, and it was my property—Quint had taken no part in the transaction up to that time—I had no reason to believe he was known to the other two men until I showed him the receipt—I thought his name was Davis, and that he was an old fellow servant of twenty years back—when I showed him the receipt he sidled up to the other party, and said I had bought the horse fair and square—I said to Quint, "It looks to me as though you belong to the same party"—when I found I could not get my money back I gave Wilson and West into custody—Clancy was on duty outside—on the way to the station West turned and said to me, "Davis will give you your £5; what more do you want? You will only get into serious trouble with your master"—I understood he meant Quint by Davis; I had applied the name Davis to him, and he answered to it—he was following us to the station—Howlett said to Quint, "You come up in front, I will take charge of you," and he was taken in charge—I valued the horse at about £15—I parted with my £5 because Wilson was going to give me £2 for my trouble, because he would not take the other man's money—I believed their statement that West wanted to buy it; he distinctly said he wanted to send it away next morning—since the charge has been under investigation a man came to me at the Police-court, and I received from him £5—he said something to me—I never saw him before.</p>

My employer's horses were sold by auction—I cannot tell who were present—when they were sold, someone there said, "Well, they have fetched all they are worth"—I said, "I thought they would have fetched another £50"—I do not think the boy in charge of the horse was so big or old as Harry Flaxen; he was quite a lad—the boy in charge of the horse at Trevor Square was a boy who took the horse to the station, and he gave his name and address to the police; I should not like to swear Flaxen is not the person—I think West trotted the horse up once or twice—I did not say I thought he was worth £30; I said I thought he was a useful tradesman's van horse—I told the Magistrate I thought the horse was worth £14; I may have said £20, but my valuation was £14—I gave the name of Davis to Quint—I said to Wilson, "You consented to let me have the horse for £5 deposit for a month on trial; I did not give security"—I did not say to. the Magistrate," When I threatened to knock it out of Wilson, I ran out to the boy holding the horse, and said, ‘The horse is mine; I have bought it'"—we all went out together—I might have said, "The horse is mine" in a way to blind the boy—it was understood the horse was not to be mine—the boy led the horse to the station, and gave his name and address—I have got my £5; and the police, who sold the horse at Aldridge's, have got the price of it.</p>

It was about three-quarters of an hour from the time I first went to the Packenham and saw Wilson, to the time I went to Trevor Square with the money from my lodgings—during that time I was in West's and Wilson's company, talking about the transaction—I regarded Wilson as the chief man in the transaction—I did not give Quint into custody; Howlett did—I complained about West and Wilson—I never said a word to Quint, nor he to me, before I parted with my £5—I said before the Magistrate, "West said to me," You had better take your £5, or you will get yourself into trouble with your master'"—I only had £l on me, and they would not have that, and I went to Tattersall's to get my horse clothing, and then the £5 was mentioned—Quint had nothing to do with buying the horse.</p>

On 28th April I was on duty in uniform near Tattersall's, about 5.45, when Beazer spoke to me—Wilson and West were near, and could hear—Beazer said, "Policeman, these men are trying to do me out of £5"—before he could make his statement to me Wilson took him into the Trevor—West stopped behind and said, "Get that fellow away, and I will give you a bit of silver for your trouble"—I refused to take it, and informed Sergeant Howlett about it—the horse was standing outside the Trevor, a lad was holding it—we called the prisoner outside the Trevor, Beazer followed, and I asked him to state the whole case in his presence—he said Wilson asked him if he understood anything about horses, as he wanted to buy one from West; he said he did understand about horses, and he asked him to judge, and he (Wilson) would give him something for his trouble—I understood from Beazer that Wilson wanted to buy the horse from West—he said Wilson said, "I am a religious, conscientious man; I don't want to have anything to do with that man; if you pay the £5 deposit the money shall pass through your hands, and you can deduct it out of it"—he said he wanted his money, and could not get it; that he gave him a receipt—Beazer said Wilson asked him to try and beat West down in price—I took Wilson and West into custody—on the way to the station I looked back and saw West hand some money to Quint, who was walking alongside of him; I could not see what money it was; I could hear it jingle—that was the first time I noticed Quint—I heard Quint say to Beazer, "You had better take your £5 back, unless you want to get into trouble with your master"—I was walking with Wilson, and Howlett was behind with West—another constable came up afterwards, and we took Quint into custody—Wilson said, "You have bought the horse; what more do you want? You have got your receipt," and Beazer produced this receipt—at the station I searched Wilson, and found £6 10s. in gold, 7s. in silver, and 9d. bronze—West gave an address—Wilson made a statement to the Magistrate that Beazer bought the horse from him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). In May last, in consequence of directions, in company with Sergeant Mellow I kept observation on Messrs. Carter's premises in Holborn—on May 24th, about ten a.m., I saw a van back into the yard; it had written on it" W. Watson, Waste Paper Merchant, Sancroft Street, Kennington, and Tiverton Street, Newington Causeway," and the name was on the front—I did not then know the man who was driving it, but I have since ascertained that his name was Aldred—I saw a number of sacks put into the van by Ross and Martin and Harvey—they brought the sacks from the left-hand door</p>

               <p>leading to the warehouse—the van was then driven into Queen's Head Yard, Queen Street, High Holborn, with about twelve sacks in it—when it arrived at Queen's Head Yard Aldred opened eight sacks, and emptied their contents into the body of the van—they contained empty sacks—Ross afterwards returned to Carter's warehouse, and after that he returned again with the man Martin, and they spoke to Aldred, and then all three went into the Running Horse public-house, and I followed them in—I then saw them come out, and Martin and Ross left and went back to the warehouse—Mellow and I followed the van to Sancroft Street—it stopped at a waste paper warehouse in Sancroft Street, belonging to a firm named Watson—Aldred then partly unloaded the van that he had received from a printer's, and then he opened another sack and took a very large rope from it, and he showed it to some person at the warehouse—I then followed the van to the Railway Arches in Tiverton Street—there is a warehouse there, belonging to Watson—the van was then unloaded, and the sacks thrown out and taken to the warehouse; I counted 140 empty sacks—on Thursday morning, 12th June, I was again watching with Sergeant Mellow, and between ten and eleven I saw a van driven by Aldred back into the yard, and load—I saw Ross there, but I could not see the other manit was loaded with a large number of sacks, containing something, but none of them were full, and some were nearly empty—the van was then taken to Sancroft Street by Aldred—but before it went back I saw it go to Queen's Head Yard, and I saw Ross there, and they went to the Running Horse—the van' was unloaded in Sancroft Street, and I counted eighty-four sacks removed from it, and taken to the warehouse—on the same evening I was in Holborn with Mellow about 5.30, and saw Ross with Harvey and Martin—they went into the Roebuck public-house—Mellow and I remained outside—on Wednesday morning, 25th June, I again kept observation on the premises with Mellow, and about the same time as before—I saw Aldred back his van into their yard, and Ross and Harvey unloaded the van containing four very large bales—Ross and Aldred then went into the George public-house, Queen Street—I was standing just outside the door—I saw them come out, and Ross was looking at some money in his hand, which he put in his pocket—I followed the van to Sancroft Street first, where they took out some bales that they had received from another place—I then followed it to Tiverton Street, and Aldred unloaded it; after the bags were taken out they were taken to the forecourt leading to the warehouse, where a man named Hurst took a knife and cut the ties—I then saw they contained empty sacks—I had not an opportunity of counting them then—they were folded, and made up into dozens—I then went into the warehouse and saw Rossiter—about twenty minutes after that I went into the house and saw Ross—during that time I was finding another policeman—I made inquiries for Watson; I believe I saw him, but I did not know him—I could not obtain any information—about an hour after I saw him in Sancroft Street, where I arrested him—I told him he had better come to Bow Street and explain the matter, and he said he would go with me—I took him into the back yard, and said, "What about those sacks?"—I can't remember all that passed from memory—about ten minutes after I made a note of what took place—he said, "I received instructtions to clear, and I sent this morning, and this is what they sent"—I asked him if he had anything else on his premises that belonged</p>

               <p>to Carter's—he said, I have not"—I said, "Have you any entries in your books to show your dealings with Carter and Co. during the past three months?" he said, "No, I don't think I have. I saw Mr. Rossiter, and told him to put the labels on and send them back. We have the paper in them, and the empties are returned"—I asked him if he had any invoice during the past three months; he said, "No, I have not, and I have been grumbling about it"—he was shortly after charged—Mellow arrested Aldred—I saw him at Bow Street; he spoke to Mr. Conquest and myself—I administered the usual caution, and then took down his statement; I then told Watson that Aldred had made a statement, and read it to him—his statement was: "Mr. Watson told me to go to Carter's and see Mr. Boss, and Watson said, ‘He will load you up;' Watson gave me 18s. to give to Mr. Boss, and I gave it to him at the public house in Queen Street. I have been down Queen's Head Yard, and he (Ross) has come to me and asked me to come over of a night and take these things away, but I told him I could not do it of a night. I know it was not paper that I was bringing away, for I have brought away bags with the paper inside as well. I am only Watson's servant, and he sends me for these things, and gives me money to give Ross, which I have done about twenty times, from ten shillings to twenty-five shillings. There are three at Carter's that have had money from me; that is Ross, and two other tall chaps that were with him"—Watson then said, "I gave him money to pay Ross for what he sent; it is the usual thing in our business to give the carman the money to pay when he receives the goods. The price to pay for waste paper is one shilling and three pence per hundredweight"—the same day I visited the Bancroft Street warehouse with Mellow and Mr. Wallace, and there I found thirty-five sacks of mixed sizes—on the 25th I tried to get into the Bancroft Street premises, but failing, I applied, on the 26th, for a search warrant, and searched the premises with Sergeant Mellow and Mr. Wallace.</p>

ROSS</hi> was not present when I read Aldred's statement to Watson, and it did not occur to me that it would be fair to read it to him—the entrance to Carter's premises is down a long passage that backs into Whetstone Park—Watson's vans were loaded in the morning, and it got the only way it could to the warehouse—the third time I went there to watch there were three men there—on, the first occasion Harvey and Martin were also charged with Aldred and Hurst by Carter's, and all four were discharged by the Magistrate Carter's preferred a second charge against Martin, Harvey, and Ross for stealing a bag of mixed seeds—I was present at the time—when I was watching the premises I did not know that Watson and his father had been in the habit of buying old sacks of Carter's, so of course seeing old sacks go away I thought it was wrong—when the van was there were other <hi rend="italic">employes</hi> about engaged in their work—the sacks appeared rather heavy, as they were loaded, but on 12th June they were very light—they were carrying three or four at once—on the 24th only four sacks were put into the van—on both occasions I saw waste paper sticking out of them—the sacks I saw at Watson's also had a few bits left in them after they were emptied—it did not strike me that the money Ross had in his hand might have been change from paying for his beer—I arrested Ross on the 25th, after Watson had been arrested</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189007280064"/>
               <p>—I said, "I am a police officer, and I take you into custody for being concerned with others in stealing a number of sacks"—he said, "I do not understand you, I should like the matter fully explained"—I said it would be explained at Bow Street Station—that I had seen a number of sacks go away from Carter's in his van, and he would be charged with stealing them.</p>

Watson" on it—Watson gave me his name as Thomas; he was always called Thomas—I have seen the van since—I have not taken particular notice of it, but I know it has been done up—I do not know anything about the photograph—I followed the van to Watson's warehouse in Tiverton Street—I saw the sacks thrown out, and could count them up to one hundred and forty—it was in the open street—there were others walking about besides myself—there was waste paper in all the sacks—on 25th June the empty sacks were inside the others when I saw them first—I went down the street and came up again—I found a label on the top, "Return empties to Carter's, by Carter Paterson"—Watson came to me at Sancroft Street—when I searched the premises I found thirty-five sacks—they are all here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know what the marks are on them—they are used for barley or grain, I think—there are different kinds of sacks—whether the sacks had been there before June or after I could not tell—some of those found in Sancroft Street had waste paper in them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general manager at Messrs.

"Accepted by Sharman, 19112,88"—since then nothing has occurred to require the removal of anything like that number of sacks—I have seen some of the sacks taken at Tiverton Street on 25th June—I should not describe them as old junk or old sacks—they would be serviceable in" our business—the canvas bags would not be used to remove waste paper—I have seen them, and identify them as ours—they are in good condition.</p>

It was not Ross's duty to turn out every sack of waste paper and examine it before it went away, but he was foreman of the department, and was held responsible—it may be taken down in one sack and shot into another—Ross did not do that, but it was done in his department—he was the foreman of the retail agricultural department, and was responsible for the waste paper being got rid of at the proper time—it would depend upon how much had accumulated whether it was cleared three times in three weeks, and upon whether he chose to send away half a load or a quarter of a load—Messrs. Carter do not object to the place being kept tidy—the sacks of waste paper are sent down the lift to the basement—the bales of sacks are sent to one part of the ground floor—the waste paper is taken away from the ground floor, it has to be taken up before it is delivered—when I once saw some sacks on the ground floor they were in a passage where new sacks are kept—when the old sacks have been cleaned they go to another part of the same floor—they are stacked up in a passage in another wing of the building, not near the lift—it is nearer where the sacks would be brought up from the basement if they were carried up the stairs—supposing some bags were carried up the stairs, I do not think that would account for where I saw them; it would be a very inconvenient place to put them—I cannot say that this is our string, but it is similar to it—December is the last entry Lean find of Ross accounting for waste paper—I saw waste paper go away on May 24th—I asked Ross if he had had the money for it, and if he had it, to hand the money over to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi>. We generally sent damaged sacks to the farm—I said before the Magistrate, "In old days the damaged and old sacks were kept and sold"; that was prior to 1885—we sent. them down to our farm in Essex—when string cuttings or waste paper, or waste was sent to Watson's from Carter's, a large number of bags had to be returned; as many as eighty-three—Messrs. Watson might have eighty of our sacks on their premises to be returned, not 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was watching for the purpose of detection—the sacks to be cleaned would go to the other side; the sacks containing other sacks to clean would go to the other side of the warehouse—I found here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a model</hi>) what I ought to have found here—two of these accounts are in 1889, 22nd February and 26th July—with the exception of those two there is no record of waste paper sent to Watson's in 1889.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189007280068"/>
               <p>—since December last no transactions of any kind have taken place as to waste paper—I had confidence in Boss—I went to Tiverton Street—I examined the sacks found—I found several with a certain mark on them, three of which left our premises since March this year—I see no mark on this lot of sacks, I identify them by the stripes—I have found this private mark on other sacks which have been recovered; I recognise the seas the sacks I marked; they are the sacks sent on the 25th.</p>

Carter—on 24th May I saw a van back into the premises, and saw it loaded—I know Marks, who works under Boss, and saw him doing something—I saw bales containing sacks; I cannot say in what part of the van they were placed—on 12th June I again saw a van loaded, and noticed the bales or bags, they were small; they contained about a bushel of waste paper in an eight-bushel bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head warehouseman at Messrs. Carter's—on 11th June I received instructions from Mr. Sherman, and kept observations on Mr. Bowler—I marked certain sacks in the basement which Ross had the control of, some of which contained empty sacks—I marked some on June 13th—on 25th June I saw a van outside the warehouse, and saw it back into the yard—I noticed some of the sacks I had marked on that floor in the passage; after the van had moved out of the yard I looked for the sacks, and each had gone; the same evening I was shown 132 sacks at the Police-station, and identified some of them—I went to Bancroft Street, and assisted in searching the premises, and found other sacks there belonging to Messrs. Carter—I have been in the force twenty years.</p>

I was in the employ of Mr. Watson, who died in January—up to that time young Mr. Watson had nothing to do with the business—this bale, found under a desk in the counting-house in Tiverton Street, had been there twelve months; it was there during the life of the elder Mr. Watson—I went away about the end of July last year on a tour with Mr. Watson—we were away nine or ten days, and came back towards the middle of August, and he was sent to Brighton to finish the holidays with his father and mother—I swear that this bale was under the desk at that time—I remember some sacks coming on 25th June, which were afterwards labelled—Mr. Watson and his clerk went out about 11.30, and the van came home with some sacks; our carman shot them down, and they were left on the pavement, so that anyone passing would have to walk over them—Mr. Watson came home about 11.30 and said, "Where have those bags come from?"—I said, "I do not know; I will call the carman down"—I did so, and he said, "I cannot receive them; Mr. Rossiter must put a label on them, and send them back"—which Mr. Rossiter did.</p>

I told her I had no money, and took a ring off my finger and gave it to her for it.

I did live at 123, Great Titchfield Street, with the deceased, and had done so seven years and a half—I know the prisoner; he was a friend of my husband—I also knew Dupois, who lived with him—she came to my house in May for two days—she after a wards came again, and stayed one night—she was at my house on 7th June; she had dinner with me, and stayed there in the afternoon—After dinner my husband called me up, and we all three looked out of the doorway—the prisoner passed with a bag in his hand, along Clipstone Street—as he passed he looked towards us, and I and Dupois went downstairs—my husband was then at the corner with Clements, who helped to move a bedstead and washstand to Mr. Clark's in the Euston Road—I afterwards heard a knock at the door; I looked up and saw the prisoner; I heard him say to my husband, "I want to speak to my wife or you"—De Grave said he did not know where his wife was—the prisoner said, "Well, take this bag and come round the corner, I want to speak to you"—I went to the door, and said to my husband, "Francis, don't go, he has the revolver!"—I said that from what I had heard—my husband said, "I am not frightened"—they spoke in Flemish, not in English—they then walked away together towards Bolsover Street—I followed, with Clements by the side of me—when they got to Bolsover Street, I said to De Grave, "Don't go any further, he has a revolver"—he asked the prisoner if he had the revolver, and he said, "No, my boy, I have not got the revolver"—he said, "If you have got a revolver I will give you in charge to the first constable I meet"—the prisoner said, "Before you do that you will be a dead man," and he distinctly put his hand in his outside pocket and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> the revolver, and then fired; Francis fell, and the prisoner ran away—at the time he fired he had nothing in his hand except the revolver—he ran away with it in his hand; I followed him to the corner of Great Portland Street—I then fell—I was picked up by two women and taken back—after I went back I heard him shoot again—I stayed with my husband, and was with him when he died next day at the hospital.</p>

I live in Short's Gardens, Drury Lane, and am a porter—on Saturday, June 7th, I was assisting the deceased, and about half-past five I was with him in Clipstone Street—he left me and went back to his house in Titchfield Street, and after that I saw him and the prisoner come out of Titchfield Street into Clipstone Street together, in conversation—the deceased was carrying a bag—they crossed over to Bolsover Street—I walked behind them; De Grave passed me the bag behind him—Mrs. De Grave was behind me—she said, "Come away, Francis, he has got a pistol in his pocket"—I did not hear what the deceased said; I was not taking any notice—they stopped, I passed the bag behind me, and it was taken by the wife—at the same moment as De Grave gave me the bag, he turned to confront the prisoner, and the instant he did so the prisoner's arm moved in this fashion (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—the elbow was visible from behind—it had been straight down; it moved like that, and the discharge went off; I heard the report immediately—they were too close together for me to see anything in his hand; I was on the prisoner's left, exactly behind the deceased—when he turned to confront the prisoner we were all close together; I was one step from the prisoner—he was on the kerbstone, and the deceased was on the pavement; he turned to confront the prisoner immediately he gave me the bag, and the instant he did so the discharge went off, and the deceased instantly fell on his right side—they were very close together at the time when I heard the shot—when the deceased fell, the prisoner stepped one pace into the road, and instantly ran away towards Carburton Street; I followed, calling out that he had shot a man—when he got into Great Portland Street, a young man</p>

On 7th June, about six, I went to the Middlesex Hospital, and there saw the prisoner—he was having a wound in his forehead dressed—I had him taken to the Police station, and I there charged him with feloniously shooting De Grave, and attempting to murder him—at that time the man was not dead—I had had some description of what had taken place—after entering the charge I said to the prisoner, "The inspector who has taken down the charge will read it slowly to you in English; if there is anything you do not understand I will endeavour to explain it to you in French; you are not obliged to say anything, but if you do it will be taken down, and may be given in evidence"—I then proceeded to explain the charge to him—the inspector read the charge—the first charge was for shooting at the prosecutor—there was a second charge for shooting at Clements—the prisoner asked for an explanation of that, and said, "I never saw him, I never shoot at</p>

               <p>him, that is not fair; for Mr. Francis I make not a murder, I go so (placing his hand towards his coat pocket), in the other hand I got a basket; Francois saw me and said to me, 'You got a revolver,' and I said, 'Well, that is nothing to do with you, you have not seen the revolver.' I went to go to Portland Street Station, Francois wanted to take the revolver; I took my hand out of my pocket, with the revolver in it; somebody struck me, and Francois want, to take the revolver; then I shout, 'Got away,' and I don't know how it hit Francois; I ran away; then at the corner of Great Portland Street two or three gentlemen caught me; one took the revolver and I loose shot towards the floor"—I took down that statement, word for word as he spoke it—next day I went to the Middlesex Hospital—the prisoner was there at the bedside of the dying man—I said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "Do you know that you are dying, and without hope of recovery?"—he said, "Yes, yes"—I then said, "What do you wish to tell me?" and word for word, as he said it, I took down his statement—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "He came round to my place twice; the second time I asked him what he wanted round my place. He said, 'Come round the corner; I want you.' When we were round the corner I said, 'You have the revolver with you, have you not? I will wait till I meet the first policeman, and give you in charge.' He said, 'You never will have the chance; before ever you meet a policeman it is all over with you'; and then he shot me, and he ran away after. He has been a vagabond all his lifetime; it is not the first time"—he then ceased speaking, and seemed faint and weak—I asked him, "When he fired, could you see he fired at you intentionally?"—he gave no coherent answer; he died within four minutes of that time; but from the few words I did hear, the impression was conveyed to me that he intended me to understand that he could not say whether or not the act was intentional; he could not see—the question was, "Could he see?" and he began to turn his head, and said, "He took the revolver," then paused, and said, "Pocket," and he died almost immediately—Mrs. De Grave was there—the prisoner was then taken to the Police-station, and charged with murder—he said, "Yes, he is dead; I see it"; that was all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is but one answer there; the other is straightforward—I am quite positive the words, "He has been a vagabond all his life," did not come after my question, "Did you see whether the revolver was fired intentionally? because I have it here word for word as he said it; it was after he said that that I put the question to him—he spoke to Mrs. De Grave after that—I did not hear what he said—it was some expression of affection—the prisoner had but little opportunity of putting any question to him; he expressed no wish; he simply stood with tears going down his face—he had no opportunity of putting any question, except by interrupting him—when I asked if he could see whether the revolver was fired intentionally? his answer was that he could not—the prisoner's statement to me was in broken English, there was no French or Flemish among it—I have only one Flemish word in the whole lot, "1 wit" for "with"—he used the expression "basket"—I do not know of the prisoner having been employed at Amart's, or of his wife going away with another man, and his losing his situation in consequence.</p>

I examined the prisoner's room; it was furnished as a bed and sitting room—it was unlocked for me by the barber—the foot of the bed was just inside the door, and one side of it was against the wall—it was an iron bedstead; the posts were about three feet high, and the tops of them were unprotected by knobs; the upper parts were about two inches long—at the foot of one of the posts there was a pool of blood—I examined the posts carefully, and there was no blood on them—I do not know whether anybody had been sitting on the bed; it was very badly made, and looked as if somebody had been on it—I found this hammer between the sheets; a rug, a blanket, and a sheet were over it—the bedclothes were not turned down; they had been roughly thrown back towards the pillows, as if an attempt had been made to make the bed—there did not appear any deliberate attempt to conceal the hammer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sculptor, of 13, Robert Street, Hampstead Road—on Saturday night, 21st June, I went to the King's Head, at the corner of Euston Road and Hampstead Road, about a quarter to twelve o'clock—I was quite sober—I had one glass there, and while drinking it the female prisoner entered the bar and asked me to stand her a drink, and I gave her two-pennyworth or three-pennyworth of whisky—when the house closed I was going home; she clung to me, and begged me to go home with her, as she was very hard up—I had only nine or ten shillings, and did not care to go home with her, but after much pressure I did so—she took me to 13, Tolmer's Square, close by, about two minutes' walk—she opened the front door with a key, lit a candle, and showed me up to the second floor front room—I saw no one else—she locked the door after I got in, and I gave her between eight and nine shillings, as I had agreed—she put the key in her pocket, but a minute or two afterwards she unlocked the door and admitted the two male prisoners—Hermann took off his coat and sat down, and Davenport came up to me in a menacing manner, and asked me to give him some money; he gave me a push with his arm—I moved towards the door, but he pushed me back into the room, and asked for money several times—I said, "All I have I have given to the young woman here"—he said, "Then leave something with us, and you can redeem it to-morrow when you have got the money"—I said I should not—I had a gold ring on my finger—he then dealt me a fearful blow on my left ear like the kick of a horse, I think he had something hard in his hand; it cut through my ear and made a scar behind—before I had time to recover, he dealt me another fearful blow over the left eye with his hand, that cut like a knife, and the blood spurted out and ran down my face into my left eye, so that I could not see—I seized a chair and broke the whole of the window out, and screamed, "Murder" and "Police"—while I was doing that, Davenport took up a poker and made a number of blows at my head with it—I held the chair in front of my face, and the bending of the poker is, I think, due to its knocking the leg of the chair—I had a number of blows on my head, and he struck the last blow on my elbow, just as I was holding the chair up—that made me drop the chair—I heard the police-whistle in the square, and the three prisoners ran to the door, which was locked—Hermann did not do anything; he was sitting on the bed, and the Woman on a couch—I saw the door unlocked, and they got away, and the next thing I saw was a constable in the room—I did not lose consciousness; I was taken to the hospital, and, under anaesthetics, an operation was performed on my., left arm—I was four weeks and three days in the hospital, and attend there daily now—my arm is still in splints and bandages, and I suffer much pain at times—I do not expect to have the use of it again—I cannot sleep as I did before.</p>

I cannot say whether Hermann spoke; my attention was too much engaged—he did nothing beyond sitting on the bed, but at last he got up and stood near Davenport—the contest occurred at the extreme end of the room—there was a lamp on the table between where I stood and the bed.</p>

I am a widower—the King's Head public-house is near my studio—the female prisoner did not tell me she was a married woman, or I should have cut her dead—I had not imbibed a quantity of drink; I was not at all tipsy, or I could not have defended myself—the public-house closed at twelve o'clock, and I had been there a quarter of an hour before—I was alone—she did not tell me in the public-house that she was a married woman, nor did I insist on following her home—I was not drunk, and I could not possibly force myself up a flight of stairs which I had never seen.</p>

The only instrument I saw in Davenport's hands was the poker—I had one glass myself, and one with the woman—I only had two glasses since seven o'clock—I do not know whether the doctor smelt my breath—I broke the window after I had the second blow—I kept the chair between us, and he kept me constantly occupied by the blows with the poker—I never struck him, but I should have if I could—the room was about sixteen feet long by thirteen feet wide—there was a lamp on the table; it was not knocked over.</p>

On Sunday, 22nd June, about 1 a.m., I was in George Street, and heard shouts from Tolmer's Square—I went there and saw a female standing at the door of No. 18—I do not think it was the female prisoner—she said, "It's all right, constable, there is a row between a man and his wife"—not feeling satisfied, I knocked at the door again, and after knocking two or three times it was opened by a female partly undressed, not the female prisoner—I entered the hall, and the female prisoner passed me and went out of the house—I went upstairs and saw the two male prisoners half way up the flight of stairs leading from the ground floor to the first floor—Davenport said, "I am glad you have come, constable, the man that did it has gone into the kitchen"—I refused to let them pass, but Davenport rushed past me and went towards the front door, which was open—I detained Hermann, and called out to the crowd to stop Davenport—Hermann came down after me to the door, and I left him there—I went into the second floor front room and saw Winter on a couch, bleeding profusely from his head—his clothes were saturated with blood—I shouted for water, and some person came up and gave him some—I sent him to the hospital in a cab.</p>

On 22nd June, at 1.10 a.m., I was on my beat, and saw about twenty people outside 13, Tolmer's Square—Davenport was in the centre of them, and Andrews by his side—I went into the house, and saw Hermann in the w. c.—he had no waistcoat, collar, or tie on, and his coat was unbuttoned—I told him a man had been assaulted very seriously and taken to the hospital, and he would have</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at University College Hospital—on 22nd June, about 1.30 a.m., Winter was brought in—I found signs of haemorrhage, and streaks of blood across his face, and his hair was matted together with blood—I cut his hair short, and found a deep cut behind his left ear, going nearly through the ear, and on the left side of his head, rather above the ear, three deep cuts, going almost to the bone, two of them about an inch long, and the third smaller; they were not clean cuts, they had irregular edges—they could have been inflicted with this poker, except the one behind the ear—a fist could have done it, struck hard—there were other cuts on the right side of his head of a similar nature, but smaller, and two bruises on his forehead, and a large bruise on his left temple—I found a compound fracture of his arm, communicating with the elbow joint, but no cut through the sleeve of his coat, shirt, or vest—there was a skin wound communicating with the fracture of the bone; that admitted air to the bone, which constituted danger—Mr. Heath came next morning, and performed an operation by uniting the bone with silver wire under ansesthetics—he was an in-patient three or four weeks, and is still attending almost daily—the wounds on his head have healed perfectly, but the wound on his elbow has not healed yet, and there is great stiffness of the arm—it is very doubtful whether he will have such a useful arm as he had before; it will be stiff for months, and probably for years.</p>

I shan't go home to-night. If I go any night, I won't go home to-night; I will think over it"—he said, "Do come home, and things will be all right again"—I said, "No, I will not go home to-night"—we came away, and father walked a little way behind us—my brother nudged me to look at a tram—while I looked at it the prisoner drew a razor across my throat—I only saw the glitter of the razor, as it dropped after that; I did not see what the prisoner did with it afterwards—I was taken to a doctor in the Stamford Road, and while I was there the prisoner was brought in—the doctor asked me whether it was with my consent or not; I said "No"—he said, "Who cut your throat; did you do it yourself?"—I said, "No, he did it."</p>

On the evening of 11th July I was on fixed point duty in Goldsmith Road, about 100 yards from the place of the accident—I received information, and went to the hospital, where I saw the prisoner—he was drunk—he was very insolent and abusive to me, and to the people at the hospital and others—I asked him where the child was—he said it was taken upstairs—he said, "I don't want to stop here all the b——y night; I want to get home; I have a long way to go"—I said I should detain him as long as I wanted him—I had to get the names and addresses of witnesses—I told him it was not laughing matter—he was laughing, and his mate with him—they were both detained at the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ryan was the worse for drink—I let him drive the dray away—the prisoner used other bad expressions—I told him I should take him into custody for being drunk and running over the child—he was examined an hour afterwards by a divisional surgeon, who is not here—I am a judge of sobriety—I should say the signature to this receipt was that of a sober man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Children's Hospital, Hackney Road—on the evening of the 11th July I saw the child when it was brought to the hospital—it was suffering from shock—several rlbs were broken, and there was bleeding from the lungs internally—I saw the prisoner in the casualty room—in my opinion he was under the influence of alcohol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him after the child had been in the hospital ten minutes—I made no examination of him—I asked if he knew now the accident happened; he said he did not—I do not think that what I saw in him was the result of excitement and nervousness—I should expect that if a man were considerably under the influence of liquor it would affect his writing—a man is sometimes drunk in the head and sober in his limbs, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>

               <p>one of their drays; about half-past six to half-past seven I and the prisoner were delivering beer at the Cobden Arms—he was sober; he started away first, and I followed him—when we got to Goldsmith Road I was in front—the prisoner turned down Audrey Street—I went straight on; I was then about twenty-five or thirty yards from his dray; I was at a walking pace, and he was following me—he did not turn down Audrey Street at a fast or reckless pace; it is a sharp incline, and you could not go very steady; but he had been walking behind me, and so he could not have been going very fast—I did not see what took place after the prisoner turned down Audrey Street.</p>

I am in the same employment as the prisoner—on 11th July, about ten or eleven, after breakfast (which we go to about eight and return from about nine), I went out with him on the dray, which he was driving—we had to deliver beer at three public-houses—the first delivery was about dinner-time, at Whitecross Street—we took a sandwich with us—the publican gave us half a pint each; they usually draw a pint pot about three-quarters full—we had nothing more there—we had six or seven pint pots about three parts full that day, I suppose—we had no more than usual; that is our usual quantity—we went to the Cobden Arms between six and half-past six, and were there about an hour—that was the last place we called at before the accident—I saw the prisoner sign this receipt there, and these are the receipts he signed at the other houses earlier in the day—we followed Harris in Goldsmith Road at a walking pace till we got to the corner, and then we turned to the right down Audrey Street—it was a four-wheeled dray—I was sitting between two barrels of beer at the side, looking to the side of the road—I heard the prisoner shout; I caught hold of the rail at the back of the dickey and pulled myself up, and saw the child a yard or so from the pavement, and not a foot and a half away from the horses' front legs—the prisoner pulled himself up as fast as he could, and asked me to catch hold of the reins as soon as he stopped them—he stopped them within the length of the dray I should say—I did not see Sparrowhawk, nor did I see the child pulled up—I saw the mother with the child in her arms—the prisoner jumped down as soon as he stopped—I did not get down; I drove the horses to the hospital, and then I got down—I saw</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The near horse walked faster than the other—we pulled up in about one length of the dray, which is twelve or fourteen feet—I did not see the child after it was knocked down till the mother had it—I did not see the horse knock it down—I could not see it before, because I had to jump on the dickey and catch hold of the reins—I did not see the man pick it up—the prisoner jumped off on the near-side—the prisoner is driver; he did not drive from the hospital because they kept him there—I have driven for seven years—you cannot pull up horses walking in less than a dray's length, if they have a load behind them, unless you did it wonderfully short; the prisoner pulled them up as short as any man could, I believe—to the best of my belief he was sober—the brake on the dray was on; it is one you use with your foot, and we always put it on going down an incline—the incline was rather sharp here—the prisoner put the brake on as he turned the corner—I saw him; you don't want to see it; you can hear it—I heard no shout by Sparrowhawk—I heard the brake before we got round the corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on 25th June the prosecutrix was brought to me; she had a cuff across the throat some three inches long, just nicking the cartilage of the air passage; it was not very deep—I don't think it was a dangerous wound—it could have been caused by this table-knife, on which there are marks that might be blood—there was a slight cut on her left cheek—she is entirely out of danger now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 21, Bermondsey Street, Borough—on Tuesday, 24th June, about a quarter past two, I was in bed asleep—I heard the breaking of a window in one of my rooms; I got up with my baby in my arms, and went to the door to see what it was—as I opened the street door the prisoner was outside with her husband and another woman—I asked her what she wanted—she made no reply to that, but said, "Now I have got you," she got hold of my hair and punched me in the face with her fist—her husband ran in the passage and struck me across the nose with something, and cut it open—I fell down insensible; I was kicked on the leg by the man; I was put in a cab and taken to the hospital—I could not see whether the prisoner was sober, it was all done so instantly—I know her by sight, but never had any quarrel with her; I can't assign any reason for doing this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The passage was not quite dark, there was a lamp opposite the street door—when the husband came forward the prisoner let go of my hair—I did not have any struggle with her—I had two bruises on my face from this; I could not say whether that was from what her husband did, or from what she did.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—about two in the morning I heard my wife scream; I went to the door and saw her lying on the stairs, bleeding from the nose—there were the prisoner and her husband and another woman at the front door; they said they would smash my b——face if I came to the door—a brick came in which caught my wife in the face—her husband threw one across the door, and I shut it—I gave the brick to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant W</hi>)<hi rend="italic">.</hi> On 6th June I was with other detectives—in consequence of a statement made to me I went to the shop of Mr. Collyer, a large tool maker in Oakley Street—I had conversation with him, and he showed me this large crowbar or <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—I watched the shop about—about 8.20 or 8.30, I saw the prisoner come to the shop and received this jemmy—he examined it, and complimented young Mr. Collyer on the make, and then took two sheets of brown paper, and string out of his pocket, and wrapped them round it, and tied it—he put it under his arm and went out of the shop, and lit his pipe or cigarette—he went into the Westminster Road, to the junction where Kennington Road joins Westminster Road, and he stood behind the fire escape box—ultimately he got on the outside of a tramcar—I, Ward, and White got inside the car at different points, we were all in plain clothes—he rode to the corner of Brixton Road, where St. Mark's Church, Kennington, stands—he got out, and got on the outside of an omnibus</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189007280107"/>
               <p>—we got inside—he rode to Clapham Road Railway station—he went in and out of the crowd waiting there to see the people come home from the Oaks—he went into the booking-office and out again, and round through the passage, and eventually he took this ticket to Walworth, which was back in the direction from which he came—he went on to the platform, and I and the officers went up, too—he waited during the arrival and departure of two trains; then he came downstairs into the booking-office and waited a few minutes, and then went onto the platform again, and to the extreme end of it—a luggage train was approaching, and when it was fifty or eighty yards away he jumped off the platform in front of the train—Sergeant Ward, who was near to him, jumped after him—I managed to catch hold of him, but he broke away from me—he threw this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> away; his hat fell off—I ran after him down the line, I daresay 100 or 150 yards—he found we were gaining on him, and he ran up the embankment, and climbed an open wood fence, eight or nine feet high—in turning off the line, I caught my foot in the signal wires and fell—Ward and White got over the fence—I got up and walked lower down to find a low part of the fence, and then I could hear by the shout that he had been captured—I walked back and inquired for the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a porter handed it and the hat to me—I went to Clapham Police-station, where I saw both the officers and the prisoner and an inspector—I said to the prisoner, "I have got what you threw away; what were you going to do with it? How do you account for having it in your possession?"—he said, "I know nothing; what do you think?"—I have been a smith, and know something about these implements—the difference between this and an ordinary crowbar is that this is corrugated, and much thicker and stronger in the shoulders here, and it is much heavier—I have not seen one like it before—I am sure it was after 9.10 when the prisoner jumped onto and ran along the line—it was six or seven minutes past nine when he was in the booking office—he ran towards the train, and then turned into the four-foot way, and crossed onto the other line; a train was due in that direction—we did not take him sooner because we wished to find where he was going to.</p>

I corroborate Boswall's evidence—I looked at the time when the prisoner jumped off the platform in front of an approaching train; it was 9.13—I jumped after him, and caught hold of him by the back of his necktie; he left it in my had, broke away, and ran along the four-foot way in an opposite direction to the train; then he veered off to the left, up the railway embankment, and over the fence, nine or ten feet high; I and White followed—he got into one of the gardens at lie rear of Manor Road, and went from garden to garden for seventeen gardens, jumping the fences in a very clever manner—we followed, and White succeeded in running him down, and had a severe struggle with him, and got on top of him and held him down—immediately I came up, he said, "I surrender"—we were all very much exhausted, and could not speak for some minutes—I said, "How do you account for this business, and the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> you have thrown, away on the line?"—he said, "I know nothing; you will have to find out"—he was taken to the station and charged—in answer he said, "I know nothing; you will have to find out"—he also said, "I refuse to give my name and address"—I call this instrument a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>; it is the largest I ever saw; it is made of the best tempered steel, expressly for</p>
