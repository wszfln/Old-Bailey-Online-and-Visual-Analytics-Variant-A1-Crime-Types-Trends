               <p>I am the mother of the last witness; I slept in the house this night and I came down between five and six in the morning, and when I came down I went to open the kitchen door and it was locked, and I went across the road to Mr. Harris for the key; I knew that he layed there that night, and that he had gone across the road, I stopped there, it may be twenty minutes or half an hour, and when I came back again with the key in my hand, Mr. Harris was with me, I saw this girl coming out of this house very fast with a bundle, and I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300004"/>hold of her arm and asked her where she had been? When I went out in the morning I left the kitchen door locked and the street door on the latch; I went out at the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street door left open by Mr. Harris? - I cannot tell what he did, but I found the kitchen door locked and the street door on the latch, I came back with Mr. Harris with the key of the kitchen door in my hand; then I saw this girl running out of the street door of the house, she said, will you buy a bit of edging? I said let me look at it, and I saw this here apron hanging out of her lap on one side, and I said what have got here? she made no answer to that, I said you have got some of our property here, directly I took hold of her and we found the lock was taken off the kitchen door and the door was wide open; the lock was not quite off but loose.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went over the way for the key, as you was in the house, could you not get into the kitchen without going over to Mr. Harris? - No, I could not; how could I get in without the key?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the kitchen door before you went out that morning? - Yes, I went to get into the kitchen in the first place.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this kitchen door look into the passage, or is it an inside door? - It is a door inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other door to the passage? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door to the passage locked or unlocked? - I cannot say, the door that was broke open was an inner kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to this kitchen door before you went out was it light or not? - It was light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that door was locked? - I know it was fast, but when I returned it was quite open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these articles taken from the girl? - I do; I am sure the shoes laid on the window the night before; the apron is my son's wife's, but I had washed it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them all to belong to the prosecutor? - I am positively sure of it, the apron has aquasortis on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the lock when you came back? - It was forced open, and from the force of the lock the window was broke; there is half a glass window to the kitchen door.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw these boots? - On Wednesday afternoon, I saw them in the window, I left him sitting in the shop till I returned from putting a letter in the post office; when I returned I found my shop door open, and my boots taken out, I had seen him frequently before, I have known him for many years; the boots are here.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I have got the things here, they are sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take these sheets of? - I believe the prisoner at the bar, but I cannot positively swear to her person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when? - The 27th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pawn them in her own name? - She pawned them in the name of Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing else of her? - Nothing but these two sheets.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Beston. I know one of these sheets was in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The person that I lived with was to me as a mistress, I was learning her business of her; I never pledged these things, but on Friday before Michaelmas the woman gave me these two tickets, and desired I would keep them till she called on me for them.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker's wife where the man came to sell the spoon; the prisoner was the person, he came to me I believe on the 14th of September on Saturday morning; the spoon being defaced, and the arms being endeavoured to be taken out, I thought it was stole, and I stopped the spoon and the prisoner; I sent for an officer from Bow-street, and had him taken to Bow-street; and I saw this gentleman's carriage come to Bow-street, and I saw the same arms on the carriage as on the spoons, although it was defaced.</p>
               <p>Willymott. I believe this to be my spoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth to Davis. Was that the article the prisoner brought to you? - Yes, it was doubled together that I might not see what arms was on them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it gave you the suspicion? - By this being defaced, and being bruised in the manner it was. The woman that lives with the prisoner brought the bowl of the spoon the evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced the bowl of the spoon? - No, I have not, I produce only what the man brought; if you can find a bowl to that then I produce a bowl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any questions to him? - I did, I desired him to come into the parlour, and asked him how he came by it? he said it was given him. When Treadway came I desired him to speak the truth, he said he found it in a cess pool; I then asked him how he came to get the arms out? he would not make me any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth to Willymott. Do you know this spoon to be your property? - I have more of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear to this being your property? - I can.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you say to the man? - After I had asked her what she had to say, she said he had given her thirteen or fourteen pieces of bandanno handkerchiefs, but he had only taken two of them from me, the remainder he had bought in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman or the man say any thing else? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you then say, Mr. Peltrau, that there was any property of your's missing? - I could not discover it till we had taken stock.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say that there are some missing that have not been sold? - Yes, I can, I examined every number and these were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him was in the custody of Armstrong I believe? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your partner seen him before that time? - No, he had not, he was taken to Mr. Legrew's house, it is in the way from her apartment to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Mr. Legrew had not seen him before you saw him? - I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you was examined twice, was it before the same magistrate or different? - It was before different magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation that you have stated to the court of both the prisoners, was it at the first examination or the second? - At the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if it was on the first examination, and not at the second, it would not appear here in this deposition? - I mentioned it myself in the second as well as the first.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you there? - About three months.

               <p>Q. How soon did you give the information against him? - I was taken up, and then I told all this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see your mistress do any thing to the handkerchiefs first before you went to pawn them? - I see her sometimes cut off the fag end, and sometimes I cut them off; when there was a fire I was to burn them, when there was no fire I was to chuck them down the necessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was taken up about some butter? - I was.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of you when you was taken up then? - I went along with a parcel more, and I was turned up.</p>
               <p>Q. What is being turned up? how long have you been acquainted with these terms? - The gentlemen discharged me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it for? - I was accused of a watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear that positively? - Yes, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive? - Because I latched it again; I saw the prisoner in my room, I did not see him open the door to come in; I looked through the parlour window, and when I saw him in the room I turned round and met him at the parlour door, and he had got my husband's blue coat, &amp;c. I hallooed stop thief! he ran out of the door before me, and was taken in less than four or five minutes, not more; my son followed him directly on my calling stop thief; I saw him try to fling some things over some pales into a garden, and they hitched on some of the pales on the top, and I went and took them immediately;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300018"/>I gave them to the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was going through St. Martin's-court, I heard this gentleman cry out stop thief! and with that he comes up to me and says, you have got my watch; I said I have not got the watch; I see a man run before me. He up with his hand and with his cane gave me a knock on the head; I said don't ill use me; and there was a parcel of people surrounding me, and I was taken to Bow-street; I have no witness to call. When they took me up to Bow-street, I says to the gentleman, I beg you will look to see if you have not got the watch, he said if I have got the watch, you must have played a slight of hand trick, accordingly he felt and he found he had got it in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they pass you and your wife? - No, they did not, but I thought they wanted to pass, they were in such a hurry. A gentleman came up and tapped me on the shoulder, he said sir, you have lost your pocket handkerchief; the gentleman's name is Joet. Sir, says I, if you have got any handkerchief it is not mine, because I have not pulled out my handkerchief; no, says he, the two men that past you have pulled it out of your pocket, and if you will go with me I will shew you the way they went. I went with him, they got into the next street from Wardour-street; they walked on very smart before us, and when they found that we walked on smart after them they began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the street? - Noel-street; they got into Wardour-street, and I bawled out stop thief! and I came up to the prisoner at the bar, and knocked him down at a building in Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it this man you knocked down or the other? - This is the man, the other got on before me, he made his escape, he was not taken at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on the prisoner? - I took my handkerchief from under his arm forcibly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your handkerchief? - A cotton one.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was your's? - It had three or four darns in it, and in taking it from him he tore it; I did miss such an handkerchief the very minute the young man spoke to me, I am sure it is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it in your pocket? - In Monmouth-street; he wanted me to let him go, and I said I would not, he turned about, and by the light of the lamp I see he

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him after that? - I did, he got away from me after that, he cut me before he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What street was this he cut you in? - Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him after you lost sight of him? - In a very few minutes, near Wardour-street, in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that was the same man? Was there other people in the public house? - Yes, there was many more; Mr. Johnson heard the word stop thief! and he pursued him as I am informed, and took the knife from him, and gave him to the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to the public house? - There was a man that came to Mr. O'Conner's, the apothecary, in Wardour-street; I was there to get my hand dressed.</p>

               <p>Q. Who came to you there? - I don't know. And he told me the prisoner was at the public house, and that I must come and make my appearance and know the man, or else the runners could not keep him, so I was obliged to run through the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the runners point him out or did you know him? - I knew him by his dress and appearance and being pock marked; I had had him by the light of a lamp that I could see him plain by.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time might there be between the time he cut you, and the time you saw him in the public house? - About five minutes. Then I went back to the apothecary, and got my hand dressed and stitched, and have been lame ever since; I have no doubt but that is the man that took the handkerchief from me, and that he cut me in my wrist.</p>

               <p>Court to O'Brian. Did you feel his hand in your pocket at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of being robbed at all? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt nothing about you to induce you to think you was robbed? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of this handkerchief be? - I gave three and sixpence, three and nine-pence halfpenny we call it, about seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Joet. I saw these men, the prisoner and the other man who is not here, who escaped, just coming behind O'Brian and I saw them keep looking back to see whether O'Brian noticed their having taken any thing from him, they had the handkerchief in their hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them? - I am not certain, but I think it was this man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them take it? - I did not; I went on making belief as if I did not notice them, then they crossed over the way, then I ran back and asked O'Brain whether he had lost his handkerchief? he felt in his pocket and found he had. so I went with him and went down Berwick-street and turned down Noel-street, and seeing this man and another before us, I said there were the men, just after I said so they set off running and turned round into Wardour-street, we caught this one just at the top of Wardour-street, O'Brian knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that you saw the prisoner and the other man with the handkerchief, till the time you saw him knocked down, was he out of your sight? - Yes, he was while I turned round to tell O'Brian.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him again? - In Noel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner, the man that was knocked down, is the same that was in Oxford-street passing the prosecutor? - Yes, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you got to Wardour-street? - I see him knocked down by O'Brian, the prisoner got up again, and O'Brian took the handkerchief from the prisoner after he was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing to O'Brian? - He cut his wrist, he made two attempts, he first cut his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the handkerchief? - O'Brian.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him, did he get away or did he not? - He cut him and then O'Brian was forced to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pursued by any other people? - I don't know who pursued him, he was pursued by other people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the witness whether he can swear which was the pocket that the handkerchief came from? - No, I did not see the robbery committed.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How many handkerchiefs did you find on him in the shop? - I did not find any in his pocket in the shop at all; I searched him when I saw him on producing the knife; he was not searched in the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to be searched in the shop? - The people of the shop turned him out, they would not let him stay there.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that the handkerchief you claimed was brought into the shop, is that true or false? - It was not so; I am sure that the handkerchief I found in the street was mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses at all.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did you take the handkerchiefs out of his pocket the corner of Queen-street? - I did, and one of them was what I lost; besides when he was lodged in the Compter he gave in his name, James Johnson.</p>

On the 20th of September, being informed I had lost some property of this sort I went and found it in my stable; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300027"/>two bags of raisins and several lumps of sugar; I then took them into my apron and carried them all home; they were there an hour and a half or more; my buyer who goes into the sugar market, he came home, and -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Don't tell us what your buyer said. - The man confessed himself that it was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Before his confession to you what did you say to him? did you advise him to confess the truth? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hint any advantage to him? - I did not promise him any thing. I said, when I found the goods, where did you have these from? Sir, says he, I will pay you for them all if you will be so good as to let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he first of all deny it, and then afterwards you threatened to send him to prison if he did not give an account of it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more but what he said? - There was a direction given him on the 19th, which I asked him what became of it, and that direction was found on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the key of this stable hang up in your shop? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not watching your key all the day? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body might have taken the key that was in your shop? - Undoubtedly; but there is nobody has any business there but the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that direction here that you spoke of? - The other evidence will bring it.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of last month I went to take in nine trusses of hay that came out of the country, and I went up into the hay loft, and I was looking and there, up in the corner, laid a parcel of white sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who put it there? - I do not; it was in the hay rick, up in the corner.</p>
               <p>- GOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of last month, when I came home there was in the counting house four pieces of sugar, and sixty-eight pounds of raisins in two bags which had been found; we agreed to put them where we found them; on the next day we found they were removed, and we had a constable and had the prisoner taken up, and we made a further search in the stable and searched under the manger, and there they were; we brought them home and found they were half of them gone; when I came home I told the prisoner at the bar, I was sorry for what he had done. I am clerk to Mr. Axford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a direction with these things in the stable? - There was a direction found before in the parcel, which I have got in my pocket; this direction was given him the day before to take out; it was found by Talbot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct the prisoner to carry the things according to that direction? - I left word for him to go according to that direction.</p>
               <p>Court to Talbot. Where did you find that direction? - In the bag where the plumbs were, which was found in the stable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you left the parcel on the counter before you took it out again? - Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was in when you left it on the counter you cannot tell? - No, but I know I took it out.</p>

               <p>I am the watchman. The prisoner past me on Friday night, or early on Saturday morning, between twelve and one, and she happened to have her apron full of bread; I asked her where she got it? She said over the way; I rather reflected on myself for letting her pass; so I followed her to the Queen's Head, the watering house, Bishopsgate-street, where she was talking to the waterman, and turning herself about I spies a pint pot stick out of her pocket; I said to the waterman, this woman is a pot stealer, for here is a pint pot sticking out of her pocket, and I took her to the watch-house strait, without ever letting her go away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had the pint pot out of his house full of beer, and I met a poor woman that was ill and wanted a coach, and had this bread to carry; I went to the coachman to speak to him, and this man, the watchman, came up, and he spoke something that I did not like; I spoke rough to him, I had the pint-pot by my side, intending to return it as soon as I got the poor woman into the coach; then he took me back to this man's house and he said he would have me transported if it cost him the bed from under him; I had been but one month up from Cambridge. The gentleman said, at my first hearing, that the pint pot was worth half a crown.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any silk of Messrs. Garsed and Co. on the 10th of September? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it after you received it? - I took it home in an handkerchief, it was not for me, it was for my sister; as I was coming along Lamb-street, I heard something of a whistling behind me which caused me to turn about; it was within a quarter to ten, or not quite too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pretty light night? - It was a pretty light night. When I got a little way down <placeName id="t17931030-27-crimeloc149">Wheeller-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17931030-27-crimeloc149" type="placeName" value="Wheeller-street"/>

               <p>Q. From the view which you had of the persons that committed this violence on you, should you be able to say who they were? - Campbell knocked me down, and the other took my bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoners before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure now as you was then? - I am sure of them because I had a full view of them in Lamb-street, and I saw them follow me down Wheeller-street, and also I saw them at the grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you, these mens lives depend on your evidence, are you sure they are the persons? - I am quite sure, I would scorn to say it if I was not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after the robbery did you see the prisoners, either of them? - About three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else present besides the prisoners? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else present when you saw them in custody? - No, Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them directly? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Campbell. I should be glad to know whether it was a dark night or a light night when this woman was robbed? - The shops were all open, it was not a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Southflat. Was I in the same dress I am now? - When they committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300031"/>the robbery Campbell he had a brown coat with whitish buttons, and white stockings, Southflat had a blue jacket on.</p>
               <p>Court. How near were they to you before they attacked you? - About half a dozen yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp besides the grocer's? - Yes, all the way down Wheeller-street.</p>

               <p>I missed a hand saw on Tuesday the 15th of October, I used it in the morning between six and seven o'clock; I was at work at an unfinished house; I went to breakfast at eight o'clock, I came back between eight and nine, and the saw was gone; I saw it again the same morning in another house; in the same house after it was taken from the prisoner; a person asked me if I had lost a hand saw? I said yes, they said they had got the thief; I went up into a house in the same street where there was a matter of twenty carpenters, and the prisoner was with them, and there was the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your's? - It has got a particular mark on the side of the handle, a mark, the remains of a knot in the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the hands of the prisoner? - No, I did not; the person that took it from the prisoner kept it from that time to this, his name is James Pugh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at this time? - I never see him before this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The time that man came in he said the saw belonged to him, and he took up the saw, and beat me for the space of ten minutes and I laid down; and then he took the saw up again and beat me for the space of five minutes; I suppose he beat me for the space of a quarter of an hour in all; after I came out of the house they took and throwed me down to a pit and chucked a large bucket of water over me; then they let me go again, and they took up brick bats and knocked me down again with the brick bats, and this man came and kicked me on the stomach, and they were going to let me go, but a gentleman came up and told them not to ill treat me, and said that they would get money by prosecuting me.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoppy. Did you beat him with the saw? - I did, but not much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the others beat him? - I cannot say, some of them did but I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q Was there any gentlemen desired you not to ill treat him, but to prosecute him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they throw any water on him? - I did not see any person.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutor? - I never saw him before; I saw him going along with a bundle under his coat and followed him along the road, we thought he was a thief, we are very often robbed there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300036"/>Q. Where about are these houses? - In a road almost by Mary-le-bone church. I followed him on the road a good way, and I overtook him, and asked him what he had got under his coat? he said nothing to me. I asked him to let me see it, he said no, and I took hold of his coat, and he unbuttoned his coat and takes this saw away from under his coat; I took the saw and him, and carried them into the house where we were at work; I kept him there till the man came from breakfast after eight o'clock, and then we all hallooed out if any body had lost a saw, and this here man said yes; Hoppy came then and he said it was his saw; I shewed him the saw, I have kept the saw ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man beat with the saw? - Very little, I believe not hurt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body jump upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he thrown into a pit? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any gentleman come to you and speak to you about him? - Yes, the gentleman for whom I worked came, and we had got the water to throw on him, and he said we had better prosecute him. He said he found this saw in the gravel, when I overtook him in the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that man came after me and took me, I never said that the saw was mine, I had the saw under my arm to shew it to any body; I told him I found it down among the gravel; I went and shewed him; this here man was the first that struck me, and that man was the next, after they had beat me for a quarter of an hour, one of them said d - n his eyes don't have patience to beat him with the saw, for I believe if I was you I should run it through his body, and when this gentleman came up and told them not to ill use me, they would get money for prosecuting me, they took me up directly.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoppy. Was you told you should get money for prosecuting him? - We were not.</p>

I told him no, then he told me to go and ask my mistress, and I left him standing at the door, and I went into the parlour to ask my mistress, and I returned from the parlour, I saw him running out of the shop with a parcel under his arm; I followed him and cried out stop thief! and he dropt the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300037"/>things down in Castle-street; I picked up the goods, and laid them on the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabout were the lodgings of Dempsey? - In the one pair of stairs above me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about stealing these articles? - The prisoner at the bar brought me this property, and told me he was very much distressed, this was on last Saturday was a week, he brought the sheet, blanket, and quilt, and I went and pawned them for him for two shillings, I brought him the duplicate and two shillings before witness, and delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn them? - In Nightingale-lane, all at one place in one bundle together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about them? - No, I do not, I was taken up last Sunday and kept till the Monday, because Sunday I could not have a hearing; the prisoner at the bar he wanted to leave me in the lurch, because my name was on the duplicate; I was taken and discharged before the magistrate, he was taken up on Sunday afternoon; I was not cleared till one o'clock on Monday, I was cleared when he had a hearing before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give an account of these things being delivered to you? - I gave it to the justice when I was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any account of that before you was committed? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You pawned these things as your own property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the pawnbroker they were your own property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was taken up for stealing the things? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in order to save yourself you accused the prisoner? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And till you was taken up and carried before the justice you never told this story? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he brought you these things you thought they were his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300040"/>property? - No, I knew they were not, but it is a usual thing to pawn these things and get them out again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them? - Yes, she took them between six and seven on Tuesday night that I lost them, and I went to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. How did you know it was her house? - The officers went to search her house; she did not send the petticoat to pawn herself, she sent another person, and they stopped her, and the woman took them to Mrs. Morley's house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other servant in the house that might have sold it? - There is another young man besides my master. I have kept it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You said that was laying at the door, do you mean laying outside of the door? - Laying on a box, outside of the door, underneath the window.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were many other articles laying with it? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. And some of the same kind, if that is your's? - There was no more Irish linen.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in a public street? - It was in Darton-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other servants in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And besides your master serves sometimes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose you had not cloth of the same length and price? - Various lengths, but the same price.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you sell a good deal in the course of a year? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And marked in the same way as that is? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed a piece of cloth from the table at the door, whatever this is; what is the mark on that cloth? - It is the letter A. a small a.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it made with a pen or pencil? - It is made with a pen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it made on the cloth itself? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is very customary for you to write on the cloth? - The private mark it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can tell your hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you could tell your handwriting on cloth equally as on paper? - I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you wrote on sand perhaps it would be the same? - No, I don't know I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in your hand writing, I suppose if there were fifty lives depending upon it you could swear to it? - I could.</p>
               <p>Q. If you was to see a piece of it at York you could say it was your hand writing? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you could, then you would have some difficulty in saying it was your hand writing? - I don't know but I might.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor woman happened to have a piece of cloth under her arm that you think has got your mark on it, but in fact you lost a piece of that sort from the table at the door, and you have sold a great quantity of that cloth, and it is only a single letter that you can swear to it by.</p>
               <p>Court. You have sold quantities of that sort of linen with the same private mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that exactly the quantity that you missed? - I cannot tell the quantity there was of it because we cut it at various times in the day; I missed the piece of cloth, but I could not tell exactly the quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300043"/>Q. Was it of that size and bulk that you missed? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that you had last seen it, might it be that you saw this woman at the house of Mrs. Kirton's? - About an hour and a half after I had seen it, I saw it at Mr. Kirton's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Supposing there had been a piece of cloth two yards longer or shorter, could you have distinguished it by the eye? - No, I could not.</p>

               <p>I am a house keeper at Westminster; I have nothing but lodgers since my husband died. On the 19th of September, about half after six o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came and offered me this piece of cloth to sell at my own house; I have known her years, but I never knew no such thing of her; she seemed very much in liquor, I asked her where she got it, she said she found it in the street, and asked me if I would buy it; I thought in the day that I had seen the piece of cloth at his shop, and I sent to Mr. Wilkinson to know if it was his property; the prisoner has three small children.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. She is a labouring woman? - She is, she sells water creases about; she told me she found it about half an hour after six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I honestly found it; I was out with a few water creases, groundsel and chickweed, and I picked it up at the Cock-pit, Westminster; if it is opened the dirt will be seen on it, and I knew that gentlewoman, and I went to shew it that gentlewoman, and that gentleman came to the house and said it was his, the gentleman never saw me near the shop, nor I was never near the shop, nor knew where the shop was; I am a poor distressed woman, got a large family, and a poor had working man.</p>
               <p>Court to Bliss. In what state was it? - Under her arm rolled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any dirt on it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Kirton. There is dirt on it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Bliss. How far is the Cockpit from your house? - Not half a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>From some information I received, I went to Mr. Cleaver Simmons's wharf, on Saturday last, and there I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300045"/>prisoner at the bar, I asked him if he had taken one of our casks instead of an oil cask in a mistake? he said he had taken no cask at all for he had none to take, he went about his business then, and afterwards I called him on one side again, and told him the consequences of it, and that if he did not tell of it he might depend on a prosecution; and then he went over to Kent-street with me and shewed me the Butt on his own premises, it was under a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it opened or concealed? - The yard was concealed, but the shed was open.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you mean? - The yard door was locked.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a yard in which butts are usually placed? was there any other butts there? - It was in an empty yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks on the butt? - There was S. W. and Chiswell-street, London; I know it to be Mr. Whitbread's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you first saw the prisoner at Cleaver's, was what you stated to the court all the conversation that passed? Did not he say that he had not an oil cask but he had an empty beer cask? - He did not say so at first, he said he had never a cask at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went with you to his premises and shewed you this cask? - He did sometime afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. And desired you to take the cask? - He did, and turned it out himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - I did not.</p>

D. it means nine shillings a yard, on the other A. M. eight shillings and three-pence; he said he bought one remnant in the country and the other in town, he had been with me eight months, he had a written character from Stockton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifford. He made no difficulty in opening his boxes? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. You might have sold these two pieces? - I don't think it is possible I could have sold them, I am confident I never sold them to Hickson.</p>

On the 3d of September the prisoner came to my house to lodge, and she continued in my lodging till last Thursday; I let to her two rooms on the first floor, last Thursday I had some reason to suspect that some part of my property was gone, on Friday morning I went into the room to examine, and I found the best part of the bed furniture gone away; the indictment states a pillow, bolster, sheet, and curtain, but that was not all I missed, I missed a great deal more, and I went to the police office, and she was put in the power of a constable, and the property found at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she quitted your lodgings? - She had not, I went on an information of a former lodging that she had served the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see the basket? - It stood at the watering trough at the weavers arms, the bottom of Newington; at eight o'clock I heard of the robbery, and I recalled to my mind that I heard some fowls at an uncommon place but I did not see them, my mistress desired me to go in pursuit of these fowls, I went in pursuit after them, and I over took the prisoner with them tied to his back, a little on this side of Kingsland turnpike, and I followed him to the Fox in Kingsland road; I asked him to sell me a couple of fowls? whereof he told me he would sell me a couple of live young pullets at fourteen-pence a piece, he said he bought them at St. Ives market, he opened the basket to me, and the first I took out was an old hen, and then I took out another, and I said I have seen enough, and I took him and the property to my master's house, and my master gave charge of him to Mr. King; I know them to be my master's property, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you servant to Mr. Kendall? - No, I was in his shop; he is a pawnbroker, I saw the prisoner put his hand to the breeches and take them down and put them down by the side of him and carried them away, I told Mr. Kendall.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I pursued him and over took him and took the property from him, they are my breeches, there is my duplicate on them, they were hung up in the shop to be sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been drinking along with an hackney coachman, coming along Brick-lane, Old street, he had a bundle under his arm which he said he had got from his sister; he says to me come into this pawnbroker's, I want to pawn something, accordingly I went along with him and I waited some time while he pawned his shirt, stockings, and some other things, he came out to me and brought a pair of breeches out, and said, take these breeches down to the coach stand, the bottom of Old-street-road, and I will meet you there. I had twenty pounds in my possession not two hours before, which I might have made away if I had been dishonest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe it is his first offence, he stood there quite stupid as if he did not know what to do.</p>

             to know whether she had been to lay out the seven shillings as desired, she said that she had been there, and had laid out the seven shillings; I returned back; other business called my attention directly, I had not time to have the prisoner taken up then; on the 18th I desired another gentleman to go and lay out some money with me, that money I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300059"/>marked, and took it to him there marked, his name is Gough, he his here; I did not mark it in his presence, I marked that money with a fork at a different distance from the side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say it was on Tuesday evening the 15th that you went to Mrs. Edwards; do you remember what time of the evening? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a perfect memory of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you gave the same evidence before the magistrate? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure? - I did to my knowledge; I remember I was not asked whether it was the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that you did not say that your conversation was with her on the morning of the Wednesday, instead of the Tuesday night? - It never was in the deposition because it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home after Mrs. Edwards had been there, you saw but five shillings in the till, and you expected seven, what did you say to him on that occasion? - Nothing at all, I had a mind to know whether there was seven shillings laid out or no, and when I returned the prisoner was gone to another house, and other business called my attention of consequence till towards the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to him the next day or that night? - I did not till I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him up to answer for it? - Not for that only.</p>
               <p>Q. Having done this, having let all this time elapse for the sake of some good purpose no doubt, who searched him? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the money? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have not you had it in your possession since? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the alderman tell you that it should not be so? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the marks that you talk of, you marked a great deal of money for the different persons? - Yes, half a guinea-worth of silver; I marked seven shillings for the lady to lay out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never mark more on your oath? - Not this five, six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean did you mark more than the seven shillings which on that day you marked, did you after that time mark more? - I did, on Friday three shillings and six-pence; but it was a different distance from the sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that you did not refuse the constable to keep the money? - I did refuse he should keep it, that there might not be any alteration made in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been concerned in any of these prosecutions before? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not you concerned in more prosecutions than one? - I shall not tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact how many people have you prosecuted for this same thing? - I don't chose to answer it.</p>
               <p>Q. What will it hurt your feelings? as they are so nice I will not press it? - You warm me, when I first got up I was very cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told any body that you knew he was a thief before you hired him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you had any conversation with Mr. Arnett? - Mr. Arnett brought him to me and recommended him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him on this subject? - I see Mr. Arnett at the shop where he lives, and I had conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never told him so, that you knew he was a thief before you hired him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you had this man? - About three weeks; a fortnight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300060"/>in the shop where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up? - On Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up in your shop? - He was taken up in my shop in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from there that he had taken the money? - No, it was in No. 36, Ludgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money taken from him when he was taken, and how much? - Sixteen shillings and some halfpence, half a guinea and the rest in silver; there was one shilling of the marked money which the lady laid out herself, and two shillings of the marked money that Mr. Gough laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between you and him when you took the money from him? - The constable was going to take it out of his pocket, and he pulled it out and laid it on the table.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your husband? - A perfumer.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he came, morning or evening? - About eight o'clock in the evening, to beg the favour of me to go to his house in Ludgate-street to lay out some money that he would mark for me in my presence; the same money I went with the next morning about a quarter past eight; he marked seven shillings with a fork rather on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the shillings again? - Yes, I bought a pair of cotton stockings, a pair of black stockings and one pair of gloves; I laid out the whole seven shillings with the prisoner at the bar, I laid the money down on the counter, I saw the prisoner take it up, I don't know what he did with it, then I came out of the shop and went home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You paid him the money, that money was not put in the till? - I don't know what he did with it, he took it up in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. He might mix it with his own money for what you know.</p>

            . What time was it you asked him this question? - I suppose it might be about ten o'clock; I asked him if he had had any customers? and he said, he had; I asked him how much he had taken? he said, he had taken five shillings; I desired him to put the articles down in a book which we kept for that purpose; he put down two of three articles which he had sold to the lady; one pair of womens cotton, three shillings, and one pair of womens gloves, two shillings; which amounted to five shillings; I asked him if that was all he had taken or sold? he said it was; I put an article down which I had sold while he was away that he should not make any excuse; I also saw in the till that there was but five shillings in the till.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You are brother to the gentleman that gave evidence just now? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you correct as to the conversation that passed between you? - No, there was nothing else said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him how much money he had taken, did he say five shillings? - He said he had taken seven shillings; then I asked him whether he had included the two shillings that I had taken? he said, yes; then, says I, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300061"/>have taken but five shillings; he repeated the words to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now about the setting down these things. Are you sure you did set down the pair of gloves that you sold, or did he set them down? - I set down one pair, and he set down one pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he or you set down the pair of gloves that you sold? - Will you give me leave to speak? and I will speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer that question. - He did set down a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q And you, when you might have an explanation of the five shillings, you said nothing to him for two days, and when the thing is too late to explain then he is brought here? - He would put down the one pair I sold without my consent, but I made a memorandum of that pair of gloves being my selling.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for on Friday the 12th of October; I took the prisoner out of the shop into the back room, and he took some monies out of his pocket and threw them on the table; with that I searched him further, and I could find nothing else on him. The monies were half a guinea, five shillings and six-pence in silver, and three-pence halfpenny in copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. When you took this young man into custody he was told that he had taken money that was marked, then he threw down the money immediately without coercion? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he told that he was searched for money that was marked? - That I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you know what they said to him? - First he told him that he had a suspicion that he was dishonest; that were the words I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said about his having money that was marked? - I don't know particularly there was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that he put his hand into his pocket and threw down the money; you searched him and found that he had no more than that. At first did not Mr. Stirtevant say that all the money belonged to him? - I don't know that he said so; I remember, at Guildhall, that there was three shillings that Mr. Stirtevant swore to. I kept the man till next day, and produced it before Alderman Langston.</p>
               <p>Q. The Alderman wished you to keep it; who prevented you? - Mr. Stirtevant.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was produced the next day, had not you a shilling in your pocket marked just the same? - I had one the Saturday afterwards, and I really did say that I could not swear to money that was marked no more than they were.</p>
               <p>Court to Stirtevant. Is that money you now produce, the same as was produced before the Alderman? - It is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one that you can speak to? - That is the one marked for the lady.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Look at this and see if you can ascertain it to be a shilling.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a French shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of this indictment.</p>

               <p>Sadler. This is the watch that was pawned with me.</p>
               <p>Goddard. This is my watch, my name is in full length on it in the inside.</p>
               <p>Dale. I cannot positively say it is the watch, I did not take particular notice, I bad it but such a little time in my possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday the 14th day of September, in Golden-lane, on my travels I found, wrapped up in a paper, three half-pence and a shilling, and the duplicate of a watch; and knowing Mr. Tuffs, I mentioned that I had got a duplicate of a watch to sell, and it was fifteen shillings if he would buy it of me, with that he took the duplicate and said he would take it out and see what it was worth, and give me the value of it for the duplicate. I have no witness, I sent to Kensington Gravel-pits, but they did not come.</p>

               <p>Q Do you know of his having lost any property in September last? - Yes, on the 26th of September he lost four pieces of printed callicos, he lost them out of the warehouse, from the counter in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the warehouse part of the dwelling house? - It is underneath the dwelling house, under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get into the warehouse any other way than to the dwelling house? - No, only at the front door; the warehouse is on the ground floor; there is nothing there on the ground floor but a passage. I saw the printed callico there about an hour before, I happened to shew them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss them? - I did not miss them till I took them on the prisoner's shoulder. This was on Thursday the 26th of September; I took him then that instant about thirty yards down Ironmonger-lane; I went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder, it was about thirty yards from our house; he had the linens on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow him? - I had some writing to do in the counting house and I saw something white, and I went to the door, and about twenty yards down the lane, or more than twenty, I saw the prisoner at the bar with the linen on his shoulder, and I knew one of the patterns, because it was the right side outward, and I followed him; the constable has them.</p>
               <p>A CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>This gentleman sent for me to take the prisoner into custody, and these things were hanging on the banisters when I went into the warehouse; they were delivered to me at the house.</p>
               <p>Sculthorp. I am certain they are my master's property; this one piece has been in the house more than a twelve month, they are worth about ten guineas.</p>

               <p>I was at the outside of the door when it was broke open; it was about half after seven or a few minutes more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light then that you could distinguish the features of a man's countenance? - Not without a candle; we had a great many lights at the door, but we could not without those lights distinguish the features of any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there had been no light or candle whatever, and you could only have seen before you by the light in the air, could you distinguish the features of a man's countenance? - I think I could. At my entering the house I opened the door, and I heard a noise, and I heard them come down stairs step by step; when I said three times, who is there? They did not answer but kept coming forward; there were three, but one made his escape, the other two we took; I gave the alarm to the next door, and I had assistance immediately; Mr. Austin, of No. 3, and Mr. Goodyear of No. 8, came out, and they brought back the two prisoners, they were not out of my sight; the first man that came out knocked me down. The things are here which they had about them; there are eleven keys also, three found on them, and the others hid in the house; I took hold of the man by the coat, and had them brought into the house to be searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was before the Lord Mayor, was not you? - No, before Mr. Alderman Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any charge of any thing being stole? - No, sir, only of the things being moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I observed in Alderman Gill's commitment, the charge was with an intent to steal? - They were only removed from one end of the room to the other.</p>
               <p>Court. That will do.</p>
               <p>- AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was called to pursue the prisoners; I pursued them; I took Gibson before ever he was out of my sight; I believe there was nothing found on him, the constable searched; there were some keys found on one of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Where did you apprehend Gibson? - On Snow-hill, just at the bottom of the court where Mr. Brownless lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Brownless live? - In Clarke's-buildings, on Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember in what situation these things were before the prisoner entered your house? - I left them on a chair on the further end of the parlour, and I found them on a table adjoining to the parlour door, scattered about.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Gibson. I was sent with a letter from the Chapter coffee house, passing St. Sepulchre's church a man came and told me, and said I was his prisoner, and had committed a robbery up that court, and took me to that woman's house, they came and searched me, and found two keys about me, one is the key of my chest, and the other is the key of a shed that I had the charge of at Blackwell Hall.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she a lodger in the house? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - She went out of my own passage, and I followed her out into the court, and I saw the top of my own stays, O dear, says I, you have robbed me; I immediately laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you lost sight of her? - Yes, I did, but I followed her and I saw the stays; she knocked me down, she gave me three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure her at that time? - I could not, she knocked me down in my own place, and made her escape.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she secured? - The same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things? - She threw them down in my own parlour; I followed her into the court, and pulled her back when I saw they were my own things into the house again; I have got the things, they are in court.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; there was a coat delivered to me, and the rest by different pawnbrokers before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Nash. This is the coat lappelled cut out the wrong way by one of my journeymen in a mistake, I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What are you? - I am a taylor, woollen draper and salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your partner? - None at all, I never had any.</p>
               <p>Q. You met the prisoner in the street? - I saw him in the street, he was on the opposite side of the way, I crossed over to him, he said he had got shirts there, and other things his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had them of a cousin of your's? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money have you given him since he was in custody? - What he demanded as his right, fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take two guineas from the prisoner? - I did not, I took it out of a chest; I gave him fifteen shillings of it, which he demanded as his right, he said the rest was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you gave him the fifteen shillings? - Nothing more particularly.</p>

            ? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make some promise to him if he would be a good boy? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing about the two guineas before the sitting magistrate? - I did not mention it, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take the two guineas out of the chest? - I did, I asked him whether it was his or mine, he said it was mine, but fifteen shillings that was his own. I asked him if he had any more demands on me? he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two guineas and fifteen shillings? - No, two guineas out of which I returned him fifteen shillings; I took out these buckles, neckcloth and stockings, and told them if they were his to take them; he said they were mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Was it before or after the promise you made him, that he told you that these buckles were your's, and this neckcloth? - I know nothing of any promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you made him no promise whatever, recollect yourself a little? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us understand what you mean by promise, perhaps you mean one thing by it and I another? - When I met him I asked him what property he had got? and where he was going?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him about confessing in the way of a promise? - Nothing to that purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems nothing passed about your cousin at all? - Very few word; nothing that I can bring against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he had received them of him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - Two half crowns, a shilling, a sixpence, a sixpence that was not passable and some half-pence, I cannot justly tell how many; I had it in my hand not above five minutes before it was taken out of my pocket; I had paid for a pair of stockings that cost me seven-pence in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid for them in the shop or in the street? - I dropped a halfpenny out of my hand, and the prisoner picked it up and gave it to me, I put the money into my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that time that you put the purse and money into your pocket? - It was, and I turned myself round and a Mr. Pratt came and told me that I was robbed, and I felt and found my purse was gone, I did not know who had it nor did not know what was become of it; I and Mr. Pratt went up a little alley to see if we could find out who the thief was, but I could not find him, and I did not make any further enquiry that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find him in the alley? - I did not; I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any reason since to suppose that the prisoner has taken your property? - I have no reason at all otherwise than by evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about it than nothing at all, I never saw the man at all in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you taken observation of him enough to know him again? - He was standing right opposite to me while I was dealing for the stockings; and I dropped a halfpenny out of my hand, and he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q Is there any one time that you can fix that your money was taken from you? - No one time at all, I did not feel the least thing in the world of its going.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a coal heaver.</p>

Did you hear the prisoner say any thing about it? - I examined the prisoner how he came by it, he made a slight answer, he said he found it, I asked him whether he knew what were in the pockets? he told me no, he had not felt, I asked Mr. Birch what he had lost? he told me a coat, waistcoat, &amp;c. the prisoner was in the watch-house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Birch, in the presence of the prisoner, claim the property to be his? - He told me that it was his property, and that he had pulled it off his back, and laid it in the cupboard before he went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Mellish's premises? - I was in them to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gateway, is there one connected square of building and wall to make the square? is there a general building that makes the square, or is any part of it open? - To the best of my knowledge there is a little wall, but it is very high, that goes round and connects all the buildings.</p>
               <p>Birch. This is my coat and waistcoat, I can hardly swear to the handkerchief, but it was the same sort of handkerchief that I lost; nor the money I cannot swear to, nor the knife so much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found them in Labour-in-vain-street, as I was going down at two o'clock in Mrs. Partridge's necessary, they were tied up in this white handkerchief, I see something white, and so put my hand on them, and I untied them and I had them on my arm, and this man met me and hallooed out watch, I told him he need not call out watch, for I was going to take them to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lodge there? - I did not, but I was in the same room in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300076"/>evening between the hours of nine and ten, I think it was ten o'clock; there were about three gentlemen in blue coats came into the room, Holmstans and I were sitting on the bed, and several more followed them, I don't know how many more, they were in short jackets, Holmstans and I were sitting on the bed, and this gentleman came in and made mention of this word, here they are, and Holmstans was undressed going to bed, he had nothing on but his shirt and drawers, with that they came in and got hold of this man's shoulder and me immediately; they never asked what we were, nor who we were, but bundled us down stairs, and in the mean time they were shoving us down stairs, there were several of them struck both him and me over our heads as hard as ever they could with both sticks and fists.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass in the room before you came down stairs? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got down stairs what passed? - I was shoved out of doors, I saw no more of the affair, and three of them were jumping on my breast with their knees, and beating me over my head with sticks; I saw no more of the deceased, till I was brought into the house, when I saw a man laying over a chair, and all over a gore of blood.</p>
               <p>Q What countryman was the deceased? - A Swede.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence used in the room, on the part of yourself, or the deceased, to these people that came in? - No, I saw no more of it than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How many Swedes do you think were in this house, on the night that this happened? - A great many, above twenty as nigh as I can think.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room where they assembled? - They were all in bed in the room that we were, except two; there was a great many in another room, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lodged there any length of time yourself? - I had lodged there before, but at that time I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that died I believe could not speak a word of English? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were in the room where the deceased was? - There were not above three more, and all the rest were in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more besides Holmstans that was up, and the rest in bed; how many beds were in the room? - Either four or five, I am sure I don't know, either three or four I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get up immediately? - There were three or four up.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - There was one of them cut in the head most shockingly, and he is gone to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe what was done with the other three? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. My good man was not there immediately on the stairs a very considerble confusion, and a great many people come out in their shirts? - There was not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who made use of this expression, and when it was first made, as Swanskey come out? - After I came out in the street, I said for God almighty sake come out and help me, in English, and afterwards I said it in Swedish; and if a gentleman had not come from the other side of the way I should have been murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not hear the Swedes call out in this way? - In the street, but not before.</p>
               <p>Q. On the stairs immediately at the entrance of the door did you hear no voice at all call out to the Swedes to come out? - No, I did not till I got out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think were in the room, so as to force you and the whole down stairs? - There were three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300077"/>gentlemen in blue long clothes, they were the three first, and several more which I cannot tell how many they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light on the stairs? - There was light in the room where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this was instantaneous, took up but very little time? - It was all done in a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore when you came out of your room on the stairs, did you observe whether there was any light or not? was it not all confusion on the stairs, a vast number of people there, Swedes and of others? - There were no Swedes that I saw; I was shoved down stairs as hard as ever I could, and got several blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you don't know the gentleman at the bar, whether he was one of them or not? - Yes, he is one of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know him? - By his face, just when he came into the room there was a light standing right before him, and he said, here they are, here they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the language used, was here they are, how did you understand it? - I don't know what they meant by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any language at all made use of by any other man on the stairs, or was you quite ignorant of what passed till you got into the street? - When I got into the street, I said, I am a protectioned man, I have got this protection, and one of them hit me on the head and called me a Scotch buggar.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Swedes have you reason to think were in the house at that time? - There were only three up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think were in the house of Peterson at this time? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other Englishmen there? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. English seamen did visit that house sometimes? - Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Peterson is what they call a crimp? - Yes, he gets seamen for captains.</p>
               <p>Q. And English seamen come under his view as well as you foreigners? now I want to know whether it past within your hearing or not, that they did not come for foreigners, they wanted to look after somebody else? - I did not hear that, neither in the room nor on the stairs, nor in the street at no way.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. Did you know the prisoner before? or do you know him now only? - I recollect his face very well, he had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I caution you to be a little aware; in the first place you said you did not know him, will you take upon yourself to say that that gentleman had a stick in his hand, supposing him to be the man? - I am sure he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that that man had a stick in his hand? - I never see him before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say before to any body that he had a stick in his hand? - Every man that I see had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. You was examined before the magistrate, you gave in your information on oath before him? you have told us of your having been very much beat, and of your seeing the deceased struck by several of the gang? how happened it when you delivered in your account to the magistrate that you never related one circumstance of that sort, because I have your information here? - I don't understand you, please to explain it better for me.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man was killed there was a coroner's inquisition held? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you did not tell what you do now, that you was struck, and that you saw the deceased struck? - I did say so then as I say now.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other light in the room before you came? - I am not certain there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the gang go up at once? - No, Mr. Watts and Mr. Tuart and another that I did not know, they three went up first, after they were up, Mr. Watts or Mr. Tuart called out to them to come up, he called one man by the name of Baker, and then all the gang came running up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed before the rest came up? - I took the candle in my hand then, and went out of the room, I was very bad with a cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what passed below stairs? - I did not see till the gang and men were out in the street, when I saw Mr. Tuart beating the deceased, I went then to the street door, he was beating him with a stick in the street, the right side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to this man in the street? - In consequence of being beat he tumbled down, and then he came and crawled to the bar, and then he tumbled down again, and then he crawled to the stair case, and tumbled down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Tuart after the deceased was in the house again? - Mr. Tuart came in, he said dear sir, dear sir, what is the matter, I said you are the man that has killed the man, and half murdered him; he said I have got no stick, I said that he was the man, for I saw nobody else strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him that you had seen him, and only him strike him, what did he say? - Dear sir, I have got no stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a stick at the time of this conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did, this conversation pass after the beating with this stick? - I suppose two or three minutes at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted the having these people in your house was totally unexpected by you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, I believe you had some conversation with some of these people in the tap room before any alarm took place at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, man, that before you went up stairs with the candle in your hand, that you had no conversation with the prisoner at the bar in the tap room? - Not a single word in the tap room, except he might say, how do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300079"/>you do? at the bar. We pass the tap room first, before you get to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be talking to you? - He never stopped a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him when he said that? - Watts was with him, he did not speak a word, but I don't know whether Tuart spoke or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Watts pass before Tuart spoke to you? - Tuart followed Watts.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether at the time Watts was going up stairs, Tuart did not stop to speak to you? - They followed one another as quick as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Tuart did not stay a single minute speaking to you while Watts was going up stairs? - He did not, I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not hear somebody call on the stairs before Tuart left you? - There was not, I swear that positively, nobody called out before Tuart went up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath cannot you say there was a dozen in that room? - I cannot say that, I have only three beds in that room, and two men in a bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Tuart, Watts, and the other got into the room before you came there with a candle? - They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried that candle lighted down stairs? - I did, I was first down stairs, I was obliged to let the candle and candlestick all go just at the bottom of the stairs, because they came so fast after me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were coming down stairs after you very fast? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a croud coming down after you? - I cannot tell whether there were two or three, ten or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that, why did you go down stairs with this candle a light? - Why should I stay in that room when I saw a croud of people coming after me.</p>
               <p>Q. A very good answer, on your seeing a croud of people after you, of course you made your escape as well as you could? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the croud coming it was that you put out the candle? - It tumbled out of my hand, I did not put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the expression, that when you was in the room, one of them saying to you, how is this, we don't want any foreigners? - They never made that expression to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that expression made use of? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first of all to say it was not made to you? - I did not give you that answer, I give you no further answer but that I tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was it not your first answer to me? - I never heard them say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell me they did not say so to you? - I tell you to my knowledge what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that expression was not made use of, we don't want foreigners, or something like that? - I will swear it never was to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - To my knowledge I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that expression<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300080"/>was not made use of? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath will you say that that did not pass in the room while you was in the room? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, on the stairs, when you got down, was not that expression made use of? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it asked you for the candle? - Mr. Watts, he held one part of the candlestick and I the other, and I would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you let him have it? - I was not insured a shilling, and that was the reason, I told him I would go up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Watts want the candle for? - He said there was a man that had gone up stairs before him and he wanted a candle to go up to see who that was, I said I would not lend him the candle, I would go up with him; I refused him the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any scuffle ensued between you two? - Not at all, he let go the candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he was sure that man that had gone up stairs was an englishman? - I judge that he supposed the man that was gone up was an englishman by the conversation I had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined in the morning that these men were taken, when the man that was taken to the Hospital died? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say you was so much frightened when you let the candle fall that you could not see how the transaction took place? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drove down the gang that came with these men? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said you knew who drove them down? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never formed any opinion whether the press gang drove down the Swedes, or the Swedes drove the press gang? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor never expressed such an opinion to any body freely? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, you understand a little Swedish? you are a Swede? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect such an expression, Swanskey, come out? - I heard that while I was on the stairs, they said, Swedes come out. I was down on the stairs at that time and the rest were in the room. Watts stood on the landing of the second pair of stairs, and I stood on the stairs, he holding the candle in one hand, and I in the other; the cry was, Swedes. Swedes, come out!</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you think it would hurt you in your business a good deal? - I think I must be a very ignorant man to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. It would hurt your favour with these people that frequent your house? - How is it possible I would venture my getting my living.</p>
               <p>Q. To be sure it would be a bad thing, and they would resent it. You never had any conversation with Tuart or Watts, or any body in your house? - I have often treated the gang civilly in my house not to take them out. The night before that I went down Thames-street to buy some china, and I saw them at the door of the City of Bristol, and I went in and treated Watts and some others with a shillingworth of brandy and water.</p>

               <p>Q. It was well known that the persons who appeared to be at your house, appeared like foreigners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet they came that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not come after foreigners? - Yes, they often press the foreigners as well as others, to over haul them, to search them, to see whether they are or not.</p>

               <p>Q. You know his wife perhaps? - I know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you, to these two persons, declare that some englishmen escaped out of your house? - If I tell things at random, I tell at random, but when I am on my oath, I am on my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. You took this man up at the City of Bristol, the inn called so. Did not Watts produce to you the names of four men that you had given information of at your house? - He did either produce it there or at the justice's, he said three names; but I never did such a thing; I never had such men at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Upon your oath don't you know, and verily believe this, that they came there in search of an englishman, and that the Swedes, to a great number in your house, being alarmed there was a great commotion, and that what happened was in consequence of this sudden affray? - I don't know what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know on your oath that they would avoid troubling in any degree a man that they knew to be a Swede.</p>

               <p>Q. You will say butter is not lead, it don't weigh quite so heavy? - How do I know about that; I was not tried for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your general way of getting your living is as a crimp? - I sell beer and brandy, and other things as a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you do you act as a crimp? - Yes, they call it a crimp; landlord is the common name.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a dozen? - I do not think there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that when Watts went up stairs you had the curiosity to follow him? - I did to the stair case, and when the halloo was given, the gang went by me, and I went up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Watts ask Peterson to lend him a candle? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts must you have been? - There was a great noise and confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any scuffle on the stairs? - Yes, hauling the men down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Swedes calling out one to another, in their language? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not hear any sort of word like this, Swanskey or Swedes, come out? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the tap room? - I went down stairs for fear of being shoved down, I could not see what was behind me, and out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you did not see the prisoner at the bar give the deceased any blow, but when this poor man had got into the tap room you saw him fall down? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fall on his face? - I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you a question, and I can prove it I promise you; how long was it that Mr. Tuart, the gentleman at the bar, was in conversation with Peterson before Watts went up? - They had no conversation of any length.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know if you heard this; that when they came in, addressing themselves to Peterson, they asked him where the four men were? - I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. You describe a great noise on the stair case, do you know from what it proceeded? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any resistance from the Swedes? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapons? - None.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a stick? - A thick stick, the short man chucked the deceased down at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in this street on Sunday the 18th of August? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Holmstans in the street that afterwards died? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw him in the street, who else did you see there? and what did you see done to him? - I heard a cry of murder! and I went out of doors, the first thing I saw was several candles, and I went a little further and the deceased was leaning over a post and there were two of the gang beating him with sticks over the loins; one I should know again if I was to see him, the other I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of that one that you should know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the man that afterwards died, when you saw these two men beating him? - He could not get away from the place where they were beating him, till he was fetched away by two men; I went and saw him after he was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Tuart coming into the house afterwards? - I don't remember seeing any of them, because they went away directly the man was taken in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did you see in the street besides these two men and the deceased? - I saw some of the gang, but I should not know them; there was only one man that I minded in particular, that was a shortish man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Swedes in the street? - Yes, I saw one of them looking after a shoe, with a candle in his hand after the gang went away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pupil to Mr. Blizard. I was at the hospital, and attended a person of the name of Holmstans on Sunday the 18th of August; he was brought in Sunday evening about twelve o'clock, in a state nearly of insensibility, on examining him, I found a wound appeared on the lower, and a contused one on the upper part of the left side of the head, it was rough and bloody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300087"/>Q. Had he any other wound? - No, except a bruise on his right arm; he died on the 20th of September, a month and two days after he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his body after he died? - Yes, it was examined, I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the contusion the cause of his death? - The immediate cause of his death, was a disease and bleeding of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say from what cause was that bleeding and disease? - It is likely to be from the injury that he received at the time of the bleeding of his head. On examination the lungs were found very much diseased, and contained a great quantity of matter; Mr. Blizard was the principal, and I attended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You see a blow on his head, could you say, or can you say that bore it an appearance, such as you could determine on your oath, whether it was received by a blow, or whether it might have been by a fall? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>- BLIZARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon to the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember attending the deceased when he was brought there? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open him after the decease? - I did. The immediate cause of his death was certainly a bleeding of the lungs; I suppose the lungs might have received an injury at the time he received the hurt on his head; he had a wound originally on the left side of the head, the symptoms impressed a strong suspion of a fracture, on opening the body a fracture was discovered very low down, under the right ear, and under such circumstances that induced me to believe that it was not received by a blow, but that in all probability it was from a fall, because it would be very difficult to induce a blow there, so as to give a fracture; in this fractured part there was a portion of wound intirely surrounded, and the fracture could not have been in consequence of a blow the opposite side of the head, but it must have arisen from a distinct blow, or hurt on that part.</p>
               <p>Q. To which of the bruises do you ascribe his death? - I ascribe his death to the bleeding of the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that complaint on the lungs likely to be produced in consequence of a blow on the head? - An inflammation might be produced there in consequence of violence, as well as from many other occasions.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was this from you? - The length of one field. I saw the men take something out, but what it was I could not tell; I pursued after the men, and I went and spoke to the constable, and while I went to the constable, he went into the house, and I could not tell rightly where he was; I went to the dunghill and there I saw a piece of lead; from there I went to the commissioners of our town, and they granted a warrant, and we searched, and we found a great quantity in this man's house, where they live.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose lead it is that was found there? - Mr. Buddle has swore to some of the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he swore to that found in the dunghill or that found in the house? - That found in the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whereabouts was it you was at work? - At Sommer's town, about a quarter of a mile from Camden. This lead was in the dunghill about half way from Somer's town to Camden.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went there who did you see? - A tall man dressed in black, who opened the door and desired me to walk into the counting house. I took the bill of one hundred and twenty pounds out of my case, I gave it to the man that let me in; immediately a green cloth was thrown over my head and I was thrown on the ground; they took my book from me; there was a person behind the curtain, I did not see that person, I heard his voice; they took the book from my hand, and threatened if I made any resistance they would cut my throat; they put an handkerchief or something in my mouth to prevent my making a noise; the person that opened the door says to the other, where is Jack? he replied he was waiting in the passage; he said, why did he not come in? I heard the door open, they then lifted me up, and took me down into a back kitchen with this over my head, and put me by the side of the copper, and chained my hands and feet to the copper with a padlock which they locked; they then said there was plenty of grub if I made no noise, but if I made the least noise they would come down and murder me, they then left me; I remained in that situation for a length of time; by shoving my shoes off and putting my feet closer together, I extricated myself from one chain which confined my feet to the copper; I went into a small room, my hands were still confined, the chain that confined my hands was not fastened to the copper; I went into an adjoining room, lifted up the sash and made a noise, and somebody came at length and relieved me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to Hatton-garden? - A little after ten, as near as I can tell, in the morning on the 21st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was it you so extricated yourself? - A little before four in the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell what was in your pocket book when they took it away? - Some bills I cannot recollect; there was a bill for sixty-two pounds two shillings upon

            ; I then mentioned to Jealous, here was Jones; we went and took him into the King's Arms tavern, Palace-yard, when Jealous put him into a room which was very dark; he then went out, and there I remained with him some time, Jealous being away in that time he asked me to give him a glass of wine; I told him I would ring the bell, and the waiter brought in a bottle and two glasses; after that he wanted me sadly to tell him what he was taken into custody for, I told him I did not know, he said you do know, and I will give you half a guinea to tell me, I told him I was not to be bought, I did not know, and if I did I would not tell him; then after that he wanted me to get him a chamber pot, as it happened the waiter just came in. I told him to bring a chamber pot; and he took it and he turned himself towards the fire place, and there pretended to make water, at that time I did hear something rustle, I thought it was his linen, afterwards, he had another glass of wine, after that Jealous, Townsend, and some other officers came in, then I began to search him, I then searched him and found two blank checks, which corresponded to that one found filled up by himself; on his going out it occured to me that I verily believed I had not done all that might be done; on some suggestion of mine Carpmeal went back.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had Jones got from the room? - Just got out; Townsend, I, and Macmanus, went with him in a coach to Peckham-rye-lane.</p>

After this robbery I went to the house; there was an express sent down to me directly, I came to town; in the house I found what I have got here, I found these cords; this board and cords, so that putting this rope through the ceiling this board went up to the joists, and kept them up, or thereby the cords might be raised higher or lower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it go through more ceilings? - No, only through one; here appears to be the handle of a new auger; they are new two-penny cords; there were several round staples; and at the end of the cord there was a wire with a slip noose, so as to be able to put it about the neck immediately. These things were put in after I let the house to Mr. Bradshaw.</p>

Mr. Blasson, the subject of your examination was confined to this, who took the house for Bradshaw? it was not with respect to whether he had spoke about the house before, you was not spoke to about that? - I was not. I was not asked the question; in short he was not the person that took it for Bradshaw; that was all I said there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Campbell. You told us you could not give the exact particulars of the bills on Stimson? - I know no more than they were five bills.</p>

A number of circumstances have been stated, both by Mr. Garrow and others, as to my situation in life; as when he asked Mr. Wimbold questions, which were totally improper against my character. I hope the Jury will consider that they are to try me from the evidence of the witnesses that have appeared this day, and that they will judge accordingly: and I hope that they will consider, that however heinous a crime is, except a man is proved guilty, he is not to be convicted of it, for the more heinous the crime is, the less chance there is of mercy after he is convicted by your testimony. The indictment, states that I have feloniously assaulted

             Campbell instead of proving it, he proves that I did not take this property from him; that he does not know me, and tells you, gentlemen of the Jury, that he was robbed by some man that he saw there, and that I am not the man; that there was another person in company with this said person, whose voice he has heard; that they were about, after they robbed him for two hours, he of course swears positively that it was not my voice. At the time of my examination, Mr. Addington he did it, no doubt, for the sake of public justice; I have no right to suppose any thing else, he asked me simply this, did you or did you not commit a robbery in Hatton-garden? I must needs own the question was a very extroadinary one; I made a reply and said, certainly not; and spoke as any man in my circumstances would, agitated and flurried. Then the magistrate says to Mr. Campbell, Now, Mr. Campbell, at the time that you was robbed, no doubt, if by Mr. Jones, his voice must have been flurried; his voice on the present occasion is also flurried; do you recollect the voice? he then swore it was not the person to appearance, nor was the voice any thing like the voice of the party who robbed him. I therefore take it for granted that the gentleman of the jury will consider it such, that instead of the witness Campbell proving any thing against me, he convinces you of my innocence of this most horrid of crimes that is now laid to my charge.</p>
               <p>The next witness is Mr. Henderson, who, when up at Bow-street, stood next to me, after stating that Bills had been presented for payment, for some sixty pounds, he was desired to look round and point out the person; he looked at me and my unfortunate brother, there were a number of other persons in the room, he positively declared, in the presence of Mr. Knowlys, that I was not the person. Mr. Addington pointed me out to him, he then says, that he cannot be positive that he did not take notice of the man, but he verily believed that the man that called on him was of a very different complexion, but, says he, our servant maid, a young woman that is present, she took a good deal of notice of him, she is below stairs, I should wish you would call for her. This was the evidence that was given by Mr. Henderson, in the presence of Mr. Knowlys.</p>

               <p>The next witnesses is Mr. Carpmeal, Kennedy, and those gentlemen who are interested in taking away the lives of their fellow creatures; to throw no reflection on these gentlemen, I believe you all know that it is just as much to them to take away the life of any man as for a butcher to kill an ox; for I declare that I am as innocent of this horrid crime, now imputed to me, as any one of you gentlemen of the jury: nor do I conceive that they have proved any thing that I have been guilty of.</p>
               <p>The next witness was a Mr. Crabb, an oilman; he proves of some twopenny cord that he had sold to some person, which he also proves was not the cord produced by Mr. Blasson; therefore I have only to say that it was not me that bought the cord, nor did I ever see Mr. Crabb till I see him at Bow-street, but in effect he does not prove any thing in respect to the present indictment.</p>
               <p>The next witness is Mr. Craven, a taylor, who knows me very well; he would wish to prove to you that at the very time, the delicate moment, when this robbery was committed, he saw me in Holborn; now Campbell he said, that they who committed this atrocious act, remained with him till twelve o'clock, at this time, ten minutes before eleven Mr. Craven sees me walking down Holborn, going into a brandy shop drinking a glass of brandy; is it possible that I should have been in a house in Hatton-garden from ten to twelve, and yet be seen by Mr. Craven walking down Holborn with an umbrella in my arm at eleven o'clock? This is the evidence that is called to affect my life, my brother's, and two other unfortunate men.</p>

Unfortunately for me the person that brought the bill to him did resemble me so much, but he says he only saw him a moment, and he believes me to be the person, but does not pretend to be certain.

             it is the most extraordinary evidence that ever was given a court; it is the positive fact, that when she was asked at Bow-street whether she had any knowledge of my person, she said that she did not know me; Mr. Addington pointed me out, saying, is not this the man? she paid very great attention, and positively swore that I was not the man. This was in the presence of Mr. Knowlys. She came forward on the 9th of October at Bow-street, at that very instant she says, that Mr. Jones came to our house with bills for payment. Now it is very extraordinary if she had not been tampered with, how she would know me from any person present, when she had said on the 2d of October that I was not the man; and you have heard to day that what I have stated with respect to her testimony is true.</p>
               <p>The next witness is Mr. Blasson; it seems he is the landlord of a house, No. 13, Hatton-garden; he proves that he has let his house to some person, and he proves that he did not let this house to me; it seems that very person is to be supposed the person that committed this robbery, or concerned in it; but he does not seem to state that I am the person; he does state that two persons prior to this had applied to him to rent the house; I declare I never have applied for the house, though I believe it would be no crime, nor would be counted such, except in my present situation, but at the same time I must declare that the first time I ever saw Mr. Blasson was at Bow-street; Mr. Blasson says that he did not chuse to let me the house. I humbly conceive in my former situations, prior to my misfortune in attending this bar, my appearance nor address was so despicable as not to have asked me what are you? and who are you? before, on such an occasion, I should have a denial. I verily believe that it is a very extraordinary circumstance, instantly to object to me as a tenant without ever enquiring into my character, good, bad, or indifferent. I repeat the declaration, I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street, Gentlemen of the jury, this is the whole of the evidence produced by the prosecutors, in which I believe there are not grounds sufficient to convict a man of a common misdemeanor, much less of a capital crime which takes his life. I hope you will divest yourselves of every prejudice that might have been produced in your minds from the reports that have proceeded out of doors, or from the public papers; I do not say that these reports are to weigh in my favour, but that you ought to divest your minds of every impression that might be made previous to what you have now heard, and that you will judge mercifully this very day as you expect to find mercy yourselves.</p>
               <p>I shall now prove to you gentlemen, from respectable witnesses, that I am an innocent man. I should leave my cause as it now stands was it not for my future situation in life; I wish to be honourably acquited, and convince you and the world, that I could not possibly commit such a crime; and if ever I could for a moment harbour the idea of committing such an attrocious deed may God deprive me of life. I hope, gentlemen, you will make some allowance for my present situation, for I must beg you will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood to Job Moore. What was the date you gave to that transaction you spoke about? - The 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that there were a pair of Bracelets sold. Do you know the person to whom they were sold? - I heard the name mentioned of Grey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where it took place? - At the Bank Coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the Sale? and what was paid? - He sold the bracelets for one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was paid at that time? - It was paid at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the number of these notes? - I cannot positively swear to them, but to the best of my knowledge there was one of them 2,271, and another 9,670.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these notes since? - No, never; nor before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you the memorandum you made of the transaction? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tens were there? - There were four.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain as to the amount of the draft? was it thirty-seven pounds four shillings, or thirty-four pounds seven shillings? - It was thirty-four pounds seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This person was a stranger as well to Jones as to you? - I don't know, he might be or not to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when this note was drawn? - I think it was drawn the 13th of September, to such a one and bearer. I think it had no time to run, it was due when it was first drawn I presume.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be quite certain of that? - To the best of my recollection it was; I remember there was on it, London and Middlesex bank; that was the reason I recollect it, because I never saw one of that kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A plated buckle maker; I have lived in Birmingham for near fifty years.</p>
               <p>Q. And have bill transactions occasionally yourself? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 28th of September. You know the difference between a bill payable at sight, and one that is a week over due? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300104"/>Q. You, as a man of business, would enquire what was the reason if a week was over due, whether the man on whom it was drawn had any assets or no. Did not you suggest that to Mr. Jones to enquire that before he took the bill? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a pretty lot of bank notes, two, four, six, and seven bank notes. Did any body make amount of the number of them at the time? - They were casting up the amount; I cannot say whether they made any amount of it, Mr. Jones was looking them over and casting them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when they began to treat for these bracelets? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was called in to know the value of them? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Grey give what Mr. Jones asked? - No, at last there was ten pounds difference.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of those two you mentioned? - 2,271, and 6,970 to the best of my knowledge, and not 9,670.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you repeat to this gentleman several times over 9,670?</p>

               <p>I am a butcher at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - I had seen them both before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them? - The Monday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell us on what occasion you saw them? - I was going home and they met me, Mills met me, it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he told me that his friend had got some sheep to sell if I would buy them; I told him I had no objection; he took me down to a public house in houndsditch where Smareley was; and he said, will you buy any sheep? I told him I had no objection; he said he had none then, but he would have some in the course of a day or two; Mills was present at the time; about Wednesday, I think, he said he should have them; and where should he bring them to? I told him he must be the best judge where he might bring them to, there were plenty of places at Islington, where the other farmers put up. Mills came to me on the Monday following, he came to me and said, come along, come along, says he, here are the sheep; I said, where? he said, in Fore-street; so when we got to Fore-street, he said, he made a mistake it was Broad-street; when we came to Broad-street I did not see any sheep, but I saw a little man in a blue jacket, and Mills said, there is the man that has got them in care; I said that is a man that I know. Mills takes me down a coach yard where the sheep was; so I and Mills together counted them; I said there were only two and forty; he said, that is right, there is one run over.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to expect there were three and forty? - Mills told me there were three and forty; I told Nathan, the other man's name that had them in care, he is a Billingsgate porter I believe, says I to him, take these sheep to Mr. Shannon, and tell Mr. Shannon, to take particular care of them till he sees me; I did not agree for any thing, he asked me fifteen shillings a piece, but I did not settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked the fifteen shillings? - Mills. I then told him to go back with me to Smithfield; I had not cash enough about me to pay him for them; I went with him to the Half Moon, and told him to call for something to drink, and I went out and got a constable, and gave charge of him, because I suspected the sheep being stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheep in the usual condition, in which sheep were brought into market? - They seemed to be no judge of the price, and then they did not appear to be fit for killing at all, they were scarcely worth any thing for killing.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had taken Mills what became of Smarely? - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300106"/>Smarely that morning at all, I had seen him the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Nathan, had you known these prisoners before? - Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pether the witness? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come to you in the day or night? - It was four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any secret about it to you, that they had got sheep to sell? - They called on me in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Smarely? did you see the prisoners both together? - Mills called me to Smarely, then Smarely seemed as if he was the person of whom I was to have the sheep.</p>

               <p>I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these sheep? - On the 30th of September, Monday morning, I was going to Billingsgate, I have worked there for these three and four and twenty years. I saw a drove of sheep, and a potatoe cart, in Fenchurch-street, and I saw three men driving them all of a row.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see if any of these men are here? - Two men are here at the bar; that was about a quarter after five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the men? - I am sure of it, they have on the same coats as they had on at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the sheep? - The way I got into the business was, one of the sheep was run over with a potatoe cart, so with that the prisoner at the bar he fetched up the driver of the cart, and says, you have run over one of my sheep; so I took the number of the cart, because he was going to knock him down, 39,397. After that the sheep was run over, one of them said, young man, have you any particular business to do? I said I was going down to Billingsgate, but if he would pay me I would go along with them; so I takes down one of my baskets and takes up the dead sheep in one of my baskets, and followed them to Houndsditch; I followed Mills and the other man to Houndsditch, then Mr. Mills said to me you must stay here for about a quarter of an hour, and he helped me down with the dead sheep, now, says he, you must follow me, Smarely was all the while behind; I followed, I went down Wormwood-street, and came just to Broad-street; says he, I must go to Smithfield, and you must stay here to take care of the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - Mills; Smarely was up and down Broad-street, at the same time, says he, this is a bye street, you can drive them up here, I drove them up there, and while I was there the watchman came to me and said, this is a great nuisance, the inhabitants will be vexed with it, if they should look out, says he, there is a coach yard, you may drive them up, I drove them up the yard, and all this time Smarely and another gentleman was walking up and down all the time, that other gentleman's name is Pether I believe; sometimes they went round Old Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the man of the name of Nathan? - Nathan came to me along with Mr. Mills.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that Mills brought Nathan? - About seven o'clock in the morning; I waited there a full hour; when Nathan came to me he said to me take these sheep, so and so, says I, who is to pay me for my trouble? Mills asked me what I wanted? I said I deserved half a crown; Nathan told me where to drive them, Smarely followed me all the way, and came full butt against me in Petticoat-lane; I delivered them to a butcher in Petticoat-lane, he goes by the name of one Mr. Shannon, according to the directions of Nathan, the prisoner Smarely followed me all the way from Fenchurch-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300107"/>and paraded all the while up and down Broad-street, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Nathan, what are you? - I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you employed by butchers? - I have worked at Billingsgate for this last twenty-three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a relation to the last witness? - No, no more than you.</p>
               <p>Q. This was early in the morning that you met them? - About a quarter after five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if these men are convicted that you will have part of a reward? - I like to be industrious.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know if they are convicted you will be entitled to part of a reward? - I never was in such a snare in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Since you have been about this court have you never heard that there is a reward on conviction of sheep stealing? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the half crown? - Mills said he had no more than a shilling about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the remainder of the half crown? - A shilling is money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the remainder of the half crown that they promised to give you? - If they had given me the half crown I had a right to it, I had earned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the half crown? - I was paid for my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the remainder of the half crown that they promised to give you? - I had half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get the half crown? - The same day after the gentleman paid me the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you the one shilling and six-pence? - Mr. Nathan.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have answered that question a long while ago, and you would have saved the time of the court, and the jury, you are an impudent fellow. What were the marks of these sheep? - All marked N. my name; that I could see in the dark.</p>
               <p>Court to Gibson. How were these sheep marked that you lost? - With an N.</p>

Smarely and I were close by the sheep when it was run over, this Nathan had them in his care while Nathan went somewhere else; then Smarely and I came to the Pit's Head in the Old Bailey, and Smarely went from me, and I never see him again till last night I see him in this court; I was taken up a week afterwards on suspicion.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Smarely. That Pether called me up about eleven o'clock on Sunday night, and tole me that he could wish if I could prefer him to a little money, I had none myself, I know, says he, of some sheep that are in a field adjoining a turnpike road; and he took these sheep out of the field to London-bridge, and drove them himself, then at London-bridge I went to Mr. Mills, for him to call Mr. Nathan that was to buy them, he said he did not mind stolen property, he had told me he did not care how they were come by, so as he could have them worth his money. Pether was the man that drove the sheep, he drove them all the way from Marden to London-bridge; I know no more of the sheep than that. I am quite destitute of any witness, I was quite unprepared for any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you had occasion to send him out on Friday the 27th of September; I believe that was the day that he did not come home after he performed the errand? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Now about this dwelling house where this property was, is it your own dwelling house? - The warehouse forms a part of the house, it is the ground floor.</p>

               <p>I am the person that looks after the work. On Friday the 25th of October, I saw the shirts put on the truck, they came out of the needle room that morning, fetched out by the prisoner and another.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it the prisoner carried? - Thirty-six check shirts and two bundles of trowsers, there were more trowsers besides them, two dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put them on this truck? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to see them afterwards on the truck that day? - I went along with the truck as far as Ludgate-hill, and then they went round St. Paul's, I went round the left hand, and they went round the right hand, till there I followed the truck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see them on the truck? - Yes, I saw the quantity, but they were covered over.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with this truck afterwards? - It was to go to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the man that was to carry them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with him? - 'Till we came to St. Paul's, he turned on the right hand, and I turned to the left, and they went into Red Lion-court, Watling-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he and you parted? - At St. Paul's; he went on the right hand as I went on the left; it is usual to go that way, and that was the way we generally made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the man go one way and you another? - Because the truck would not go that way; I went strait on the City, through Cheapside to go to the warehouse, and instead of their coming that way they went down Watling-street, to Red Lion-court.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your goods again? - Yes, some.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you see first, the prisoner or the goods? - A gentleman took in what was left in Red Lion-court for safety; I saw them in Red Lion-court I believe the same night; the gentleman sent word to the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands did you see them? - In one Mr. Cumberland's, a broker, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after this? - Not till the Monday that he was taken on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the things again if you was to see them? - There is the parish mark on them, that is the mark we mark all the shirts by.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher. On Saturday last the master of the workhouse came down to me into a public house, and told me he had behaved in a very dirty manner, and said that he had robbed the workhouse of shirts and trowsers, and told me if I should see him to stop him. On Sunday evening he was by our door, and I stopped him and delivered him to the beadle, and had him taken to the watch-house; he said he was sorry for what he had done, and that the other man had sold the trowsers and shirts, and gave him a guinea and a half of the money; I went up on Monday morning and acquainted the master of the workhouse that I had got him in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of this lad? - I asked him several times where he came from? I could get no answer, but from the workhouse; I sent for the beadle of Cordwainers ward, and he said as it was a parish matter he would not have any thing to do with it; so I took the goods into my warehouse, and sent him home with a note in his pocket. In the afternoon of the same day Mrs. Bramham brought me the note; I delivered the things to Mrs. Bramham and another, two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he now in service? - He is in the marines, he is the first lieutenant; I believe I had not met him since the peace, till about two months ago I received a note from him, informing me that he was in London, and in very great distress, claiming my assistance, requesting me to send him a temporary assistance; I desired the boy who brought the note, immediately to conduct me to him; I was extremely unhappy to find a young man that I had known in good circumstances and in a genteel line, in so deplorable condition; I rendered him what assistance I could, and requested he would come to my lodging, I told him I should occasionally render him any little assistance in my power, I invited him constantly to breakfast with me, and about three weeks ago he came to my lodging, says he, you can put a guinea in my pocket without any inconvenience to yourself, I am sure; I said, I should be very happy to do it; he told me that he had a watch of his wife's in pawn for four guineas, and that if I was so good as to lend him four guineas to redeem it, he could very readily pawn it for five, I told him I should be happy to lend him any assistance in my power; I was in bed at the time, I told him there was exactly four guineas and some silver in my pocket, he was very welcome to take it for the purpose; he took it out of my pocket by my desire, by the time I was up and at breakfast, he returned with the watch in his pocket; I told him it was certainly worth much more, and if he pleased I would lend him the other guinea, and keep the watch as a security, which would save him the expence of pawning of it; but if I should happen to want five guineas in the interim before he paid me, he could have no objection to my sending it to a pawnbroker's. I wore the watch for several days in my pocket, and shewed it to several of my acquaintances, mentioning the circumstance; I mentioned it to several of my acquaintances, and on Friday week last a friend of mine, a very old acquaintance, a Mr. Lawrence called on me in the morning, begged the favour of me to lend him a few guineas in order to pay a bill, that he was bound to take up on that day; I told him I had not cash to spare, and pleaded an excuse, he told me his credit would be hurt, as his bill became due at twelve o'clock, and he had promised to pay it; this was I suppose about ten, and he intreated me to lend him what I could spare, I told him I could not spare a single guinea, he then suggested the idea of lending him Mr. Wheeler's watch, and he says I will pawn, and will give you my honour to redeem it, and let you have it by eight o'clock this evening; as he told me he had a pressing occasion for a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300115"/>money, I did not refuse him, I gave it him for the purpose of pawning it; in about an hour and a half he returned to the room where I was dressing in custody, he told me that the offer of the watch had been attended with a most serious consequence, that he was detained for its being a stolen watch. I was astonished at the declaration, and told him I will attend you immediately to the justice of the peace, and sufficiently exonerate you. I went with him to justice Addington's, and told justice Addington all the circumstance, and he was discharged, and so was I, and he told me it was necessary to take Mr. Wheeler, in order to justify myself, and at four o'clock that day Mr. Lawrence, and I took him into custody. I think it is three weeks ago to day that he come to me, for I had the watch in my possession for one week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him whether on last fortnight I did not go with him, during the time of divine service in the afternoon to Westminster Abbey? - I do recollect our walking that way, and going into the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before you had the watch or after - I think I had the watch at that time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday the 28th of September, between the hour of five and six in the evening; I was coming along through the Bird Cage-walk in St. James's-park; I perceived against one of the large trees, a cross made with chalk, and at the foot of the same tree the leaves were heaped up higher than the rest, which lay about considerably, I immediately went up and kicked the leaves away, when I perceived something wrapped up in a white linen rag, I took it up, and in the rag was a gold watch, a gold chain, two gold seals, and one setting of a seal without any stone in it, I immediately took it up and converted it to my own use, as I was at that time in great distress; this is the whole state of the case, that is the simple way by which I came by the watch, and I trust, my lord and gentlemen of the jury, that though there are many stories told of this kind in court, that you will consider the watch might be taken out of my Lord Stormont's bureau and placed there for purposes, which I don't know, it was said in Bow-street, that the Lord Stormont had employed a carpenter to mend his bureau; the bureau has been left open several times, I understand from what his Lordship said. I was bred at Westminster school myself, I have received a liberal education; I am well known by many of the first respectability, who are now employed on his Majesty's service; I have been respected by all ranks of officers;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300116"/>it is not very probable that I would throw myself in the way where the watch was stolen from, in a place where there is not an officer all about the Abbey but what knows me very well; I therefore trust you, gentlemen of the jury, will consider the circumstance, and make every allowance that the case will admit; and I trust my lord, to your mercy, and the uprightness of an English jury; I have nobody to call but Mr. Coulthurst.</p>

On coming home through Lincoln's inn-fields, returning to my lodgings, I saw a person who looked very hard at me; my lodgings are in Mason's-yard, Duke-street, Piccadilly; he looked very hard at me, and I thought it had been some body that knew me, (this was in Lincoln's-inn-fields, that side next to Holborn, he met me, I was going towards Duke-street,) I turned back and immediately found it was nobody that I knew, and I walked my way home; he immediately came up to me, turned back from the way he was going, and came up to me, said what a fine night, and what fine girls were passing; and further said, if I chose I might go and spend the evening with two at his lodgings, which were in London-street, Tottenham-court-road; after some conversation I agreed to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop, or are you a journeyman? - I was a shopman at that time. We came to where he said he lodged, and then he said that he had forgot himself, there was a person there then that would not let him bring any girls in, but she would be gone presently, and he did not wish to go in till this same person was gone; he immediately asked me to take a walk up to the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road, where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300117"/>drank six-pennyworth of negus, which I paid for; then we returned down towards London-street again. He then said, on recollection, he did not wish to go to his lodging that night, that he had an appointment at a house that he was well acquainted with, to spend the evening with some girls that were to be there, with which I then thought to return home. He persuaded me to take a walk with him as far as there; when we came to the house he knocked at the door; this was in <placeName id="t17931030-75-crimeloc399">Little Newport-street, Newport Market</placeName>

            , by the best enquiry I could make. He went and secured the door by putting his back against it; says he, there is no girls here, and if you do not deliver what you have about you I will blow your brains out; on which I went towards the door, somewhat alarmed at that expression, because it was what I little expected; but there was a table standing near the door, on which was a candle, he comes up to the table and thurst his hand into my left hand coat pocket, and took from thence, two muslin neckcloths; he took these, and thrust his hand in again, and took out a roll of ribbon, about eight yards and a quarter, pink sattin; while he was taking that, I endeavoured to take out a silk handkerchief which I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance? - I did all in my power to prevent his taking any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to prevent his taking what he did? did you struggle with him? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him put his hand in quietly into your pocket? - I begged him not to do it. While he was taking out the pink sattin I endeavoured to take out a silk handkerchief with some cash tied up at one end of it, to conceal it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no money mentioned in the indictment? - No, he did not take any, he perceived the handkerchief, and said, give me hold of that handkerchief; I did not give him the handkerchief, I put this handkerchief up under the back part of my coat, with the money tied up in it, he wanted to know if I had no money about me, I told him I had none but three-pennyworth of halfpence, which was in my waistcoat pocket, not owning to what I had in my handkerchief; he did not take that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the time he thrust his hand into your pocket, did he lay hold of you in any way? - He laid hold of me by the side of my coat to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would blow your brains out, had he any pistol? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand? - I saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that is all that is lost? - All that I can recollect or swear to his taking away; he demanded my buckles, I made resistance, and he said he would not take them as they would be of little value; he then opened the door and walked down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be you got there? - Between the hours of nine and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after that? - He walked down stairs; I followed him, and he told the landlord going down stairs, which I suspected to be the landlord at least, it was some man standing by the side of the stairs, that he was surprised the girls did not come, and when they did, desired they would wait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300118"/>till he returned, then I walked on to go home as fast as I could, and went along Leicester-fields, where I was followed by this same person, the prisoner at the bar, there at the bottom of Leicester-fields he again took hold of me by the coat, and said, if you don't deliver up either the buckles or handkerchief, I will blow your brains out; on which I did not know what to do, I plucked off my coat from me, and I ran away from him, up the side of the Square, and up Leicester-street, then running along a street which goes along the top of Leicester-street, I went up Wardour-street, and along Coventry-street, till I came to the Hay-market, and went into Jermyn-street, and went on to Well-street, there I stopped quite out of breath, I could not run any further; in about a minute, or very soon after, he came up to me again, he said, I know you have property, and if you don't let me have something more, at another time I shall serve you the same sauce; he likewise said, he should know me, see me where he would; there was nothing passed but that, but he walked away from me, which is all I believe that passed at that present time, till Saturday the 5th of the same month, October, this was on Wednesday the 2d. I was going up to the Green Man, and Still, in Oxford-street, with a box, and turned down New Bond-street to the Green Man and Still, and I saw the prisoner, and called to my mind that it was the same person who robbed me, on which I kept my eyes on him, and I walked further down the street till I came to some house, which I thought I would go in to get assistance to take him; I went into a house somewhere in the street, and got the assistance of a person that was in the tap room, I don't know his name, he is not here, he was discharged at Marlborough-street, and I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - I did, and took him to Marlborough-street. When I first took hold of his collar, I said, you are the man that robbed me; after some words he said, pray loose my collar, and I will go along with you; I was first going for Bow-street, not knowing of Marlborough-street, till some people told me; turning the way for Marlborough-street he said, he would make me any satisfaction if I would let him go; on which I said, I wanted no satisfaction but to take him to justice. In going in at the door, when he found I would not release him, he said, then damn you, I will be revenged of you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. A very probable story you have been telling indeed. You never saw the prisoner before the time you met him in the Square? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual with you to fall into conversation with a person going along? - Not usual.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived at that time with some mercer? - No, I had lived in a shop, but I was out of place at that time; I was out of place since the 12th of January last, I was under a view of getting into a situation for myself; I was then going to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge? - With one Simkin, a coachman; he drives for a gentleman, a Mr. Dean, in Mason's-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live there now? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is as remarkable for telling probable stories as you are perhaps.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever recover your property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - When he was examined at Marlborough-street an officer, two of them at least went to where they found his lodgings, not in London-street, but in Titchfield-street, there with a search warrant they found the things; one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300119"/>officer is here, Hamilton, with the property; the ribbon was found first of all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe your loss before the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Was this your own property that was taken from you, or did it belong to any other person? - It was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by it? - The neck-cloth I had in my possession when I left London, the ribbon I bought of my master the second day before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the other articles? - They were also bought to the best of my recollection, of the same person at the time I lived with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your master recollects you bought all these articles of him? - No, I don't suppose he does, but the shopman recollects the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you went along with this man for the very proper decent purpose of getting women? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, I suppose, without his assistance know any person of this description, you found women so scarce in this town? - Why yes, I could have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was better to get into their company through the means of a stranger that would not hurt your character? - I was not going with women, I was going that night home, and did not intend to go with any women till it was hinted to me by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing in the course of this progress that you have described? - Yes, I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you complain of being short of cash when you had so much in your handkerchief? - I did not tell him I was short of cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not desire him to make a little money of these things, nor did you put them into his hands as security for payment of the reckoning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But what made you call out so at the time you gave him the things? - I made no alarm at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your fear that made you call out so lustily? - I did not call out at at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between you then past very quiet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you state to the man of the house that he had robbed you? - I know of no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed him down stairs, and you had time so to have done.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300120"/>Q. Was there any light in the room? - He had got a light in his hand; I had not the presence of mind to see then whether I was robbed or not; he said, how are you? that was what passed at the present time; in the morning when I awaked I found myself robbed of all my money, except half a crown, and sixpence, and some halfpence, which was twenty guineas, and a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else sleep in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find your breeches in the morning? - I found them by my bed side taken from under my bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went to bed? - Under my bolster; I alarmed the house in the morning when I found myself robbed; I stated the business to the landlord what happened, and he told me that after I had gone to bed a man came up stairs, and the person came down again, and as such he suspected that this man might have robbed his house; I asked him why he did not stop that man? I told him he came up stairs, and came into my room; he said he came up for he thought the sheets might have gone off the bed; I asked him why he did not acquaint me of the business when he came into my room? he said the reason was that he was afraid that I should have no rest afterwards, supposing I found myself robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your money or note? - No, I came down in the morning, and when I was talking to him about the business, I told him I thought it was an odd kind of business, and he said he would go with me to seek about it, but I thought it was best to drop the acquaintace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by these twenty-three guineas and five pound note? - I had it of Mr. Holland. I had saved it with him; I put all my money in my fob when I came from Southend.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in Mr. Holland's service saving this money? - Six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it you had left Mr. Holland? - About ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you worth when you left him? - As nigh as I can tell I might have three, or four and thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you any money at the time you parted with him? - I had twenty nine shillings and two-pence a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did Mr. Holland pay you the last week? - He paid me one pound nine shillings and two pence, the week's wages; I was foreman of the carpenters and joiners; he paid me not himself, but his clerk paid me this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he paid you the money before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How much might your board and lodging cost? - Sometimes seven or eight shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you live on that? - Sometimes I had a pint or two; I was paid the first part of the summer for two extradinary days.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you applied to Mr. Holland? - I applied to Mr. Holland last Sunday, to state the business to him, and he desired me to go to Sir Sampson Wright; I saw Mr. Holland this morning, and he said he misunderstood me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you ask Mr. Holland whether you could or could not recover the money against the landlord of the house, in which you was robbed? - No, sir, I did not ask Mr. Holland about it; I stated the business to Mr. Holland.</p>

               <p>

Did you say any thing to that purpose? it is last Sunday only; now I ask you if the purpose of your business to Mr. Holland, was not to know whether you could get that money of the landlord by an action? - Not to my knowledge; Mr. Holland told me to go up to the office, and he told me that I could take the common law, if I could not do any thing else in the affair, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never ask him whether you could ever recover or get any money of this man at the bar? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single man or a married man? - A single man; I have got a mother to support.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you work with any body now? - I have got a rupture; I am waiting to go with a gentleman abroad. When I left that employ at Southend I went down to Suffolk.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell the name of any one person that you have done any work for in the last ten weeks? - I did some work for

               <p>Q. You did not see a person in the house the over night, that very night? - Not that I suspected of any kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never say that you had that note of one of Mr. Holland's clerks about nine weeks ago? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you say to Mr. Stirling, the attorney, Craven-street, that you took the note about five or six months ago? - I never saw the man to my knowledge in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say to that gentleman that you had that note five or six months ago? - Not to my knowledge, I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Can you swear you did not? it was but last Saturday, just a week from this day that you was robbed? - I might say I had the note, I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q.This was on Thursday last you saw this gentleman. On your oath did not you say that you had that bank note five or six months ago? - Not to my knowledge, I might say it to some gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you say so to that gentleman? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, man, you must know what you said the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear Mr. Stirling, and ask him that question.</p>
               <p>- STIRLING sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw this man at Bow-street on Thursday last, I asked him if he could tell me the number of the note, in order that it might be traced; he told me then that he could not tell the number, that he had had the note between five and six months; I am very positive these were the words, and more than that I repeated them to Mr. Roberts, and several gentlemen that were in the office at Bow street. This was on Thursday in the morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to sleep there on Sunday night, a young man and I were both together there. In the morning between five and six o'clock I awoke, the chamber door was open, which I shut when I went to bed; I spoke to the young man; there were a great many lodgers in the house, but not in the same room, the door was open when I awoke, I supposed it was done by some lodgers down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Salmon. Is there lodgers in the house? - There is, but they are all creditable people, and have lodged there for several years. He says he called to me, but he did not; he only lodged there one night before, about a week ago. I went to the Vinegar-yard, and they knew nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When you awoke what became of the prisoner? - She was not in bed with me, but the other woman was in bed with me; she told me she saw her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again? - Yes, the officer that took the prisoner shewed it me before the justice, and I saw my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever know the woman before, that took you to this house? - No, I never saw her in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. You met her in the day time, in Whitechapel. What sort of a house is this that she took you to? - I am sure I I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a house of ill same, is it not? - She keeps lodging beds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found your watch afterwards; who had your watch? - Mr. Allen, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard that the watch was found in the bed? - I did not find it there; I heard the officer say that it was found in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody else with you in the room but this woman and yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the woman about the watch, and she said she knew nothing about it? - She said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went there? - I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you been drinking? - A couple of pints of beer, and one thing and another.</p>
               <p>Q. And perhaps a glass of gin or two. Do you mean to say you was perfectly sober? half seas over perhaps? - I was not drunk, but I was not perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having any spoons? - Yes, he lost one about the last of September, and I missed it the 1st of October, and I missed some before that, there were six in all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. From where did you miss them? - From the place where I kept them, below stairs in a cupboard; I had seen them on the Monday before they were taken, the prisoner was the only person that I thought could have them because she was a charewoman in the house, I went and found some spoons at a pawnbroker's in Berwick-street.</p>
               <p>- BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I have got two spoons, a table spoon and two tea spoons; I took the table spoon of the prisoner at the bar; I questioned her at the time she brought it, who she brought it from, she said from one Mr. Clark of Margaret-street. I had known the prisoner for years by using the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when that was? - On the 30th of August; I took in the table spoon, there was a tea spoon that was taken in the 9th of May; I did not take in the other tea spoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever consent to leave the goods? - No, I never consented to leave the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever return back to the stable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand the goods of his servant? - I did; I asked his servant for them. The prisoner would not return them, he told me I might get my money how I could, he was disappointed in getting his money, and I must be disappointed too.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go afterwards the next day? - I did not. That day I went back to the stable, and told the man I must have the goods, for his master would not have them, and I sent to my master by one of the lads.</p>
               <p>Q. What justice did you take him to? - To Mr. Graham at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for not paying? - That he could not get the money of the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand the money of the prisoner? - I did, and the goods, he said, I had delivered the goods and I might get the money how I could.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did not he come and surrender as soon as the warrant was out against him? - He did not, he committed the fraud on the 9th, and I did not see him at the office till the 17th.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this transaction yourself? - I detected the prisoner taking it; I am a linen draper, she was with another lady that I had been selling some articles to; I saw her take it and put it into her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in company with the other woman? - The other woman bought several things and paid me for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300128"/>them to the amount of seventeen, eighteen, or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this cambrick? - Eight shillings. I charged her with it and desired her to give it up; she took it off the counter, I was on one side of the counter and she was on the other; I charged her with it and desired her to give it up; she would not, she was searched in the parlour and it was taken from her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a very young woman, I see she came into your shop with Mrs. Sweeting who is a woman of character? - She is, and I believe the young woman's friends are respectable.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to you had bought goods three or four times the value of this cambrick? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. This cambrick of course being only a yard and a quarter and three nails, lays within a very narrow compass; you thought you saw her, and perhaps you did see her put it into her pocket, I believe she said at first she had not got it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know how it was found? - I did not see it found.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not a common shop lifter that she was with? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see this young woman lay her handkerchief on the counter? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>I did not search the prisoner, but I was present and saw the cambrick taken from her pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say? - She seemed very much frightened when it was found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This piece of cambrick is an article that lays in a very small compass; I would ask you whether it might not be enclosed in an handkerchief very innocently by an innocent person? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible? - It is not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. This young lady desired to be searched I believe? - The person that was with her desired she should be searched, to which she made no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. On searching her you found nothing but this cambrick? - No, the person in the room said, let us look at this handkerchief? and opening it the cambrick came out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her an excellent character.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to my bar with an elderly woman along with her, and they had two glasses of liquor poured out to them; the prisoner at the bar offered a six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it called for the glass of gin? - The prisoner at the bar; my son said he believed it was a bad sixpence, I looked at it and I said, this is a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that six-pence come into your possession? - I took it from the woman, and afterwards gave it her back again; she had not drank any liquor, and I did not care if she went about her business; they did not drink the two glasses of gin till they see whether the six-pence would be taken or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked for this gin? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gin paid for or no? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it offered to be paid for? - It was, with this six-pence, this woman offered the six-pence, I gave it her back again and told her it was a bad one, and I did not chuse to take it, she said she had taken it of a baker in change of a shilling where she had bought the two-penny loaf which she had in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the baker's name? - No, I asked her what she had done with the remainder of the change, she said she had laid it out in necessary articles as she was coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she said that she had parted with the change as she was coming along? - Positively.</p>
               <p>Q Out of that change from the shilling she must have received ten-pence, would that have paid for the gin that she asked for? - It was only two-pence for her to pay. I told her that I believed that she was a very bad kind of woman, and that she was putting off this money; she said it was no such thing, and was rather pert; I told somebody to tell Jostling to step in; he was in the house, and Jostling stept in, and said he thought he had some knowledge of her face, Jostling said, I will search her, I said do as you please about that, the other woman she got off, Jostling laid hold of this woman first and searched her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300131"/>Q. Was she asked any questions about money before Jostling searched her? - Jostling said he knew her face very well, and she was a putter off of bad money. She said she had no more money about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - I am positive, she said so before Jostling came in, and after too; when Jostling came to search her he found the four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jostling search her? - Yes, I was on one side of the counter and Jostling the other, he took first out of her pocket four-pennyworth of halfpence loose which would more than have paid for the gin; Jostling says, what is in this purse? she did not seem to know what was in it, a purse? she said, she did not know any thing about it, I believe she said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jostling draw the purse from her pocket? - Yes, and he opened the purse before her, and there was in it six six-pences of the same sort that she had produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first six-pence she tendered to you? - I took it out of her hand myself, and have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other sixpences that were taken from her? - Jostling has them and the purse.</p>

               <p>I am constable; I took this woman in Towers's house, I happened to be in Mr. Towers's tap room, and I heard of some women offering a bad six-pence; directly I came into the bar and I thought I knew this woman, when I went into the bar Mr. Towers asked her whether she had got any more money about her? she said no, the prisoner is the woman, I searched her, and found a purse with six bad six-pences, that was all I found in the purse; there were four-pennyworth of halfpence loose; then I took her into custody, and had her before a magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he drest? - Much as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he trowsers on? - Not that I know, I was very busy at the time, and I could not get out of my place, I sent for Mr. Peat, the officer of the market; I told him to take him into a public house and search him, accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any more bad money than that bad shilling? - Yes, I have got four, he tendered them into my hand for payment, he gave me nine shillings, four bad and five good ones, I gave him none back only one; I never returned the other eight to him, I have kept them from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received the money in the streets for goods, two or three days before, I thought they were all good.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search further? - I then proceeded to search him, and I felt him up and down his thighs, and I found there was a lump, and I unbuttoned the knees of his breeches, and he had got a pair of drawers under his breeches, there I found this paper of bad money, the good money was all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any good money among these? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time? - Yes, he requested of me to let him go, and to walk along with him to the London Spa, where he had obtained change for a guinea on the Saturday evening before I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no paper nor any thing like, he found the good and bad together.</p>

               <p>Court to Peat. Whereabouts did you find afterwards this paper? - Between his breeches and his drawers, when I unbuttoned his knees I took out that paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received all this money for my goods in the street; this Sunday morning that I went to buy a quarter of a hundred of mackarel I paid him nine shillings out of my pocket, and I thought it was all very good as ever I had in my life, and I was putting the money into my fob, and it went inside of the lining, Mr. Peat took none from my pocket, it all sliped down that I had, there was no paper about me, and if I had any bad money about me I would not pay it to any salesmaster of Billingsgate, who are counted the sharpest men in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Finch. Had you any reason to suspect him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - Pretty near a year, he deals sometimes in the market, and sometimes get other employ, where he can get the most money.</p>

               <p>Q. You have told my lord exactly what Mr. Mendoza said to you when he came the second time? - Then he said I am come, or I must have some handkerchief, Mr. Decosta has sent me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that was it? - As nigh as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for six pieces or six dozen? - He asked for six dozen, and not six pieces, I am most certain. To take me on my oath I cannot say whether pieces or dozen, but to the best of my knowledge it was dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. He had bought some of you? - He had, Mr. Decosta has lent me several hundred pounds, I thought I could not refuse Mr. Decosta, and as he came along with Mr. Decosta I could not refuse him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many transactions have you had with Mendoza by the desire of Mr. Decosta? - I don't know that ever he came above twice in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he never came above twice? - I will take my sacred oath that he never came but twice in one day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times has he came without Mr. Decosta, and as he said by Mr. Decosta's orders? - He never came but that time with Mr. Decosta's orders, the other times Mr. Decosta was along with him; the first time he came, he came from the country with Mr. Decosta, and Mr. Decosta remained in town the same day, and he returned and paid me for these handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the afternoon Mr. Mendoza came again? - He did, and paid for what he had in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come again after he had come twice that day? - A few days afterwards, whether it was two or three days I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give credit to him on Mr. Decosta having sent him, or on his saying that Mr. Decosta had sent him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you had done twice before, once without Mr. Decosta, and once with him? - No, only once.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the second time when he came in the afternoon, that he came with Mr. Decosta? - He came in, but Mr. Decosta was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he present when he asked you for some pieces of handkerchiefs? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not take on you to swear whether Mr. Decosta was present or not? - He was in the house, but whether he was in the room or not I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the handkerchiefs on credit? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. The second he had also on the credit of Mr. Decosta? - I don't know whether it was on the credit of Mr. Decosta or not.</p>

             in London, a linen draper wholesale, we never sell less than a piece.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Pray how long have you been in partnership with Mr. Levy? - Much about that time, just before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life had you been in before? - A dealer in all manner of articles, jewellery, watches and linen drapery, diamonds and every thing, and deal in them now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in partnership with Mr. Levy? - Ever since sometime in May.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have been a witness in this court before? - I never was, only I was called to the character of a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never was in this court only to give a man a character? - I will take my oath and ten oaths unless it was to give one man a particular acquaintance of mine, a character, that was an old man, his name was De Frize, he was here for finding a bank note, I gave him a character.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of being a witness at Worcester? - I was no witness at Worcester, I was quite the contrary; a particular person found a saddle bag of letters, and brought them to me, and I think to my credit and honour I brought the whole up to Sir. Sampson Wright's, and delivered it up to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you admitted on evidence for the crown, as an accomplice at Worcester? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give evidence at that trial afterwards? - I told the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you taken up for the robbery yourself? - Who? I taken up! never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Lee? - Yes, by reputation all the world know him; I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Lee, and did Mr. Lee advise you to tell the story about the Worcester business? - After I came to town to surrender myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you was not a witness at Worcester, but quite the contrary, what did you mean? - I went down to tell the truth against the young man that had given me the things; I went down by order of Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he sent somebody with you? - No, I went down by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You said also just now that you surrendered yourself? - I went down to Worcester to sell my goods, a young man knocked at the door where I was in the room, and told me that he had found something on the road of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed him of course? - He shewed me a great quantity of bank notes and other notes, I asked him how he came by them? He said he found them going along the road; I was very much frightened thinking that it belonged to the post office, and it turned out so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you give him for them? - How can you say that I gave him any thing for them?</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with them? - I came immediately to London, and told my father of it; my father says, if you will take my advice, I would have you go immediately to some magistrate, for I don't believe the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is this ago? - I am about twenty-eight now; this was about ten or eleven years ago. The young man then went away from me directly, and I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, and told him the things were given me so and so, and he made me sign a paper, and told me that I was to appear at the assizes at Worcester. He did not commit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300136"/>me, nor take any security in the least; I don't know whether he asked my father about security it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying before, that you was not a witness, but on the contrary?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You came from Worcester to London to surrender; you did not say any thing till you came to London. What did you not talk to the farmers on the road about this business, or did you come to London first, and stay till there was a reward offered? - No, I had no reward at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the young man taken up at Worcester; and afterwards you surrendered in town? - I don't know whether he was taken or not taken before; I don't know yet whether he was taken before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go before a magistrate at Worcester? - Because I was very young, I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You was old enough to take care of that property that you found in that odd way? - It was brought to me by a person that did find it; Mr. Isaacs can tell you more about the business than I know.</p>
               <p>Court. You was in partnership with Mr. Levy in May; had you articles? - We had, but we have destroyed them some time since.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it dissolved? - About a fortnight or three weeks back; the business could not answer, it was in the linen drapery line.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to dissolve the partnership? - The trade did not answer in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to go about the country? - And before this revolution in France, I used to travel into Flanders and Brabant, but since I cannot go; I used to deal very much in the linen drapery articles, watches, and other articles, and used to buy some for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mendoza? - Ever since I was a child, this eight or nine years by sight, but never having any connection with him, any further than by reputation.</p>
               <p>Q. Never dealt with him? - Never had any dealings with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apply to him for the money of these handkerchiefs? - I did; I applied to him when I heard that Mr. Decosta had not sent him; I did not apply to him for the money, but for the goods; the profit was not so great, and I would as soon take the goods again; I let him have the goods on account of Mr. Decosta, and I sold them very cheap to Mr. Decosta.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell cheaper to Mr. Decosta than to any body else? - I don't know that I did, but he is a man that has lent me great sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say on your oath, that you sold to Decosta at a cheaper rate than to any body else? - If Mr. Decosta came into the place, and to say what he wanted, he might have it at prime cost for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any difference in the price of the articles you sold to Mr. Decosta, and those you sold to Mendoza? you sold three pieces to Mendoza before, did you make any difference of Mendoza's paying for them or Mr. Decosta? - He paid twenty-four shillings for them; the price depends on the fineness, in the same parcels we pick out some finer and some coarser, which makes a difference in the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write to Mendoza about it, and desire him to give you back the handkerchiefs? - I cannot recollect what I wrote to him; I remember some words that I wrote to him, instead of writing to him at first I did not, I went to a house in Duke's-place where he very often comes to; I said, if you do not give me back the goods that you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300137"/>taken from me under Mr. Decosta's name, I will get a warrant for you; he did not come with the goods; I saw him two or three times, and he made some frivolous excuse; at last he told me, if you ask me again for the goods, I will give you as good a licking as ever you had in your life. I always accused him of taking them in Mr. Decosta's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the letter, and see if it is your hand writing? - It may be mine; I cannot tell that that is mine or not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath will you swear that that is not your hand writing? - I cannot say it is not, nor can I say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you believe? - It looks like my hand writing; I believe if it is not mine it is well made after it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer. Do you believe that to be your hand writing or not? - I cannot swear it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't ask you to swear? - I believe it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the contents? - If he did not produce goods or money, I should get a warrant for him, and go to some magistrate and tell the case.</p>
               <p>The letter read.</p>
               <p>If you do not send me my handkerchiefs this day, which you have taken from me, on commission to return them the next day, or my money, I have plenty of witnesses, you will feel the effects; and be assured if you do not come by to morrow you will find the ill consequences of it yourself.</p>

The next day I saw him again, he asked me if I was going to town? I said I was; then, says he, I will go with you, and he went with me, and he took three dozen of handkerchiefs the 24th of May, then after having taken them there he went there again, and got six dozen of handkerchiefs. I know no more about the matter.</p>
