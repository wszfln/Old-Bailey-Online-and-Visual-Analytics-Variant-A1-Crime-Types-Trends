In consequence of instructions on 2nd March I went to Newington Causeway about 3.15 in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner leaving the shop of Mr. Kino, a tailor—he was about to get into a cab when I went up to him and said "My name is Taylor, I am a detective officer of the City police, and have to arrest you on suspicion of forging letters of credit on the London Joint Stock Bank," he said "Yes"—I said "You will have to accompany me to the City"—on the way he said "Let me understand you distinctly"—I then repeated what I have already said—at the Bow Lane station he said "What am I waiting here now for?"—I said "For Sergeant Moss, who has the case in hand, and who will explain matters to you"—he said "The only transaction I have had with the Joint Stock Bank was a cheque for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he handed this cheque to me—he said "I know I am a wide man, and don't want to be shown up"—I asked him to produce every<lb/>thing he had got about him, and he handed me over a variety of articles—he took two small bottles from his pocket and was about to dash them on the floor—I took them from his hand and said "What have you there?"—he said "It is medicine"—at the station he gave the name of Charles Cherwood—he refused his address. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 51<hi rend="italic">l. cheque was signed J. Watson, payable to Charles Cherwood, and so endorsed</hi>.)</p>

On Saturday, 2nd March, I saw the prisoner at the Bow Lane station—I told him he would be charged with forging 10 letters of credit or circular notes, eight of which had been changed at the Grand Hotel at Paris—he said, "I have never been across the water; I have never been to Paris"—I saw Taylor take from him this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note, No. 822, 525, dated 13th June, 1877, six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. 16, 555 to 16, 560, dated 11th August, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and a few shillings in silver—I produce the two bottles I saw at the station marked D and E—after the prisoner had been charged at the station I went to 39, St. Mark's Road, Kennington, which I knew to be his address—I had caused him to be watched—in the front room, ground floor, I found on a table this camel-hair brush and a small piece of sponge, and in a glass on the table I found some liquid—I put that in a bottle labelled A—I also found a bottle, marked B, in the same room, and another, marked C, containing size—in the pocket-book taken from the prisoner at the station I found these two camel-hair brushes—at his lodgings I found a seven-barrel revolver, loaded, a box of cartridges, and a pawn-ticket dated 23rd February, 1878, in the name of George Wood—I gave the bottles to Dr. Saunders—at the time he was charged I did not know of this case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Governor of Newgate—since the prisoner's apprehension, and during the examination before the Magis<lb/>trate, and after his committal, he has been under my charge—I received this letter; he sent it to me—I read it, and saw him—I told him I had read his letter, that it was impossible I could assist him in a matter of that kind, that I had sent it to the authorities, and if I heard anything from them I would let him know—this other letter he also sent to me on 11th April—I put the date on it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">These letters were read as follows</hi>:—"28th March, 1878.—Governor,—Pardon the liberty I am taking in addressing you, but really you seem to be the only man I have met since coming to this country who seems to have mind enough to grasp an idea of some magniture, which I am about to present to you as briefly as possible. Some years since I made the acquaintance of a noted forger, the one, in fact, who did the most of the work for those people McDonald, Bidwell, &amp;c., who are called the great Bank of England forgers. Through him I became acquainted with others, who, knowing me as a sporting man who was ' all right, ' did not hesitate about talking in my presence. In fact, I admit that I assisted them in various ways, both as a chemist and as a man who thoroughly understood business matters of all kinds. About a year since my friend whom I have mentioned came to me and said that he was sick of the business, and wanted to leave it altogether. He therefore proposed that I should communicate with the banks and bankers of the city of New York and with the Treasury Department at Washington, offering for a certain yearly sum (about 10 per cent. of the average annual losses from such causes) to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060006"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">utterly prevent all forging and counterficting</hi>. The parties with whom I communicated were very much taken with the idea, and it seemed at one time as if it was a certainty that it would be taken up, but unfortunately the Government detectives got wind of it (and they are all more or less in collusion with the counterfeiters), and they were able, through their backers in the Treasury and in Congress, to prevent an appropriation being made. In New York city we also were disappointed, for we could get no <hi rend="italic">concerted</hi> action; each man we saw was pleased with the idea, but when it came to patting his hand in his pocket it was another thing; therefore it fell through—at least for the present. When I was sent for to come over here (which I will explain to you at some future time), I fully intended to try and make some arrangement with the authorities here of the same kind. I have had no opportunity of doing so until now, and let me make the offer to you. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> make all the arrangements, and I will guarantee that for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum we will prevent <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> forgers from plying their vocation in <hi rend="italic">London</hi>; for another 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we will prevent them from working in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, and for a third 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from swindling any bank or banking house in <hi rend="italic">Great Britain</hi>. This may seem to you an impossibility, but let me assure you, upon my honour, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. You would be surprised were I to tell you how many professional forgers there are. Why, if you will believe me, all the forgers, counterfeiters, engravers, photographers, and chemists (who are connected with crooked business) in the <hi rend="italic">world</hi> can be counted upon your fingers. Therefore, you see how easy it would be for me, for instance, with the assistance of say two men in London, three men in the States, and one in Paris, one in Berlin, and one in Rome, to have timely notice of whatever was coming off and <hi rend="italic">prevent them from working on our territory</hi>. In fact, we would act as lightning conductors, so to speak. The men whom I would employ are all men who have been years in the business, and who in the folly of it, they are willing to do anything for a living, but still would not consent to <hi rend="italic">give any one away</hi> and have them arrested; they would merely warn them not to work here. In fact, it would be something like the Preventive Service in which, I believe, it was not unusual to find old smugglers, and they made the most efficient officers. There are a thousand things I could say to you in favour of my plan, and should you see fit to question me about it, I will be happy to give you all needed information. In order to show you that I know whereof I speak, let me inform you that it was intended to flood the London and European market this summer, during the Exposition, with all kinds of forgeries. The French bank notes, for which some men were arrested last month, were a part of what were to be used, but the men who had them got hard up, I suppose, and had to let some of them go. For this market there has been manufactured more than <hi rend="italic">one million of pounds</hi> of stuff, principally bonds. There were to be sold through certain brokers in the City, two of whom <hi rend="italic">I know</hi>. About 75,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bonds, all ready for use, except a few minutes' work on each, are now awaiting my order on the other side. If it is required, I will send for them as soon as I am liberated, and have them sent to one of the parties who has promised them. There are a lot ready, a large amount of drafts of a certain steamship company, a few samples are here, but the bulk is on the other side. These I can get also at any time. In fact, I could mention, were it necessary, a dozen different things now ready or nearly ready for this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060007"/>
               <p>market. Will the Treasury and the Banking Association allow them to come, and thousands of people to be robbed of their all, for the sake of sending <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to prison for a few years? Now, Governor, you are the man to take this thing in hand. It would be worth a thousand a year to you, if not more, and all you would have to do would be to transmit my daily or weekly report to the proper persons. You would not be known to any one but me, nor would I be known to any one but you and the people under my control, <hi rend="italic">who would not know each other</hi>. At least, they would not know that each was in my employ. Please think seriously over this matter, and let me know your opinion at your earliest con<lb/>venience. By so doing, you will oblige, yours respectfully (signed), Chas. Cherwood." "Gaol of Newgate, April 11th, 1878. To Mr. Abrams or the solicitor for the Central Bank. Gentlemen,—I hear that the utterer of the forged check is now under arrest for some offense: so if you want him you can fetch him. Don't you think it was unwise on your part to refuse to take advantage of the liberal offers I made you more than two weeks since? Perhaps Mr. Chapman never showed you my ' written propositions' with a synopsis of what I was able and willing to do. Did he? Please answer at once, and oblige, yours, &amp;c., Chas, Cherwood. It may not be too late yet."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective H</hi>). On 5th April I went with Thick to 9, Henry Street, Stepney, about 9.30, and found the street door open—I knocked, Read opened it; I asked her if she lived there, she said "Yes"—I asked her if any one else lived there, she said "Yes, two others lives here"—I said "What have you got in the room?"—she said "I don't know, you had better look"—I did look, and in a small cupboard, unlocked, I found this ladle with white metal in it, two files with metal on them, a spoon, a small portion of a mould, which afterwards broke away in my hand, and some plaster-of-paris and sand—all those things are used in making counterfeit coin—I waited till 3 o'clock next morning—Stone came home about 1 o'clock; I knew him by the name of Morris—I was watching outside and followed him in—I asked him if he lived in that room, he said "Yes"—I showed him the things I found in the cupboard, and asked him who they belonged to—he said they did not belong to him—I asked what he had about him—he said "I suppose this is what you want", put his hand in his pocket, and took out seven shillings separately folded in thin paper—I asked him if he had any more about him—he said "No"—I put my hand into his trousers pocket, and among other money found this bad shilling—I said that I believed the shillings were made of the same metal that was in the ladle—I think he said mat he did not know—Read was in the room all the time—I took Stone to the station, leaving Thick in charge of the room and of Read—I afterwards went back to the house, and about 2.30 King knocked at the outside shutters and came in—I said "Good morning, King"—he said "Good morning"—I said "You know me?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Who rents this room?"—he said "I do, I pay the rent," and that he had been there since November—I asked him who those things in the cupboard belonged to—he said "They belong to me"—I said "I have just taken Stone to the station, I found eight bad shillings on him, I believe you have been making them here"—he said "Yes, it is no use telling you, for you know all about it"—I searched him, but found nothing—Read was there all the time, but I don't think she took any part in the conversation—when I knocked at the door I asked her if Mr. Hartley was there, alluding to the prisoner King—I said, "He is a one-armed man;" she said, "Yes"—I asked her if any<lb/>body else lived there; she said, "Yes, my husband"—I asked her what her husband's name was; she said, "Morris;" and when Stone came home she said, "That is my husband," and that they had lived there a week—I took King and Read to the station—I locked up the room, and gave the landlady the key, taking the counterfeit coin with me—I went back on Sunday evening about 8.30, got the key from the landlady, and searched the room—we found a crack in the boards six or eight inches wide; I took up some more boards, and found some plaster-of-</p>

               <p>paris, and then the landlady put her hand under the flooring and found this double mould to make two shillings at once—the flooring had been broken previously, but it did not appear recent—there was a piece of cloth over the opening in the floor—I have seen King and Stone together once—Read told me that she was not married to Morris, but only lived with him.</p>

I live at 9, Henry Street, Stepney—I let my ground-floor front room to Mr. Hartley, the prisoner King—he came in on 7th November—he said that he was a ticket-writer—I did not see Stone till a month or six weeks after that, and I did not see Read till a week before her arrest—I have seen them all three coming backwards and forwards; they had a street-door key and a room-door key, and let themselves in and out—I was not aware of what they were doing, or they should not have stayed there—they always paid me with good money—when they left, the detec<lb/>tive locked the door and gave me the key—I gave it to him again on Sunday, and he opened the door—nobody had been in the room in the mean time—I had kept the key in my pocket, and I had bolted the shutters inside while the detectives were in the room—I went into the room with them on Sunday when they found the mould under the floor—there was a small hole in the floor when the room was taken, and I nailed a piece of cloth over it—in the evening I found that the nails had been taken out and the cloth shoved on one side—Hartley sometimes paid the rent, and sometimes Stone—Read never paid me—there was a blind to the window, which was generally down even in the day-time—when the street door was shut they used to knock at the shutter if one of them was inside.</p>

I live in Bartholomew Road, Kentish Town—I have no business—my wife has private property—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—he is a money lender—I have had many money transactions with him—on 20th August, 1875, I was given into custody by a lawyer's clerk—the charge came before Mr. Vaughan—a remand was granted for a week, and the case proceeded on the 27th, and was withdrawn—I attended and was represented by Mr. George Lewis, jun., and a Mr. Allingham prosecuted—I met the prisoner on 18th March, at Messrs. Digby's, 35, Lincoln's Inn Fields, the solicitors acting generally for my wife and me—we talked about the Grand National race—Mr. Carr, the managing clerk, had to pay the prisoner some money—the prisoner said he could not take interest, but would further advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Carr said the prisoner had better back "Jackal" sfor 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said "I have left off" backing horses, I am not going west, I am going into the City; if you like to risk a telegram I will send one to Atkins "—I did not then know who Atkins was—I know now that I had seen Atkins once before that—he is the manager to the Mischief Tavern</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060027"/>
               <p>—I said I would put the matter beyond a doubt, and would ask Messrs. Digby's permission to allow the answer to the telegram to be sent there—I did so, and then left the office, leaving the prisoner and Carr there—I afterwards went to a public house near the Bankruptcy Court, Portugal Street—the prisoner and a few others were there, backing horses—we discussed about the winner—from there I went to the Napier Hotel, in Holborn, with the prisoner—a Mr. Makins was in the bar—I, the prisoner, and Makings, went to the telegraph office at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, and the prisoner dictated a telegram and I wrote it—it was sent—I and the prisoner then went to Mr. Hooper's, the prisoner's solicitor, 35, Newgate Street, about 12.30—I met a Mr. Lee there, a solicitor, and some others—we went across to the Seven Stars—I there said to Mr. Hooper, Mr. Potts, the landlord, and others, "I have sent a telegram to back 'Jackal' for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they asked if we thought he was likely to win—I, Mr. Hooper, and Mr. Lee, then went to a betting club in the Strand—the prisoner had then left—when we were discussing the merits of Jackal Mr. Hooper said that he should back the horse for two sovereigns—Jackal did not win—Atkins made no demand for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I occupied the same premises both before and after March, and in May I was in treaty with the prisoner to advance money with regard to my wife's pro<lb/>perty, and I had an appointment for me and my wife to meet the prisoner to execute a deed at Messrs. Digby's, at 11 o'clock one day in May—Mr. O'Brien, the prisoner's solicitor, went with us—the prisoner was to meet us there—a conversation took place with respect to the deed with Mr. Digby, in consequence of which I, my wife, and O'Brien left the office—on coming away we met the prisoner—he apologised to Mrs. Parker for being late—Mr. O'Brien said "No matter, Mr. Martin, Mr. Digby will not allow Mrs. Parker to sign the deed"—the prisoner flew in a great rage and said "By God, Mrs. Parker, if yon do not sign that deed I will charge your husband with having given a false name to a telegram, and that will give him seven years—Mrs. Parker said "You may give him 20 if you like, I will not sign that deed"—we then left—I met the prisoner frequently between that interview and when I was taken in custody—he said "There will be a warrant against you one of these fine days"—between 5th July and 20th August I lived at the Hermitage, Epsom—during the remand, when I was on bail, I did not see the prisoner—Chancery proceedings have been taken with respect to the deed, and those proceedings were decided at the beginning of the year—the prisoner swore "I never authorised or requested him," meaning myself, "to send the before-mentioned telegram"—that was false—this was also false, "I never authorised him to use my name for that or any purpose"—I appeared against the prisoner for perjury at the commencement of this year.</p>

I was liable to the prisoner for the bet on "Jackal"—I stood to win or lose—I lost—I paid the following day or the day after—I sent Mr. Carr to pay Atkins—I did not telegraph in my own name because I did not know Atkins—when I laid the information I swore I did not know Atkins by name or sight—I had seen him once, but at that time I thought I had not—I did not owe him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not swear Atkins had not a dishonoured cheque of mine; I was told he had—I was never asked to pay it—I do not know that it was dishonoured; it might be, I cannot say—that was not the reason I did not put my own name</p>

Digby would not let Mrs. Parker sign"—the prisoner said "Never mind, if Mrs. Parker will sign"—I said "I shall not sign"—he said "If you do not sign, by God, I will give your husband seven years for forging my name to a telegram"—I said "You may give him 20 if you like, I shall not sign"—I saw the prisoner several times between May and August—either the prisoner or Hooper said it would be bad for Mr. Parker if I did not sign, as they would prosecute him for forging the prisoner's name to a telegram—after my husband was arrested I saw the prisoner, and also Mr. Hooper, in the prisoner's presence—on 27th August I went to Mr. Hooper's office—the prisoner there said if I did not sign the deed he could not assist me; and Mr. Hooper produced the deed with some erasures and said it was altered; and as the time of the remand was running out I signed, and three minutes afterwards the prisoner went to Bow Street, and at 12 o'clock the charge was withdrawn and my husband was discharged—proceedings have been taken in Chancery, and the Master of the Rolls gave a decision on 14th February—my husband took out a summons a mouth before that.</p>

I am a surgeon, and am resident superintendent of the female department of the Colney Hatch Asylum—the prisoner was under my charge there from 4th April until July, 1872, when she went out on trial—the nature of her mania was madness from drink—she had loss of memory, and she was under the impression that she was poisoned—she wanted to put back three years of her life, and her ideas were generally confused—she was discharged off the books in August, 1872—I was not at home then—the last time I saw her she went out on trial, because I thought it would be better for her—I supposed her to be cured, or she would not have been discharged—she has not been back since that I am aware of—when she was labouring under these delusions she was not able to know that any act she committed was a wrong act, or of knowing the nature and quality of the act—when she was discharged I believed her to be perfectly sane and responsible for her actions—she soon recovered from the excitement.</p>

On 14th March I was on duty in Lansdown Road about 11.40 at night, and saw the male prisoner there speaking to two other men—I went up to them and asked the prisoner what was the matter—he said "We have lost the plate out of our house"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060038"/>
               <p>—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "75, Lansdowne Road"—I said "What time did you miss it?"—he said "I came home about 11.30; after I had been downstairs and taken off my hat and coat, on searching the rooms on my way to bed I missed the plate"—I and Constable Lewis then walked into the hall of the house—the female prisoner came and opened the door of the dining-room and the door of the sideboard which was in the dining-room, and she said in the male prisoner's presence "That is where the plate is gone from, it was wrapped in flannel"—I said "Have you searched the house?"—the male prisoner said "No, we have only been downstairs"—I then went up to the first-floor front bedroom, and on opening the door smoke burst out in my face—I said "You have a fire here"—I then took from the male prisoner a candle which he brought upstairs and entered the room—the smoke was so thick that I could not find the fire, and I had to leave the room—on entering a second time I placed my hand on the mattress; it gave way and the fire rolled out in ray hand; there were three mattresses—I then sent the other constable for the fire-engine; he returned and got water, which I poured on the mattresses and extinguished the fire—the bed-clothing which was on the bed I had previously taken off and rolled up in a ball—I then entered the back bedroom on the same floor—the female prisoner, who held followed me, exclaimed "Oh, some one has got in here; see, they have moved the drawers from the window"—one corner of the drawers had been pushed away from the window; it appeared that they had been in front of the window; there were flower pots on the drawers; the window was closed but unfastened, and the blind was down—I examined the window, there were no marks; there were bars outside, about 8 or 9 inches apart—we then went to the front bedroom second floor, and I there saw a mattress which had very recently been on fire, and a toilet-cover lying on it partly burnt—there was no fire, it was just burning out—I then went downstairs to the first floor again, when I, met Bolton, the fireman, and examined the back room with him—I found no marks of any entry having been made—I don't think any could possibly have been made without leaving marks—I saw Lewis take a box of matches from the table on the first-floor landing; he made some remark to the male prisoner about them, which I did not hear—I was afterwards present when the names and addresses were given—I left about 12.45—the house was quite close to where I first saw the prisoner—I was standing at the corner, and it was only one house from the corner.</p>

I was in plain clothes—the men the prisoner was talk<lb/>ing to were a tradesmen and a man in his employ, and a constable in uniform, on the beat—they were very nearly opposite the house—they are not here—I was standing so close to them that I could overhear their conversation, and I walked up to them—I believe I did not tell the prisoner that I was a constable before I went into the house—the con<lb/>stable in uniform did not go in, he remained at the gate—Lewis went in with me, he was in plain clothes—the prisoner was speaking to the other constable about the plate being lost—I did not inquire where he had been that evening, merely the time he went out and returned—he remained in the house till the fireman came—the mattress was burnt through—I believe it was a wool mattress—there was a hole burnt in it, but it had not spread to the rest of the mattress—that fire had died out recently—</p>

               <p>prisoner called my attention to the chest of drawers which had been re<lb/>moved from the window in the back room first floor, and said that some one had made an entry there—the drawers had been moved—there were some flower-pots on the drawers; they were top-heavy, and it would have been impossible to have entered the window and pushed them aside without overturning them—there were not the slightest marks on the window—I examined the garden; there were no traces of any footmarks or of a ladder—the soil was soft—we searched the house throughout from top to bottom, and did not find the slightest marks of any entry—I asked the female if she had any idea of the cause of the fire; she said she could not account for it—I asked what time she went out—she said about 6 o'clock—I asked what time she returned—she said about half-past 11 o'clock—I asked her if she had a light of any kind, gas or a candle, previous to going out—she said there was no occasion for it, as it was quite light when she went out—I asked if there had been a fire in the room—she said, "No"—I asked if she had had any matches about the place—she said "No"—I asked how she found the premises on returning—she said that on opening the street door, instead of the lock turning twice, she opened it with one turn only, showing that somebody had entered previous to her—I then asked her for the occupier's name—she went downstairs into the dining-room and got me a card with Mr. Corbett's name and address on it—the two fires were perfectly distinct and sepa<lb/>rate; there was no communication whatever between them—I should say they must have been wilful—there was no sign of their being accidental</p>

               <p>presses for endorsing stamps on bills and invoices, and on the 31st he called and took them away—on that occasion he gave the name of Paul; and said that he was sorry he had not given me his address before—he called again on 8th February and produced this piece of paper with "F. May" on it, and said that he wanted a stamp made for a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—the signature struck me immediately as that of the Dutch Consul in London—I am a Dutchman—I think he wrote on it in the shop "Pym," and I scratched it out and wrote "Pimlico" with an "i"—I said that part of the "y" in May could not be included in a No. 3 stamp, and produced a larger press—he took a small piece of paper out of his pocket marked 40 A, 40 B, 40 C and 41 C—40 A. was in pen and ink, and the others were in pencil—he wanted me to make blocks for them, and also blocks from this small piece of paper with a 1 and a 9—he asked me if I had figures to match those—I showed him several and in one the stroke ran up—he said that that would not do, he wanted them executed the same, and wanted me to make a block with "39" on it, and three extra sets of figures from 1 to 0, so that he could print 39,000, 120, 121, 122, and so on—he did not leave the pieces of paper with me—I told him the best thing he could do was to introduce a numbering machine to his customers, as those loose figures would be difficult to work, and if he was so parti<lb/>cular about the numbers I could not do it unless he brought a strip of paper with all the figures upon it—he said that when he called for the other press he would give me the order for the numbering machine, the price of which was to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be the price of the stamp and blocks, leaving 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave no name or address—he wanted the work ready on Monday, 11th February, at 11 o'clock, military hours—I completed the order, but he did not come—a friend called my attention to the propriety of having the stamp with "F.

                  </hi>. I am a Frenchman and have been a lithographic printer at 21, Jockey's Fields, Bedford Row, nine or ten years—I have been in this country 22 years—I knew a man named Leroy for many years, but lost sight of him for three or four years—in August last he introduced to me a Frenchman named Martin, who wanted to practise on lithographic stone—I allowed Martin to use part of my shop and got a lithographic stone for him to practise upon—on 7th February this year Martin introduced Dubois and went to Paris the same day—he said "This is the gentleman I spoke to you about in the begin<lb/>ning of January; I have not kept my appointment to-day; he has come to my place and I introduce him to you"—Dubois took out a piece of paper in Martin's presence—it was in French, and was headed "Old England"—I did not read it—he said, "I want it very well engraved and well printed, as it is a particular job for a firm in Paris called 'Old England'"—he said that he wanted to get up a coupon—Martin said "You leave him alone, he is a good printer; look at the specimens around the room; he could do any branch of business"—Dubois said "Very well, I shall come to morrow and bring you some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060045"/>
               <p>other papers and bring you the information about this work," and as he left he said "I shall be here to-morrow at 3 o'clock military time"—Martin said "I am losing this job; I have been waiting all this time to work"—6,000 or 8,000 francs was to be given to me for the work, and Martin's share was 2,000 francs, and he would lose all by going away—I did not know the nature of the work, the details had not been given to me—they left together, and about ten minutes afterwards Leroy came with a gentleman named Dubert, and I went with them to Martin's lodgings but Dubois was not there—I had some conversation with Martin, and that was the last time I saw him—Dubois came next day punctually at 8 o'clock—(he had read the paper in French to me)—he asked me if I could furnish him with a sheet of paper; I gave him this plain sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and he took out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, put it on one corner of the paper, and traced a pencil round it—he then put the note higher up and traced it over again, which makes it double—he said "I want you to engrave 'Old England' at the upper part in Old English, in the same writing as it is on a Bank of England note, and make a scroll alongside the same as they do in cheque books, and write in skeleton letters along it 'Old England'"—I wrote this "Old England" in pencil across the scroll when he spoke about it—I also wrote in ink these words, that was for the water-mark—he said "Make a perforation down the centre of the scroll work"—he also said "I want this bank-note put down at the bottom," and that I was to be sure to leave room for the Director to sign his name without it going into the lower part—the line at the top of where the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was placed was simply to show me the distance, but I was not to make a line between the two documents—he wanted them in books of 25 each, with sufficient space at the end of the counterfoil to have them bound up—he said that the part I was to print was to be a fair sample of this—I said "I don't think you can do that," because I saw that it was a bank-note—he said "Oh yes, you can, we are not going to do the signature F. May, nor the numbers at the side of the note, and in that way it will not be an imitation; we shall have the name of our chief cashier, who will sign it himself"—he said that the plan was to give away the coupons over the country to persons who would buy 1000 francs' worth of goods in one month, and at any time they could go and buy some more goods and give that as money, and if there was a few shillings change they would set the change out—he wanted me to let him have 12 or 20 copies by Monday—he wanted to send the paper to Paris as a pattern of Old England—I said that it was totally impossible, I must see my engraver first, and ask him how long it would take to engrave and the price—he said "You must set your engraver to work day and night. I will leave you this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; you go and see your engraver at once, and ask him the particulars, and when it can be done and the price. Is your engraver a good workman? because I want an exact copy of these. I shall leave you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, please give me a receipt for it," which I did—he said that the firm of Old England would open on 1st February, and he must have some to go on with a few days after the opening—he asked if I could get some Bank of England paper—I said that I should try and get it as near as I possibly could—he said he wanted the water-mark "Old England <hi rend="italic">comptoir franco</hi> English, Paris," at the top, exactly the same as a Bank of England note, except the little square with the figures in it at the bottom, and he said "By</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060046"/>
               <p>this we do not imitate this note"—the words "I promise" were to be there, and everything except the signature, the figures, and the square water-mark—the woman in this corner (<hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi>) was also to be engraved—I said that I should have to go to some paper-mills; he said "How long will it take to do that?"—I said "About a month or six weeks, I cannot tell exactly;" he said "Oh, that is too long, we can't wait that time; you must see if you can't get some paper sooner than that"—I said that I would make inquiries about it—he left the papers with me—I was to see the engraver and he was to call next day at the same time—he gave his name "Wattecamp, 23, Broad Street, Golden Square," and said "That is my office"—I received this letter the same night; it is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was translated thus</hi>: "London, 8th Feb., 1876. Mr. Fimbel. On leaving you I went to the lithographer who had been mentioned to me. He assured me that the mould of the paper could be made like the pattern without the help of the paper-maker. Mr. Martin having been recom<lb/>mended by an old friend, I am happy to give you the preference, but for the first proofs do not come and say to me 'I have not been able to get such paper.' It must be similar and irreproachable. I do not haggle, but be just. You have 4,000 francs profit with our house; but thirty proofs with their perforations must be ready on Monday. I have been told that this can be easily done.—Dubois Wattecamp. To-morrow at 3 o'clock without fail.") He came next day at 5 o'clock and asked what the price would be for engraving the plate—I told him ten guineas (I had sent to the engraver)—he still wanted it by Monday—I said "It is impossible, it will take the engraver ten days to do"—he said he would write to Paris and let the firm know that—he said "Can you come out in the City with me? I will show you where to get some paper"——I said "I don't think you can; it being Saturday the firms close at two "—he said "Well, will you come with me and I will show you?"—I said "I will"—before leaving he said "Give me that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note back again; I cannot give you the receipt till Monday morning, because I have left my pocket-book at Broad Street, Golden Square, and I live at Chelsea; give me a piece of paper and pen and ink and I will give you a receipt to discharge you of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note back, but in the mean time I had made this copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and had shown it to him on the Friday—I had put in the actual number of the note—he told me that Old England was a good house, and they would do a good deal of business with me, and that McClure were their printers before—he then took me to Queen Victoria Street to Mr. McClure's shop, but it was shut up—he told me to go there the first thing on Monday morning and inquire about the paper—he said that they were the printers before, but he gave me the preference, being one of his countrymen—he arranged to call on Monday between twelve and one o'clock, but he did not, and on Tuesday the 12th I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was unable to come and requested to be informed of the particulars and price</hi>)—this is my answer—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the witness had obtained a pattern of paper and enclosed an estimate for the paper, the engraving, and the printing, amounting to</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and requesting a deposit of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I received this letter from the prisoner in reply—(<hi rend="italic">This being translated was dated</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">and signed Paul Wattecamp, It requested to have a proof by the</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th, that the order would be for</hi> 10,000 <hi rend="italic">copies, but that he had not yet received any money</hi>)—on Monday morning, the</p>

               <p>11th, I communicated with the authorities of the Bank of England, after which I reported from time to time what I was doing, and acted under the orders of the police—on Monday, the 18th, Dubois called and said that he had not been able to call before, as he had not heard from the gentlemen in Paris, and was waiting for money—I showed him some samples of paper—he said that one was too blue and the other too thin; could I get it a little thicker?—I said that I would try—he requested me to get it all done by the end of the month without fail and to keep the engraver on it and not give him too much at once—that paper had no water-mark—it was arranged that I was to get some more next day—he said that as soon as he could get some money from the firm he would bring me some, as he had spent a good deal of money and wasted a lot of time—he asked me if I had heard from Martin—I said "Yes;" I had received a letter from him on 11th February—he asked me if I had answered him—I said "No"—that was true—on 25th February I went to 23, Broad Street, Soho, and saw Dubois—he asked me upstairs—it is a foreign restaurant, and he was lodging there—I showed him some other specimens of paper—he said "I think it is rather too thick; you had better keep to the first sample. If you will allow me to keep them till to-morrow I shall see them by daylight, and shall come to your place and give you an answer"—I said, "I hope I don't intrude, as you have company to dinner with you," and left them with him and went downstairs, and sat in the restaurant—Roi, who is not now on his trial, was there (that is not Leroy)—Dubois introduced me to Roi as "Mr. Fimbel, my printer"—Dubois said, "Pray take a seat," and I sat next him—there was a conversation at the table, and he said, "Have you seen your engraver about this job of Old England?"—I said, "I have"—Roi said, "Hush! don't speak so loud about your engraver"—I said, "Why did not you come to my place on Friday last, according to your appointment?"—he said, "I could not come, as this gentleman, my friend, had just arrived from Paris a few days ago, and I had to go about with him to buy goods for the firm of Old England which we could not get in France"—Roi said, "Let us talk about this mat<lb/>ter, because it is a very serious affair; the order will be 20,000; you will have 10,000 to go on with for the first"—Dubois said, "We will come to-morrow and see you"—Roi said, "No, not to-morrow; the day after, or the day following"—those goods were bought for the Exhibition—when I left Dubois said "We shall come to your place to-morrow to see you," but he did not come—he came on 6th March, and said that he had just arrived from Paris, and had been travelling all night, and had got a very bad cold and was very poorly—he said that I was to do a great "leap" for him; the expression was "<hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi>"—he asked if I had got a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said "No"—he asked me to get one—I said that I would try—he said that I was to manage with the engraver to do the work, as he had not a penny in the world, but should have money to-morrow—he left, and returned about 6 o'clock—I told him I had not been able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and he arranged to call next day, 7th March, which he did, and told me he had not got the money from France—he said, "There are two partners, and I am interested in the firm and must wait their pleasure"—I saw him on the 9th for a few minutes at the door and he said that he had got an Italian job, but would take it to McClure's—I saw him next on 18th March—De Jongh came with him, who I did</p>

               <p>not know, nor was he introduced to me, but De Jongh said, "Now, Mr. Fimbel, we want you to get on with this job as quick as you can, as it has been on hand long enough"—I said, "I cannot till I get a deposit," and De Jongh put two sovereigns on the table—Dubois picked it up, and said, "This is enough to buy the plate for the engraver, and you will engrave it in five days"—I said "Yes, by working hard"—Dubois said "You need only give your engraver one sovereign, as I shall only have one sovereign this afternoon—that was not in De Jongh's presence—Dubois said "Tell your engraver we must have proofs by Friday; leave Old England out and part of the scroll, and have part of the coupon finished and return it on Saturday, and by Monday you can have it finished"—I said that that could be done to save time, only engraving the bottom part—De Jongh said "No, you must get it done by Thursday night; where does your engraver live?"—I said "372, City Road"—he said "When can we have an answer?"—I said "By 1 o'clock"—he said "That won't do, we must know before; my friend Dubois can go with you, as I cannot go myself, I have to go to the Borough Market about some eggs; give me a piece of paper and I will give you our address"—I did so, and he wrote this: "Dubois, 7, Belgrave Terrace, Peckham Park Terrace, S. E., near the Old Kent Road;" and said "It is too far for you to come, drop me a line and I will come and see you"—we then left together about 11 a.m. and left De Jongh at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, I and Dubois went to the City Road, and he said on the way "De Jongh is rather a suspicious man, that is why he came with me to pay the deposit, we are partners together"—we went on to the engraver's, and before entering Dubois said "Do not tell the engraver my name or address, it is no business of his, tell him it is for one of your customers"—I said that I would—he said that he would wait for me at the public-house, and I went into the engraver's, and afterwards went to the public-house, where Dubois said "Will you kindly give me a receipt for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave you?"—I tore this leaf out of my pocket-book and wrote "Received March 18, 1878, of Mr. Wattecamp, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account"—he said "When will the engraver get done?"—I said "2 o'clock on Friday"—he said "Tell him to get done about 12 o'clock"—he also said "I shall come this afternoon with 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and then we shall be able to get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for a copy for the engraver"—in the week afterwards he showed me four sovereigns, and said that he would give me the other sovereign and we could go out and get a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—before I went out he said "Will you show me the samples of paper I returned to you"—I did so and he tore a piece like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off one comer and put it in his pocket-book, and said "Will you kindly make me a receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and I will return you the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. receipt?"—I drew out this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and gave it to him—I went to a public-house with the five sovereigns, but they had not got a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; Dubois asked me to go to another public-house, because he said "You can speak English and I cannot"—I went and got one—I afterwards wrote on this draft in pencil the date of the fresh note—I had put down the first one in ink—he took the paper out of his pocket-book and said that it was rather thin—I said that it would swell in wetting it to get the water-mark—he said he thought it would do very nicely—I said "Do I understand that you want the little square out?"—he said "No, do the water-mark just as it is on the note"—it would not be a true water-mark, only an imitation put on by block by</p>

               <p>means of wetting it—I asked if the engraver could keep that note as payment—he said "No, I shall want that note back again to see if he has made a true copy of it," and he took a piece of paper out of his pocket-book and put down the date of the note—he impressed me not to fail to get it done by Friday at 2 o'clock, and said that he would stop at my place and smoke in my parlour till it was done, as he wanted to send it by post to Paris—he asked me how long it would take to do 10,000 copies—I said "Perhaps four weeks to print them"—before leaving he said "If you don't fail I will reward you for it and the engraver too; I don't mind a few pounds more"—two days afterwards I heard that he was in custody.</p>

I am principal of the Printing Department, Bank of Eng<lb/>land—all notes are printed in the bank itself—an impression from this stamp and these numbers would resemble parts of a Bank of England note—there are always five numbers this size on a Bank of England note and also a small number such as "48 <hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>" with a letter under it—we have several series of notes with the number 39, 120, and they run upwards to 39, 200—it would be possible to stamp the words "F. May" without the word "Pimlico"—the water-mark of a bank-note is made at the mill in the manufacture of the paper—an attempt could be made to stamp a water-mark on thin paper, because it has been done, but it is a very rough imitation—our notes are printed from the surface, not from a plate but from a raised character.</p>

I am one of the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp, and Co., of 6, Old Jewry, who are solicitors to the Agra Bank—I was sent for to the bank on 1st April between 12 and 1—Lord Cranworth, Mr. Richard<lb/>son, and Mr. Duncan, directors, were present—the prisoner Wynn made a voluntary statement—I warned him that any statement that he might make must be unconditionally made—I reduced to writing what occurred the same evening, with the exception of one or two blanks which I filled in the next morning—this is the memorandum I made; it states that Mr. Wynn offered explanations as to the account between Waud and Graves and the bank, that the overdrawings were not brought to the attention of the chairman, that he had allowed the overdrawings to serve Waud and Graves, that he had spoken of them to the clerks Green, Carter, and Martin, and had induced them not to notice them, telling them it would be all right, that the over drawings had been going on for several months past, and that 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been drawn out on 28th March, the day before Waud and Graves's stoppage, that he handed the amount to Graves at his counting-house and received cheques as if it had been paid in cash over the counter, and was afterwards entered by him, that Graves promised to give him cover, but failed to do so, and he threw himself on the mercy of the directors; that as to the previous transac<lb/>tions he could not identify the circumstances of each of them, but they were generally carried out in the same way, the cash being taken out at lunch time and handed to Graves at a meeting-place in Lombard Street or at Graves's own counting-house; that Waud was present at some of the overdrafts and was acquainted generally with what was going on, but did not take any active part; that as to Mr. Green he said he was sorry to compromise his fellow-clerks, but that they accepted his assurance and did not know anything was wrong, and that cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be</p>

I live at Forest Hill and am ledger clerk at the Agra Bank, in Nicholas Lane—Wynn has been there during the 11 years I have been in the service—he was cashier—I produce the till-book in which Wynn enters all cheques paid over the counter—the entries on 28th March are in Wynn's writing—the first five are 346<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—between the 346<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 50 cheques are entered—between the 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about a dozen are entered—the 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are close to each other—there are other cheques entered after those—I posted these amounts in the ledger—they are drawn in Graves's writing—the cheques are taken from an ordinary book supplied to a customer—the cancellation on them indicates payment over the counter by Wynn—the directors meet on Wednesday at 12 o'clock—on Tuesday night, the 26th, there was a debit balance in the ledger of 620<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the morning of the 27th a payment in to credit of 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving the credit balance at the time the directors met at 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was turned into a debit balance at the end of the day of 907<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., after allowing as a credit the sum of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 28th the debit balance was still further increased to 3, 857<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was reduced by a credit of 898<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., made up of two cheques on, I believe, Berridge and Wilton for 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the book has not been altered since—this is Messrs. Waud and Graves's pass-book from our bank—the pass-book is made up from the ledger and the entries checked off by the cheques—no customer should have any debit cheques until they are entered in the pass-book—the 58 cheques found at Graves's, I believe, were not entered in the pass-book—the account was not in credit again—a debit balance-book is kept for the information of directors—it shows when a customer over<lb/>draws—I kept that book—I have spoken to Wynn about Waud and Graves's debit—Wynn asked me not to put it in the book, because he had a credit for the amount in the ledger—that is cheques may not have come in time to get paid—I was satisfied with that explanation and omitted to put the amount in the debit balance-book—I was aware of the relationship between Wynn and Waud—I did not know anything about Wilton and Co. being the same firm as Waud and Graves.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hackney, and am a cashier in the Agra Bank—I have been employed there since 1867—it is not a Clearing House Bank—we clear through Glyn's—the latest time we send cheques to Glyn's is 3.45—we get our Bank of England notes from Glyn's—there is daily about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of notes in the bank—about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes was under the control of Wynn in till No. 2—I and Mr. Green had charge of till No. 1, the general cash—it was Wynn's duty to make up on a slip of paper the contents of his till—for my balance I got from him the total figure, and copied it first on my own slip, and then in this book which is ruled in two columns, one for general, and the other for Wynn's cash—the last time Wynn wrote the figures of till No. 2 was on the 20th March—on the 21st March I got Wynn's total as 611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 22nd 615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 23rd 647<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 25th 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 26th 659<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 27th 693<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 28th 735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 29th 639<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 29th was the last day Wynn was at the bank—J1 and J7 contain Wynn's figures—I saw Mr. Green take them from Wynn's drawer on Saturday, March 30th—these figures tally with my entries, except that I wrote 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and represented the contents of till No. 2 on those days—when the contents of the till was counted I found cheques marked C1 to C4—the amount of moneys was 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—C3 and C4 have not been can<lb/>celled—C3 is taken from a cheque-book kept at the bank for the use of customers commencing No. 247, 381—it is the second cheque—the cheque of 26th March for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is taken from the cheque-book of Waud and Graves—it is in Graves's writing, and there are two small crosses on the counterfoil—looking at this book, in Graves's writing, I find two little crosses and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out as a total on 26th March; and on 12th March the same little crosses and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out, corresponding with the amount of the other cheque—I have several times spoken to Wynn about the unsatisfactory state of Waud and Graves's account—within three or four months of his leaving my attention was directed to it—Wynn's reply was generally that there had been a lock up of capital in machinery, and that the overdraft would probably be put right in a few days, possibly hours—on 25th March I noticed a very heavy over<lb/>draft, and told Wynn it was very wrong, and could not possibly be allowed, and I should have to represent the matter to the chairman—he assured me in the most solemn manner that the account was right or would be right—that was three or four days before the account was in credit 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on seeing the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. credit I said to Wynn I was very glad that the account had been set right and hoped it would be kept right—about three or four days before this credit Wynn said "Carter, we have worked together for 25 years, have I ever deceived you in any way?"—I said "No, certainly not"—he said "I swear to you, before my Maker, that this account is right; I test it in every way, I know the whole ins and outs of it, and the thing cannot go wrong"—he then said "Would you mind advancing 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Waud and Graves on the faith of what I tell you?"—I said I did not feel justified in doing it, it was a large sum of money for me to part with—he said Graves was coming to speak to me about it—I said "How comes it that Graves knows anything of my private matters?"—he said "I told him"—I saw Graves alone immediately after in the street outside the bank, and he renewed the application—Graves said "Waud and Graves are temporarily pressed for money, could you oblige me with the loan of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I</p>

               <p>said that I could not, because what money I had had came from my wife and I could not deal with it without her consent, and there the matter dropped—Waud very rarely came to the bank, and very few cheques are in his name—after the credit of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been drawn out in cheques cancelled by Wynn, except two cheques of my can<lb/>cellation, one for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware I had cancelled the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I saw it at the Mansion House—I showed the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to Wynn before I paid it—we do not refer to the ledger on paying cheques except in rare cases—I was not aware of the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank<lb/>notes being taken out of the bank by Wynn on March 28th, nor of Wynn's taking notes away at any time—I never heard of it till Wynn's statement on 1st April—I did not know that Wynn was not coming to the bank on 30th March—I walked with Wynn to the railway station on Thursday, the 28th, when he told me he had been disappointed of cover from Waud and Graves, and the amount was overdrawn, but I do not think the amount was mentioned—he said there was some fear about it—that was the first I heard of any danger—he mentioned there had been a connection with a Mr. Wilton which had led to Waud and Graves's proper moneys being taken from the account—I had then no idea of a partnership with Wynn and Wilton, but thought Wynn referred to advances from one firm to another—the credit in the ledger on the 27th March of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was made up of three cheques, one on the Metro<lb/>politan Bank for 248<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two on the National Provincial Bank for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 251<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were paid—on 28th March, amongst other notes from Glyn's, we got 20,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes they included the numbers 62342 and '3—they are on Wynn's slip, only the 3 is accidentally transposed with the 2—we also received from Glyn's 25 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, including No. 38203—these two papers L and L 1 show the numbers of the notes that make up the 1, 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 27th we received from Glyn's a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 28121—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 38206, and two 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. 63242 and '3, are in Wynn's writing—Nos. 38206 and 63243 were amongst consecutive numbers of notes received from Glyn's—those are set against the cheque for 364<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—against another cheque for 293<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., No. 62164, a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, is set—the remaining 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid in gold—the next cheques are for 269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., against which is entered a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 28121, a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 62163, and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 38203, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cash—the numbers on the paper L1 correspond with those numbers—I got this letter and Wynn's keys from Wynn jointly with Mr. Green on the Saturday, 30th March, it is dated 31st by mistake: "My dear Green and Carter,—I find matters are quite without hope. They must stop. Enclosed you will find my keys. I am quite beside myself. Forgive me. Yours truly, J. R. I. Wynn." I did not see Wynn after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been chairman and managing director of the Agra Bank since the year 1867—I remain at the bank during busi<lb/>ness hours—I was referred to in case of an overdraft—that occurred almost daily—I have no recollection of Wynn ever asking permission to make advances to Waud and Graves—he borrowed 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which secu<lb/>rities were deposited, and the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was carried to Waud and Graves's current account—the loan account has remained since October, 1877—I produce a list of overdrafts of Waud and Graves at the director's meetings—I was never applied to between October and 28th March for permission to overdraw—I also produce a tabular statement of the days and amounts in 1877-78, when Waud and Graves's account was in credit the evening before the directors met, the last being February 12th 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next credit is 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Waud and Graves have had an account about 10 years—I was not aware of any connection between them and Wilton and Co.—there was nothing that attracted my attention to the account till a letter of 30th March—it is the head accountant's duty to call my attention to any overdraft—either Green, Carter, or Wynn should have done so—neither of them had authority to allow an over<lb/>draft—Wynn brought me a letter on 30th March about 2 p.m.—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that, having done what he should not have done to assist Waud and Graves, he tendered his resignation</hi>)—it is written on paper which has Waud and Graves's lithographed heading—I told him to come on Monday and I would talk to him on the subject—I have no recollection of receiving this letter—it is Wynn's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was found on the prisoner, and was on paper with the same lithographed heading, and stated: "I feel quite powerless to do anything; would it not be better for me to come on Monday</hi>,</p>

I am a hairdresser, of 13, Princes Street—I occupy the whole of the place, except the shop and the back parlour—I sleep on the first-floor back—I went to bed at ten o'clock on the night of 27th March at about eight o'clock—Curtis came to apply for a lodging—I had one room—he looked in drink, and I said very roughly, "No, I have not a room"—this all took place in English—he went away—about 2 a.m. I was alarmed by a noise, got up five minutes after, went downstairs and lit the gas on the staircase, where I saw the two prisoners—I looked, and the passage door leading into the back parlour was shut—I asked them what they wanted?—they were standing close together, and I think it was Curtis said "I beg pardon, I have made a mistake"—I had a sword in my hand—Matthews was at the back of Curtis—he moved a little and I saw a chisel stuck in the door—I called "Police"—one or two minutes afterwards Victor Ouverie came downstairs while the prisoners were still in the passage—the police came and took them and found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a chisel, a piece of candle, and a few keys on the mats.</p>

The rent of my house is 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there are a shop and back parlour on the ground floor—no one sleeps there or on the basement—I and my wife sleep on the first floor—the front room is for my business and the back I occupy—Ouverie and his wife sleep on the second floor—the back room on that floor is not let—he has another room on the third floor which he uses as a kitchen—a young man in the City occupied the back room second floor—that room is sometimes let for short periods but not for a night—I let my rooms by the week—I swear that women are not allowed to occupy any of those rooms with men—I have had a good many Frenchwomen living in the house but not now—I had two loose women in my house four or five months ago—Mons. Ouverie has a latch-key, and his wife, also another lodger in the back room third floor—it would not be possible for my lodgers to let any one in after I had gone to bed without my knowing it, for even if a cat runs upstairs I am awoke by it—I am always awakened by my lodgers—in the evening, at 10.30, I heard Mr. Alex<lb/>ander, who lives in the third-floor back, go up, but nobody else—I did</p>

I have known Mr. Hall for the last three years. I worked with him for one year. He was manager in an establishment where I was cook, and we were on very good terms together, and he said, 'When I establish myself I shall take you as cook.' But when he established himself he could not find me. I went to his place and he engaged me. I remained with him till he dis<lb/>charged me. He was very well pleased with me. He went away gene<lb/>rally in the morning and left the place in my charge. The prosecutor talked about the landlady being a friend of his. The boy told me that the waiter had taken coffee into the landlady's room in the morning and remained there a quarter of an hour, and often saw him come downstairs from the bedroom. I have seen him neglect customers. I went there to speak to him about something which I had not mentioned. He said when cooks did not do their business, it was his duty to discharge them. I made an observation and he knocked me down."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, of 64, Rupert Street, Haymarket—on the night of the 9th of February I was walking up Ludgate Hill with my three sisters, who were in front of me and my brother, who was walking at my side—I noticed four men coming from the direction of St. Paul's—they surrounded my three sisters, and pushed them rudely up against the shutters and fastened them there, and would not allow them to pass either way—I immediately went to their assist<lb/>ance, and said to the prisoner "What are you doing with my sisters"—he took no notice, but stepped back a step or two, when one of his com<lb/>panions answered me, but I did not catch the words, and so I said "Are you aware those are my sisters you are interfering with?"—the one who had answered me said he didn't care a d——whether they were my sisters or anybody else's sisters—I felt annoyed at that, and said "I will pull your nose"—the prisoner then pushed me up against the shutters—he had a large stick in his hand and brought it down on my leg; I felt my leg tremble, and found I had no power in it—it was a black or brown polished notched stick like a thorn—I put my right hand out and caught the prisoner with that, and my young sister with my left, and held on to them—I cried out "Oh my leg, my leg is broken, that man has done it" (<hi rend="italic">nodding to the prisoner</hi>)—my sister got round to the other side of the prisoner and held him and cried "Police!"—the prisoner then kicked me on the same leg—I caught hold of him with the other hand and gradually sunk to the ground, and sat on the pavement—whilst I was on the pavement I told him if he attempted to go he would have to drag me with him—my sister had hold of him still and so had I, and I went on my back on the pavement afterwards—whilst on my back one of the party came to me and said there was nothing the matter with me, and if I did not get up he would kick the top of my head in; or off, I forget which—I think that was the one who had spoken before—I appealed to the bystanders to protect me—"Will anybody protect me from this man? you hear what he says," and he tantalised me, I cannot say the exact words he used—he then walked round the crowd and I said "There is the stick he has done it with"—a young man attempted to take it out of the prisoner's right hand—he resisted at first, but when he saw who it was taking it he let it go, and my sister gave him in custody and I charged him—I was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was in bed for five weeks and two days—when the prisoner was given in charge he stood and grinned—he didn't say anything—my sister Sarah was with me the whole time—I had hold of the prisoner from the time he struck me, and am positive he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am positive he struck and kicked me—I solemnly swear I saw a stick in his hand—I said at the police-court I might know the other men if I saw them—I may have said I should know them—I was asked if I could identify any one in Court as one of them—I picked out one who I said was very much like one of the young men with the prisoner—I know he turned out to be a witness in another case, but I was not positive—no second person was brought under my notice—Thomas Gray was brought under my notice—I didn't see him when I looked round the Court—he was afterwards put into the witness-box—I heard my sisters examined—I heard Eleanor say "My brother was</p>

               <p>he was not when I had hold of him—I was on the ground I suppose 20 minutes—I did not notice the prisoner's left hand—I saw no cigar—my sister, who spoke about the stick was called on the last occasion at the police-court—some of them said that he had something in his hand but they did not see what it was.</p>
               <p>

I live at 64, Rupert Street, and am the wife of Edward Robertson, a printer's clerk—on the night of 9th February I was on Ludgate Hill with my sisters and brothers—about 12 o'clock three men and the prisoner pushed rudely against us and got us up against the shutters on the wall side—my brothers, who were behind, came up and asked them what they insulted us for—my sister, Mrs. Crawley, said "I beg pardon, allow us to pass; we are married women"—we tried to walk along—we got away from them, and when turning round to go away I heard my brother Thomas Edward call out "My leg is broken; that man has broken it; don't let him go"—my younger sister had hold of him on one side and my brother had him by the coat and never loosed him until he lost power over himself and gradually sank to the ground—my younger sister called for the police until they came and then gave him in custody—the prisoner was the nearest of the four men to my brother—he had something in his hand, I could not see what it was—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion at the police-court that we induced the men to annoy us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prisoner appeared perfectly calm about the matter and astonished at the charge—I did not hear him appeal to the by<lb/>standers as to whether he had lifted hand or foot against the prosecutor or interfered with him in any way—the prosecutor did not show me where the stick was—the prisoner was not smoking a cigar at that time—at the police-station he asked to be allowed to smoke and had a portion of a cigar in his hand, and he was told to put it out, as it is prohibited—I looked all round the crowd to see if anybody had got a stick, and no one in the crowd had one—there were about twenty or thirty persons, more than half men—I did not go to each and ask if they had a stick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought in on the morning of 10th February suffer<lb/>ing from a broken leg—it was about the middle of the bone, what we call the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi>—only one bone was broken—I should say the breakage was caused by direct violence—I could not say by what instrument, but by something more than a fall, either by a blow on the leg or striking the leg against something, force applied from the outside—it was a simple fracture, with bruising of course, but no wound of the skin—it might have been caused by a blow with a stick or the foot, or both, it would be impossible to say which—he was five weeks and two days under my care—he went out on 19th March—he has been once or twice since to show himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. We have plenty of cases of broken legs caused by a simple fall—the breakage might have been caused by the man striking his leg on the corner of the kerb-stone—in the case of a blow or kick I should not necessarily expect to find an abrasion of the skin unless the man's legs were bare—it would depend on the force of the blow.</p>

In all probability it was caused by a blow more than a fall—I cannot say exactly—the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is the chief bone of the leg, the shin bone—the bruise was just over the seat of fracture—it was about the size of a hen's egg—if the fracture were caused by falling on the kerb it would more easily occur if he were standing in the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ticket collector in the service of the Great Northern Railway at Holloway—on Sunday, 14th April, I was collecting the tickets there from the 10.16 a.m. train—I found the two prisoners and a third person, a lady who is outside, in a second-class carriage—when I applied to the female prisoner for her ticket she held up a season ticket, showing me the date, King's Cross and Crouch End, second-class—I asked the male prisoner for his season ticket and he pulled a purse out of his pocket and held it up—I asked him a second time and he held up a reddish purse, something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said "Season"—I did not notice which side he held up, but I can say that it was a purse and not a ticket—I asked him a third time for his ticket—he then opened his purse and said "I have left my season at home"—I said "Will you pay the fare <hi rend="italic">?</hi>"—he said "No, I will give you my name and address," and then said to the female prisoner in English, "Write my address out for me"—I then asked her to let me see the season ticket she had shown me and she handed me this ticket No. 7239—(<hi rend="italic">This had</hi> "Mr. H. Gehrke" <hi rend="italic">printed on it</hi>)—I said to the male prisoner "Is this your season ticket?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You told me just now you had left it at home; how is it this lady is using it?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060080"/>
               <p>then offered to pay the fare—I would not take it, and called the inspector, who told me in the prisoner's hearing to take the name and number of the season, and ask for the address—the male prisoner gave his address 7, Park Villas, Crouch End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This was on Sunday morning, the last train running before church-time—I am not aware that on the following Tuesday he went to the Company's offices to give a full explanation—I did not call at the defendant's address, Fern Villa, 19, Perth Road, Finsbury Park, N., nor do I know that a Company's officer did call there—Mr. Forbes is the traffic manager—I have been a ticket collector three years and a half—some persons carry their season ticket attached by an elastic band to their purse, and some inside their purse—I have often seen it on the purse with an elastic band—he offered to pay me the money before I called the inspector, and he offered to pay the inspector, but neither of us took it—the second-class fare from Crouch End is 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard him say Park Villas—the young lady asked me for a pencil and was writing it down—I can't say whether she finished, for she got up and looked out of the window on the opposite side—I did not get the written address—I re<lb/>ported the matter the same day, and it would go to the Company's office next morning—the season ticket books are kept at the King's Cross office—the lady witness who is to be called was not at the police-court she was not heard of until yesterday—she was next to the carriage door, hers was an ordinary ticket—the female prisoner sat on the far side of the compartment—she gave me the ticket when I asked her—I asked the male prisoner "Is this your ticket?" he said "Yes," and offered to pay the fare for the lady—I did not supply the paper for writing the address down.</p>

I am an inspector at Holloway station—I was called on this Sunday morning to a second class-carriage, and heard Faulkener ask the male prisoner for his address—he said "7, Park Villas Crouch End"—Faulkener asked him whether the season ticket was his—he said "Yes"—he offered to pay me the fare; I refused to take it and told Faulkener to take his name from the season and the number of the season; and then he was asked for his address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

I am chief clerk in the Season Ticket Department, Great Northern Railway, King's Cross—the prisoner Henry Gehrke is a second-class season ticket holder between King's Cross and Crouch End—this is the season ticket issued to him—he gave his address Fern Villa, 19, Perth Road—the female prisoner does not hold a season ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There is a proper register of season ticket holders, and on looking at this ticket we could tell Mr. Gehrke's address—I do not recollect his calling at our office on Tuesday the 16th to explain the matter, but I was told he did call—I did not hear the explanation—he has been a season ticket holder for three years—just before the expiry of season tickets we send a form to holders to be filled in, and one would be sent to Mr. Gehrke—I did not call on him to ask for an explanation on 25th April—I cannot say who did—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner Augusta here produced a third<lb/>class season ticket in her own name, between Crouch Hill and King's Cross on the Midland Railway, until</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1878)—I did not know then that she was a season ticket holder on the Midland, but I know it now—the Crouch End station of the Great Northern Railway, and the Crouch Hill station of the Midland are a very short distance apart, and some of the trains when they arrive at the Metropolitan Station, King's Cross, stand on the same platform, but only those trains which run through to Moorgate Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, of 4, Green Street, Whitechapel—the house belongs to John Bird—on 29th April, about 2.30 a.m., I was in bed in the front parlour—that is my bedroom and sitting-room—I was awoke by the striking of a match, but the shutters were shut as they were when I went to bed—I looked up and saw the prisoner—I said "Who's there?"—he said "It is me; I have been robbed and you have got to die"—he tried to catch hold of me—I jumped out of bed—it was dark, but I could hear by the glasses moving that he was seated on the sideboard, and knowing the part of the, room he was in I went to the door, which was locked—I went out and closed it as well as I could—I wanted to lock him in, but could not get the key out—Mr. Bird came and I then heard the prisoner open the window and jump out—the window was fastened when I went to bed, but not the shutter—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man, because he struck a cigar light, and in trying to blow it out he held it up to his face.</p>

I was on duty in Whitechapel about 2.30 a.m. and saw the prisoner in Green Street, about 100 yards from Bird's house—I afterwards stood in the shade under a wall opposite the house, concealed from view, believing that the prisoner was still there—I saw the shutters come open and the prisoner jumped out—I ran him about 100 yards and he stopped of himself, turned round, and said, "There runs the boy, master, you are wanting"—I said "No, you are the one I want," and took him in custody—he said "I have not done anything nor yet got anything"—I did not lose sight of him from the time he got out at the window—I was close behind him all the way and have no doubt he is the man who got out—he was sober.</p>

We con<lb/>sider Mr. Mathieson thoroughly responsible and respectable, and what<lb/>ever he undertakes he will carry out." I forwarded that letter to Mr. Farlow, after which this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was prepared in our office, and I saw Walker sign it "J.

Straker—he said that he was traveller at Mathieson's, and I might be sure that he would not be there if the money was not safe—I told him that I did not consider the money was safe for that reason, and that I could not supply any goods without reference—he proposed a reference to some firm of small printers, I think in Aldersgate Street, of whom I had heard before—I told him at once that was unsatisfactory, and we could not give him credit—he then left—I do not think any goods were supplied to Mathieson and Co. after that—a letter-press had been supplied previously—I was not acquainted with it, and as soon as I found it out I stopped more goods being supplied, and it was in consequence of that he came and saw me—I have no means of telling the date—we have not received any payment from Mathieson and Co.</p>

I replied to that letter and eventually kept the bill—when it became due it was presented through our bankers, and returned with a note annexed to it—I afterwards called at Commercial Wharf and saw the two prisoners and another man—I said "I wish to see Mr. Mathieson"—McCarthy said Mr. Mathieson was abroad, but he would bring the manager to me—he went into an adjoining room and brought Walker—I asked him if he was Mr. Mathieson?—he said no, he was the manager—I produced the bill and said "I want payment of this bill"—Walker said "We can't pay it till Monday"—I said "It must be paid"—I called his attention to the banker's note on the bill, that the bill had been presented, and the premises had been found padlocked—McCarthy said that the premises must have been closed when the man called—I then left—the bill has never been paid—before I sent the cabinet I believed that the reference that had been given from the Dudley Iron and Coal Company was a genuine reference, and that Mathieson and Co. were a good firm of merchants—that induced me to send the cabinet—I asked Walker to return the cabinet—he said "We cannot do that"—I have since seen it at the Civil Engineers' Office, in Parliament Street, and a portion of the case in which it was packed.</p>

               <p>had come from Antwerp, and were worth from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was the clerk's duty to take a receipt book, get a receipt for the bill of lading, and bring the book back—on the 26th February I received this further order from Mathieson and Co. for 100 kegs of different sized nails, to be delivered within 21 days; that would be about five tons, to the value of about 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not execute that order, we wrote that we were not sure they could be delivered within the time fixed, and asked for a reference; in reply to that we received this letter referring to the Dudley Iron and Coal Company, 62, Moorgate Street—in consequence of that I went there; I saw some person in the office and was told that Mathieson and Co. were respectable decent people and good for the amount, I mentioned 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not satisfied with that reference and wrote to Mathieson and Co. declining to execute the order except for cash—about the end of March, after the 30 days, I applied for payment of the first order, for the 40 kegs; we have never received any payment—I instructed Mr. Chamberlain, our solicitor, in respect of it—before supplying the goods I believed the contents of the advertisement I had seen, and that Mathieson and Co. were carrying on a genuine business at Commercial Wharf; it was in consequence of that I supplied the nails to them—I afterwards saw some nails produced at the Mansion House; these are some of them; each nail has a private mark in the head; they are the same sort we supplied to Mathieson and Co.—this is the bill of lading of the 40 kegs.</p>

On Thursday, the 28th March, I watched the prisoner's premises at Commercial Wharf—I saw the Great Northern Railway van deliver three trusses of goods there—McCarthy received the delivery sheet from the carman—the goods were taken inside—shortly afterwards I saw McCarthy speak to a boy out<lb/>side the premises—the boy handed him a pocket-knife and he went in the warehouse, where the three bales had been taken—I walked by and saw McCarthy doing something to the bales, I could not see what—McCarthy left the premises about 12.15—I saw him afterwards speaking to Herbert in Thames Street, and a barrow was taken down George Alley to Old Swan Lane—I watched them take the goods out this back way to Messrs. Beeton—on Saturday, 6th April, I arrested Walker in Dover Street, Blackfriars—I said "Mr. Walker?"—he said "My name is not Walker"—I said "Perhaps Mathieson, then?"—he said "Well, what is it you want?"—I told him I and another detective who was with me were police officers, and we were going to take him into custody, and he would be charged with obtaining a quantity of goods from various parts of the country by fraud—he said "You do not say so"—I said "Yes"—he said "I am just going to meet my wife and children, let it be till Monday; make an appointment and I will meet you"—I said "No, I cannot do any such thing"—he said "I was just going to get some money, and in three weeks' time I should have had sufficient to pay all; I have had a lot of trouble this last two years"—I took him to Bow Lane police-station—there he asked me what I thought the magistrate would do with the case at the Mansion House?—I told him I did not know—he said "What is the usual sentence in these cases?"—I said "Sometimes a sentence of penal servitude"—when arrested he was carrying a black leather bag which I handed to Sergeant Green.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live at 92, High Street, Shad<lb/>well; where I have carried on the business of a tobacconist about 12 years—the prisoner keeps the Globe and Pigeons opposite—I leave instruc<lb/>tions with my daughters what they are to do with coin—on 29th March I had just come in, and the prisoner's wife came over very excited, and I heard her say to my daughter that she ought to be more careful and not bring bad money over there—my daughter said "What is the matter?"—Mrs. Sampson said "Why it is a bad one, you ought to be more care<lb/>ful"—I said "What is the matter, Mrs. Sampson?"—she threw a crown piece down on the counter, saying that it was a bad one, and told me to bring five good ones for it—she went out, and on Sunday, 31st March, I was very ill, but I got up and dressed myself on purpose to go over and see the prisoner—I bade him good morning, he asked me how the sciatica was—I said "Very bad, and I should not have got up if it had not been for the five-shilling piece; it is a very unpleasant business; I should like to settle it; I want no bother, and under the circumstances let us go half a piece"—he said "No, I will have all or none"—nothing else took place till 9th April, as I was ill in bed; the prisoner then came over to my shop and saw my wife—I was sleeping in the next room, with the door open—I heard him say "Now, Mrs. Cambden, I have not come to tell you I am going, I have been to Mr. De Rutzen, and he has autho<lb/>rised me, unless you pay me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, to call a policeman and give your daughter in charge in the usual way"—my daughter afterwards wrote this for me, as I was blistered that morning, and I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated April 9th, from the Witness to the Prisoner, stating that if he came any more with his intimidations he would take immediate steps to prevent him</hi>.) These words "92 opposite" at the bottom of the letter were not there when I sent it—they are not my writing—the prisoner said before the Magistrate that he wrote them, and then he denied it—on the next Wednesday, April 17th, I saw something exhibited in his window and went across and took a copy of it; it was "Notice, beware of red noses and utterers of counterfeit coin, for particulars enquire within"—my letter was also there and the words "Read the dishonest letter and sign"—but a piece of paper was pasted over those words—I never saw them uncovered—on Thursday the 18th the paper had disappeared, but the letter was still there, and a picture of a gorilla, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—over that printed in red letters was "Red face, the spacious caravans are densely crowded and contain"—that has occasioned me a great deal of annoyance up to the present time and my business has suffered.</p>

I was born in that neigh bourhood, not 100 yards off—the prisoner has lived there 10 months—this figure of a gorilla is taken from Wombwell's handbill—I cannot point out any thing in it which is like me—I have not a red nose—there is no doubt that my daughter changed a bad five-shilling piece there—I had been on good terms with the prisoner—he bears a good character in the neighbourhood.</p>

I am the prosecutor's daughter—on 29th April, from instructions I received, I took a five-shilling piece to the Globe and Pigeons for change—I asked Mrs. Sampson to see that it was a good one, as it was to be changed for a man in our shop—she examined it in my presence, and said "Oh, that is good enough," and gave me the change—she did not put it in the trier, she bounced it on the counter—about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came to our shop and brought a crown</p>

               <p>—I do not know whether it was the same—she said that I ought to have known better than to have taken bad money over there, and not to come for change any more—she threw the crown on the counter, and said that we were to send five good shillings for it, and went out—on 9th April the prisoner came over and saw my mother—I heard him tell her that he had been to Mr. De Rutzen, not to think he was going—on Saturday, 13th April, I saw my father's letter in the prisoner's window, and a crowd there—the body of the letter was in my writing, and the signature my father's—the words "92, opposite," were not on it when it was sent—on 17th April I saw this in the window: "Read the dishonest letter and sign"—nothing was posted over it then—my father's letter was by the side of it.</p>

I am in the prosecutor's service—on 13th April my attention was called to a crowd looking in at the prisoner's window—Mr. Cambden's letter was there and this notice along side it—I took this copy of it: "Beware of those with red noses and utterers of counterfeit coin; for particulars apply within. Read the dishonest letter of 9th instant, and sign"—that is a true copy—on the following "Wednesday I saw the same notice," Read the dishonest letter, "but that was cut off or else a piece of plain paper put over it—it was a blank—a crowd at the window made me notice it—my uncle's letter was in the window, and a gorilla placed alongside it with the words, "The spacious caravans are crowded and contain": that was placed so as to run on, "and contain yours truly, see opposite" (<hi rend="italic">The picture</hi>)—I served a notice to produce on the defendant, who said, "Do you think you are going to frighten me with that bit of trash? there is the letter in the window—" I said "Will you give it to me?"—he said "No; it is not likely."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 892). I have been seven years in the force—on Saturday night, 20th April, I had received directions to watch the shop of Spiers and Pond in Water Lane—I did not know Barratt, but his description was supplied to me and I saw him about 4.30 that afternoon in the Blue Last public-house, near Spiers and Pond's—he Corresponded with the description—I waited till he came out and followed him to Spiers and Pond's, where I saw Chapman on the foot<lb/>way in front of a slab where the meat was—he stood by Chapman's side a few minutes speaking to him—Chapman then picked up a piece of beef, held it up, placed it on the slab again, and drew it to the edge of the slab—Barratt held his hands under the slab and Chapman put the meat into them—Barratt put it under his coat and walked on without going into the shop—the beef was not given to the scale man to weigh, nor was any paper wrapped round it—I went alter Barratt and took the beef from him—he was searched and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, was found on him—I went back and charged Chapman with stealing a piece of beef, and said that a man already in custody would be charged with receiving it knowing it to be stolen—he said "I have given no man any meat," and at the station he said in answer to Mr. Maxtead, the manager, "If the man took it he stole it"—I searched him and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to his lodging, 4, Printing House Lane, near Spiers and Pond's shop, and in a box at the side of the bed I found this purse containing 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—when I watched Barratt I stood within 10 yards of the shop—two women customers were in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Spiers and Pond are large butchers, and they have a fish shop a little lower down—carts were outside both shops—I was opposite the shop when Barratt went up, and the street is only 11 yards wide—I was looking for about a minute—I took Barratt about 20 yards from the Blue Last, took him to the station and went back to take Chap<lb/>man about 10 minutes afterwards—I had been watching the shop for three weeks, but only on Saturdays—two or three women were outside the shop speaking to Chapman after Barrett left—I say to-day that Chapman pushed the meat along the slab, I said at the police-court "Chapman took It from the slab and handed it to Barratt"—I saw no money pass when I arrested Barratt, he said that he bought it at the Meat Market—Barratt said at the police-court that he had never seen Chapman before; Chapman asked him—I had no conversation with Barratt at Guildhall police-court; I saw him in the cell—he spoke to me in the dock—I did not say "Be sure you tell the Magistrate that you gave Chapman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the meat."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I said at the Court that I was 10 or 12 yards off, but I had not then measured the street—I explained to the Magistrate, Sir Andrew Lusk, that the meat was slipped along—writing down "handed it to Barratt," was not my doing but the clerk's—I had watched on the 6th and 13th, but did not see Burratt—Chapman was only outside on Saturdays</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">This Prisoner</hi>). I was in the employ of the West<lb/>minster Civil Service Association, almost opposite Ludgate Hill station—before I knew Chapman I bought meat at Spiers and Pond's; it was weighed and I invariably paid for it at the desk in the shop—you must go into the shop before you can get to the desk, which is about six feet from the outside—on a Saturday some weeks before I was in custody I went and asked Chapman the price of several pieces of meat; he told me and I said that it was more than I could afford—he said you can buy a piece outside if you like—I said "What do you mean?" he said "Give me what I ask and you can have the meat"—I asked him what he wanted for a piece of pork—he said "A couple of <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>," meaning 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he gave me the meat—that was the first time I had any dealings with him—I did not enter the shop or go to the counter—the meat was not weighed—on Saturday, 20th April, I was at the Blue Last—I was not aware that I was followed and watched—I went to Spiers and Pond's about 6.30., and placed myself on Chapman's right hand, who was outside attend<lb/>ing to the slab—I said "Good afternoon"—he said "Halloa"—I said "What is the price of that piece of meat against your arm?"—he said "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which I gave him—he gave me the meat and I put it under my coat—I did not go into the shop—I was followed and taken into custody—I tendered a statement voluntarily at the police-court—no influence was used to induce me to do so—no hope or promise was held out to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I told the officer that I got the meat at the Meat Market, that was a lie—Chapman asked me at Guildhall "Do you know me?"—I said "No"—I did not know his name till the charge was brought—to the best of my recollection I did not say "I have never seen you before"—when I pleaded guilty here I said that I received the meat from the man, but I paid him for it—I did not say "I got the meat but I don't know how I got it"—I said that I thought it was not altogether right—I am a porter and had been at work seven months at this Association, before that I worked at Herbert's, 54, Ludgate Hill, and before that at Norman and Redmon's, Old Compton Street, Soho, for six months, and at Clements and Co., St. James's Square, from 12th July, 1875, to May, 1876—these are my testimonials.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Mullins, Higura, and Co, of New York, Shipping and Commission Agents—in September last the prisoner was appointed our London agent under this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on his getting samples from us, his duty was to show them to people who came to buy, and forward the orders to us for our approval, and if we approved of the purchaser we executed the order, and sent the goods to their destination—we invoiced them to the purchaser, and sent the prisoner a copy of the invoice under the terms of this agree<lb/>ment—the bills of lading ordinarily would go to the purchaser, and in this case we sent two to the prisoner by his request, as it was to be collected on delivery—this was not usual, but we did it to protect ourselves—the money was to be collected on the delivery of the bill of lading—in Decem<lb/>ber last we received an order for 130 kegs of nails for Frederick Smith, of London, but they were to be consigned to Glasgow—on the 4th January we dispatched them to Glasgow, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> Bolivia—the invoice was made out to Frederick Smith, but we put it in our letter to the prisoner—Smith's letter was in an interior envelope—in February we received an order from the prisoner for 122 kegs of nails, and 22 cases of hardware for William Rose—this was shipped on 13th February on the Anglia, from New York to London—the voyage would take about ten days—the consignment was gent to Mr. Ross, and a copy of the invoice and the bill of lading to the prisoner—they embraced the nails and the hardware—we afterwards re<lb/>ceived this letter from the prisoner by post. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 9th February</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Messrs. Mullins, stating that Mr. Perry's connection with the firm had ceased in consequence of his incapacity for business; that he was endeavouring to obtain a partner, and expected to receive several amounts on account of goods next week, and requesting Messrs. Mullins to allow him to place the same to his credit and if so to cable to him "Agreeable</hi>.") The consignment on the Bolivia would arrive on 16th or 17th January in ordinary course, and that by the Anglia about 23rd February—the last paragraph in our letter referred to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner was collecting for Mr. Smith—that was all that was belonging to us on this side of the Atlantic—we did not understand that the goods coming forward next week were the goods which were the subject of Mr. Boss's consignment—he did not know that any goods were shipped by Mr. Ross—we thought he referred to the outstanding account due from Mr. Smith—we sent him this telegram "Agreeable"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060107"/>
               <p>in consequence of his request for us to allow him to place to his credit certain funds which could not amount to more than 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore we agreed to advance him that amount to help him, and our subsequent letter of the 6th explains that—we meant him to take it and use it for the expenses of the office—I wrote this letter on 6th March. (<hi rend="italic">This was to J, C. Marsh and Co., and referred to nails, citron fruits, and other articles., and stated</hi> "<hi rend="italic">In answer to yours we cabled Agreeable</hi>.") Under that letter the prisoner might pay in 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently received from him this letter dated 14th March. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt of a bill of lading and of a sample lot of oils; remarking on the different markets, and requesting to be allowed to place</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Messrs. Brown's credit</hi>.) We did not comply with that request—no such arrangement, had been contem<lb/>plated—that was not Brown, Janson, and Co., but Brown, Shipley, and Co., of London—that was the first we ever heard of the arrangement, and on 26th March, on the receipt of that letter, we sent this telegram to the prisoner: "Hold goods, particulars Thursday," in answer to which he telegraphed "Goods held, amount needed advised"—he had instructed Brown, Shipley, and Co.—that was the first suggestion that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to them—he wrote to us saying he had several houses connected with Brown, Janson, and Co., and recommended us to do our business through Brown, Shipley, and Co.—we assented to that, but wrote to him telling him instead of either of them to pay the deposit into the Union Bank of London—I left New York on 27th March, and arrived here on 9th April—I called at the prisoner's office that day, and asked him what had become of the goods—he said that they were in store all right at 52, Lime Street—I asked him how it was he consented to take orders from irresponsible people—he said that he was assured that they would take them up on arrival—I expressed dissatisfaction, and he said that it was no use talking so harshly to him, there was but a little profit lost, a little difference in price, but he held the goods, and he volunteered to pay whatever loss we sustained on account of their non-arrival—nothing Was said about the bills of lading that day—that was all the conversation appertaining to the goods—I saw him again on the 10th or 11th, having reason to suspect that everything was not right, and asked him to deliver me the bills of lading, or whatever he had to show his title to the goods he had in store—after some hesitation he rang for his clerk, and asked him to bring in a certain paper—he then told me that he had given up the bill of lading—I said "Then give me the receipt or whatever else you received in its place"—he said that he had no receipt—I said "But you must have something to show what your goods are, some consign<lb/>ment from the warehouseman"—the clerk handed him a paper which he handed to me—it was simply a memorandum of loan by Davis and Turner of these goods on 18th March—this is a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l., for which</hi> 132 <hi rend="italic">kegs of nails and</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">kegs of hardware were deposited as security, with permission to sell the same if the</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l. was not repaid by</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1878. <hi rend="italic">Signed J. C. Marsh</hi>.) This other memorandum is the same with the exception of the power of sale—I asked the prisoner what he meant by pawning our goods—he said that he needed some money, and had put them in store there, and Davis and Turner had advanced the money—I said "You had no right to do that, and you know it"—he said "I did not get the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I only got 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and explained that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was an old debt by him to them—I said "Why did you pawn our goods to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060108"/>
               <p>pay your old debts?"—he said that a package of samples of pistols and guns that we sent to Davis and Co. as express agents, directed J. C. Marsh and Co., were detained by them for the old debt of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to liberate them he had, at the suggestion of Davis and Co., deposited these two lots of merchandise shipped to Smith and Ross, thereby getting his express package and a further advance of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which, together with the charges and freight from New York, made up 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and over—I told him to take the memorandum of loan and endorse it, which he did—I expressed my dissatisfaction and left the office—I visited him again with Mr. Heritage, my solicitor, who asked him if he admitted that he was our agent—he said "Certainly"—he was asked if, when he pawned the goods, he knew that he had no right to pawn them—he said "Yes"—he was asked how he intended to give us back our goods—he said that he had no means, for he had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world—the invoice form of the consignment to Ross is 327<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—under clause 2 of the agreement we have to pay half the rent and furniture, and we have paid 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to 31st December, 1877, which is the half—no more rent became due till 1st April, 1878—nothing was due in March for rent or furniture.</p>

My firm contemplated doing a large business in this country—we were to send over any American goods that we bought—the prisoner did not complain of the nails that we sent—we sold them from samples—he did not say that Mr. Ross had complained—he said that they were a bad assortment, and he expected a heavy loss—there are only two transactions which refer to bills of lading, except samples, and for those two we sent bills of lading—we shipped a little sample of oil from New York on 25th or 27th February to a gentleman in Middles<lb/>borough, to have them transhipped to the steamer at Black Eagle Wharf, London—we are agents, and we sent a bill of lading to him—an account was rendered to us of the three first months of the business, that carried it up to 31st December inclusive; the next account, up to the end of March, would be returned on lst April—I was not asked before the Magistrate about the conversation with Mr. Heritage—a warrant was applied for on 12th or 13th—I should say 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be due for the first of those shipments.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Davis, Turner, and Co., of 52, Lime Street, City—I have known the prisoner between two and three years—about two years ago he contracted a debt of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my firm, which remained owing, and I did not see him again till 11th March this year—it was just before the Philadelphia Exhibition, two years ago, and we saw him on his return eight months after the opening—that brings us to the beginning of 1877—I only saw him in the street then, and I do not think anything was said about the debt<lb/>early in March this year we received a case of revolvers from our New York agents to be delivered to the prisoner; he wrote to us and we replied that we should be happy to send them if he would send us a cheque for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(that debt had been contracted by his asking us to advance it to him, and to receive payment out of his commission when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060109"/>
               <p>he was at the Philadelphia Exhibition—we had no security except a letter—he had been introduced to us by Mr. Sangster, the umbrella manufacturer—when the prisoner failed to pay we applied to Mr. Sangster)—just before March 11th I called on the prisoner and asked him what he was going to do—he said that he wanted the case of revolvers very urgently, and that he would pay me the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he did not name a date; I said that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, and I should prefer to keep the case of guns—I should think it was worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because there were several guns in it; he said "I must have the money down"—he said that he would send me on a cheque—he then read a paragraph from the letter of a firm in New York. (<hi rend="italic">This was</hi> "If you have no objection, we will place the same goods to your credit; if that meets your views please cable us.") He showed me the <hi rend="italic">cable</hi>—I told him to come round in the afternoon and see my partner as well as myself, and we can go into the matter"—he did not then tell me on whose behalf he was acting in London—I had never heard the name of Mullins and Co.—I saw under his name, "Agent for Mullins and Co.," but I could not have told what it was—I knew he was an agent, nothing more—he came in the afternoon and saw Mr. Foster and myself, and we agreed to make him an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the receipt of the goods, and being satisfied that they were worth it—he asked us to make an advance at once, but we replied that till we got the goods we could not—he did not produce the bills of lading—I told him that on leaving the delivery orders of Pickford, where the goods were warehoused, we should not mind letting him have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he assented, and my impression is that he wrote out in our office a delivery order to Pickford's to deliver the goods to us, and we received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Pickford's agreeing to do so—Pickford's are sure to have the delivery order—as to the other goods an order was handed to us by Messrs. Henderson, of Glasgow, to deliver them to us—they are the pro<lb/>prietors of the Anchor line—the prisoner gave the two delivery orders to me, and then he went with our clerk to Pickford's, who got this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from them, and then handed the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Pickford's place, I think, and got this receipt—on the larger consignment we ad<lb/>vanced 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: it was agreed that the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be included in the advance, and we were to hand him over the case of revolvers, which we did on, I think, the 13th—on the 15th a further advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made to him. <hi rend="italic">This was for a further sum of</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l., at</hi> 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest, with liberty to dispose of the goods if not redeemed within a month</hi>.) The interest and com<lb/>mission were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not think it necessary to inquire whose agent the prisoner was, because he showed me this letter and telegram authorising him to do it—the bills of lading were never in my hands, and my impres<lb/>sion is that the prisoner came once or twice between the 18th and the 18th to see if the goods had arrived from Glasgow—on the receipt of the goods we should make the advance—Pickford's had delivered by the 13th, and thence the further advance—the goods arrived on 18th March at Carron Wharf, London, and on that day we made the prisoner a further advance of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid for charges on Smith's consignment—taking those four sums together and the charges for freight, that made up the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest and commission—we gave the prisoner this memorandum of deposit on the 18th.

I could not see what coins they were in his hand—I could see they were silver and rather large coin, whether half-crowns or two-shilling pieces I could not say—he said he was a respectable man, that he did not do it, that he had a wife at home; he had come out to buy some fish; he was a fish dealer, and he went up to London most every morning—Stratford Bridge station is about a quarter of a mile from ours, it could easily be walked in 10 minutes—there is a public-house at Stratford called the Railway Hotel—I believe it was open at six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk warehouseman and live at 2, Eliza Cottages, Plaistow Park—on 9th February, about 10 minutes to 11, I left home with my little girl to get some beer for the next day's dinner—I went to the Libra Arms, got the beer and sent it home—I stood for a moment talking to some one—I heard a woman scream and saw some man running—I walked quietly over and saw a woman with blood running down her face—I advised her to go home immediately—as I left her I saw the prisoner struggling with a man who he threw down—there were other persons about at the time, some behind me—I hesitated a moment and the prisoner rushed at me and I felt a pricking sensation in the abdomen; I put my hand down and found my bowels protruding—I did not feel the blow—the prisoner then ran away—I walked with the assistance of two men, and a surgeon attended to me—I saw the prisoner again the same night, I said I would not positively swear to him; he was brought to me by the police; I then thought I was dying—a Magis<lb/>trate examined me upon the certificate of a surgeon—my impression now is that the prisoner is the man—I was on my back in bed for eight weeks, and I am still sufferring from the effects of the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When the prisoner was brought to me I said "It was</p>

               <p>done in a moment"—I don't remember saying "it was dark"—I was perfectly sober—I said "I will not positively swear he was there, he was a tall man, something like this man, I saw him in the dark."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was examined again before the Magistrate on 23rd March, when I was better; I then said "I cannot positively swear to the prisoner, but I fully believe it was him"—that is my impression now.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUGHES BROOKS. I am a grocer—on the night of the 9th February, about 11, I saw some women standing in front of my shop, which is near the Libra Arms—they were quarrelling—I saw the prisoner standing with some women farther down the road—these women were complaining that they had been struck by the woman who was standing with the prisoner, and they were saying what they would do to her, and they went back to her and the prisoner and they had a bit of a souffle together; the prisoner lifted up a large iron pipe and let it fall on the head of Julia Banfield, and knocked her down; he then threw the pipe over a fence—several men came up and spoke to him, and he and another man began to spar; they had a sort of running fight till they got close to the libra Arms, I followed them—he men made a rush at the prosecutor who stood in front of me, and then suddenly turned round and ran away without his cap—he made a blow at the lower part of the prosecutor's body—he said "I have been stabbed"—a constable then came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There were about eight people there altogether—the women had been scuffling together—the prisoner had the iron pipe in his hand—I saw no knife—I fancied he was trying to trip the prosecutor up with his hand—I saw the beginning of the disturbance, it began about 20 yards from where the prosecutor was stabbed—there Were about half a dozen persons there at that time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHAYLING (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 99 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>), I was on duty and heard some calls for police and ran up, I found five or six people standing there—from what I was told I went to the prosecutor's house—I found him lying on a couch—I then went and apprehended the prisoner—I told him the charge—he made no reply—I asked him for a knife, he took the one produced from his trousers pocket—I noticed that the big blade had some stains on it, and the small blade had been fresh broken off—I took him to the station and went to the place where the assault had been committed, and found this cap there which the prisoner afterwards said was his, and put it on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I stated before the Magistrate that I noticed stains on the big blade—I did not say that the blade appeared free from recent marks; I swear that—I see the words in the deposition but it is a mistake—I signed my name, but it was not read over to me—I showed the knife to the inspector—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Plaistow—on 9th February I was called to see the prosecutor—he was lying on a sofa and his intestines protruding—he had been stabbed about an inch and a half below the navel—I should say this small blade would be likely to make such a wound—he was in a very weak, bad state—he had lost little or no blood—it was a highly dangerous wound; I apprehended his death and gave a certificate to that effect, and had a Magistrate called in to take his deposi<lb/>tions—I left him in charge of Dr. Howse and attended him afterwards every six hours—I replaced the bowels and sewed up the wound—he in</p>

               <p>proved—I have had considerable experience in such wounds, the general result is death—he is not out of medical treatment yet; he is ruined for life, he will have chronic hernia and be prevented from lifting weights, or running, or any violent physical exercise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This knife was handed to me by the policeman, who stated there were some stains on it—I only saw a little tobacco—I should expect to find blood stains on a knife from such a stab; not much, but in the nick where the nail goes to open it—it must have been a heavy thrust—the prisoner has always borne the character of a peaceable, quiet man in the neighbourhood—such a wound would not break the knife—it seemed to be a friendly quarrel among the women.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I had hold of his coat to guide myself as I had a child in my arms—I was nearly knocked over by Bradshaw trying to pass between my husband and me—I then saw Bradshaw on the ground and my husband on top of him—I thought my husband was <hi rend="italic">dropping into</hi> him for knocking me over with the child—I then saw my husband's watch pass from Bradshaw's into Moore's hand—I screamed out "That is my husband's watch," and if it had not been for the child I should have caught it—I heard Moore say two or three times "I have got the watch," and I turned round and he was gone—on 25th April I was sent for to Greenwich station, where I found eight or nine men placed in the yard and I recognised Moore who took the watch from Bradshaw—I feel certain he is the man.</p>

I was in a crowd at Strait's Mouth, Greenwich, and found Bradshaw being held by Kedge, who charged him with having stolen his watch, and gave him into my custody—Bradshaw said that Kedge had been offered his watch five or six times, and would not take it—a man in the crowd said to Bradshaw "You stole</p>

I am an officer of the H Division of the Criminal Investigation Department—I received information of the robbery, and from a description I apprehended Moore on a Thursday morning at a barber's shop in Brick Lane, Whitechapel—I told him I should take him on suspicion of being concerned with another man named "<hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>" for stealing a watch at Greenwich—he said he knew nothing about it, he didn't do it, but he knew who did—I took him to the station, and he asked me not to let the inspector see him who had Bradshaw in custody until he was placed with some other persons, so as to give him a fair chance—I complied, and took him into a library apart from the station—he was subsequently placed in a yard with seven or eight others—Kedge looked at them, but failed to identify him, but Mrs. Kedge instantly identified Moore; she said "That is the man who did it"—I said "You had better go up and touch him"—she said "I think it is the man" at first, and then on closer investigation she said "I am positive"—I know both the prisoners, and have seen them together on one or two occasions—I saw them the day previous to Good Friday close to where they live, in Cage Street, Spitalfields.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live at 60, Lower Queen Street, Rotherhithe—an the night of 21st April I was coming down Rotherhithe Street and saw the two prisoners speaking to my friend at the corner—I have known the prosecutor about 18 months—I did not hear the prisoners say anything—the prosecutor said to me "Here, I want to speak to you"—I went to him, and he said "These two men have asked me which is the way to the Commercial Dock, you tell them"—I told Eliske, and he said "I think he tell me lie"—I told him "Straight on," and I said "Would you oblige me with a light for my pipe?" and he gave me one, and then I turned round and saw Markgraf standing out in the road with the prosecutor—I was standing with my back to them about 10 yards or a little more distant—when I</p>

               <p>turned round from getting my light from Eliske I saw Markgraf on the top of Plumpton on the ground with a knife in his right hand—then Eliske rushed from me and hit Plumpton about the hip, and I rushed to them directly, when the prisoners got up and ran away—the prose<lb/>cutor said "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, my watch is gone"—I ran and tried to apprehend them about 20 or 30 yards—Markgraf dropped the watch in the gutter—I stopped to pick it up and they gained upon me—I ran again and saw them go round Silver Street into some house in Silver Street—I lost sight of them when they turned the corner—it was a very dull night and raining—I was close to the prisoners, I can swear to them—I gave the watch to the prosecutor—I was going to run for a constable—I saw them given in charge—I was at the door.</p>

I am a labourer at the Oil Works, Rother<lb/>hithe Street—I met Plumpton when I was coming through Rotherhithe station—he was talking to the prisoners—I walked a little way with them—I do not know of a black door leading to the Commercial Dock—I had not heard what the prisoners said to Plumpton—I was only a few steps away when the prosecutor was under the prisoners on the ground—I swear I did not see Plumpton strike any blow—I heard no altercation—I turned to say "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>," when I saw them on the ground—I ran to separate them, when the prisoners ran against the wall and ran away—Markgraf ran from the wall—I did not see Plumpton knock Markgraf against the wall—I swear it—the affair took longer than half a minute, because I was telling the man the way to the Commercial Dock; about a minute—I swear I saw the watch in the gutter—one dropped it—I swear I ran 20 or 30 yards before I saw the watch—I had no chance to hold one of the prisoners when they were on the ground—I do not recollect saying at the police-court that it was after Plumpton had got up that he called out "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, I have lost my watch"—I had not been in a public-house that night—I went to this house because I heard them in the passage going "Hush, hush," making a hushing noise—I was not let in, I did not knock till the constable came up—this is a private house—I know one of the people by sight, and one works at the same firm as I do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Rotherhithe—on the night of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. st, just before midnight, I was called to the police-station and saw the prosecutor there on the floor suffering from an incised and punctured wound on the right side of the chest, about 3 inches below the arm pit—it extended down to the rib—I was able to pass my finger in and feel the rib—it then extended upwards for at least 2 inches, and probably farther, but not wishing to make it worse than it was I did not more minutely probe it—it was most certainly a dangerous wound—it had caused a very considerable amount of hæmorrhage—the whole of the side of the chest was swollen as big as my two hands from the effusion of blood into the structures, and had the stab not been turned, by the knife striking the rib, it must have penetrated the cavity of the chest and wounded the lung most severely; as it was he had lost a very con<lb/>siderable amount of blood and was in a very exhausted condition—this dark-handled knife would not have produced such a wound, but this other would—I say this very advisedly—I had the two knives shown to me at the time and have compared them <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>—the wound would have been inflicted by such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">This white-handled one</hi>), a knife of this width and depth of blade, but not by such a knife as this, the blade is too short and narrow—the blow must have been delivered with very great force—a very considerable quantity of thick clothing was cut through—the wound was barely healed on 4th May—it is now quite healed.</p>

To the best of my judgment such a wound could not be caused by accident, on account of the force with which it was delivered—it was not a mere accidental scraping against—I do not think the effect would have been the same if the body came against the knife—I think it must have been delivered deliberately and with great force—that is my opinion—it is merely matter of opinion.</p>

I am a carman, of 124, Spa Road, Bermondsey—I first saw the prisoners together about the last day or two of February in Thames Street, and I have seen them almost every day till I gave them in charge, in Southwark Street, Spa Road, Commercial Road, Watling Street, Queen Victoria Street, and close to my office—I have watched them and followed them frequently—I have seen them with men in my employ, who are here as witnesses, Murphy, Beaton, Jenkins, and ten or twelve other servants of mine, sometimes when they had loads and sometimes when they were going for loads—early in March I saw them talking to Jenkins, I think it was near the Crown public-house, where they get their coffee or beer of a morning—my business is receiving valuable goods at railway<lb/>stations and conveying them to railway stations—at the beginning of April I spoke to Beaton, my carman, and in consequence of what he told me I cautioned my men about having the prisoners hanging about them, and on 3rd April I saw the prisoners opposite Spa Road for a quarter of an hour, and then gave them in charge, as Jones got on the wheel of my empty van and Smith was alongside it on the pavement—I charged them with inciting my men to rob me—they said that they had not done any<lb/>thing—I took them to my yard, and several of the carmen identified them both.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I watched them both from February to May—I did not conceal myself—I have about twenty drivers, two of them are here—the Crown public-house is about 200 yards from my place—I have heard that Jones lived close to my place—I sometimes saw them speak to my men in the street—sometimes I was on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and sometimes in a cab—my men could not see me—I saw Jones speak to Beaton five or six times, I might say a dozen times, it was every day for a month, or every other day, but sometimes it was two or three times in a day—he has been about our neighbourhood pestering—I have seen them speak<lb/>ing to Beaton in the Spa Tavern and in the Crown, but I first saw him speak to him in Thompson Street—I was not close enough to see whether he pulled up his van—I was feeling my way—I warned my carmen almost every day, the first time was about the end of February—I have seen Murphy speak to Jones about two dozen times—Beaton had spoken to me about this, but Murphy had not, or any of the other carmen—I did not employ detectives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and have been in Mr. Taylor's employ about 12 months—I first saw the prisoners about two months ago at the Crown, in Spa Road, one morning before 7—Jones asked where I was going, I said "To the yard"—he said "I will wait for you to come out"—they remained there and I was in the yard about an hour—when I came out they were waiting outside, and Jones asked me where I was going. I said "To the Bottle Works, Eyre's Quay, to get a load"—he said "You are no use to us this morning"—about the middle of the same week I saw them both again in the street in Spa Road—I was with my van; Jones asked me where I was going, I said "To the Chatham and Dover Line;" he asked me if he could ride with me in my van; I said "No, certainly not"—he said "If we meet you down the road will you let us have one of the cases, and we will open it for you, and take the goods out and do it up again neatly, and no one will know it has been opened?"—I said "No, certainly not, I have heard of too many carmen being in trouble through that sort of case; I cannot do that, certainly not"—Jones could hear what was said, but I don't think he said anything—on another occasion I was going to Horsleydown with my van for some skins—both the prisoners were there, and Smith asked me if I would have something to drink; I said "I do not mind"—a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who I knew was with them, Tracey, who works at the firm—Tracey asked me as well to come, and I went with them to a house in Horsleydown and had something to drink—Smith asked where I was going; I said "Over the water for some hides"—he asked if it was any good his waiting for me; I said "No, it will be no use," but he followed me to Davis's Wharf—I had not to get hides, but I told them so to keep them from coming after me—before that day I had seen them both in Thames Street; I was drinking some beer in a public-house, and Jones asked me if I would have some of what he was drinking—I had some of it and went on with my own, and had something to eat and went out—he then asked me what I was going to load, I told him I did not know—he said "Is it any good my waiting for you?" I said "No," and went away—Smith heard what Jones said—I saw them either four or five times, and two or three times were in Spa Road, but I have also seen them hanging about of a morning near the yard.</p>

I swear I have spoken to them as often as five times, and three or four times we went into public-houses—I took them into public-houses about twice—I don't think I have spoken to them ten times—I have only been into four public-houses with them—they first spoke to me in the street, a very short distance from our place—I did not swear not half an hour ago that I first met them in a public-house; that must have been the second occasion—it is two months ago now—the first words Jones said to me were asking me to have something to drink—he then said "Are you going to do anything for me?" and I thought he meant that I should rob my master—I mean to say that he suggested that the first time I saw him—I had not been warned by my master before that, but I had been spoken to by somebody else—I blame</p>
