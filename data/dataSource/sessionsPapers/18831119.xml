After I got the goods I drove them to Shoreditch. The two men took the van, and drove away. They gave me a pound for my trouble"—he made a similar statement at the station—he mentioned the names of two men—I forget them—Steinbach and Sandell, who have been convicted, he said he did not know—he was taken to the Mansion House, remanded for a week, and then escaped from custody—he was afterwards taken by Detective Sergeant Webb.</p>

               <p>brother, Alfred Nicholson, was living at 13, St. John's Terrace, Hackney Road, on 13th September, 1881—on that day he was summoned to Worship Street Police-court on an affiliation case—I and my brothers William and George Nicholson went to hear the case—when it was over we went to my brother's lodging—we met my brother Morris near Shore<lb/>ditch Church, and he went with us—there was some hooting by the neighbours, and so he went for a walk—we came back about 25 minutes or half-past 9 o'clock—I can't say who went in first, three or four of them went in together, my brother and another chap, a stranger, Henry Roberts, and my brother's wife, Alice Nicholson—I stopped outside, Morris Nicholson stopped outside with me, and a man named Till, and another named Ilstone—I saw the prisoner there and her sister Caroline Hughes—Caroline Hughes stopped in front of the door and would not let my brother Morris go in to my brother Alfred—I saw him give her a push, and then he went in and she began to cry, and her father Solomon Hughes came up and asked her what was the matter; she said "Morris has struck me"—he went inside and went upstairs—I followed him, leaving Caroline Hughes and the prisoner standing at the street-door—when I got on the lauding I felt some one catch hold of me by the waistcoat; it was so dark I could not see who it was at the time, but it turned out to be Solomon Hughes; I pushed him with one hand and caught hold of the corner post of the door to release myself—three buttons of my waistcoat gave way, and he fell downstairs, and I went into the room and told them what had happened—when I got into the room I saw my brother Morris sitting on the bedstead in the front room—my brother Alfred went downstairs to see if the man was hurt—the police came about 9 or 10 minutes afterwards, and Morris was charged with pushing the man downstairs—the prisoner and Caroline Hughes charged him—I said that they should not take him, for I did it, but they shoved me on one side and took him—Mr. Abbot was instructed to appear for my brother at the police-court—I told him everything that had taken place—I attended at this Court when the case came on for trial—I came inside and saw the Counsel, Mr. Geoghegan, and asked him to call me—my brother was convicted of manslaughter—a petition was prepared to the Home Secretary on 10th November—I was laid up for four months with rheumatic fever—directly I was able I went to Scotland yard and gave myself up for this offence—I went several times to he Home Office and to Scotland Yard—I kept my waistcoat for 18 months, and then gave it to a man named King.</p>

On 30th October I went with Inspector Pearson of the North-Western police to Tapp Street, Bethnal Green; I there saw the prisoner; I said "Is your name George Smith?"—he said "Yes"—I said "We are police officers, and are going to take you into custody for being concerned with a man named Rouse, who is in custody, for stealing a truss of cloth on the 23rd of this mouth"—he said "Me steal a truss of cloth!

I am the prisoner's sister, and live at 14, How<lb/>land Street, Marylebone—I am an assistant governess—on Saturday, 6th October, the prisoner came in about 3.30 as near as I can remember, I am not quite confident as to the time—I am at home all day on Satur<lb/>days—I know he was in before 4 o'clock, and did not leave the house till 9 o'clock—my mother returned from her work about 4.30; my brother was at home with me then, and helped me to get the tea—my mother, came in at that time, and said "I will run and fetch the vegetables"—my brother and I demurred, as we were waiting for tea, and we sat at the tea-table—I don't know the time we arose, but I can confidently say that my brother did not go out till 9 o'clock that evening, when I had to go out, and a friend of his accompanied me part of the way—what presses 6th October on my mind is that I had written to a lady and had an answer, and that was the last Saturday that he was at home.</p>

To Leo Serne, for the case of bulbs lost in the transit between Hamburg and London, as per value, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on 3rd October we paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was cashed in the office—he endorsed it in my presence, and the money was handed to him—on 9th October the remaining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid him by the cashier in the office, and he signed this receipt: "Received the above sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in</p>

               <p>settlement of all claims;" across the stamp "Leo Serné"—on both of those occasions he appeared to understand perfectly what was said in English—it was upon the faith that the case was really missing that I advanced him the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should certainly not have done so if I had known he had got the case—this is the bill of lading of the case—it was produced by the prisoner when he came—he endorsed it and we paid him in exchange for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him write the "Leo Serné" across the stamp—there is a similarity between the signature and the document itself—I will not admit that the "Leo Serné" has every attribute of a foreigner's handwriting, and the upper portion every attribute of an Englishman's—nearly all foreigners have a different way of writing from an Englishman—I come in contact with a great many foreigners—"Leo Serné" is undoubtedly in a foreign handwriting—his signature is also on each bill of lading—I do not speak Dutch, I speak a little German—if the case had been opened and some bulbs taken out in the transit we should certainly have paid the claim—I did not see anybody with the prisoner when he came; I am not aware anybody else was with him—he said, "I wish delivery of this case of bulbs"—he spoke with an altered intonation—the case of bulbs was not to be found anywhere at that time—the clerks in the office were present—I had no difficulty in understanding what he said—I saw him a few days afterwards—he was alone then as far as I knew, I saw no one with him—we said we were very sorry we could not find his case, every search had been made for it, and therefore we must make him recompense for it—his English was such that we could under<lb/>stand fully what he wanted—he made no objection—the first time he came he made no claim for loss of contents—he said, "I must have my case of bulbs"—I said, "Unfortunately we cannot trace it"—there was a similar conversation on the second occasion—I will not pledge my oath he used the word "delivery"—he said each time, "I wish to have my case of bulbs"—he said not a word about the inside of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He never said a word about having found the case, or that bulbs were missing out of it—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated 24th September was written from our firm by one of our clerks. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the case of flower roots for which he held the bill of lading had not arrived by s.s.

                  </hi>. I am a fish hawker, and live at 14, Tewkesbury New Buildings, Whitechapel—I have known the prisoner about seven or eight weeks—I went with him to the Custom House on a Monday or Tuesday in September—I saw Mr. Ross, and Mr. Sernégot a landing order from him—I spoke to Mr. Boss in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner first of all came to me and asked me if I wanted to do some jobs or work, to fetch a case of bulbs from the ship, and he would pay me for it—I said I would—somebody told me I could not get the case till I had been to the Custom House, and three of us, Serné, Mr. Smith, whom I don't think is here, and myself, went to the Custom House—the gentleman there asked the value of the case, and I could not tell, and asked Mr. Serné, and he said in Dutch "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I told it to the gentleman in English—when he had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the Custom House we went on board the ship and could not get the case, and went to Messrs. Philips and Graves's office—the next morning the prisoner came to me and said he had got a letter from the man who took the case of roots from the ship by mistake to his own house, and wanted him to fetch them away, as if he did not they would be sent back to Messrs. Philips and Graves—he showed me the letter; I did not read it—I, Serné, and Smith went to the Kingsland Road together to Mr. Runté's, and saw there a lady and that little boy about the case—I took the case, as Mr. Serné told me, to 3, Tewkesbury New Buildings, where Smith used to live—I left it on the pavement; the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> came out, and I told her to take care of it—Serné and Smith did not go with me—there was an address on the case, but I did not read it—as far as I saw the case was in good condition when I took it away, it was not broken at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did the talking at the Custom House; I did not go with him for that. I went to fetch the case away—he said he could not speak too much English, and I said I would do it for him as good as I could—I am Dutch—I don't think I wrote anything for him—I was to have 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for this business—it came to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he would make it all right and give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never had a farthing—Serné asked me to go with him for a Saturday—I said I could not as I had not got an overcoat—he said he had got 13 or 14, and would give me one, and a pair of trousers and a waistcoat—I had the overcoat, not the other things—I have got the overcoat now, I don't think he wanted me to give that back—I am sure he put the value of the case at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am sure it was not 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the police-court 12 or 14 days afterwards—Mr. Smith came to me and said, "Haven't you heard anything of Serné?"—I said no, I hadn't—he said, "Well, I have lent him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and afterwards I lent him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and three pawn-tickets, and then he went to the police-station and told the Court that he had lost the ticket of a watch, and got the watch," and he promised Mr. Smith if he got the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Messrs. Philips and Graves that he would give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Smith said if I didn't go to Messrs. Philips and Graves Mr. Serné would <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on me, as he must have his 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the reason I went to Philips and Graves—I don't know if I have ever seen this declaration document</p>

I have called with reference to the case of bulbs, for which you received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and which was not lost as you said, and which you know all about"—he seemed rather surprised—I said "You have made yourself amenable to the law, and my instructions are to give you into custody"—he hesitated, and then at lost said "I have not got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, but if you will wait here I will send and try and get it"—I forbade his going, and remained there, and sent a message to our principals—I allowed him to go upstairs to his office, and I went up after I had sent to the office—I knocked at the door—ultimately he opened it, and wanted me to go inside—I said "No, I can communicate all I have to say here; I am ex<lb/>tremely sorry, but I have instructions to give you into custody for obtain<lb/>ing the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fraudulently from my people"—he said he did not wish to go through the streets in the company of a policeman, and then I walked</p>

I took Ronckemmer with me to the Custom House. I went from there to the s. s. Holland to see about the case, and there I had the answer that my case could not be found; that very likely it was already delivered on shore. I went to Messrs. Philips and Graves alter this, and they told me that the case had gone to a wharf, and I should have it the next day. The next day I went to Philips and Graves, but the case was nowhere to be found. When I came home I had a letter that my case had come ashore at Blackwall with the passengers' luggage, and then I went to the place I had the letter from to fetch the case. I took the case away with Ronckem<lb/>mer. I took the case in the presence of four witnesses, and instead of bulbs being in it of the value of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they were not of the value of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. After that I went to Philips and Gravers's office to claim the case. I made the claim not for the loss of the case, but for the loss of the bulbs. I can bring witnesses. I signed the claim to receive the money, but I did not know what was written down. I call no witnesses here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butler, now living at 26, Parkworth Road, South Bermondsey—on 30th September I was butler in the employment of Mr. Townsend, of 94, Harley Street—I had been in that service two years and eight months—I have known the prisoner two years and a half—during that time he came to Harley Street to see me about five or six times—the other servants in the house saw him—on Saturday, 29th September, the family was out; they returned a little after 11—I had charge of the plate; I put it away about 5 that afternoon in a chest in the pantry—I kept the keys—after the family came home I locked the house up and put out the gas—I had been out to the Fisheries Exhibition—my bedroom is on the basement—after locking up the place and putting out the gas I heard a knocking at the area railings, after I had gone into my room—the pantry is opposite my bedroom, near the area door—I had not been to bed, I had undressed—I put on my trousers, and opened the area door and saw the prisoner—he said "Don't be alarmed, it is only me, I want to speak to you for a minute or two"—I went into my bedroom and put on my waistcoat and coat, and took the key of the area, Unlocked it, and let the prisoner in and lit the gas—the key was always kept in the pantry—the prisoner went with me into the pantry—I asked him if he had had his supper; he said "No"—I told him I had got some I had left that I could not eat myself, would he accept of it; he said "Yes, with pleasure"—he said he had got a friend outside, who he was to meet in about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—I got him some supper—I put the key of the area gate in the corner of the pantry, on the dresser—I gave him a steel carving-fork and a table-knife to eat his supper with—I told him he must excuse the fork, as the plate was all locked up—he said "You have locked up, then? "I said "Yes"—I don't think I told him where I had locked it up—he did not have any<lb/>thing to drink—he ate his supper—he then asked me to turn down the gas, and said "I will go into your room for a purpose"—I did turn down the gas, and he walked into my room, and I followed him, as the door was open—the bed was behind the door in a sort of a recess—I sat down on a box at the foot of the bed, he sat on a chair beside the table—before he came in I had put my silver watch with a chain attached to it under my pillow—I also had a gold watch—I think the chain of the silver watch could be seen—I did not observe it myself—the prisoner walked up to the side of my bed, and took the silver watch, and looked at it, and said "I thought you always</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190029"/>
               <p>wore a gold one when you went out of an evening"—I said "Not always, particularly when I am likely to go where there is a crowd"—he said "You have got that stowed away then, I suppose"—he looked at my watch again—I thought he wanted to look at the time—he then said, "I must be going"—I said "Yes, it is getting late, I have no doubt"—I then turned towards the door to go and open it to let him out—he said "Well, I must go, good night, old boy"—that was before we had left the bedroom—he then put his left hand on my left shoulder and with his right he drew a razor across my throat—I saw the razor coming before it touched me—the blood spurted out on my hands, which I held just in front of me—I said "For God's sake, Collins, what are you doing?"—he said "You b—, I have got you now"—I struggled and got hold of his hand with the razor in it with my right hand—he threw me on the ground—I fell on my back—he tried then to get at my throat with the razor, and with my hand I kept it back and had three of my fingers out and a piece of my thumb—we had a struggle, and I got on the top of him—at that time the blood was flowing freely from my throat—a further struggle ensued and we both got on our feet—I caught hold of the bedstead—he still had the razor in his hand—he changed it into his left hand and was cutting at my throat on the left side—he drew it across my throat three times on the left—I saw the razor coming again and I put up my right hand and caught hold of it and it dropped out of my fingers—I had no razor of my own in my room; I only had one and that was in the pantry—this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not mine, I had never seen it before that night—I took it up and threw it at the head of the bedstead and it fell at the back of a box—the prisoner then caught hold of me and tried to put his finger down one of the cuts in my throat—I struggled with him, and he threw me on the pillow, and put the pillow on the back of my head—I think he kept me there about five minutes—I then threw him over, and I think he fell on his back—I tried to hold him, but I could not keep him down—I don't know exactly what I said at the time—he didn't say anything before he took his hands off—after we had struggled several times he tried to put his hand over my mouth and stop my breathing—he got exhausted, and I asked him then to take his hand off, which he did—he then said, "For God's sake, what have I done?"—I said "What have you done this for?"—he said "I don't know, the devil has done it"—I then got up and went along the passage towards the kitchen calling out—the prisoner kept saying "Come back and forgive me"—he followed me about as far as the kitchen door, and he stood there, and I went into the kitchen away from him—I heard him go back into the pantry, and then I came out of the kitchen—I had called out for help in my room, but not after I got into the passage—when he went into the pantry I heard the splashing of water, and he called for me to go down into the pantry and wash myself—I was very exhausted—I heard him go to the area door and heard the gate shut, and in two or three seconds I heard the key fall down into the area—I rang the nursery bell, and assistance came—a doctor came in and attended to me—I next saw the prisoner about 6 o'clock next morning—he was placed by my bedstead with a number of men, and I picked him out—I was afterwards taken to St. Thomas's Hospital, and was discharged from there on the 22nd October—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I thought afterwards that he did this for the purpose of robbery—I have known him for a long time and was very friendly with him—I don't think he ever came so late and had his supper with me before; if he did he went into the kitchen at 9 o'clock—he was never in my place as late as 12 before—I saw him about four or five times during the time I knew him—it might have been five or six times; I don't think more; it was not three or four times a month—I did not ask him to have a drink with the supper; I don't think I opened a bottle of ale—he didn't say "I would rather not have it," nor did I say "You look as if you had been drinking"—I had opened a bottle of ale before he came, and had a glass of it myself—I don't know whether I gave him a glass or not; I don't think I did: I might have done so; I don't say I did not—I don't think he said "I have had enough; I have been drink<lb/>ing whisky, and that always upsets me"—I swear he didn't say that, or anything to that effect—I did not say "I thought you had been drinking, you look like it, but a glass-won't hurt you"—when he had had his supper we talked on different matters—he had seen me with my gold watch before—I don't always wear that when I go out—when he looked at the watch he said "It is late, I must go"—that was after he had looked at it twice—he asked me to go into the bedroom and to turn down the gas; I went with him because I thought he wanted to talk about something particular—there was no one in the pantry—I wanted him to remain in the pantry, and he said "No, don't waste so much gas; I will go into your room"—he walked into it; the door was standing open—he had never been there before that I know of—I didn't ask him to stop when he wanted to go—no dispute arose between us; we were talking about the Fishery Exhibition and the things I saw there while we were in the bed<lb/>room—he had some corned beef for his supper; it only took him two or three minutes to have it—I did not give him the slightest offence, nor he me, that I know of—he is a barber's assistant—he didn't when he took out the razor make make a gash with it at my hand; it was at my throat first I am quite sure—I think we were struggling together for about three-quarters of an hour from the commencement—he seemed very ex<lb/>hausted—I didn't have the razor at all, only when I took it up after it had cut my fingers—I called out at the time he was cutting my throat whenever I could—I called out when I was upon him, but of course I was trying to keep him down, and to keep him away from me all the time—I don't know exactly what I called out; I called out as well as I could—I didn't call out when I heard him washing—I didn't go upstairs—I didn't ring the bell till he had gone—he was not more than two or three minutes washing himself—he didn't suggest that both of us should wash ourselves—I did not wash myself—I did not give him the key and ask him to fling it on the mat—he took it up from the pantry table—I said at the police court the words the prisoner made use of were "Lord have mercy; what have I done?"—it was something to that effect—when he took his hands off me I went along the passage towards the kitchen to get out of his way—I had no chance of calling my master down then—he was following me, and I was afraid if he had any other instrument he would cut me again—he was saying "Bass, forgive me" as he followed me—I could not get upstairs; I was exhausted, and I was afraid of him—he didn't try to take my silver watch or anything—I opened the kitchen door to go through to the larder—I could have called out there if I had got into the</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital on Sunday, 30th September, when Baas was brought there—he was under my care until he was discharged on 22nd October—in my opinion the wound in the throat was the result of several cuts—it was on the right side of the middle line, just above the thyroid cartilage—it was a deep wound, deeper towards the middle, and more shallow outside, about an inch and a quarter long—on the left side, and I believe not continuous with this one, was another wound, about three and a half inches long, extending from the middle line to just below the lobule of the ear—this wound seemed to me to tail towards the outer part; crossing these were two other superficial wounds, somewhat circular, and not quite straight—these were the whole of the wounds on the throat—there was an oblique wound on the chin, I think on the right side—I think this razor would inflict the wounds I saw.</p>
               <p>

On Sunday morning, 14th October, I was on duty at Molyneux Street Police-station—at about 12.45 the two prisoners were brought in by Buck and Nicholas—I took the charge—Florrie Williams charged them with assaulting her and robbing her of a purse containing 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in Oxford Terrace—there was no mention at that time of the brooch, but a few minutes later Bevan brought it to the station—in answer to the charge, Wise said he knew nothing about it—Ash said "We had been drinking in the Green Man public house, Edgware Road, and walked together down the Edgware Road; I gave the woman a florin to go for a walk with her down Oxford Terrace"—she said "You did nothing of the kind"—she did not deny the walk, only receiving the money.</p>

I am the Divisional Surgeon of Police at Marylebone—on 14th October I was called to the Molyneux Station and there saw the prosecutrix—she seemed to be suffering from shock—her left hand seemed to be bruised and was a good deal swollen, no permanent injury has been caused—I have not seen her since—I should think she is perfectly right.</p>

The "leader in the affair" has some<lb/>thing to do with Leader and the baby, and I believe "portable" mean's money—I also wrote: "I do not think I ought to write to 'Ajax.'" That is Mr. Heath, he signed himself "Ajax" in his paper. "I have told them to let him have my address if he asks for it." I was not keeping out of the way; I mentioned that I left my address—I was not in want of money, I had plenty—when a man is worried we say it is a <hi rend="italic">chopper</hi>—I understood that Leader was worrying Mr. Heath.</p>

               <p>boxes of cigar supplied by Mr. Biggs—I searched Palmer, and found nine pawntickets, two of which related to Mr. Biggs's goods, a quantity of letters, a memorandum, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—he said "I must have been a fool to stop here"—he said at the station "You have recovered nearly all the cigars;" I said "No, there is a quantity missing still"—he said "I have sold 12 boxes to a friend of mine; I shall not say who it is, I don't want to get him into trouble"—I went to 116, Portland Street, Manchester, and found that somebody had been trading there as Brierley and Co.—I found in the grate a large correspondence partially destroyed by fire, among which was a letter from Edward Williams, an envelope of Stanley Street, and other papers relating to the charge—I have been to Mornington Street since Palmer's arrest, and found documents in the writing of both prisoners—I received Brierley in custody at Stockport, and received the papers—I found nothing on him—I went to Bury Street, Southport, and found more papers, and at Mornington Street I found this sample of essence of lemon—there was a large quantity of these bill heads at 78, Bury Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fitter in the employment of Messrs. McKinlay and Co., iron founders, 23, Upper Thames Street—the two prisoners were carmen in the same employment—on Friday night, 12th October, at 6.35, after we came back from tea, I went into the warehouse, and the prisoners were then at the tailboard of the van, which was at the bottom of the gateway—the vans in McKinlay's place back right in from the street; this was backed right in, and the bottom gate leading from the street shut—I went upstairs into my shop, and I heard the sound of gutterings and also pans being put into the van—gutterings are in about 6 feet lengths—I did not see any gutterings in the van—I could not say that it was empty—when we left the place there was no light on the first floor; when we got back and they were standing at the tailboard there was—the gutterings and pans are kept on that first floor—I had been the last to leave the first floor, and I had turned the gas down when I left at tea-time at 6.5—in the ordinary course of business the gratings are brought from the first floor to the ground floor and loaded there—at 6.45 When I was in the shop I saw the two men at the tailboard talking together—I was examined at Guildhall, and said "I saw the two accused loading gutter<lb/>ing into the van, and afterwards I heard the guttering go on"—I have not got a very good memory—I heard Hare say as they were going out that he was going round to get some grain for the horses—I watched the van go out; I saw it come home; the doors were opened by one of the prisoners; the other had put the horse in the van again—I did not see that done; I believe Randall closed the doors because he had to back the van of which he was carman in after the other went out—I watched at the top of the lane till 8.55, when Hare came down with the van and put it in the stable—he was driving Randall's horse in his own van—there was nothing in it—I saw him drive round the house to the stable, which is round in Blackfriars—he had to open the doors again; they all had keys; that was the last I saw of him—McKinlay's men knock off work at 6 unless a customer comes in—on this Friday we knocked off at 5.55, but I, Ward, Arnold, and Charley Graves had to come back to work late—Arnold is the one that gives the piecework out—I said something to Arnold with regard to what I saw, and the next morning, Saturday, I informed Mr. John McKinlay, my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman and storekeeper in Messrs. McKinlay's service—the guttering is kept on the first floor over the gateway—it was 6 feet 4 1/2 inches—OG is the section of it—I went over it on Friday, 12th October, between 3 and 4 p.m.—it was in its berth on the floor over the gateway—the berth was very nearly full—I next looked at it on the Saturday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock when I had to serve a customer, and it was then between 100 and 200 lengths short—I went through the stock of galvanised pans on the Saturday morning—40 each of six, eight, and ten gallons came, in on the Friday morning—on the Saturday morning 40 more six and eight gallons came in—there then were only 28 left of the 40 ten gallons that dame in on the Friday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with others as McKinlay and Co., of Upper Thames Street, iron founders—on Saturday, 13th October, I received a communication from my brother John, one of my partners, and on the Monday morning I sent for the detective Taylor, and then for Hare to my room—I said to him "I suppose you know what you are sent for"—Taylor said "I am a detective; what have you done with the guttering that you took out on Friday evening?"—Hare said he did not take out any guttering—the detective said why had lie taken out the horse and van, where had he been if he did not take out any guttering—Hare said "I was coming along Thames Street about a quarter past 6 o'clock and met a man who asked me if I would do a job for him; I said 'Yes,' and took my horse and backed the van into the doorway, into the gateway, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190054"/>
               <p>changed horses with Randall"—he said "Why did you change horses with Randall? why take out the horse at all and change horses with Randall?"—Hare said his own horse was broken-winded and Randall had a better horse—Taylor asked him again "Did you do the job? did you remove the goods?"—Hare said "No, I went out and could not find the man; I went along Thames Street and Victoria Street and couldn't find him"—Taylor said "How long were you away, when did you come back?"—he said "About half-past 7 o'clock"—he also asked him when he went out—he said "About a quarter to 7 o'clock"—I took no notes of it—that was all that was said—he was not allowed to leave the room, but went farther up into another portion of the room, and then Randall came in—he was asked, and made a statement, nearly as Hare had made it, that he changed the horses, but if gutterings were put in he had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it—he was asked "What did you do with yourself in the meantime, did you go and meet Hare?"—he said "No, I went to the stable and cleaned Hare's horse"—he was asked "Did you see Hare again?" he said "Yes, I saw him again about a quarter to 9 o'clock"—"Where"—he said "Up Queen Victoria Street or at the end of a wharf, I am not certain which"—Taylor said "Then Hare did not come back till a quarter to 9?"—he said "Yes"—I and Taylor both asked the questions—he said he waited till he came home—Hare was not sufficiently near to hear what was said—he was asked why he stopped so long, from a quarter to 7 o'clock till then—he said he stopped to clean his own horse—I gave directions that they should both be taken into custody there and then, and charged with stealing the guttering, not the pans—St. Paul's Wharf is very narrow, and vans are backed in this through the gateway and loaded in the warehouse, and put there at night so that they shall not obstruct the street—there is a large opening to let things down from in the first floor—as a rule, if guttering.; were to be loaded they would be let down from the first floor to the ground-floor where the vans were, but if only one or two gutterings were wanted the men would carry them down—the loading of gutterings is a sort of thing which if one hears once he is not likely to forget—any one who heard could tell it—they are pushed over one another and make a peculiar noise—on the other side of the first floor is the fitter's shop—they were two distinct buildings at one time, but there is a large opening 10 feet wide between the two now in the wall that runs up and takes the roof, and there are openings where windows were going to be put in but they have not been—if our men in the fitter's shop stood on a stool they could see through the windows into the first floor—there is a different access to the fitter's shop—the carmen have keys to the small gateway to let themselves in after business hours when they come back with empty vans—they should place the vans in the proper place, return the horses to the stable, and go home—the ordinary hour for breaking off is 6 as near as possible—the gas would be turned off on the first floor unless the fitters had been working, except just enough for the carmen to see—Taylor made no communication to me about the stove-fronts; my attention was drawn to it by my brother, who is not here, but my son is here, to whom the communication was made—no blame has attached to Taylor in connection with that matter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 216). On Wednesday morning, 29th August, about five minutes past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Wardour Street, and noticed smoke issuing from the grating of the basement of No. 17, which is called the Pandora Restaurant—I rang the bell—it was answered in three or four minutes by a man from the second-floor window—I spoke to him, and he came down—before he answered the bell I heard footsteps in the basement—the man then came down and opened the door—I could not swear to the man then; I can now, it was Amerio—I went into the house and into the basement, and in the front kitchen I saw a gas jet in the pipe running along the wall—the pipe had been cut, and the gas was burning from it—it was rather a large flame, the ceiling was burning—the pipe originally ran along the ceiling, but it had been bent down; the flame was playing on the ceiling—the burning gas was about a yard from the gas bracket—I could not see any other fire in the basement, but there was a great deal of smoke there—the first thing I did was to get some cloths, which Amerio handed to me, and I put them round the pipe and put the gas out—I then went upstairs to the entrance, and on looking round I saw flames, or rather a glare, in the back dining<lb/>room—I examined that room, and found two pipes burning nearly close to the ceiling, not from the original bracket, but from cuts in the pipe—that had burnt the paper up the wall, but had not set fire to the ceiling—I tried to extinguish those, but was unable to do so—I threw water over them, but was unable to reach them—I then wont up to the first floor, and in an ante<lb/>room there I saw another gas-bracket screwed off, and gas lighted there—that had set fire to the paper, and the window frame was burning—I ascended to the second floor and tried to ascertain if persons were in bed—I then tried to ascend to the other floor, but could not—I then went down to the front door, and to the best of my belief I saw the prisoner turning round the corner to go into Gerard Street, which was about 50 yards off—he had his coat on his arm—I did not see any other persons but the prisoner and Amerio—I stayed outside till the firemen arrived—at half-past 8 the same morning I saw the prisoner again at the house—I asked him if he was the person that opened the door to me—I understood him to say yes—I went into the back part of the basement, and found some embers of an extinguished fire in the wine-cellar; it appeared to be composed of straw and wood—it was not on fire then, it had been put out—that fire had burnt through the rafters to the ground floor—it was Amerio who opened the door to me.</p>

I was called to the fire at 17, Wardour Street—I got there about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock—I first went up to the first floor—I there found the gas burning from a hole in the pipe at the side of the bracket—that was in a small room at the back of the second floor, the window of which looks on to the staircase; it was closed—I ex<lb/>tinguished that fire with some water that I got from a hand-jug in the room—I then went to the ground floor—I saw two distinct lights in the dining-room on the side of the wall, they were burning from the pipe; the paper on the wall was on fire—I did not put that out, I could not get near, the smoke was too strong—I went down into the basement to try and find the meter, and eventually I did find it, and turned off the gas—the smoke was very thick; the gas was full on—I could not see whether the gas was burning in the back part of the cellar—the smoke was so thick I had to get out of the room two or three times before I could turn the gas off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector C</hi>). At 7 o'clock on the morning of 29th August I went to 17, Wardour Street—I made an examination of the whole house—I found traces of two fires in the basement—one was in a cupboard called the wine-cellar, at the extreme back of the premises, the shelves of which were burnt—there were a quantity of embers of straw—that fire had apparently killed itself, by the density of the smoke—there was a very much larger fire in the corner of the cellar, and a lot of half-broken straw bottle-covers, and several pieces of wood, apparently parts of shelves burnt down—that fire had gone through into the ground floor behind the wainscoting—the rafters were burnt through, and the flooring on that side was unsafe to tread upon in consequence—on the ground floor imme<lb/>diately above this large fire in the basement there were two gas-brackets; the pipes leading from the ceiling down to those brackets had been cut close to the bracket; the gas having been then lit, the lead pipe had melted close up to the ceiling—the wall was covered with canvas and paper, and that was burnt through—upstairs, in a small room leading from the front to the back rooms, there was a gas-bracket by the side of the window; the pipe there had been cut, and the flames from the gas had burnt about a foot of the window frame—the pipes are here—after I had made the examination, about eight o'clock, the prisoner and Tobia came in together—Constable Fowler spoke to the prisoner first and asked him if he was not the man who opened the door to him—the prisoner said something which I under<lb/>stood to be yes, I am not sure about it—I then asked him where the other man was who had slept in the house, he replied that he did not know—I then asked him to show me where he (the prisoner) had slept; he motioned me to come with him—whatever he said was in very broken English—I followed him upstairs into a room (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on a model produced</hi>)—there was a bed there; it had not been slept on; neither the bed or bedding was in any way disturbed—I pointed that out to him—he said something which I could not understand—he then motioned me to come out of that room, and led me to another one; there was a bed there—I said "That bed has not been slept in"—it had not been slept in, neither bed or bedding</p>

               <p>were disturbed—he said that was the room in which he usually slept, but he had not slept there that night, but in the other one; that was what I under<lb/>stood him to say—I found that I could not get on with him at all without an interpreter, so I sent for Constable Boultman, who speaks French, and he interpreted to him in French what I said to him—he made no answer—he was taken into custody—a few days afterwards I went with Mr. Marchaud to 15, Panton Street, and he pointed out to me in a bedroom there a box and a hat-box, and a parcel consisting of a rug, a greatcoat, one or two sticks, and an umbrella—the box was not locked; I searched it, it contained a man's clothing and linen marked E.R.; there were handker<lb/>chiefs, shirts, socks, and different things, and a quantity of letters addressed to Evasio Rollino, at different places, one letter addressed Messrs. Rollino and Tobia, 17, Wardour Street, enclosing a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated August 28th, payable to the order of Rollino and Tobia, both the existing licences of the house, and several old licences—I found a bunch of keys on the prisoner, one fitted the box and one the hat-box, and several keys which fitted different rooms and cupboards in the Pandora—I made a search at Wardour Street to see if any men's clothes were there—I found one or two old articles, one or two shirts, and an old coat and waistcoat; nothing else, except a coat belonging to one of the sailors, which he afterwards claimed and took away—I was present on 11th September, when a statement was made in Inspector Greenham's presence—that was in consequence of a letter I received from the governor of the gaol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was at 7 in the morning, about four hours after the alarm of fire, that I went up and saw the bed—it was in consequence of so imperfectly understanding what the prisoner said that I sent for an interpreter—this matter was under investigation before the Magistrate for some weeks—it was known that Campigni was in Italy—he appeared on the seventh remand, that was six weeks after the prisoner was charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only found one bed in the house that appeared to have been slept on, that was one which the girl pointed out as the one she slept on; no other bed had been touched—the clothing of her bed was all disturbed; I could not say whether any one had been in it or on it; it had evidently been slept on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, of 46, Compton Street, Soho—on the 8th December the leasehold interest of 17, Wardour Street and all the furniture and effects were mortgaged to me by a deed which I produce—they had been mortgaged to me about eight years before that—on 8th December Mr. Caramelli mortgaged these premises and effects to me for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was to be paid by instalments—Caramelli afterwards assigned to Alurto, and Alurto paid some of it to me in instalments—I recognised him as the representative of the original mortgagor—on 8th December I instructed Mr. Sidney Garrett to take an inventory of the goods—on the 5th February, 1883, Tobia became the assignee of the mortgagor—I knew nothing about Lazziere, I believe he came in afterwards as a partner or something—in June one of the instalments which became due was unpaid; I put a man in possession about four weeks after, on the 1st June, 1883—the amount of the instalments was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including the interest—after the man was in possession Tobia came to me, and about a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards the prisoner came, and they paid me by this cheque—the prisoner was rather excited—he spoke broken English, but I understood him—I can</p>

I trade as the Ladies' Dressmaking Asso<lb/>ciation at 4, Camden Road—previous to last April I knew the prisoner as a customer, as Mrs. Chetwynd, and about March or the beginning of April she came and wanted a silk dress made to order—I asked her for the customary deposit: she said that she had never given it before and should not give it now; she was the wife of Sir George Chetwynd, and was seeking a divorce, and her matters would be settled directly—the dress was to be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the understanding was that it was to be paid for on delivery—on the Saturday on which it was to be ready I received this letter from her. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "S.R.

               <p>I asked her who he was, as I did not know—she said that he was the brother of Mr. Chetwynd who lived at Brockton Hall, a second cousin of mine—on 17th October, when I arrived at home, I found her in the hall—she said that she was in great distress, and owed her landlord some money, and did not know what to do—I asked why she did not communicate with her relations—she said she was so worried she had not time, and asked me to write a letter to her landlord, Mr. Jeffrey, of Henrietta Mansion, Cavendish Square, asking him not to be hard upon, her, not to press her for the rent—I did so on condition that she would communicate with her relations—this is my letter—I did not know that she had represented herself as my wife or my sister-in-law, and I wrote it from motives of kindness, believing her statement—Mr. Jeffrey called on me at 10 o'clock next morning, and I told him I had telegraphed to Mr. Chetwynd of Brockton Hull, and would communicate with him—I received an answer that evening when I returned home, and wrote to Mr. Jeffrey, enclosing the letter and some testimonials which the prisoner had left with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and carry on business at 4, Austin Friars—I have known Watters about a year as a stock and share broker at Draper's Gardens—he is an outside broker, not a member of the Stock Exchange—we had a small trans<lb/>action</p>

               <p>last November, and he dealt with me again last March, since when he has employed me to buy and sell stocks on the Stock Exchange—I believe they were speculative transactions, and they were to the extent of several millions—all the contracts I make on the Stock Exchange I am personally liable for—he deposited securities with me from time to time as cover, and I always had a margin of 10 per cent, in case the stocks should go down—the settling days at the Stock Exchange are at the end and middle of the month—these speculative transactions are called time bargains—the account is made up at the end of each fort<lb/>night without the actual thing purchased being handed over, but a balance is struck—I made out a contract note in every case on the same evening between 3 and 4 or 4 and 5 o'clock, which showed the transaction—this letter of 24th May is signed by Watters. (<hi rend="italic">Autho<lb/>rising the witness to take any Stock at any time towards liquidating any balance against him</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Watters</hi>), <hi rend="italic">stipulating for the right of paying off any amount at any moment, and that the same securities which he had deposited were to be returned to him.</hi>) On 1st October I had advanced 55,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I got security from him for 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I deposited most of the bonds with other people and kept some myself—the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. margin was to cover losses; she object was to cover transactions in other stocks—I believe this letter to be written by Watters.

Herewith cheque to pay off loan on 600 Pennsylvanians. Please see that it is the last 600 I delivered to you.—J.D.W." This cheque for 6, 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed by Watters, accompanied it, in exchange for which I delivered to him the 600 Penn<lb/>sylvanians referred to—on 1st October, about 10.30 a.m., I received this letter, enclosing two cheques.

Watters.</hi>) I had the securities under my control—I saw Watters at my office about 11.30, and told him I could not give up the securities unless he gave me other securities in exchange, a marked cheque or bank notes—a marked cheque is one marked by the banker upon whom it is drawn that it will be met when presented—he asked if I could not manage to give him the securities in exchange for the cheques—he went away and I believe he returned about 1 or 1.30, but I am not sure that I saw him—I after<lb/>wards received from Watters 16,000 Egyptian Preference, I cannot say personally—one of my clerks then gave him all the securities mentioned in the letter by my order: 70 Suez Canal shares, 460 Pennsylvanians, and his cheques for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the two values were approxi<lb/>mately equal to each other—I lodged part or all of the Egyptian Preference shares at the Union Bank of London—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of them, with the numbers, and these two lists together contain them all—the two cheques were duly paid—next day I wrote out this letter, and Mr. Watters signed it. ("T. McMicking, Esq. Sir,—Will you please sell for cash on the best terms my Stocks, and also the balance on my account. I authorise you to close my account if you think fit.—J.D. Watters.") I closed the account—he asked me to sell the whole of the securities</p>

               <p>against which I had advanced money, including the 16,000—I asked him if there was anything wrong—he said "No," or that he did not know, and asked me to carry out his orders, and then I wrote out that letter and asked him to sign it—that was 2nd October, but the account had not been closed—I had made up the account in the ordinary way at the end of the fortnight, and a new fortnight had been entered upon and another account opened—I did not wish to keep a big account open, because he was selling, and I did not wish him to take away the securities I had—I sold the stock on the Stock Exchange, and there was a balance in his favour of 1,482<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave that to the solicitor, the bank having restrained me from paying it over—I afterwards saw Watters in Throg<lb/>morton Street, and mentioned the stock I had sold, including the Egyptian, and the price I had sold at—he asked me to render the account as soon as I could, and to pay the balance to him before 4 o'clock; that is to say, during banking hours—the account being a long one, and the book-keeper not having the particulars ready, he was unable to make up the balance before banking hours were over—the cheque could have been ready, but being crossed would be of no use to him that day, as it was past 4 o'clock, so it was not paid that evening—after it was made up Watters came round and saw me next day, and asked me for the cheque—I said that I could not pay it to him, because I had been restrained by the solicitor of the River Plate Bank from doing so—he said that it was a pity I had not paid the cheque over before I received the notice, or he may have said it was a pity I had not made up the account quicker—I had had no notice from the bank, but I had a caution from the solicitor—I did not know Warden in the matter—I never heard of him—I knew no one but Watters from beginning to end—he never told me who his principals were or for whom he was acting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never asked him—those transactions were conducted in the way of business—they were not very unexceptional in their magni<lb/>tude—a great many people employ brokers to buy and sell to a large amount on the Stock Exchange—the value of the transactions have very little relevancy to what the balance will be—the cover we require depends upon how a person is introduced—the loans are apart from and supple<lb/>mentary to the ordinary account, and a separate account is kept—the first loan was on March 9th, when I advanced 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against some Argentines of 1881, which remained with me till 21st May, 1883, when I handed back 11,200 Argentines and received 920 Pennsylvanians, which were approximately equal to what I handed back—the Pennsylvanians remained in my possession till 1st October—another loan was contracted between 21st May and 27th June, when I received 2,600 Dominions and 280 Pennsylvanians in exchange for 8,000 Deheras, which I gave up—on 14th August I received 29, 500 Argentines, 600 Pennsylvanians, and 5,000 Dominions, and gave in exchange 18,000 Unified, 1,400 Egyptian Preference, and 2,600 Dominions—on 20th September I received 20,000 Argentine hard dollars, and gave in exchange 1,500 Buenos Ayres of 1873 and 2,200 Pennsylvanians of 1870—on 21st September, 1883, I held 1,800 Pennsylvanians against 12,000 Argentines of 1881, 4,000 Argentines of 1882, 2,000 Egyptian Preference, 5,000 Egyptian Domain, and 49, 500 Argentine hard dollars, against which I had advanced 45, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you the stock price of the day, but as I advanced within 10 per cent, of the value, the value would be 4, 600 more than the advance I made—on 28th September I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190102"/>
               <p>a cheque from Watters for 6, 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay off a loan on 600 Pennsylvanians—that cheque was drawn on his own account, and I gave it back to him later in the day on his giving me 5, 600 Argentines of 1882 and 70 Suez Canal Shares—those were given to me towards a fresh loan of 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is an uncommon thing to do—if he had contracted a fresh loan a few hours after, I should think it natural that he should give the same cheque back; it often happens that a broker takes a cheque supposing that the drawer has the whole amount at his banker's, so that a customer receiving securities could realise them and feed his account so as to meet the cheque, and if he tookaway the securities he would get his cheque back—when I took the cheque I never supposed that Watters would want another loan the same day, and I intended to pay it in—I pay in about 3.30, but he wanted another loan, and I handed him his own cheque and a balance cheque for 4, 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my practice is to keep cheques till 3.30, and pay them all in together—his cheque was part of the advance I made him—I presume it would be the same on October 1st if he had received the securities—there could be no difficulty in putting the account in credit—I did not under<lb/>stand the giving of such cheques as a representation that he had the amount at his bank—I have said "There was nothing wrong in his giving me a cheque for 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he not having that amount at his banker's; his bankers understand this"—a stockbroker on account day usually finds how much he has to pay, draws cheques to that figure, and the people to whom he owes money, according to the multitude of his transactions, take those cheques, but it does not mean that he has that amount, he has to receive money from others, and the cheques he receives are set off against the amount he draws—a man draws for 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the expectation that other people will pay him more than 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of his winnings from them—there is nothing wrong in his drawing cheques up to the value of the security—giving a cheque implies that there is cash at the bank or securities in their possession—the cheque does not represent value in the possession of the person who draws it, but it represents actual cash at the bank—I consider that it represents value in one form or other—a cheque always represents value actually in the possession or under the control of the drawer, but it may be in securities as well as a balance at the bank—if I had a large cheque which a banker had marked, and which he would pay, I should be willing to give it up—29,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was more than I was disposed to hand over—I did see the securities, as they were in my possession, but I did not give them up, as I did not choose to trust him with them—that was one reason out of half a dozen—it never crossed my mind that he would misapply them; that would imply that he was capable of running away with them, but I did not like to put 29,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his pocket to do what he liked with—a stockbroker having a large sum to pay and to receive would draw a cheque without regard to the securities in his possession—there are differences—brokers are in the habit of drawing cheques in the hope that their debtors will have paid to enable them to meet their cheques, but generally they are small cheques; but these cheques I am referring to are for 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when securities are pawned—I did not myself hand back the securities to Mr. Watters on 1st October—I cannot be sure whether I saw him after the interview that morning; I don't think I did, I may have done—on that day two cheques of mine, one for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were handed to him—those cheques came back to me, one through the Union Bank, my bank, and one through the London and</p>

               <p>Yorkshire Bank—they were both paid—if the securities had been realised on the morning of 1st October, there would have been a con<lb/>siderable balance in Watters's favour—in the course of the afternoon there was a serious fall in the value of some of the stock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't say that if the account had been closed earlier Watters's account would have realised a profit, but it would have realised much more that it did if it was closed on the following day—I think, from memory there was always a loss in September.</p>

               <p>him about six years previously; I had never spoken to him since—this memorandum, "Handed to J.D.W. same day, J.R. is my writing—the securities there mentioned were handed over to the prisoner by me, and the 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was endorsed by me and paid in to the bank—it was about half-past 11 as near as possible when I handed over the securities—about a quarter to 5 I found that the cheque had been returned—I went after Watters and met him; I told him his cheque had been returned, and asked what he had done with the securities I had given him—he said he had delivered them to his client, Mr. Warden, who had promised to provide his cheque and had failed to do so—I understood from him that Warden was missing—I had the cheque then in my possession—I took him round with me to the London and West<lb/>minster Bank to give an explanation; that is the bank to whom the cheque was paid, and who held my principal's securities—he told them much the same as he had told me—he said that he had margins with another broker, and with the aid of his friends he quite expected he would be able to put the matter right—these produced are the lists giving the particulars of those securities that were delivered up and those remainidg in our hands, which we afterwards sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I mean he was trying to get money from his friends, and to sell the securities he had from other brokers—an account was summed up every fortnight and a balance was struck, which had to be paid or received by the broker: that is the balance I spoke of; the whole account would be closed, but there would still be a balance.</p>

I once asked Mr. Watters for the names of his clients; that was the middle of June; he said he was not able to give them up, but I could be satisfied that things were all right, it would be a breach of trust—it is not usual to do so on the Stock Exchange—certain securities were deposited with me, and afterwards exchanged—5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptian Preference were deposited with us on June 29 and 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on June 15, and they were returned to Watters on 12th July—on 15th July we received 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Spanish 5 per cents., which we handed back on 19th September—there is nothing unusual in the exchange of securities—on 1st October Watters communicated with my clerk about the cheque being returned, but I did not see him till the evening, when he said that Warden had disappeared—he told me that when he went to the River Plate Bank that afternoon one of the gentle<lb/>men there said that he had better sell what securities he had out and cover himself—he mentioned a cheque for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he hoped to receive from Mr. McMahon, and to hand it to Mr. Simon to cover his losses—I think that was the next day—he said that that would stop in Mr. McMahon's hands, he would not pay it over—Watters gave me just under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on October 1—he gave me a cheque on Tuesday,</p>

I expected that it would be met—I generally pay in in the afternoon, but if I had chosen to pay it in earlier I should expect it to be met—it would be credited to me by the end of banking hours—cheques have to be cleared every night—the bank would pay a cheque when presented, but they would expect their customer to pay in sufficient money to meet it during the day—according to my notion, if a man gives a crossed cheque that means a day's credit; if he gives me a cheque for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 11 a.m., he has till 4 p.m. to find the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had thought it was just a chance whether he met it or not I would not have taken it, but I thought he would be sure to meet it—I thought he had got the money or could get it—I did not think he personally, but his clients, had got the money to meet it or securities equivalent to it—I did give him credit when I took the cheque—I believed he would be able to meet it, and that if he had not got the money or the securities in his pocket he knew where to get them and was quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>—he came again about 5.30, saw Mr. Seriven and myself, and said that he had seen a Director and the accountant and had not been able to make any arrangement; but they advised him to sell the further security which he had got loans against, so as to recoup himself—he said nothing about what Warden had done with what he had given to him—he said that on the next day or the day after Warden handed back to the River Plate Bank the securities which Watters had handed to him—I asked him when Warden went away—he said that he came to his office about a quarter to 2 o'clock and told him there was some difficulty with the bank; he said that his account was wrong—I don't know what sums he owed, but he said that he was a ruined man and was going away—he said that Warden used to meet the differences by raising loans on securities—I said to Watters in the afternoon or at the meeting in the evening at the Craven Hotel "It seems a large account you have had open with Mr. Warden"—he said" I always considered Mr. Warden to be a man of considerable means."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I was secretary and manager of the London and River Plate Bank for a period of nearly twenty years—about the middle of last year I employed Mr. Watters to obtain a loan for me of about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to pay off a loss I made with him in speculations on the Stock Exchange—in order to do that I obtained from the strong room of the bank securities that had been deposited there—towards the end of December or the beginning of January he spoke to me about his own losses—he told me he had made a large loss of about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by his own speculations, and that his failure must follow unless he was assisted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190111"/>
               <p>—after a good deal of conversation, he finally induced me to cover his own loss as well as my own, to save exposure of himself, by taking further amounts of bonds—he represented to me at the same time that the loans, as far as he was concerned, would only be temporary—that he was on terms for a loan through his brother, a solicitor in Dublin, for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another loan through solicitors in London for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to the brother in Dublin—this is the letter I wrote, after considerable delay—it is dated the 3rd of March, 1883—there was a good deal of delay, and I wrote urging that this 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan should be completed—I found the stock to raise the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a reply to this letter stating that his brother already owed him money, and he had no idea of increasing the debt—both loans fell through and I was saddled with the whole affair—I received accounts up to that time as far as I remember, and I received contract notes during the year 1882, and I was debited with commission in the ordinary way—after that time he told me that he had stopped all commission, only charging what he had to pay himself—I learned from him every fortnight the results of these speculations—I got no written account from that time—before settling day I learned whether more cover was required, and as it was required I provided it from the same source, the bank—sometimes he called at the bank, and I gave him securities in my own room; sometimes I went to his office with them, according to arrangement—it was about four minutes' walk from the bank—about April or May this year I urgently appealed to him to desist, and represented to him then that there was 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the bank stock in his hands—he refused to do so, assuring me of the great credit he was in, and the number of brokers he was able to employ—I made no further appeal, I went as far as I thought I could in doing so, and went no further, and the thing went on—on several occasions he asked me if I could get certain stock—sometimes I did get those that were more favourable than others, if it was possible—part of the stock I took was deposited by customers for safe custody—they were kept sometimes in the interior safe, and sometimes in the strong box—they were done up in parcels, tied with string, and labelled with the customer's name—when I took the securities I took the labels off, sometimes in my own room and sometimes in Watters's office, and preserved them, waiting the return of the stock for its redemption—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains nearly all the names of the customers, with one or two exceptions—the total value is not summed up here, but I identify them all as having been taken by me from the strong room and handed to Watters—the annual audit took place on the first of October—we had previously agreed to arrange for the production of all the stock that was required for that day for the use of the auditors—I saw him on Saturday, 29th September, and he then told me that he had made all his arrangements for Monday—I gave him a list of what would be required to be brought in—he was to obtain the stock as early as possible in the morning, against his cheques—I saw him on the Monday morning about half-past 10, and he then told me that he was sure of all the brokers giving up the stock against cheques, with the exception of one man that he was rather afraid about—during the con<lb/>versation he told me that if any hitch occurred he would give himself up—I left him in Throgmorton Street and went back to the bank, reaching there shortly before 11 o'clock—in the stock in the bank there was 30,000 Egyptian Preference Stock—up to the 1st October I had not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190112"/>
               <p>taken any of that—this list marked G was prepared to lay before the auditors for the purpose of their going through the audit—I myself laid it before them—the 30,000 is ticked by the auditors—that was produced and shown to them—after it was ticked Watters came in in the course of the forenoon, after 12 o'clock—he had brought some lots of stock into the bank—he said he found hesitation on the part of the brokers to give more up—I cannot tell what it was he brought—he brought some small lots, as a rule, not one lot and then another, but part of each—the 30,000 was safe in the bank at that time, and I believe also 10,000 Egyptian Preference Stock in the name of Mr. Ainger—the others he brought in portions from time to time—this is Watters's handwriting—it contains a list of what he did bring in—it is addressed to Mr. Langton, the accountant to the bank (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "2nd October, 1883. The securities I handed to Mr. Warden yesterday, and for which I received no equivalent, were 5,000 Egyptian Preference, 1,000 Domain, 60,000 Suez, 300 Pennsylvanians, 2,400 New South Wales, 2,000 Egyptian Preference, and 9,000 Unified")—at the same time he brought in more than these—that is a portion for which he said he received no equivalent—it is accurate so far as it goes, but it is not complete—he asked me to give him some<lb/>thing that would induce the brokers to give up the other stock, and I gave him a portion of the stock that was counted and passed by the auditors—that was the Egyptian Preference—I believe at that time it was 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, but I was afterwards told I had given him 27,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the audit went on from 12 until after 1 o'clock—at that time they had passed and ticked all that was in my possession to show them—finding that Watters failed to complete the stock necessary, I had no alternative but to leave the bank—I went to his office about half-past 1 o'clock—I told him I was a ruined man—he had a small portion of stock in his hand at the time, and said there was still some that he could not get—I told him it was too late, it was no use attempting further—the conversation only lasted a few seconds—I asked him his intention—his words were "I have no heart to go abroad; I shall give myself up"—he gave me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and I went from his office to Havre—I turned part of the notes into French money at a money-changer's in London a few minutes afterwards, and left for the Continent—I was only a few days in Havre—I was away a week altogether at Paris and Havre—I came back on Saturday, 6th October, and wrote to the bank stating where I was, and that I was ready to give myself up—towards the last few days of September I asked Watters to give me some money of my sister's which I had lost—it was rather more than 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he got the 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his banking account for me, and said that was all he could spare at the time—that was about Friday or Satur<lb/>day, I am not sure which—the money was to be sent in a draft on Scotland, not sent to my sister's, to send on their account—he left me at the door of one of the banks to purchase the draft—this draft (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is Watters's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was a draft slip of the Bank of Scotland dated</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th September,</hi> 1883, <hi rend="italic">requesting a draft for</hi> 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in favour of W.E. and A.J.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No statement whatever of that kind was made by me—I never represented myself to him as acting for any one—I lived at Regent's Park—I had known Watters for about ten years; I cannot say where he was when I first made his acquaintance—I found when I returned from abroad that he was a visitor at the house of my family—I did not know what his employment was at the time—I knew him for seven years at the London and Yorkshire Bank—he has visited me both at my house and at my club—I think I had only one club; I do not remember his being in more than one—there was a South American Club five or seven years ago—I do not remember his being there; he might have been there—I was one of the members—he may have been my guest there, but I do not recollect it—he might meet there gentlemen interested in South American business matters—there were many there who were not—there were some who were connected, and in an important manner, with South American trade—I did belong to the Wanderers' Club; Watters has been there—he might have met gentlemen there friends of my own—I have no recollection of representing them as being largely interested in River Plate affairs; it was quite unnecessary—it is a thing I should never have thought of representing to him, simply as a casual guest at the time—he knew that they were River Plate business men, therefore it was unnecessary for me to tell him so—I had on one occasion what was called a River Plate party—he was present one morning—the party did not go up the river—he had breakfast with me one morning, and left after breakfast—I had a few friends who were largely interested in River Plate affairs, merchants most of them—they very seldom came to my house at all—it was quite an exceptional case—that was the only time that the party met at my house—occasionally I met them at the club and as my friends—we did not go to the Cafe Royal—I never had a supper party there that I remember—there was only one occasion that I remember of a meeting of River Plate gentlemen at my house—I never engaged in any Stock Exchange speculations on their account—I have dealt with other brokers besides Mr. Watters, two or three perhaps—one was a Mr. Miller, of the firm of Miller and Co.—that account was opened for about three years, perhaps longer—I never represented to Messrs. Miller that I was acting on behalf of myself and other persons—I represented that it was my individual speculation—that has always been the understanding—I have told them so—the transactions I have had with any other brokers have been trifling in amount, and there was no necessity for any statement of the kind, and no statement was made—I did not make any pointed statement to Mr. Miller—he never asked me questions, and I never made any statements on the subject—he understood it to be my own business as far as I could judge—I made no statement to Mr. Miller or any one else to the effect that I was acting for friends as well as myself, or that I was acting for myself alone—I made no statement at all—the question never came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190114"/>
               <p>up—no one asked me the question—I have not read the Stock Exchange rules as regards clerks speculating, I have heard of them—no suggestion was made to me when I began to speculate through Messrs. Miller that it was a violation of the Stock Exchange rules, that I recollect—it never occurred to my mind that it was—I paid Messrs. Miller a good many cheques from time to time—they originated the speculations themselves—in many cases they frequently opened stock in my name, and I knew nothing of it till I saw the contract on my desk—I have never thrown up one of their contracts, but I have often lost money by them—I have frequently disapproved of it—I never repudiated it; I did not like to take such a decided step—Mr. Miller was a friend of mine, and had been for several years—I have deposited securities to a small amount with him—on one occasion I took the loan of a bond from one of the customers, the bank replacing it afterwards—I took it from the bank, and deposited it with Messrs. Miller—I do not recollect that I deposited any other securities with them—I did not require to do so—I had in that year, 1880, money of my own—there were several cheques paid to Messrs. Miller which came from Watters—I do not remember a cheque of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have a bank book, but those cheques did not pass through my pass-book—they were simply taken from Watters's office to Mr. Miller's office—I think I have taken cheques from Watters to Mr. Miller's on six or eight different occasions, payments that Watters was perfectly aware I had to make to Mr. Miller—the total amount of those would be about 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think that was part of a cheque which Watters said he gave to me—I believe one newspaper said from 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another news<lb/>paper said 67,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Watters did not give me 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cheques—he gave me cheques which I passed to Messrs. Miller to the extent of about 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me cheques which I passed through another broker for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to Mr. Cray—I think it was only 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as far as I recollect—I cannot remember the same thing happening with another broker—I have seldom given Watters any cheques—I have given him cheques—it is impossible to say how many—Watters gave me 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques, because I represented to him that I owed the money—he gave me a few cheques on other occasions, about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think altogether I identify as given to me for my own use—part of that was really money earned before the business commenced on joint account—the business suc<lb/>ceeded to a certain extent, and it was earned by success in those specula<lb/>tions previous to the operations for mutual account—up to the time of the operations for mutual account the speculation resulted in a profit, which was paid by Watters's cheques—that was in the early part of the transaction, somewhere about 1881—as far as I recollect the mutual account began when the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan was made—that was in December, 1882, or January this year—it was previous to that letter; that letter was written afterwards as a reminder, to hasten the production of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not hear mentioned the name of a gentleman in London, from whom he expected to get 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he told me the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was forth<lb/>coming from his brother—there was another loan of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he told me he was arranging from a firm of solicitors here—I did not hear the name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The only money that I can trace as coming from his hands was his 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me cheques to the extent of 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—part of what he gave me was earned by success in speculation, on the previous operations—that was part of that 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to me by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190115"/>
               <p>him to pay off debts that he knew were owing to other brokers—part of the stock kept open with these brokers was to get information and to check his own information—he was perfectly aware that the stock was open—he knew that I had these speculations with other brokers, and wanted to keep my speculations going in order that he might get information—the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was besides the 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., over and above that—I think only part of that was earned in speculations; he really never gave me any money at all, he simply gave me what he could spare out of his own banking account—his bank account was furnished from loans on stock—he never gave me any money that was not found for him first—I stole it from the bank first, and he gave me back part of what I had given to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. None of the money which I received from him came with any account of what I had done, except as I said before at the very earlier part of the transactions in the early part of 1881 and 1882, when I did receive accounts—he rendered me accounts during 1881 and 1882—I don't say that all I did with Miller was for the purpose of checking his information, but part of it was—the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to begin with was sent to pay a debt to Miller and Co. about six months before this mutual opera<lb/>tion took place—my account with Miller had been opened for a consider<lb/>able time before that—latterly the object of that account was to check his information of stock, and especially in Brighton stock—I fre<lb/>quently got information from Miller which Watters as a large operator could not get—I am certain that Miller and Co. frequently told me things that they never told to him—that was in some respects the object of my keeping open the accounts with Miller, that I should have information with regard to particular stock—I have given that information to Watters on several occasions to use in his operations—that was not altogether the object of it; it was one of the objects—I know Mr. Parish; he is a gentleman in a very important position in Buenos Ayres matters; he is a great friend of mine—I am not aware that Mr. Watters has met me with him—I don't think Mr. Parish has been with, me to my club; I don't think Watters has been invited there to meet him—Mr. Parish has called at the club; he is not a frequenter of the club—I have mentioned Mr. Parish to Mr. Watters several times—he has heard his name mentioned at my sister's house, but that was not with reference to business matters that I am aware of—during the years 1881 and 1882 contract notes were supplied to me by Mr. Watters; they do not exist now—all papers that I had in connection with this affair I destroyed before I left London—on the morning that I left I destroyed the little that was left; I have not kept anything of consequence; very few papers were left that day, only a few memoranda of stock that I had in his hands; they were in my own writing—they were a list of securities which I had taken from the bank and handed to him—it was my habit to keep a list of the securities, and it was from them that I was able to prepare the list of the securities which were wanted on the Monday—I didn't go over the state of my account with him every fortnight; unfor<lb/>tunately I had no account with him; there was no stated period for doing it—I used to see him very frequently—that process was not done so often as once a fortnight—I occasionally took him a corrected list from time to time and agreed it with him—he sometimes passed me a memorandum stating that he would require a certain amount of stock that settling day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190116"/>
               <p>—that did not show what the state of the account would be; he simply mentioned the amount of money he had to cover—I am sorry to say that I became aware that the account was going rapidly to the worst—in the commencement of this year he supplied me with a small green book, which he kept up for about ten days—I tore out the few pages which were used when I left London, and I gave the book to my solicitor—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was only kept up for about ten days—there is nothing in it now—I destroyed the contents when I did the other papers—I did not at my first examination declare that no such book had ever been supplied to me—I believe I first mentioned it on my first examination after it had been found at the bank; no, it was not found there, it was found there on my application—I was told that Watters's solicitor had written to my solicitor to ask for the production of the books—I believe that was after the first hearing at Guildhall—I at once sent to the bank to look for it, and it was found—I knew that I had destroyed everything that was written in it or I should not have left it—I first began to take securities from the bank about the month of June—I think it was 1882, in connection with this affair—I have already said that I took the loan of a bond once before that—I think that was in 1880, but I am not very sure, or 1881—from 1880 to 1882 I don't think I required anything that I am aware of—I had a key of the strong box; I could not with that key alone open the box—one of the directors had a key—the outer door of the strong room had two keys, one in the possession of the accountant and one in my own, and the strong box had two keys, which the director and myself had—it would not require the concurrence of the three to get to the strong box—the outer door of the strong room opened by my own key and the accountant's—when he was not there I gene<lb/>rally used my own and his—it was necessary at one time to have a double custody for the door of the strong room, but it became unnecessary because the safe was inside—the securities were kept in the strong room simply, and then the concurrence of the two keys were required, but of late, for additional safety, they had been put in the strong box, and therefore the same protection with regard to the strong room was not necessary—I could lend the accountant my key and he could lend me his—he took it when he required it to go down for his cash in the morning—he didn't ask me for it; he took it; the key was in the drawer in one of the safes in my room, an open drawer—he always took it; I made no objection; it was the custom, and I sometimes took his key in the same way, and he made no objection—he generally kept his key hanging up in his desk—he could go and take mine, and I could take his—the directors must have been aware of that fact, because they saw me open the strong room in their presence nearly every day—the directors would see me with the two keys—after the introduction of the strong box the securities were always put in the strong box or in the safe; there was also a safe inside—to get at either of these it required the concurrence of two people, myself and the director on duty—when securities were brought into the bank it was the duty of the security clerk to enter them—if a customer wanted a loan it was generally authorised in consultation with the bank committee—when it was authorised I should have to give instructions that the money should be paid, and then, the securities being deposited, they would be handed over to the security clerk for him to enter, tie them up, and mark them with the customer's name—his duty then was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190117"/>
               <p>to hand them over to myself, and the director and I should place them in the strong box or the safe, as the case might be—that would be done by the two of us together—we should then both lock the strong box or safe—when securities were wanted to be taken out, I and the director went down, opened the strong box or safe, and took them out, we should both take notice what securities were there, and they would be handed back to the customer who called for them—the security clerk would make a note of the fact of their return before they were returned—that was the regular practice of the bank—the directors took it in turns to be on duty a fortnight each—he would be in attendance at 11 o'clock in the morning until the business he had to conduct was over—that would be an hour or half an hour—he would put his key in his pocket and take it away with him—at the end of the fortnight he would hand his key across the board table to the director whose duty it was to take it the next fortnight. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you manage to steal these securities? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already described the method at Guildhall; I can only repeat it here. On some occasions securities were left out for the detachment of the coupon by one director, and they were not returned; they would go to Watters—it would depend on the bundle of coupons how long it would take to detach them; it might take the best part of an afternoon—if they were bonds belonging to a customer they would be given to the security clerk to detach the coupons; if they were coupons upon which money had been lent, the borrower of the money would send one oft his clerks to cut off the coupons—the directors would take out the securities, but not see as to their return; in many instances he would go off duty next day—before the 1st October I became convinced that the amount of my liabilities was far larger than I should be able to meet—that was my feeling, and had been so for a long time—from time to time I told Mr. Watters that I believed that the speculations, quite apart from other questions, would turn out disastrous—I gave him my opinion on several occasions that he was playing a hopeless game altogether—he used sanguine expressions of belief in my success—if I had been absolutely convinced beyond all possiblity of hope I should not have remained in London to go through the audit—I must have had some lingering opinion that there must be a way out, or I should not have remained under any circumstances—I did not tell him that I could not meet these liabilities, and that I must try and save something out of the wreck for my sisters—I said that before attempting the audit I would like to make the money secure—I have no recollection of giving him the name of Hamilton—I think I could swear that I did not—I might have done anything at the moment, but I do not remember now—the 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent to the person indicated in Scotland—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given me on the 1st October about half-past 1 o'clock in the day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not interfere with the details of the 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in any way—I did not get the cheque-cashed, or get the bank-notes changed at the bank—Watters gave me the draft—I did not go into the bank with it—it was the same name by which I sent the draft to Scotland on the Saturday—there was nobody in the bank conversant with this theft that I was committing.</p>

               <p>they required, but which I found he had never done—I wrote a letter to a relation of mine in Scotland on the 1st October, at midnight, and I mentioned Mr. Watters as one of the persons who would be useful in helping my sisters—I am not sure which letter it was in, but it was in one of those letters which I mentioned, the one of the 1st October or another of the 5th October—I told this relation of mine that Mr. Watters had informed me that he was going to give himself up on that occasion, but I did not mention him as one of the persons who would help to take care of my sisters—I appended his name to a will which I see in that gentleman's hands, but not with reference to taking care of my sisters—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the memorandum—I wrote it for the guidance of my family about two months before I left—the last paragraph is headed "Assistance"—among the names there I have put Watters's name, not for advice, but for assistance, for money which he owed them, having broken up their home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the transfer and securities clerk of the River Plate Bank—I have been so 17 or 18 years—I was under Mr. Warden—I kept the securities book—it was my duty to enter in that book the particulars of the securities deposited for safe custody by customers, and also the securities upon which advances had been made—on 30th August I find an entry of the deposit of 30,000 Egyptian Preference, to cover an advance of 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made that entry in due course, and it was initialled by one of the directors, Mr. Zimmerman—in due course they would be deposited in the strong room, and that was all I had to do with them—I knew that the audit had been appointed for Monday, 1st October, and in due course I made out this list (<hi rend="italic">G</hi>) of the securities that had to be produced to the auditors—that was in the ordinary course—the audit took place that day—the last time I saw Mr. Warden at the bank was at about 20 minutes to 2 o'clock—after that Monday I saw Mr. Langton go through that list to see what securities remained in the bank, and of the 30,000 Egyptian Preference Stock only 3,000 remained—the next nine items in this list were found to be all there—the securities of Lawrence, Sons, and Gordon against a loan of 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Ainger, 10,000 Preference, 8,000 were left, and of the 5,000 State Domain none were left; of the 1,700 Pennsylvanian shares 960 were left, and of the Argentine Hard Dollar Bonds, 50,000, 2,500 were left—this list of 15th is Mr. Langton's writing—I have checked it—it contains a list of the securities which were abstracted—it gives the name upon whose account they were deposited, the nominal value, the description of the security, the price on 2nd October, and then the value worked out—that was a list of the securities that were safe in the bank—there are two mistakes; one is Weldon of Manchester, 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the total is 68,282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the customer's securities, and 48,128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the securities against which advances had been made, making a total of 116, 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took no part in</p>

               <p>the audit on that occasion—this list produced is a correct list of the details of the securities—I asked Mr. Warden if I could render any assistance at the audit, and he said no, he could do it himself—I knew on Monday that he had absented himself—on the following day I was present when his private safe in his room was opened and his drawers were opened—the key of the safe had been left—the drawers were locked—in my presence the bolts of the lock were cut, the drawers opened, and in a drawer I found the 15 labels produced—they are in his writing, most of them—it was the practice to put the customer's name upon them—a string or tape was tied round them, and then they were deposited in the strong room—these labels refer to the 15 lots of stock, the list of which has been produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the accountant to the London and River Plate Bank—I know Mr. Watters merely by sight—I have seen him at the bank perhaps a year and a half ago—I was not acquainted with his place of business in Draper's Gardens at the time—I have known it since, and have been there—on 1st October I saw him at the bank at a few minutes to 11 o'clock, and again in the afternoon, about 2.30—he requested to see me—he said "I am afraid it's all up with Warden"—I said "I do not understand what you mean"—he said "He came to my office about half an hour ago, and said, 'I am a ruined man, for God's sake do what you can for my poor sisters'"—I expressed great astonish<lb/>ment at this, and understood him to explain that Warden had formed one of a syndicate for speculating on the Stock Exchange—he then went on to say that he was placed in an exceedingly awkward position; that he had borrowed securities on account of Mr. Warden, against which he had given his cheque for 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so, and as the securities were not returned to him he could not meet his cheque; this would cause him to fail, he would not meet his engagements, and he wanted to know if the bank would assist him with means to pay the cheque—I of course could not enter into that, but Mr. Zimmerman, one of the directors, being in the adjoining room, I requested him to see him, which he did—I then left the room, and was not present at the interview—the next day, the 2nd October, I found a letter addressed to me at the bank from the prisoner—he called before 10 o'clock, or about 10 o'clock—I understood him to say that he had arranged his affairs the previous day, and then some suggestion was made to the following effect: that he knew where the securities to a large extent, 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were placed as a cover for loans, and that if those securities could be taken up they would realise a margin—I said I could not enter into any discussion upon that point; he must see the chairman of the bank if he had anything to say—the chairman was not there then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said at one of the interviews that he understood that Mr. Warden was a very influential person, possessed of means—I do not remember his saying that he always understood Mr. Warden was acting for other persons—he said he was one of a syndicate—he referred to that again—I did not say that I thought this was what it would come to; that I was afraid he was plunging—I said I had been a little uneasy about Warden—I never used the word "plunging" that I remember, or that I knew he was dealing with other brokers—I had been a little uneasy as to his connections and associates, but nothing to the extent that I supposed he would abstract anything belonging to the bank—I had no evidence to believe he was speculating—about a couple of years</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190120"/>
               <p>ago I thought perhaps he might be doing a little, just a small thing perhaps with other brokers—I say I was a little uneasy as to the class of his associates—I did not say I thought he was plunging, but that I fancied he would pull through—nothing of the kind—I do not exactly remember what I said—I think it was that I was afraid, or something to that effect—I do not know that I said anything with regard to specula<lb/>tions—Mr. Zimmerman was in the adjoining room at the time when I saw Mr. Watters on the 2nd.</p>

McMicking and Miller and Co.—I suppose there would be some allegation in the actions that Watters took the securi<lb/>ties with a knowledge of the theft—I have not seen it; it is in the hands of our solicitors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 8, Old Jewry, and am solicitor to the London and River Plate Bank, Limited—on 2nd October I obtained a warrant against Mr. Warden—in consequence of a communication from the directors I called at the office of the prisoner that afternoon—I gave him my name, and told him that I was solicitor for the bank; that I had obtained a warant for the arrest of Warden, and I stated that I understood he had been to the bank, and that he had securities in his possession to the value of upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had been placed with him by Warden—he said that was so, and that he had obtained loans upon those securities, leaving a margin, and I understood him that the margin would be about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that would be 10 per cent—I told him that the securities were all stolen from the bank by Warden, and therefore they belonged to the bank, and from that time he must not interfere or deal with the securities, as any margin was the property of the bank—he said he had given certain securi<lb/>ties to Warden on 1st October, for which he had given his cheques to the amount of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had not been paid, and that he must protect himself—he also said that he was a ruined man, as he could not meet those cheques—I told him that in my opinion he would be guilty of a criminal act, he would be an accessory after the fact if he dealt with those securities, knowing then that they were stolen—he said he was of a different opinion—I then advised him to consult a solicitor—he said that he had given the securities to Warden, as there was to be an exchange of securities, a common thing on the Stock Exchange—I asked him how he came to give so large an amount of securities without having anything in return—he said he did it because it was a common thing on the Stock Exchange—I asked him if he took any acknowledgment or receipt from Warden for the securities he gave up—he said it was not usual to take receipts—I think he said he would go and consult his friends—I saw him a short time afterwards—he then referred to Mr. Gregson as his solicitor—I said I wished to find out whether Warden had taken the securities away with him, and I asked him for the numbers of them—he had four or five telephones in his room, and he spoke to somebody through a telephone, and he said he would get me the numbers later on—I asked him for the particulars of the securities, and he then wrote the particulars in pencil on this piece of paper and handed it to me, "5</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think that the allegations in the action are that on 4th October, at the time Watters, Miller and Co., and Symons and Co. took the assignment of the securities they knew they had been stolen—it is alleged that at the time they took the securities they took them with notice that they had been stolen—after the date I have mentioned I had communicated with Watters's solicitor from time to time—I had several interviews with Mr. Gregson—every information I required was not given me—I asked for a good deal of information about the dealings, and about the numbers and particulars of the bonds, and I did not get it; I have never got it—I asked for the numbers of the securities which had come back to Warden on 1st October; that was not given me—I asked Watters some questions that he refused to answer—I asked him some questions about his transactions and he said "You had better see my solicitor"—I began questioning him about what his dealings were with Warden; that was on the first interview—he did not then mention the name of his solicitor; he had not chosen his solicitor; he mentioned one or two names which I forget, but he had not determined what solicitor he should employ; I advised him to consult a solicitor when I spoke about the criminality of his acts.</p>

Miller, and Messrs. Symons, stockbrokers—the total assets are about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have looked through most of the books; there is no book called a securities book; there is no book containing the particulars of the securities which he received—there are contract books for the broker to make out contracts for stock bought and sold, with counterfoils—there are entries of accounts with Messrs. McMicking, Symons, Miller, and Allen, purchases and sales—I find counterfoils of contracts relating to dealings with Warden; the last one in the bought contract book is dated 14th June last, and the last sold 24th May last—in the ledger I find an account called "George Warden's account"—I find there a loan of 4,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. placed to his credit on 28th June, 1882—the account begins in May, 1881, and goes down to October, 1883—I have made this abstract of the account, it is correct—there is also an account headed "General account"—this is a correct abstract of that account—it begins July, 1882, and ends October 12,1883, the total amount of purchases is 4,742, 709<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the profit is 21, 527<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., losses 129, 492<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a balance of 107,965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loss—these are taken out fortnight by fortnight—on 14th December there is a balance of 6, 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loss on the general account—there is also an account in the ledger with Mr. A. Merriman, according to which it shows a profit of 9, 518<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on 31st May, 1883—I find a profit balance carried into the general account on May 9 of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th May—on 31st May the 9, 518<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is transferred to the general account—from February 12,1883, to 6th September 800,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appears as the dealings on Merriman's account—I also find an account in the ledger of a Mr. H. Sachs; he was Mr. Watters's clerk—I find in his account a profit balance of 1, 513<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in July, and that is brought into the general account—Sachs's account of dealings from February 12 to July 7 is nearly 700,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also find an account in the ledger under the initials "J.D.W.," Watters's initials, and a profit balance of 1, 322<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is also brought into the general account on 31st May—there are two or three other small matters, the profit of which is brought into the general account, with the names of Cook, Woods, Hutton, and Strange—there are no accounts of loans from brokers—I find generally that a commission of 1-16th paid to brokers on the Stock Exchange is charged against the</p>

I always looked upon Mr. Warden as a man of unimpeachable integrity, and he informed me emphatically over and over again that he was the centre of River Plate circles, that he was acknowledged so, and that he had a large and influential connection. He asked me to open separate accounts for his own speculations and those of his friends. I supplied him at the close of the day with memoranda of those transactions, and with full accounts at the close of each settling day. I gave him cheques from time to time on account of surplusage of sales, and loans of stock to the extent of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 29th September and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a Prisoner</hi>). I am at present in the House of Detention awaiting sentence in respect of certain offences to which I pleaded guilty at the Sessions before last—up to 30th November last year I was a cashier in the Army and Navy Stores in Victoria Street—I left on 29th or 30th—my present age is either 21 or 22, I don't exactly know—I entered the service of the Stores on 24th June, 1878—at that time my salary was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, in 1880 it was increased to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in November, 1882, it was 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with a possibility of earning 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day extra if my accounts were correct—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance in 1879—he was at that time a bicycle manufacturer at Kennington Cross—I cecame acquainted with him through having a bicycle repaired, and in May, 1880, I purchased a bicycle of him for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and in the next season, 1881, I bought another for 16 or 17 guineas—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts, I paid by instalments—he asked me at first in 1880 where I worked, and I told him at the Army and Navy Stores, Victoria Street, as cashier, and that my wages were 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I became very intimately acquainted with him then, and used to go out riding on bicycles with him, and go to his house to tea on Sundays and spend my evenings with him, and we rode on bicycles on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, and if we went out from Saturday afternoon to Sunday we spent 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about May, 1881, we were out riding and went to the White Horse, where we drank, and he said "You seem to have plenty of money, how do you manage it; do you <hi rend="italic">fuddle</hi> your books?"—I said that Winter, a foreman in the Stores, had shown me a plan so that I could make plenty of money—he had not been at Strange's then, but he came afterwards—Strange said "If you want any money taken care of at any time I will take care of it for you"—about the beginning of the bicycle season of 1881 he asked me again how I managed at the Stores—I told him all I had to do was to make it right with the cheque clerk, leave the bill out of the book, and divide the money—the cheque clerk always did go; I could not do it without him, our books would not agree—Strange asked me if I had been banking money, and I said "Yes"—we went about in 1882 spending money in the same manner, and Windus who pleaded guilty in September, frequently went with us—on a Saturday afternoon in August Windus and I were going for a ride to Weybridge—we stopped at Strange's on the way, and Windus asked Strange if he would mind some money for him, as he had only a small pocket on his bicycle—it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and when he handed it to him he said "I made this yesterday, but I kept it in my desk in case anything should turn up"—in August, 1882, I went to live at Mrs. Ketteringham's, 2A, Charlwood Place, Pimlico, with a young man named Rhodes, also in the Stores—on, I think, November 28th, 1882, a young man named Charles Windus was taken on a charge of stealing money from the Stores, and on November 30th Rhodes was taken—when Windus was taken I went home and took some money out of my box—I had about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there which I had robbed</p>

               <p>the Stores of from time to time and brought home in my pocket—I took 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out and Rhodes went with me—we took a cab and went to the Penny Bank, Victoria Street—I deposited 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there in my own name—we then went to Strange's in Kennington, and I said to him "Charley Windus was arrested to-day, I am afraid they will search my box, I want you to mind some money for me"—he said "Well, I will take care of it; if anything is found out don't say I have got it"—I said "Here is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and gave it to him in a leather purse—I asked him if he would give me a receipt; he said "Yes, but you had better ante-date it in case anything is found out"—I than wrote out the body of this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he signed it—it is dated November 20th, 1882, but the transaction took place on the 28th—the date is Strange's writing—I went to him again the next evening, and he said "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> your money was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wrong"—I could not dispute it then, and I said "Put it down 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the 30th I sent Strange a telegram, and he came to Mrs. Ketteringham's with a friend, about 8.30 p.m.—I had been very queer all day; I said "Rhodes was arrested to-day; I am ill, and I am afraid they are going to arrest me; what had I better do?"—he said "You come over to my place"—we took a cab and went there, leaving a note for my landlady—when we got to Strange's I saw a medical man—I think his name was Allen—I remained there some weeks, but I was there a fortnight before I went to Mrs. Ketteringham's—Strange said when I was at his house that he would go to the Stores to see if anything was found out about me—the doctor had recommended me rest, and given me a certificate—on December 1 Strange went out, and when he returned he told me had been to the Stores, and had seen Mr. Yeldham, who was very cross, but he did not think anything was found out about me, and he had seen Winter there, who said he thought it was all right, but he would come over and see me himself in the evening—I think I had only then seen Winter over at Strange's, but from that time he came regularly and saw me there—I had then 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the Post-office Bank, Westminster—I drew it out in December, and paid 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think to Strange—Strange told me to draw it out in case anything was found out—he said "I will take care of it with the other"—I opened a new account with it the next day in the name of Taylor at the Elephant and Castle Branch, Walworth Road—Strange told me to use another name—he did not say what name, but he knew what name I banked in afterwards—on February 1, 1883, I closed that account by drawing out 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid to Strange—I believe it was in gold—before I left the Stores Strange asked me several times to go into his bicycle business, but I did not care about it—when I was staying in his house in December he asked me if I should like to go into a laundry business, as I should not be able to go back to the Stores, and early in January there was an advertisement by Mr. Brasier to dispose of a laundry at Acton—Strange went to see it two or three times, and we concluded to purchase it for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went with Strange in December, 1882, to open his account at the Penny Bank—he told me he was going to pay money in there, but he did not say for what purpose—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the agreement between us made out afterwards (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement dated</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th January,</hi> 1883, <hi rend="italic">between George Brasier on the one party and John Strange and J.W.

               <p>was in the House of Detention—I was taken in May, and have been in custody ever since—on 30th January Strange drew a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Brasier—I took it to the bank and cashed it—the clerk told me to write "Brasier" on it, and I got ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for it—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the earnest money paid to Brasier on the 26th as well as the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in December, when I was staying at Strange's, William Windus was there, and Strange's sister came in and said "There is a man walking up and down outside who I know is a detective"—Windus and I were expecting to be arrested every day, and Strange said "Come on you two, you had better hide"—he took Windus somewhere upstairs, and came down and put me in a cupboard, and covered me up with some dresses and shut the door—I remained there 10 minutes, and then he came and said "I think it is all right now," and I came out, and he fetched Windus down—a few days after we were in the house, and a ring at the bell came, and his sister or housekeeper, they were both there, said "There is a policeman at the door, Jim"—Strange said "Come on you two, you had better hide," and he took us upstairs through a bedroom into another bedroom, and we both tried to get under a bath, but it was not big enough; only one of us could get under—I stopped about 10 minutes, and Strange came up and said "It is all right; he has gone away now"—I pleaded guilty at the September Session to stealing a considerable amount of property at Twickenham and at East Grinstead—a person was sent to Twickenham in consequence of a forged order from Mr. Hume, one of the depositors at the Stores—William Windus took apartments there in Novem<lb/>ber, 1882, in the name of Hume, and then wrote up as if one of the customers had given a real order and got goods sent down—before that was carried out Windus said to Strange "Can you tell me where would be a good place to have some things sent through the Stores, as we intend having some sent?"—Strange said "Twickenham or thereabouts, that is a nice quiet place"—I said it would do very well, and the same thing was attempted to be done at East Grinstead—Windus remained at Twickenham in the name of Hume three weeks or a month, but he frequently came up to Strange's, and saw me there—we had a conversation, and showed Strange how we were going to get the goods—we got about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods by that plan at Twickenham, and most of them were pawned in London—Windus brought them up—Windus, and I, and Strange, and Cornell were present when they were pawned—the tickets were burnt—I saw some of the things—there was a great deal of jewellery—we endeavoured, but we did not actually get goods at East Grinstead—Windus had asked Strange where would be a nice quiet hotel to go to and have goods sent, and he said "Payne's Hotel, East Grin<lb/>stead"—that was the hotel we went to on bicycles—Strange had goods altogether amounting to 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the morning we bought the business—the whole of that money was the proceeds of frauds of various kinds on the Stores—that is the medical man who attended me at Strange's house (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Allen</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know what my sentence is to be—Cornell had charge of the deposit ledger—he passed Windus's letters in the name of Hume as if they came from a real depositor and got the goods out—I pleaded guilty to the forgery—Cornell has been sentenced to twelve months; Windus has not been sentenced yet—nine of us were in the dock on September 18th—they were all sentenced to from three months to twelve, except Windus and I—Mr. Poland asked that our sentences</p>

               <p>should be postponed—I have been in custody since May—no one brought Mr. Dutton into communication with me; I wrote to him on 18th August from the House of Detention—I never saw Chamberlain there—no friend of mine said that if I volunteered information it would be better for me; I don't think my brother or anybody had communicated with Mr. Dutton up to that time—Cornell had told me that if he was me he should make a statement; Windus did not also tell me so; I had not spoken to him at that time; I was in the same cell with him at the police-court, but there was always an officer outside the cell—that happened once a week—my parents told me to plead guilty; I have only seen them once, but they may have sent my sister to me—Mr. Dutton took my statement a day or two after 18th August; he was with me three or four hours; my statement was read over to me and I signed it—I had not pleaded guilty then—I have made two or three statements; it is less than six; they have all been taken down—he may have come one day and afterwards continued the same story—I don't think I saw Mr. Dutton more than four times, and I may have seen his clerk four times—I have seen Mr. Chamberlain many times; I did not make a statement to him—whenever I saw Mr. Dutton or his clerk I made a statement—I think I have only implicated two persons from first to last, Winter and Strange; I told nothing about Mears—I was in the grocery department; there are over twenty assistants there and three or four shopwalkers, besides higher officials who walk about the place—I have two check clerks, one on each side of me; each has a stamp to stamp the bills, and I stamp them as cashier—men are appointed to write the orders, and in a very few cases they write them threefold with carbonised paper, but a great many customers write their own orders, and then there is only one—I am the man who pocketed a half-sovereign which a customer left on my desk—I knew I was stealing it but at the Stores we often lost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, so we kept customers' change to recoup ourselves—my books will prove how much I was short—the first week I was there I lost 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by giving customers too much change or taking too little, and I more than recouped myself by taking more than I lost—I never kept any 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I don't remember representing to any one that I was getting 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week at the Stores; I might say so to hide anything if I had been out with anybody spending a lot of money—I was in a bicycle club with Strange a long time ago; it was only In existence a month or two—I only remember about a dozen members—we had no regular uniform, only a dark blue suit—I also belonged to the Silver Cup Club—Windus was in that—there was a regular uniform—when you produce the badge of a bicycle club at touring public-houses they take so much off what you have—any member can belong to the Silver Cross Club by paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a year—there are a number of touring houses—when I rode out on a Saturday afternoon I used to start at 2 o'clock—I thought it a very expensive amusement—sometimes we each paid and sometimes one paid and divided it between us—I paid Strange by instalments for my first bicycle—I after<lb/>wards sold it at a loss, and bought a better one next year—I sold it through Strange—he sold it for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and allowed me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had paid 18 guineas for it—I sold them all for less than they cost me—I put 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the laundry business—Strange lent me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him an I O U for it, that was my share of the capital—I afterwards sold the business and received back 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my share, I was in custody at that time—I</p>

I may have said it to more than one—Postlethwaite drove me to racecourses in a Hansom cab—I did not tell Postlethwaite I had won a lot of money by betting—it was on bank holidays that we drove to races, four times, I think, I went; he is a young man who drives a Hansom cab, not for his father—I used to take Postlethwaite for a whole day in the Hansom cab—I always had one of my companions with me—Rhodes went—I could give you the names of the other people who went with me the other times, they are not concerned in this case—I do not suggest that Strange went.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cantle came to my surgery when he had the venereal disease on one occasion only—on 1st December it was not an actual rupture; it would have, been if he had gone about—it was not arising from the other complaint—he was suffering from the previous complaint—he did not want nursing for that—he wanted rest after this one, and not to move about—I know Dr. Leftwich by name—I do not know whether Cantle had seen him the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner awaiting sentence for an offence to which I pleaded guilty last September—I entered the Stores in May, 1879—I was cheque clerk and also cashier—I made Strange's acquaintance in March, 1881—he was keeping a bicycle shop at 18, Kenningten Cross—I went there and gave him an order for a 14-guinea bicycle to be made—I was receiving about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week wages—I told him who I was, and I was introduced by Harry Fraser, a cashier at the Stores—I saw him again in a month—I went to pay him so much off the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe the receipt has been destroyed—I have told my people to search for it and it cannot be found—two or three months after that I went out riding with the prisoner and Cantle on Saturdays and Sundays in June—we stayed out two days, it used to cost us about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the two days—in settling my bill in October I paid off the remaining amount, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner asked me how I got it, and I told him I had been working it with one of my checkers, by fraud—I said that the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made in that way—only he and I were present—he asked me how I did it—I said "I leave out the bill and get my check clerk to do the same, and keep the money, so that there is no record of the trans<lb/>action"—he said "Are not you afraid of being found out?"—I said "No, as a foreman named Winter gets the bills for me, and I destroy them"—Winter has been committed for trial here on another charge—I continued to go out riding with him, and we became more intimate—I was concerned with Cantle and Cornell in a fraud at Twickenham—I represented myself as a customer having a deposit account—that is one of the charges I have pleaded guilty to—at the end of October, 1882, I called there with Cantle and said "Can you tell me a nice quiet place where we can have goods sent, where Carter Paterson's deliver?"—after thinking a little while he said "Twickenham, I should think, would suit you; it is a nice quiet, select place"—about a week after that Cantle said "We have decided to go to Twickenham, Jim Windus is to go down there and send orders to the Stores, which will be passed by a man named Cornell in the deposit office"—I went down there and brought some goods to London, two of the charms—I saw him there, showed him one of the charms, and said "We have received these a few days ago"—he took it up and said that it was a pretty ornament—I also brought up the pencil-cases, but I don't think I showed them to the prisoner—Cantle left first and I went with the prisoner to a public-house to have a drink, and</p>

               <p>he asked me under what name I was staying and where—I said "Under the name of 'Hume, Bangor House, Arragon Road, Twickenham'"—after the Twickenham business there was another matter of the same nature at East Grinstead, but that was abandoned—in December, 1882, I asked the prisoner whether he could tell me of a nice quiet public-house or hotel in the country—he turned to Cantle, who was with me, and said "Will Payne's, I should say; Payne's Hotel, Grinstead, you know, Jack, where we used to put up"—I had been there with the prisoner on bicycles—I said that we wanted to have goods sent there, as in the other case, but nothing was sent—I was down at Twickenham when Rhodes was taken—my brother Charles was taken a day or two before, and I was at Twickenham then—on the Friday before the Saturday when I left Twickenham at the end of November we were speaking of my brother's arrest, and whether we thought they would be after Cantle or not, and Cornell said "I don't think so, because you have destroyed all the bills, and there is no evidence against you"—at the end of 1882 Cantle and I were talking to the prisoner, and his sister Lucy, who was standing at the door, came in and said "There is a strange man outside evidently on the watch, who I know to be a detective"—the prisoner said "You come with me, Windus," and he took me upstairs through a back bedroom into another room—I stopped there 10 minutes, and he came and let me out; and about a week afterwards, when there were said to be persons after me, I was hid under a bath—in August, 1882, I called at prisoner's shop with Cantle and asked him to take care of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I said that I made it yesterday in the drapery department, and asked him to take care of it, as I had only a small pocket in my knickerbockers—he said "You had better let me keep it for the silver-plated bicycle you promised to give me an order for"—I had promised him an order for one, but had not given it to him—I was taken in custody on 6th June this year.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, 28th July last, I sailed in the Melrose from Cape Town to Natal. I was employed as servant to three of the officers—on Sunday, the day after we sailed, I was in the second-class saloon, where my cabin is, at the bottom of the stairs in the fore part of the vessel (<hi rend="italic">plan produced</hi>)—I was in the "peak," to the right of the cabin stairs, where the officers' servants and the steward slept, about 3.30 in the afternoon—I was in my own cabin and came out into the second-class saloon, on both sides of which there are berths with tables in the centre and settees—I saw the prisoner, his wife, and another passenger called James Power—the prisoner and his wife were sitting on the settee with their backs to the table and near the prisoner's berth on the left side of the saloon going aft—James Power (Carey) was standing at the corner of the prisoner's berth, and was about a yard from O'Donnell with his face towards him—the woman had her arm round the prisoner's neck and resting on his shoulder—I noticed O'Donnell pulling his arm round from his pocket and holding it towards the deceased—he fired at the deceased and hit him in the neck—Power turned round and called out "Oh! Maggie, I'm shot," and as he was staggering towards the bottom of the saloon, having got about two yards from him, the prisoner fired two more shots at him, hitting him in the back—the prisoner was only two yards from the deceased and remained in the same sitting position—I was standing about five yards from the prisoner—Mrs. Carey came out of her cabin and caught the deceased as he was falling—they both fell together—I rushed past the prisoner to the deceased, and put my finger in the wound of the neck to stop the bleeding, and remained there until the doctor came—as I passed the prisoner I saw him putting the pistol into his left side coat-pocket—Dr. Everett attended Carey, who died a quarter of an hour afterwards—about a quarter of an hour pre<lb/>viously I saw them drinking together; that was about 3.30—after the shots were fired I picked up a bullet under the table in the saloon where the deceased died—it was about two yards from the spot where the shots were fired (<hi rend="italic">The bullet was here produced</hi>)—that is the bullet—I noticed other persons in the saloon at the time, Carey's son, the boat<lb/>swain Jones, and the little girl Carey—Jones was playing with the little girl at the bottom of the stairs—young Carey was also at the bottom of the stairs, but I did not notice him go anywhere.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated that he was about a pace from his cabin door when the shot was fired.</hi>) I cannot point out the positions on this plan, as it is not correct—O'Donnell held the pistol in his right hand; I am sure of that—his back was towards me, and he was looking towards his cabin—Carey was about a yard from him, lounging against the cabin—Mrs. O'Donnell was on the prisoner's left-hand side, nearest me, and she was sitting with her arm round O'Donnell's neck—that was the position when I saw the shot fired—Carey was lounging against the corner of the cabin—the boatswain Jones was at the bottom of the stairs, playing with the little girl, with his back towards the prisoner—I had not observed anything of O'Donnell or Carey during the day previous to the occasion—I saw them drinking together when I went into the cabin at about half-past 3—I did not see Mrs. Carey then present—there might have been other persons drinking besides Carey and O'Donnell, but I did not observe any one—I do not recollect Carey and O'Donnell coming on board the Melrose on the Saturday—Mrs. Carey's cabin was at the bottom of the saloon on the left-hand side—Carey slept in the steerage, being a third-class passenger, but the wife and children went second class—I do not know where Carey slept on the Saturday night—I do not know whether Carey, his wife, and O'Donnell had been on shore drinking on the Saturday—Mrs. Carey caught her husband just as he was falling on the deck—I cannot say whether she came out before the shots were fired—she was in her cabin when Carey exclaimed "Oh, Maggie, I'm shot"—the three shots might have been all fired before she came out, they were close one upon another—it was after the second and third shots that she came out—Carey called out after the first shot was fired—there never was more than about two yards between O'Don<lb/>nell and Carey—O'Donnell took steady aim at the man—if O'Donnell had made one pace forward he could have struck him, if he had had a knife or a sword; he could not have struck him with his hand—Carey was facing him at the first shot; there was about a yard between them—Carey was a fine fellow, a fine man—I did not see O'Donnell take the pistol from his pocket, but I saw him drawing his hand from his pocket—Carey was looking at him, but I do not know whether he saw the pistol—Carey made no grab or any gesture to seize the pistol or O'Don<lb/>nell—he was shot in the right-hand side of the neck, and when he was</p>

Up to the time the shot was fired there was nothing to draw my attention to the movements of O'Donnell and Carey more than to other persons on board—I believe they were drinking each other's healths—I did not mention that circumstance before—they were lifting their glasses as if drinking each other's health; their glasses went up together, but I did not hear them say anything—I had not noticed Mrs. Carey at all that morning in the saloon—the first thing that called my attention was the shot; I rushed aft after the second and third shots were fired; a crowd rushed down and there was a deal of confusion—as far as my observation goes I did not see young Carey go to his mother's berth—I did not see any other pistol but O'Donnell's, but I cannot say that one might not have been in the cabin—I did not notice Mrs. Carey till after the three shots were fired; she was then going up to O'Donnell—I saw young Carey in the saloon, but I did not notice him do anything or go anywhere—when I saw Carey staggering after the first shot he was in the middle of the cabin, about a yard from O'Donnell's berth, and nearly opposite where the prisoner was sitting—when I turned round after hearing the first shot Mrs. O'Donnell was standing with her hand on her husband's shoulder, and she remained so when the second and third shots were fired—just as the first shot was fired a passenger passed me and went on deck; I do not know his name and do not know him; he was examined at Port Elizabeth—I heard Mrs. Carey say at the Cape that O'Donnell said "I was sent to do it," but I am almost sure O'Donnell said "I did not do it"—I think young Carey said that O'Donnell said "I could not help it"—O'Donnell did hold out his hand to Mrs. Carey and say "Shake hands, Mrs. Carey," and she did—I had not noticed whether Carey or O'Donnell were excitable men—I did not hear Carey indulging in any abuse of the Government and the English—I did not hear Robert McHardy examined at Port Elizabeth.</p>

                  </hi>. I was 15 years of age last April—up to the beginning of July I had lived in Dublin—my father had been in prison some time before he left Dublin—on 4th July I went on board the Kinfauns Castle in London with six younger children and my mother—we all went in the name of Power, except one, who was called M'Kenna—on 6th July my father joined the vessel at Dartmouth—he also went by the name of Power, and we all went to the Cape of Good Hope—I saw the prisoner on the voyage; I think he came on board in London—he was accompanied by a young woman—I recollect arriving at the Cape on Friday, July 27th, and on the 28th we all went on board the Melrose as steerage passengers—my mother and sisters slept in the second-class cabin, and my father and three of us boys in the steerage—the steerage is all open—on Sunday afternoon I was in the second-class saloon—I</p>

               <p>went down from deck at 3.30, and when I came down my father, Mr. Jones the boatswain, and my little sister were there, and O'Donnell was sitting on the settee, and Mrs. O'Donnell was sitting close to him—my father was standing at the corner of O'Donnell's berth; I was near the staircase, where Jones and my sister were—I had been about five minutes in the cabin before a shot was fired—during that time my father and O'Donnell were speaking together—I heard no high words between them—I saw the prisoner draw a revolver out of his pocket and fire at my father, and the cartridge, or a bullet, hit my father in the neck—he was standing and O'Donnell was sitting—I was near the staircase—when the bullet struck my father I think he did not speak, but I saw him stagger towards my mother's cabin at the end of the saloon on the left-hand side—I ran towards my mother's cabin to get my father's revolver—I went round the tables—my mother was in her cabin and I took the revolver from the bag produced—I had seen my father with a revolver when he came on board at Dartmouth, and I saw it when my father went on shore at Madeira, and when he came back he put it into the bag—I knew it was there because I afterwards saw my father and mother go to it to get money—I think it was on the bedstead—that was between Madeira and Cape Town—I knew the bag was in my mother's cabin, because I had taken it from the Kinfauns Castle myself—when I ran to the cabin I wanted to give the revolver to my father—it was unlocked and I took it out—there was only one pistol, and, to the best of my belief, this is the one produced—I then went back into the saloon—my mother had gone out before me—after I got out of the cabin O'Donnell fired the second shot—my father was running towards my mother, crying out "Oh, Maggie, I'm shot"—I then heard a third shot fired—my father was then in my mother's arms, standing with his back towards O'Donnell—I kept the pistol in my pocket—I did not give it to my father, because I saw he would not be able to use it—my father and mother fell together, and he died within a quarter of an hour afterwards—during the whole time I was in the cabin before the shot was fired I did not hear anything like a quarrel or see any struggle—I did not see my father with any pistol, I did not pick one up off the ground—I carried the pistol in my pocket until it was taken away from me, shortly after my father's death, by the second officer—there was a good deal of excitement at the time—I saw my mother go towards O'Donnell, who put out his hand and said "Shake hands, Mrs. Carey, your name is not Power," or something like that—I am not sure whether O'Donnell said "I was sent to do it" or "I had to do it"—I am not positive as to the words used—my mother, I believe, did not shake hands with the prisoner—Mrs. O'Donnell said "No matter, O'Donnell, you are no informer"—I had seen O'Donnell using a pistol on the voyage—he was shooting flying fish with it, but I cannot say whether it was the one with which he shot my father.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUSSELL</hi>. This is the fifth time I have appeared as a witness—I saw in the saloon at the time I heard the first shot, Mr. Jones, the prisoner, my father, Mrs. O'Donnell, and my little sister was playing with Jones—others might have been there—I cannot say whether Parish was present; he might have been—I said at Bow Street "At the time the pistol was drawn, my father could have seen Jones in the cabin, but not Parish, because Parish came out of his cabin when the shot was fired"—that is not true, but I did not understand the question</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190147"/>
               <p>Mr. Sullivan put to me—I thought the question was if my father looked round while Mr. O'Donnell was drawing the revolver, and could he see Parish—I said that he could not, because Parish came out when the shot was fired—I cannot say whether that was a true answer—I did not see Parish out of his cabin, because my back was turned to him—the question I did not understand was about when Mr. O'Donnell drew the revolver; I have had time to think about it now—my little sister and Jones were at the bottom of the companion steps—I cannot say whether I was facing towards them, but I think I was looking towards the aft end of the saloon, towards my mother's cabin—I don't know whether their faces were towards me or not—I saw the prisoner lire the pistol, and I think it was with his left hand; his body would have hidden what he was doing if it was in his right hand—he might have drawn it with his right hand, but he fired, I think, with his left hand; I saw him draw it, but cannot tell with which hand—I do not recollect whether I swore at Port Elizabeth that he fired with his left hand—the moment the shot was fired I ran to my mother's berth—my mother was there, and she came out into the saloon just before me—when my father came on board at Dartmouth I first saw the pistol; he carried it in a revolver pocket behind on his hip—I heard that it was given him at Dublin, and he showed it to me—he took it ashore with him at Madeira—so far as I know no one knew up to then that my father was Carey—I never looked at the pistol to see if it was loaded, though I saw it once or twice; I should have known, for I had had one of my own, which I bought at Port Elizabeth—I saw the pistol between Madeira and the Cape, when my mother and father went to the bag to get some money—the bag contained money, papers, and the revolver—up to the time when we changed into the Melrose my mother and father berthed together, and, so far as I know, the bag was kept locked; down to July 29 it was generally kept locked; I saw it unlocked once or twice between Madeira and the Cape—we arrived at the Cape at 4 a.m. on July 27—the vessel was brought alongside about 6 a.m., and my father went on shore—he did not take the pistol with him on shore at the Cape, far he was asked at the Custom House if he had any firearms, and he laid "No"—one of the men at the yard told us that if he had any fire arms he would have to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if he denied it he would have to give the revolver up—the Melrose was close beside the Kinfauns Castle, and our things were carried on board in the afternoon—I carried the traps and bag which contained the revolver—I think I went on shore on Saturday, and I think I met Mrs. O'Donnell and the prisoner—I do not remember that my father, the prisoner, and Mrs. O'Donnell went up town on the Saturday drinking—we slept on board the Melrose that Saturday night—when I ran, after my father was shot, to the bag it was not locked—I did so because my mother could get the revolver out, and because I could open it whether it was locked or not; if you pulled the straps you could get your hand in—the carpenter on the Kinfauns Castle had to open it for my father one day—he did something with the key, and I saw aim pull this strap, and therefore I thought I could get the pistol out by putting in my hand—it was brought here after the murder—when the Magistrate required me to get out a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I could not open it with the key, and the carpenter got a chisel and burst the lock—I could not get it by pulling the straps because it was at the</p>

               <p>bottom among some papers—it was, in fact, open when I got the revolver out, but I could have got it if it had been locked—I cannot mention any one who saw me with the pistol in the saloon after my father was shot—I cannot remember the second officer asking me if I had one, but he searched me twice on that day on deck—he did not find the pistol on the first occasion, I had it in my trousers pocket—I do not remember telling him that I had not one—three minutes afterwards he searched me again—I did not hear the second officer, Beecher, told that I had the pistol; I saw a young man speaking to him, but he searched me again and took it from me—I told Beecher I wanted to get it out of my mother's way, and I told you I wanted to get it to give it to my father; both were true—I do not remember saying before to-day that my father put the pistol into the bag after Madeira, or that I had carried the bag from the Kinfauns Castle to the Melrose—I did not understand that I was asked whether my father took the pistol on shore with him—I said something like this at Port Elizabeth, that O'Donnell said to my mother, "I did not do it," and I said at Bow Street that he said, "I was sent to do it"—I knew that my mother had sworn that those were the words, and that was the reason I swore to them at Bow Street—I cannot really remember what the words were—my father and O'Donnell were great friends in the Kinfauns Castle—O'Donnell was to have stopped at the Cape, but my father said there was a better chance of work at Natal—while we were leaving Cape Town on Sunday some men came on the quay and pointed at my father, who was on deck—up to that time I do not know that any one had suspected that my father was Carey—my father asked me to see if the men were pointing at him—as to the shooting of my father, all three shots had not been fired when my mother got to the saloon; if it has been said that all three shots were fired before my mother came, that was not correct—I bought a pistol at Port Elizabeth, I paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I flung it overboard as it was broken—we drove about at Port Elizabeth, my mother and myself, but I do not remember the driver's name—I don't remember someone saying, "You are a fine fellow, why did you not shoot O'Donnell when he shot your father?" and my replying that I ran to get it, but it was gone, my father had it—I do not remember reading that the prisoner said my father had a pistol—I do not remember that man (<hi rend="italic">Walter Young</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My father, when shot, was laid on the table, and his pockets were turned out—I did not see anything taken out—he kept the pistol in his pocket for a day or two after leaving Madeira, and I afterwards saw it in the bag—I did not pick up any pistol on the saloon floor—my mother went to the bag and she got a fright; she thought the revolver was lost, or that somebody had taken it, because she did not see it, but I made her open the bag and showed it to her—when the first shot was fired by O'Donnell I ran to my mother's berth to get the pistol—I saw Parish in the saloon after my father was dead, but not till then—I said that Parish had come from his cabin after the first shot because I had read it in his evidence.</p>

I live at Cape Town, and am a hotel-keeper—I left Cape Town in the ship Melrose on 28th July for Port Elizabeth—when I went on board I saw James Power and the prisoner there—I was in<lb/>formed on board that Power was James Carey, on the Saturday before starting—on the Sunday afternoon after dinner I was sitting on the hatchway reading an English newspaper—Carey came and spoke to me, and asked me to lend him the newspaper, which I did—while he was looking at the newspaper his boy came up and spoke to him, and Carey left me and went downstairs—I afterwards followed him into the saloon—I went to get some beer, but I could not get it—when I went down I saw O'Donnell in the cabin—I heard a shot about half an hour after I went down—O'Donnell was sitting on the settee at the corner, near the companion steps—Carey and the prisoner were sitting about a yard from the steps—Carey was sitting by the side of the prisoner; a young woman was sitting a little way off—I saw one of the crew playing with the child—his boy was at the farther end of the cabin—I did not hear the words Carey and O'Donnell said, but I saw them talking together—O'Donnell was very quiet—I was up at the hatchway—when I was downstairs they were talking together in a quiet tone—I did not see anything like a quarrel between them—when I could not obtain the beer I went down for it—I then went upstairs and sat upon the hatchway, which was open, and I could see down into the cabin—I was waiting to see the beer come out—O'Donnell was very quiet—I saw Carey talking in a very <hi rend="italic">high</hi> state—he was going on as if he was laying down the law, or something of that kind, and he had his hand in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—I could not hear what was said—he was sitting down by the side of O'Donnell—about 10 minutes after I heard the report of a pistol, and, looking below, I saw</p>

               <p>O'Donnell lowering his hand—I looked over the hatchway, and saw Carey making way towards his cabin—I then saw the motion of O'Donnell's hand up—I could not exactly discern the pistol, although I saw the smoke of it—I believe it was his left hand that was up—I did not see anything in Carey's hand—after the second shot was fired I ran down below, and while I was going down I heard a third shot—when I heard the second shot O'Donnell was sitting down on the corner of the settee, and the young woman was hugging him round the neck—Carey was standing up, looking towards the crew, with his face round, at the time of the first shot, a short distance from the foot of the ladder—I saw no violence on Carey's part—on my seeing the second shot fired Carey was making towards his cabin, going away from O'Donnell—I did not see the third shot fired; it was fired as I was going downstairs—when I got into the cabin I saw Carey fall on the deck at the end of the settee, by Mrs. O'Donnell—I saw Mrs. Carey too—I saw young Carey at the time; he was running about awfully excited—when I was looking through I saw him run into the cabin, and I saw Mrs. Carey come out—after Carey fell I rushed up on deck, went towards the galley, and asked one of the crew if he knew where the captain was—I went down below, and I was standing at the foot of the stairs—Mrs. Carey left the body and came in a grieving and frantic way, with her hands clasped, towards O'Donnell, and said "O'Donnell, why did you shoot my husband?"—O'Donnell put his hands out towards Mrs. Carey, and said "I could not help it, Mrs. Carey"—I then went to Mrs. Carey and drew her away from him, and said "You had better come away from him"—some few minutes after that O'Donnell was put in irons and handcuffed by the captain's orders—O'Donnell never made a complaint to me of an attack on him by Carey.</p>

I live at King's Arms Street, North Walsham, Norfolk—I assist my father, an ironmonger—I and my brother, Frank Cubitt, were passengers on board the Kinfauns Castle, going to the Cape—I saw Carey and O'Donnell together on board during the voyage—I did not know until my arrival at the Cape that James Power was James Carey—they appeared to be on friendly terms—we arrived at Cape Town on Friday, 27th July, and I stayed there, and put up at the White House Hotel—on the afternoon the Melrose left, which was on Saturday, I went into a wine and beershop, and the keeper of the shop made a state<lb/>ment to me in relation to James Carey—he gave me this document with a likeness of Carey. (<hi rend="italic">This was a supplement given away with the "Weekly Freeman" of May</hi> 5; <hi rend="italic">in one corner was "He swears in his victims" in another corner, "Look to the man in the grey suit," in another "He informs," and in another corner, "Crown witness," with a portrait of James Carey in the centre.</hi>) I recognised that likeness as representing James Power, the man on board—I went with my brother to the docks from which the Melrose was to start—my brother has since died—I saw O'Donnell standing on the docks at the side near the Melrose—I said to him "Have you seen the portrait of Carey?"—I produced it, and showed it to him—he said "I will shoot him"—he asked me for it, and I think he put it in his pocket—he went on board the Melrose, and I believe she sailed about a quarter of an hour after the interview referred to—I did not go on to Port Elizabeth—I remained some time at the Cape with my brother—I then returned to this country—I met with an accident in an explosion that took place a few weeks ago—I have lately given this information.</p>

I was the second officer of the Melrose on sunday, the 29th July—in the afternoon I was officer of the watch, and was on the bridge when I heard a shot fired—that was about a quarter to 4 o'clock—I at once got off the bridge and went down into the second saloon—before I got into the saloon I heard two more shots—there was a longer interval between the first and second shots than there was between the second and third—I heard the two second shots as I was going along the deck—when I got into the saloon I saw the prisoner sitting on the stern side of the cabin, on the settee—the boatswain was with him—I went up and laid hold of him by the right wrist first from behind—I saw the boatswain take a pistol from the left side pocket of his coat—the boatswain handed me a pistol like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on looking at it I found three of the chambers had been recently discharged and two loaded—we did not find any more arms upon the prisoner; we found a knife or something like that, but nothing of any consequence—I saw a cartridge some time after in the bath-room—I took it out of his waistcoat-pocket—the prisoner had been in the bath-room for some time—he was taken there—it was a similar cartridge to this—it appeared to fit the small revolver—I did not try it—it struck me it would fit it—I did not see Carey till I went along the table—I saw him there, injured—I saw Mrs. Carey first there—I saw young Carey afterwards—from what I heard I felt young Carey some short time afterwards on deck—I found on him a pistol similar to that produced—it is an English pistol, which is com<lb/>monly described as a "bull-dog" pistol—I asked young Carey what he was going to do with it—I took it down immediately and gave it to the purser—when I caught hold of him, which I did rather roughly, and was taking the pistol away, he said "Do not be frightened, I am not going</p>

I am district surgeon at Port Elizabeth—on Monday, 30th July, I saw the body of a man being carried through the streets at Port Elizabeth—Inspector Cherry and Dr. Everitt were there—the next day I saw the body at the new gaol—on Tuesday morning I made a post-mortem examination in the presence of Dr. Everitt, who died shortly after—I found the body presented three bullet wounds—the one in the neck was about the centre of the windpipe, a little to the left—it passed under the superficial muscle of the neck, wounding a large vein in its transit—it cut the collar of his jacket—the other two wounds were at the back—one was on a level with the upper border of the shoulder-blade, about three inches from the spine—the second bullet wound was at the lower angle of the shoulder blade, some distance from the spine—I found that the upper bullet had cut through the second rib behind, and had wounded the upper part of the lung, and made its way out at the chest, between the fourth and fifth rib, and had lodged immediately under the nipple, from which I removed it—this is the bullet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the second bullet in the back had wounded the lower part of the lung, gone through the diaphragm, traversed the stomach, which was half full of food, and nearly cut the left kidney in two, wounding the large blood-vessels—there was a considerable quantity of blood in the left pleura, and the abdomen contained a large quantity of blood, staining the intestines—after a minute search I could not find the bullet—it was lost in the pelvis or the back—Mrs. Carey and her son afterwards saw the body, and I attended the funeral—the fatal wound was the third one—they were all serious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first wound probably was enough to cause death unless active surgical aid was available—the first bullet entered between what is commonly called Adam's apple and the base of the throat—that is a little to the right of what is commonly called the throttle of the throat—the bullet came out by this big muscle on the neck, under the oblique muscle, cutting the collar of the coat—it was nearly horizontal (<hi rend="italic">The wit<lb/>ness pointed out the positions of the wounds</hi>)—the second bullet entered about the left shoulder—it cut through the rib opposite—it lodged in the breast,</p>

               <p>in the nipple; you could feel it with your finger—it was oblique from above downwards—the nipple is lower than the second rib behind—the third was by the point of the shoulder blade, about the same distance from the spine—it entered and went through the lower part of the lung, through the large muscle separating the chest from the belly, and through the stomach, and then it was diverted by some means, and passed down into the kidney, cutting the big blood-vessels, and was lost somewhere in the contents of the belly or the muscles of the spine—the direction would be from above, downwards—the wound in the neck was about horizontal—I think it is possible the wound in the neck might have been delivered by a man who was firing with his elbow at his side, seated, and the man at whom he was firing might be a man of 5 feet 10 inches in height stand<lb/>ing up, but I do not think the other two could have been—I think the man who was shot might have been standing up as to two of them—it entered the throat, and came out a little more at the side, in a horizontal line—a man who fired with his elbow at his side, or a man who fired seated, and the man at whom he fired being 5 feet 10 inches high, would cause the wound inflicted in the neck to be horizontal—the bullet might have been diverted from an oblique course by a tendon, or the side of the windpipe, or a muscle—I made a minute examination, but did not find anything to suggest that there was anything to cause a diversion of the bullet—I examined the prisoner in gaol at Port Elizabeth, and found his left arm was limited in its movements at the elbow joints by an old injury—the muscles of the hand were wasted, and the little finger was con<lb/>tracted—the left hand and arm were very much disabled—the palm of the right hand was hard and horny, like the hand of a man accustomed to hard, muscular work—he could hold things in his left hand in a clumsy way—the elbow was injured in childhood—that was the prisoner's state<lb/>ment—the wasted condition of the forearm was due to the straining in lifting a heavy packet of hay, and a good deal of the waste would be at<lb/>tributable to the enforced disuse of the arm—I made an examination of Carey, and found that he was a powerful man about 5 feet 10 inches in height, heavy bones and strong muscles, big square shoulders; in fact a big-boned man—he was a corpulent man, well nourished, and in a healthy condition compared to the prisoner—he was a much more powerful man—there was no comparison between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have had a good deal of experience of shooting cases, both in the size of pistol balls and rifle balls; and it is my experience that a bullet often takes a very erratic course and is diverted by a very slight obstacle, I could not predict the exact course it would take—as to Carey staggering and bending as he walked, that would not make any difference in the opinion I formed that the man who shot him must be standing up—the prisoner had a perfect use of his right hand, he could not fire so rapidly with his left hand as his right—he had not sufficient free movement to use the pistol with his left hand—it is rather difficult sometimes in excitement to hit an object although it might be close.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The murders in which it was supposed he was implicated were of a political character—when he spoke of murder being no crime, he was speaking of "removing tyrants," representing the English Government, or persons connected with the Government—he at all times took great care to prevent himself being detected, and he was very chary of his own life—I never knew him to commit a daring open murder for which I could arrest him he gave evidence against his fellows in crime, and thereby escaped being tried, and probably executed—I take it for granted that was his reason—all he said and did was so execrated by the Irish people that I had to take care to protect him from their violence, and that was the reason for his removal from Dublin.</p>

I am soap a manufacturer, of Bow Bridge, Stratford—I have been in business 13 or 14 years—my brother, who has a bone-crushing establishment near there, made a communication to me early in September, in consequence of which I observed what was going on—I usually leave for the City on Fridays at 2.30 or 3 o'clock—Hatts was a receiving foreman—Culff has been in the habit of bringing fat there about four years, and the average of my payments to him has been 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left it to Hatts to see to the weights—he had a book in which he was requested to enter them, and until my brother wrote to me I had no suspicion—the casks Culff brought were all about the same size, and those in this case were 31,32, and 30 inches deep—they are the same diameter—the tare was about 1/2 cwt., and the weight of the cask a little over 2 qrs.—a cask full of rough stuff would weigh about 3 cwt., which would mean 2 1/2 cwt. of fat—the tops of the casks were covered when brought in—Hatts would enter in the gate book everything which came into the place, the numbers but not the particulars—here is an entry in Hatts's writing on 12th Sep<lb/>tember: "W. Culff, Stepney, seven casks of rough stuff, 3.9.20."—he puts the tare against each cask, varying from 2 qrs. 2 lb. to 5 qrs., and it amounts to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is in Hatts's writing—after the rough stuff is melted the produce is entered in another book in Hatts's writing: "Produce, Sept 13, 1883, W. Culff, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he does not give the details—the result is 10.2.24, making a net weight of 8 cwt. 3 qrs. 15 lb.—that would represent the weight we should pay Culff for, viz., 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made up every week accounts of what I had had during the week—this account is made up in the usual way for the week ending 15th September; there were no other casks from Culff that week—on Wednesday, 26th September, I saw Culff in the clerk's office in reference to that 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cheque—I gave him the account, which was in the clerk's writing, copied from Hatts's book, and said "Seven casks of rough stuff, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Mr. Culff, is that correct?" he said "I don't know, Sir; I leave that to you"—I said "I don't like people leaving it to us; if we made a mistake of 2 cwt., I suppose you would soon find it out?" he said "Yes"—I said "Look at that account and see if it is correct;" he looked at it and said "It is"—I handed him this cheque and said "Here is your cheque, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., receipt this account"—the words in the cheque were 12.16.7, and the figures 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was done purposely that the amount should differ, and he brought it back on Saturday, the 29th—I saw the seven casks in respect of which that cheque was given in the old engine-room, four on Tuesday, 11th Sep<lb/>tember, and three on Thursday—I examined them, and the average was about 1 cwt. of fat in each—they were about half full—I did not weigh them or remove them—I know they were Culff's because all the other casks of kitchen stuff were marked in chalk by Hatts with the customer's</p>

               <p>name, and these were not—the other three which I saw on the 13th were in the same condition—I estimated about 1 cwt. of rough stuff in each—I did not mark them then—they would be melted in the usual way—Hatts's figures were not true, they could not possibly produce 8 cwt. 3 qrs. 15 lb. of real fat because there was more melted fat than kitchen stuff—this is the gate book in Hatts's writing—his entry is "Tuesday, September 11th, W. Culff, four casks rough stuff out of four empties"—in Hatts's book of rough stuff here is on page 42, "September, 1883, W. Culff, 7 seven casks of rough stuff"—that is put down under date of Thursday, September 20th; the casks are entered 3 cwt. 0 qr. 7 lb., 2 cwt. 3 qrs. 4lb., 3 cwt. 0 qrs. 17 lb., 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 20 lb., 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 17 lb., 3 cwt. 0qr. 11 lb., 3 cwt. 1 qr. 3 lb., total 20 cwt. 3 qrs. 23 lb; tare, 4 cwt. 0qr. 8 lb., which carries out 16 cwt. 3 qrs. 15 lb.—under that is an entry of a cask of melted stuff, but he did not bring in any melted stuff—there is an entry of fat received by weight—here is an entry at folio 422 of rough stuff; "Bought of Culff 16 cwt. 3 qrs. 15 lb."—Culff brought in four casks that week—I examined them in the old engine room on 18th September with a three-foot rule; one measured 16 inches, one 18, one 5, one 5 1/2—I put the rule to the bottom, but I did not move the casks—the total of the four was 3 1/2 cwt., and the whole lot could have been put into one cask and would have about filled it—it was in a loose state before it was melted, and there would be no difficulty in turning the one of 5 1/2 into the one of 5; and if they had put the 15-inch one in there would only have been 20 inches of stuff there—I kept an eye on them and measured them two, three, or four times a day—no other casks came from Culff that week—here is an entry in the gate book, "Tuesday, September 17th, W. Culff, four casks rough stuff;" that is a mistake, Saturday was the 18th and it is carried over on the 17th—that is the only entry of Culff's that week—I next saw Culff on the 29th, when he returned the cheque—I handed him the account and said, "17 casks of rough stuff, 17.3.15"—he said "Yes"—I said "You don't vary the amount much"—he said "No"—I handed him a cheque; I said the former cheque was a mistake—I had this 17 written in, and initialled it and returned it him, and he took them both away—my clerk, Farthing had measured the casks in my presence and my measurements were verified—it is not true that 16 cwt. 3 qrs. 3 lb. was delivered that week by Culff—none of Culff's fat was melted, but a cask of our own fat was credited to him—on October 1st at 2.30 p.m. I told Hatts that I was not satisfied with the correctness of the rough stuff and should have it all re-weighed—he weighed it, I checked the weights, and Farthing put them down—we weighed 25 or 30 casks, and when we had finished I said "I want to see Culff's fat weighed"—he appeared confused, and then we began weighing five casks of Culff's rough stuff; four of them were weighed, they were not marked with chalk as the others were—I said "Where is the fifth cask?"—he said "It has been missing since Wednesday"—I said "I know that to be a lie, the first cask you brought in last Wednesday was one which I had seen you take the fat out of and put it into Culff's (he took it from one of Carrington's casks, I came in while he was doing it)—I told him that two of the casks which he brought out to be weighed were two which had been delivered by Culff a fortnight before the 18th—I knew that as they had my mark on them—I had marked them with a piece of paper with three strokes, outside</p>

               <p>and a piece of paper in one cask inside—I said "If you doubt what I say look at the casks, and you will see my mark on them"—he said that it was so—he had mixed them up with what came in on the 24th—four other casks are entered as coming in on the 24th, but two of them are casks which I had marked in the week ending September 24th—those were the 16 and the 18 inch, some rough stuff had been put into one of them—I said "You had better come into the office and I will tell you some more"—he said "Ever since Rowland left"—we went into the office—the officers were there, and I said "I presume you know who these two gentlemen are?"—he said "Yes"—Beale said "I presume you know who we are, we are two police officers; it will be better for you if you speak the truth," and I said "You had better speak the truth."(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Culff did not come back, but I received a letter from his solicitor dated the 2nd; that was after the warrant against Culff was out, and he knew that Hatts was in custody—Culff was the only man who brought rough stuff in his own van, our own men go out collecting for different people—Culff would ascertain the net pro<lb/>duct from the entries made by Hatts in our books—he would be bound by that—we melt every day, and Hatts has charge of the melting depart<lb/>ment—in a large number of instances as soon as the rough stuff is brought in it is melted—Hatts would put the casks in the old engine-room—there were no other casks of rough stuff there, there was soda and soft soap—I know that because we check the whole of the stuff in the place daily—Alshorne assisted Hatts at the steam crane in unloading the casks—they should be weighed as they are handed in, and put down in the books—they came in between 7.30 and 8 o'clock—on 13th September three more were placed in the engine-room—they were brought before breakfast, I believe; I saw them soon afterwards—I had the stuff emptied on to the floor fox three weeks before it was put in the pans to be melted, and as soon as it was in the pans I knew what we had got, and checked the stock—the carman puts the chalk mark on, and no other casks were unmarked in September or October during the time I was keeping watch—the casks are petroleum barrels—I drew the cheque intentionally wrong, and altered it for him when he brought it back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Hunt's ledger-keeper—in consequence of a request made to me I watched Culff on Tuesday, September 18th, and saw him enter the yard at 7.45 a.m. with a hired van and four casks covered with a cloth—Hatts was upstairs at the loop-hole, and he and Alshorne received them when they were lifted up by the crane—Culff went away a few minutes afterwards and took some empty casks—as soon as the place was cleared I went up and had a look at the casks—there was no chalk mark on them; two had very little in them, and the other two were about half full—a few minutes afterwards Mr. Hunt and I inspected them—they were measured in my presence on the Saturday between 2 and 3 o'clock, after the men had left the factory—one measured 5 inches, one 5 1/2, one 15, and I think the other 16; the total weight was about 2 1/2 or 3 cwt., they would not weigh 3 cwt. net—they were not entered in Hatts's book then—they were left in the engine-room, and have never been melted yet—I was there on the 26th, when Culff came, and heard part of the conversation—Mr. Hunt said "Is this account correct, Mr. Culff?"—he said "I don't know, Sir; I suppose so"—he then took the account out of his pocket and referred to it—Mr. Hunt said "You would soon know if we paid you for a hundredweight short"—he said "Yes, Sir, that I should"—I can swear those words were used, I picked up a piece of paper and scribbled them down—I was present on the 29th, when Culff came again, and made a note of what passed—Mr. Hunt said "You managed to keep up the quantity pretty well, Mr. Culff"—four casks had been delivered by Culff that week, on the 18th, and no</p>

               <p>others, and those are the ones I measured—I was present on October 1, when Hatts was before his master, who said he was not satisfied, and we entered the weights on a board—Hatts only produced four casks instead of five, and the first two we weighed were part of the four which came in on the 18th, which were supposed to have been melted, and the cheque given, and he put them forward as two of the others—Mr. Hunt said "Where is the fifth cask?"—he said "It has been missing since Wed<lb/>nesday, Sir"—Mr. Hunt said "Let us have no lies, Hatts; you know that cask never came into the place, and you know that no stuff has been melted this week"—I understood Hatts to say "That is so," but he was a few yards from me—Mr. Hunt said "You had better come down to the office with me, and I shall be able to tell you a good deal more about this affair than you think for," and followed them to the office, where Mr. Hunt said "When did these two casks come in you have just weighed?"—I said "Tuesday, the 18th"—he said "When did you measure them and mark them?"—I said "On the 22nd"—he said "You hear that, Hatts?"—he said "That is so," or "I am sorry to say that is so."</p>

About October 1, I was called on to go to Mr. Hunt's—I had been in communi<lb/>cation with him a fortnight or three weeks—I had seen Culff almost daily—when I got there Hatts was brought in—Mr. Hunt said to him "I have a suspicion that something is going on wrong between you and Culff in bringing fat"—I then said "I suppose you know who we are?"—he said "I guess you are policemen"—I said "Yes, we are"—Mr. Hunt said "I have kept observation, and I have found that on several occasions you charged me with fat which Culff has brought"—he hesitated, and said "I am very sorry, I was tempted by Culff, I hope Mr. Hunt won't charge me for the sake of my wife and family"—Mr. Hunt said "How long has this been going on?" he said "Upwards of two years," or "About two years"—Mr. Hunt said "How did it commence?"—he said "A man named Rowland, who used to work here, asked me to his house, and Rowland said 'If you want to make a few shillings a week you can make it with this man"—I said "What have you been having for your share?"—he said "7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week"—I said "Is that all?"—he said "Yes"—the other sergeant asked him where he received it—he said Culff came and brought it to him wrapped up in paper, and gave it to him every week.</p>

On 12th November I saw these sacks of forage made up; they were marked "Jupp"—I said nothing to West when he started—I had seen some bits of paper in Mr. Walker's hand, upon which he placed a private mark—I went to Hounslow about 3 o'clock, and waited till 6.20, when West returned with the waggon, and pulled up his horses in front of the White Bear, and went inside—he came out in about five minutes, went to the timber cart, and took off a sack of fodder, which was on the centre pole, and carried it into a shed which Tillyer occupied—there were only two forage bags on the cart—he had one wrapped round his legs—this was the only full one—the horses never had their nose bags on while they stood there—a sack of forage is about three bushels—there is an open shed at the bottom, and an inner shed also, which Tillyer occupies, and which locks up; it adjoins the White Bear—West stood the sack down in the open shed, and returned to the public-house—he remained there nearly half an hour, and then came out with Tillyer—they went into the open shed—Duck and I waited about two minutes, and when we saw the sack was gone we went across to the shed, and met Tillyer coming out, and said "What is this Mr. Montgomery's man has brought in in a sack?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—we took him to the inner shed, Duck struck a light, and we saw the horse provender emptied out in a heap, with the sack by the side of it; I could see that that was the same sack—I saw West driving away; I went after him, and said that I should take him in custody for stealing a quantity of horse provender, the property of his master—he said, "I did not steal it"—I took him to the station, returned, and found Duck in charge of the place and of Tillyer—Duck took Tillyer to the station, and I waited for his return—we then called the landlord of the White Bear, who was Tillyer's master, and examined the fodder in the shed and found the pieces of paper which I had put in, and took possession of the fodder in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Pyfield; we live at Sandy Hill, Woolwich—on 6th November I was in my back room washing; somebody knocked at the door; I went and saw McCausland, who asked if I had received a letter from his uncle—I said "No"—I knew him before—he went a little way and came back, and asked me if I had got a little pepper that I could give him—I said "No," and shut the door—he went down the path, shut the gate, and went away—I went on with my washing, and about 2.45 found the front door open, the parlour door broken open, and the parlour window open—I went to the gate, but saw no one—I went to my bedroom and found five drawers out of six in the chest had been opened, and I missed a tin cash-box, two watches which laid by the side of it, and a bank-book—in the box was a gold brooch and necklace, two gold lockets, one of which was on a watch and the other separate, a silver brooch, a long silver guard, my husband's medal, a pile of papers, and a Russian coin, value altogether nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I identify this brooch, necklace, earrings, and coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

"the gold brooch, necklace, locket—he said "You know I do a bit of dealing in that line; I bought them some two months ago of a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> in town, I don't knew his name, but I could find him if I was allowed to go"—on the remand on the 14th Allen intimated that he wanted to speak to me; I went and saw the prisoners in adjoining cells—McCausland said in Allen's hearing "How do you think I shall get on, do you think the Magistrate will settle it?"—I said "I am afraid not"—he said "I intend to plead guilty; Allen was a fool not to open his mouth and tell you where the stuff was at the first onset; I told the lot to him for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Allen said "Have not you found any more of the property, Mr. Brenchley?"—I said "No"—he said "I am sorry you were not sooner on the job; if you had come in the afternoon you would have found <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> in my place with all the stuff, and I should not have been here; I sold the two watches to a tall young man at the corner of the street directly I came out of the rooms for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I should know him again if I saw him and could point him out, but I do not know his name."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). On 27th September, about noon, in consequence of information, I went to Clapham Junction Station and saw Houlden—I said "Mr. Houlden, I believe you have some forged notes in your possession"—he said "No"—he tried to struggle away from me—I put him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and took him to Battersea Road Station, searched him, and found on him 203 25-rouble notes and two sheets of paper with holes in them, bearing the water mark of five-rouble notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the paper was folded in four, and there was enough to print four notes each with the water mark in the centre and sides—when he was charged he said "I emphatically deny it"—I went with Inspector Abberline the same day to 15, Lavender Road, where Houlden lives—Mrs. Banks pointed out two parlours where he lodged—we searched and found several large boxes, the keys were on the mantel<lb/>shelf—Abberline opened them and found six plates for the manufacture of five-rouble notes and a black bag; and in the same box 1, 680 sheets of paper, water-marked for five-rouble notes, and folded for four each, and a water-mark plate—we took the boxes to Battersea Police-station, and showed them to Houlden, who said that one box belonged to him but not the other—next day about 11 a.m. I went to 28 Knox Street,</p>

               <p>Clapham Junction, with Abberline, and saw Mary Hill, I believe she lives there—I said "Is your name Mary Hill?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Is your husband in?"—she said "No"—I said "What time will he be in?"—she said "About 11 o'clock to-night"—I said "We are police officers, and I believe you have plates in your possession for the manu<lb/>facture of notes"—she said "I have had blocks but I have not got them now"—I said "Where are they?"—she said "At my sister's"—we went upstairs—she took a key out of her pocket and opened the door of the first floor back room, where we found a printing press and a quantity of burnt paper—Abberline said to her "You had better come with me to your sister's," and he and another sister who was present then went to Mrs. Garter's while I remained with Mrs. Hill; they came back with the plates—Mrs. Hill said "I took them there this morning"—the parcel was brought there; it was opened in my presence and contained plates for the manufacture of 25-rouble notes—she said that she did not know anything about them—she was taken to the station—we afterwards went to Spottiswoode's and found Henry Hill employed there as a compositor and printer—that was between 12 and 1 o'clock—we told him we were police<lb/>officers and should take him in custody for having in his possession plates for the manufacture of Russian rouble notes—I don't think he made any reply, but he said to Abberline in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> "This man Chester brought these plates to me and told me he would shoot me if I did not print them"—he was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—we also went to 28, Knox Road with the key of the back room, which we got from Mrs. Hill; we found there the Christmas number of <hi rend="italic">London Society</hi> and the plate inside it—we found a quantity of burnt paper in the grate, among which were two pieces relating to 25-rouble notes—they had a yellow edge—all these things were taken to Scotland Yard; and in setting, the paper up I found another piece of paper bearing 25-rouble marks on it—a stalled witness was brought in to see the paper and materials, and he printed some notes from them—some types for printing the numbers were found inside the parcel brought by Mrs. Hill's sister.</p>

Spottiswoode's many years, where he bears a very good character—the tympans were there—these plates are all in Russian—this is the only plate which was outside, all the rest were in the parcel.</p>

Spottiswoode's, in New Street Square, in the room; if they have not disturbed them you will find the plates there—I had previously been with Mary Hill's sister to 64, Lavington Road, Battersea—she spoke to Mrs. Carter, who lodges there—she gave me a parcel, which I took to 28, Knox Road and opened it in Mary Hill's presence—it contained ten plates and blocks for the manu<lb/>facture of 25-rouble notes—Hill said she hoped her husband would not get in any trouble—after she was taken to the station I went to Spottiswoode's with Moser and saw Henry Hill—I said "I am an inspector of police and this is an inspector; a man named Houlden is in custody, and your wife is detained at Battersea Station for having in their possession plates for Russian rouble notes, and you will have to go to the station"—he said "I will go with, you" on the way he said "Mr. Chester</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Holdens statement was put in as follows:</hi>—"House of Detention, October 3, 1883.—I am an old man, and wish you gentlemen to assist in my old age, and I will tell you exactly how matters stand. The pro<lb/>moter and founder of all this was Hermain Jaffe. He resided 19 years ago at Hoxton. He had another wife; she is dead. Her children are in Paris, and are brought up by the Jewish Institution. Jaffe had the money furnished him by a man named Posnianoski. The latter was manager to Meyer at Berlin, who committed suicide 19 years ago. At that time I became acquainted with Jaffe; I was introduced to him accidentally in a warehouse in Commercial Street, E. He asked me how long I had been in England. I told him since 1851. He said 'Then you are an old Englishman; then you ought to know England well by this time.' He took me into a public-house called Welb's, and treated me with drink and cigars. Then he said 'If you could find a trustworthy person who could keep a secret, but he must be an engraver.' I said 'I happen to know some one, and I believe he is a genuine man, but I am afraid to ask him such things of that description; it would be an insult. Then please let me know the nature of the case, and I will then endeavour to feel the pulse whether the party will consent to do anything of that kind.' I did so, and found a party. He lived at that time in Ely Place, Holborn. Jaffe gave the money and samples of notes, and he said if he could see something done towards it he would find some money. He did so on three or four different occasions until they were done and he had the goods for the money. He advanced some more money and bought others. He was lucky enough to escape when I was entrapped by Mr. Thompson with other men, but they were all customers of Jaffe. I served my time, and on coming out started business in Belgian window glass to a large extent until about 18 months afterwards. Jaffe again came to me, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188311190193"/>
               <p>persuaded me to introduce him to the party who made those <hi rend="italic">fivers</hi> before, and gave the money to do so. (During my absence in Portsmouth Jaffe, Krakaner, and Posnianoski were convicted in Paris.) Jaffe gave me then a further order for 25 roubles. I said to him 'These are not the 25 fives which were in circulation,' but he informed me that the old ones had been drawn in and a new issue had come out. He gave me three samples of these, and he gave a deposit of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to see something done towards being made. When he saw that the plates were in hand he supplied more money, to the extent of nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Jaffe had all the goods that were manufactured, and they passed through his hands, and now seeing that they are out of date, and no one wants to buy any more, desired me to make some new ones, and he sent 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Nice, which can be proved by the lips of the landlady's daughter where I resided for seven years in Hamford Street, the Pickersgill; but she did not know what the money was for, Jaffe sent that money to have new 25-roubles made. The man being dead I could not do it; he died about three years ago. Jaffe is a native of Kurland and had a manufactory there. The man's name who made the plates in Kurland is Braim. That man stood in the same dock, and he told me all about Jaffe and his career. Bear this in mind: not only had Jaffe goods through me, but he was the promoter of several factories in London, which nearly all fell but one; I believe so, I do not know there are any more. He had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he sent them all abroad. He never had another business besides dealing in Russian rouble notes. I do not know Russia, and never was there in my life, and never negotiated nor offered to any one goods of that description. I can always make a living wherever I go. I am well known on the turf and am a general dealer. I am a good linguist and can speak six languages, and always earn a living wherever I go. Jaffe used frequently to visit me in Stamford Street. I positively assure you that in the event of getting my liberty I will render you all the assistance possible. I have the sources of that kind of information, and just because I am in trouble they all sympathise with me, and therefore I shall be able to fulfil my promise, and more so that the Russian business of that description shall never appear in this country.—<hi rend="smallCaps">N. HOLCHESTER</hi>." "October 17, 1883.—As I omitted on the last occasion to state to the Treasury, I am in a position to prove in evidence that Jaffe not only gave the money for the purpose of manufacturing plates, but he had them also in his own possession for a considerable length of time for the purpose of getting money under the pretence that he had the manufacturer who makes the notes and required the means to carry it out He had the plates stored away by an old man, who will come forward as a witness, to prove that Jaffe asked him to take care of these for him, and removed them from time to time from his place so as to show the people, and thereby induce them to part with their money. The plates were shells, and Jaffe had them filled up by a foreigner whom I hope to be able to produce at my trial. Jaffe had also a printing press, and tried to take proofs from the plates, so as to endeavour and send them abroad to finish them. I shall be able to produce people to whom he showed the plates.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HOLCHESTBR</hi>."</p>

On 31st October, about 7 o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoner into custody, and at the same time I took the husband; they were together in their room—I told them they would be charged with causing the death of their child by neglecting and starving it—the prisoner said "Good God!
