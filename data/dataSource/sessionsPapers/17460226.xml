               <p>Prisoner. Please you my Lord. My Mother is a Dealer in Coal, and my Mother ow'd a Gentleman two Guineas. And my Mother gave me two Guineas to pay him. As I was coming along, I happen'd to go into a House to call for a halfpenny-worth of Annifeed . Seeing this Man I took no Notice at all: I got my Dram and came away; as I came into Whitechapel, the Prosecutor ask'd me to drink a Pint of Beer: Upon that he forced me; upon which I call'd for the Watch: When I call'd for the Watch, I charg'd him: And when I came to the Watch-House, he made the Watchman charge me. He took from me two Guineas, the Money I was about to pay away. The Watchman gave the Money to the Constable.</p>

I said to him take your Basket, let me have some more. I went and bought my Goods, and coming back to Cannon-Street, I said, I cannot keep pace with you. When I came to my own House he said, you have staid a great while behind me. Then I reckon'd it was about half an Hour after Five in the Evening. So he emptied my Goods and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it was half an Hour after Five ?</p>

               <p>Ebenezar Hartly. I am Constable of Chester-Keys . Coming on the Key the 5th of this Month, I saw this Woman and another at the Bag of Cotton. I came to her and ask'd her what she was doing. Said I, how came you by this? She said, the Porter gave it me. I said, she should go with me to the Porter, to know what Porter could give Merchant's Goods away. After that I found Mr. Jones out and shew'd him the particular Bag.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Roberts. There were a pair of Ear-Rings lost. My Master keeps six or seven Servants. I desir'd my Mistress to search their Boxes and Trunks. Accordingly we all went up Stairs together. But there was nothing to be found of the Ear-Rings. I told my Mistress as nothing could be found here, I begg'd we might all be search'd in the Room. I first turn'd out my Pockets; then the House Maid, then the Cook and another Servant or two; then we came to the Prisoner at the Bar. She refus'd. My Master had his Child by, a Youth. What is the Reason you won't search your Box. Then she turn'd her Gown a little on one Side, and the first Thing my Master saw was these two Pillowbears, the next was a Towel, and this Handkerchief, in which were five Candles conceal'd: And my Master was angry with her for concealing these Things. And the Justice, when we went before him, ask'd her what Reason she had to keep these Things in her Pocket. She answer'd, to keep them clean. Five or six Candles in them, fine Things to keep them clean indeed!</p>

               <p>Page. About Seven o'Clock in the Evening, the Prisoner at the Bar brought this Watch to my House , in order to borrow a Guinea and a half. I ask'd her where she liv'd. She said, near where I liv'd. I ask'd her whose Watch it was. She said, her Husband's, and that he was ill, and that she pawn'd it out of Necessary, for her Husband. Then, Sir, she said, I let you know, the Watch is not mine, but a Woman's whose Husband is ill.</p>

Some Time after, this Woman came for a halfpenny Candle. My Wife miss'd some Candles that were hung upon the Pegs; upon which she found 6 lb. under her Apron. We ask'd her hour she came by them. She declar'd she bought them in St. John-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear with any Certainty that these are your Goods?</p>
               <p>George. I am certain they were, they were fresh made Candles. The Prisoner's Husband was question'd about the Candles, and said, when we went to his House, if there were any Candles they were ours; where we found 4 lb. more Candles , which I knew to be ours .</p>

            . My Lord, On Saturday Night I had nobody in the House but myself and little Girl. a Customer in the Neighbourhood sent for some Candles, and said they must have them then. When I came home I miss'd several Pounds of Candles . I found the Prisoner in the Shop for a halfpenny Candle. I turn'd aside her Cloak, and found 6 lb. in her Apron.</p>
               <p>Negro, Constable. I took charge of her Saturday Night : When I came, the Candles were taken out of her Lap; which Mrs. George declar'd were her's .</p>

               <p>Constable. She could not tell on what Side of the Way in St. John-Street, the Man she bought them of , liv'd, nor whether he was a tall Man or a short Man that serv'd her.</p>

            , the Prisoner at the Bar, brought to me a large Copper Funnel .</p>
               <p>Q. To what Purpose did he bring it to you?</p>
               <p>Carter. To sell, my Lord. He ask'd me 14 d. the Pound for it. I ask'd him what it was. He said it was the Head of a large Furnace. I ask'd him what he was, and he said, a Distiller. I said it was very odd, that you should be a Distiller, and ignorant what it was. My Lord, he told me that he liv'd at Henly upon Thames, that he was a Distiller, had come to Misfortunes, and must sell it. So when I question'd him about it, he said, if you don't like it, or don't think that I came honestly by it, I'll leave it, and go fetch a Person to my Character. With that I told him I would not have the Things left, without he said himself. At last, a Gentlewoman, a Widow of a Common-Council-Man of our Ward, who was some Relation to the Prisoner's Father, desir'd me not to charge an Officer with him. He equivocated in several Shapes. At last, he said, his Wife had bought these Things of a Woman that sold Rags and old Iron. Said I, what do you imagine your Wife might give for it? He insisted upon it, that she might give a Great 2 Pound. He told me his Father liv'd in St. Giles's, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260010"/> also his Brother. They directed me to the Prisoner's House, but his Wife deny'd him. I went in the Broad-Way, Westminster. I ask'd there, if there were not several Gentlemen that keep Distiller's Shops thereabouts. Pray do you know any one in particular, I said. They said, pray what is your Business? This Morning I stopp'd a Copper Funnel, which I imagine was some Gentleman's Property hereabouts, because the Person lives hereabouts that brought it. Upon this we went to a Person of the Business, Mr. Lowrey; and it appear'd that he was the Person that had lost the Funnel. Upon that we charg'd the Constable with the Prisoner. From that we went before the Justice and he was committed upon a Suspicion, because then Mr. Lowrey had not seen it. The next Day Mr. Lowrey came to me to see the Funnel, and swore it was his.</p>

               <p>Prisoner, This Man, when I came to bring the Funnel , stopp'd me: I emptied it out of my Sack, and they desir'd me to sit down by the Fire, and I sat down. They brought a parcel of People into the House, and stopp'd me and frighted me. They ask'd me whether I had any Money in my Pocket. But the Broker said, he would stop me with it, but not charge me with the Constable, and wanted me to run away. I sent to my Father to Broad St. Giles's ; and when my Brother came, he made him Pay 6 d. for sending his own Boy. The Broker told me I had a pretty deal of Impudence to ask 10 d. the Pound for it .</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner . I'll only mention this, that if this Man had been conscious he had committed the Felony, 'tis certain he might have made his Escape.</p>
               <p>Barthia Whitefield . I went to Mr. Wilson's, the Prisoner; he said to me, don't you never light on no Copper Pots, no distilling Things, I can see them lie about in Shops. The first Thing I ever took was two Funnels, and he bought them of me. About a Fortnight after, I took this large Funnel. I was in Company with him at the Time I took it. He said, the Shop is clear, you may now take it. He receiv'd it of me, and gave me 3 d. the Pound for it.</p>

The Evidence seems to lie pretty strong against Wilson. His having stolen the Goods in Possession, carrying them about in a suspicious Manner, as I find he was found in three different Stories, these are strong presumptive Evidences of Guilt. What he has to take off that Presumption was, that he was instrumental in apprehending of Barthia Whitefield; if you would make any Use of her Evidence, it must be taken together : That is, that she did steal it, but that Wilson was present at the Time that she took it.</p>

             Collection of Thoughts, Moral and Divine.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took them, how far did she go with them?</p>
               <p>Slater. She went away with a Purpose to carry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260013"/> them off, for she saw nobody there. I had that very Day lost another of these Books .</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the Stand was you?</p>
               <p>Slater. One or two Doors from it. She met me with the Book under her Cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Slater. My Lord, I stopp'd her. I charg'd her with having my Goods. She shuffled, and ask'd what I had to do with her. And I caught these two Books from her, and I got her into a House .</p>
               <p>Q. And what had she to say for herself?</p>
               <p>Slater. That she had done nothing amiss, and if she had, she desir'd to answer for it. And demalt I would not use her ill, and the like. She was very bold in her Expressions. I took her before the Justice; the Justice ask'd her if she had nothing else to live upon but this; she answer'd, she had two Children, and was oblig'd to follow this Employment to maintain them .</p>

            (to the Prisoner) Would you ask him any Questions? He says he saw you take these two Books from the Stand in Holborn. That he met you coming up towards him. He took them from you, and you confess'd you was forced to do so. Now make your Defence .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I was just going from the Stall and I saw a Gentleman with a Plaid Morning Gown; and I ask'd him where the Gentleman was that belong'd to the Books. I had one Book in one Hand and another in the other ; and had a Design to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you want to buy the se Books for?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. To read.</p>
               <p>The Court put the Prisoner to read Milton, but she did it but very indifferently. She said she was a poor Woman , and could read Welsh better than English.</p>

Says she, do you carry your Work home, and I'll go there and order a Steake, something hot for the Mouth, against Twelve o'Clock: I must be at the Inn at One: So I went and told another Person of it, and she had decoy'd her with the same Story. I went to ask if such a one was there; she said, she was not, but she was here last Night. I said, she has robb'd me of a Pair of Stockings and a Spoon. This Gentlewoman, that I went to, was sitting in a Room with her Mother. Says this Gentlewoman, she (the Prisoner) is just gone by the Door; I went after her, and said to her very softly, Come, let us go back and see Mrs. Perguson. When we came into the House, I was in a Passion: I clapt my Hands on each Side of her, and found the Stockings on one Side in her Pocket; I threw them down at the Feet of the Table, and she said, they were not mine. I said, they were mine, for they had a Darn in such a Place. Now, I said, give me my Spoon: She said, she had it not, and made many Wishes. I said, let me feel in your Breast, and I found it there.

               <p>North . I had been at an Acquaintance's House of mine , the other End of the Town. Coming home I was very late, between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>North. To the best of my Knowledge, Sunday Night last was three Weeks; this happen'd in <placeName id="t17460226-27-crimeloc94">Cheapside , near Bow Church</placeName>

She (the Prisoner) got up close by me, whereas my Pocket hung as it does now: Says I, good Woman, I don't know you. There were two Creatures together. She put her Hand into my Pocket and took out two Half Crowns, a new Six-pence and some Farthings, to the best of my Knowledge three Half-pence. When she took it out I felt her Hand in my Pocket, but I did not seize her immediately, because I could not see the Watchmen about. Thinks I, when I see a proper Watchman I'll charge you with it. There were three of the Creatures. When they came down Foster-Lane, says she (the Prisoner) I'll go Home this Way; says I, I can go Home this Way too. When I saw the Watchman upon the Stand I took immediately hold of her Arm; I said, you have robb'd me of such and such Money. When we came to the Watchman, as she is a common Creature that every one knows, I said, you robb'd me; she express'd herself in a Way I cannot express. I have a Husband, and I have got a Child almost nine Years old; I told her, I did not know what she meant by it; I don't desire, I said, any further Law; but I would have my own. Says the Constable, give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260018"/> this poor Woman her Money, if you have robb'd her; and if you insist upon it, good Woman, she must go to the Compter. Says I, she has robb'd me. When she came to the Compter Gate, oh! says she, I'll give twenty Half-Crowns, I'll give you your Money again to let me free. Please you , my Lord, we went to the Compter; when we went before the Alderman, oh, says he,

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have known the Witness these twenty Years; she has been try'd several Times here; she has stood in the Pillory three Times: My Lord, she charg'd another Woman with the Robbery as well as me. She ask'd me to go to drink with her. Enquire her Character. Coming down Honey-Lane Market, the Prosecutor standing by the Door, she ask'd me to go and drink with her; she insisted I should go and drink along with her. I follow'd down all Cheapside: As I came down there, there came along a Man with a Link in his Hand. The Prosecutor insisted I should drink with her, or else, she told me, it would be the worse for me. Says she, here is the Watchman, I'll charge you with stealing two Half-Crowns, and a new Sixpence, and three Halfpence. I said, You Watchman, see I throw nothing out of my Pocket. When I came into the Watch-house the Constable search'd, me and search'd the other young Woman. When we came in to the Watch-house, he says, What Rachel, the Jew , &amp;c.</p>

I was coming home to Crowder's-Well-Alley: As I was coming along, over-against Row-Church, I saw this Woman and the Prisoner at the Bar: So, says I, how do you do. I had known her by coming up and down the Street. Phillis, said I, how do you do; if you think proper to go my Way, you shall partake of the Light of my Link: With that, this Woman insisted upon the Prisoner at the Bar to drink; the Prisoner made Answer, she would not drink with her at all, she did not like her. The Prosecutor answer'd, If you won't drink with me it will be worse for you by and by. With that, I said to Phillis at the Bar, I can't stay, God bless you, I wish you good Night. In about two or three Days after she sent for me to Wood-Street Compter: That is all I know of it .</p>

My Master won't give me so much by 6 d. an Ounce as I cansell it to a Shopkeeper. I ask'd him where he liv'd and where his Master liv'd. I gave him 5 s. 5 d . an Ounce for the Silver.</p>

They told her she should not be hurt if she would tell the Truth. But at last she said, she knew the Girl that had took it away. Then they went to enquire after this Girl. She mention'd the Girl that was along with her at taking it away. The Girl that she said had taken it away, had not seen her that Day.

               <p>Prisoner. I had it in my Hand upon the Compter. She came up and said , what are you doing, you are about to put that up. No, says I, Ruth, I am not. Upon that I took the Stick I had there and went home. The Maid sent for me at Night. I did not know what it was for, I said, I would go. I have been up and down there these 20 Years.

               <p>Pearson. I lost a pair of Stockings about Two o'Clock, the 22d of February, from my Shop in Chiswell-Street .</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against either of the Prisoners ?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Please you, my Lord, two Women came to my Shop in order to buy Stockings, as they pretended .</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come together?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Pearson. They cheapen'd some Stockings. They wanted some green Stockings with red Clocks. They told me they wanted something more ordinary. My Servant brought some, but they would not give so much for them; A Person had been there before and gave but so much. My Wife, as they seem'd to be poor Girls, desir'd they might have them. The little Girl would not give so much as 22 d. for them, which was their own Price. I bid them get them gone, they did not come to buy. A Neighbour came to me, and said, please to examine your Stockings, whether you have not lost any. There were two Dozen upon the Compter. I examin'd the Stockings, and there were two pair gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the Women were gone?</p>
               <p>Pearson. About a Minute. Says this Man that stands here, if we go out, I believe we shall overtake them. When I overtook I laid hold of them, and said, go back to my House: With that the beggar-Woman took one of the Stockings and threw it over some Pallisades . So then I brought them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260024"/> my House. Presently after this came a Neighbour of mine and brought the other Stocking, that they had thrown within the Pallisades .</p>
               <p>Q. After this, what did you do farther?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Please you my Lord , I brought them to my House , and we thought it proper to have an Officer. They call'd me Rogue, and the like. Upon this we had them before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they deny it? As to these Stockings produced, these are odd Stockings; were they upon your Compter at that Time ?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Yes, please you my Lord, in Pairs, in 24 Pairs .</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect that particular Stocking you saw the little one throw away, are you sure it was one of them?</p>
               <p>Pearson. I did not take it off the Pallisades. This Man, the other Witness , took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Ting more to say?</p>
               <p>Pearson. I have nothing more to say.</p>

With that we came away, we had not gone above 20 Yards, but he came to us and said, we must go to his Shop, and have us before the Justice. He said , he had hang'd one, and he would do his Endeavour to hang us. When he follow'd us, he clapp'd me (Dawson) in particular on the Shoulder, with two pair of red Stockings; and said he had lost two pair of such.</p>

               <p>Irish. I liv'd at Kingsland, at one Mr. Butter's. On the 31st of July I was going to my Master's House. Going on an Errand, this young Man met me, and two more. Two held my Leggs, the other stopp'd my Mouth with his Hand. I was going for my Master's Cows when this young Man met me; I got from him, but he follow'd me and threw me into the Ditch .</p>
               <p>Q. How many in Company were there?</p>
               <p>Irish. Four. Two held my Legs, one stopp'd my Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do to you?</p>
               <p>Irish. The young Man the Prisoner lay with me.</p>
               <p>Court. I find you are a marry'd Woman, you understand what is meant by lying with you. Had he Knowledge of your Body, as your Husband has had ?</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he this Knowledge of you whilst these two People held your Legs and the other stopp'd your Mouth?</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. This you say was on the 31st of July last.</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How happen'd this Prosecution was not commenced before now?</p>
               <p>Irish. I could not find the Person out. When I went home to my Master and Mistress, I complain'd sadly that I had been us'd at this Rate.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you complain'd to your Master and Mistress at the same Time, the same Evening.</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was this?</p>
               <p>Irish. At Eleven o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Irish. By the Highway between Kingsland and Newington, the Corner of the Fields?</p>
               <p>Court. And was this about Eleven o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes, Sir, Eleven o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon the Prisoner at the Bar, was he one of the Persons?</p>
               <p>Irish. That was the young Man that lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Person near that knew any Thing of it?</p>
               <p>Irish. There was a young Woman in the Field, pretty near, that spoke to me about it three Weeks after .</p>
               <p>Court. You say this Woman in the Field told you of it three Weeks after; when did you come to know that the Prisoner at the Bar was concern'd in it?</p>
               <p>Irish. She told me she knew them all. This was Weeks after the Fact.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take up the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Irish. Lately.</p>
               <p>Q. How happen'd it you did not take him up before ?</p>
               <p>Irish. I had never a Friend to stir in it, to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Irish. At his own House in Old-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. This Woman told you three Weeks after the Fact was committed, that he liv'd with his Father, and that his Father was a Housekeeper in Old-Street. This Person that told you the Prisoner at the Bar was one of the Persons, could she tell you who the others were?</p>
               <p>Irish. She only knew the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. And this Relation you had three Weeks after the Fact.</p>

               <p>Irish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your Father never been about getting some Money of this Man to make it up?</p>
               <p>Irish. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What Highway was this; is it not a publick Road?</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. And if this Woman in the Field could see this Fact; if you had scream'd out, all these Pease-pickers must have heard you. What, none of these come to your Assistance? For these Pease-pickers were in Sight as well as this Woman. Did you tell any other Neighbour, or any other Person besides your Master and Mistress, of it? Were you got with Child by this Time?</p>
               <p>Irish. Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>And after the Prosecutor's Father came to my House, and ask'd what we intended to do. That Warrant we took out is not strong enough, but the second is. The Father did say he tore the first Warrant. I told the Justice it was not tore.</p>

               <p>Bennet. Please you, my Lord, I was call'd up by Mr. Byrne between Four and Five o'Clock; I went to assist him. He search'd the House, suspecting there might be more than this one that run away. Being dark, and raining very hard, he did not see who it was . In searching about the House, there lay Linnen out of the Box, in one Place and another , and a large Silver Spoon, &amp;c. With that my Man and another Man went to search the House.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Bennet. In looking out at the Window we saw his Hat, taking it up with a Pair of Tongs, it was half full of Water. Mrs. Byrne said, Here is the Thief's Hat. Mr. Byrne said, it was Tom's Hat; for he had chang'd, on Shrove-Tuesday , with a young Man at his House, who was then gone to Sea. Mr. Byrne said to me, Mr. Bennet , Will you go and drink a Draught of Purl at the Coach and Horses? When we went there the Prisoner was sitting without his Hat , and his Wig as wet as Dung. Then we charg'd him with the Money, and told him, it would be better for him to deliver the Money up again; which he did, throwing the Money down again, only the Half-Crown he had spent .</p>

            . Please you, my Lord, this Mr. Bennet call'd at my Window and said, I beg you would come down, Mr. Byrne's House is stripp'd. When I came in they shew'd me up into the Chamber, where the Cloaths lay about the Room. I and another surrounded the House for fear the Thief should get away, and not be catch'd. By the Hat we had a Suspicion of the Prisoner; otherwise none would have had a Suspicion of him, he behaving so well. I went to the Headborough, and he refus'd coming. We surrounded the House, and I said, We had better go to Justice Quarril. I went with Mr. Byrne to drink a Pint of Purl at the Coach and Horses; there the Prisoner at the Bar was without his Hat. Mr. Bennet said, We have got the Prisoner. We told him if he would deliver the Money up, we would be favourable to him. He said he had spent Half a Crown of it, and he laid down what remain'd.</p>

            . About Four o'Clock I heard a Noise in the Room; my Husband said he believ'd it was Rats; then we thought it might be our Dog: Says my Husband, The Rats may be nibbling at your Boxes; upon that I struck a Light, and while I was blowing the Tinder to light a Match, somebody run out of the Room; I scream'd out, and my Surprize was so great that I could not light the Candle: But we soon got up, and found the Door open, which I suppose he open'd to run out. When I came to search I found all my Linnen safe , but the Money that was in that Box. There were several particular Pieces: Two or three Pair of Mourning Buckles in that Box he took away; this Lid I found in the Chimney-Corner. To the best of my Remembrance, there were 18 s. in another Band-Box. In his Hurry, in taking these 17 or 18 s. he took up the Necklace with it. (The Necklace and Money were produced in Court.) He is a young Man I should have suspected the least of any body; he was a young Man that behav'd very well. The Ruin of this young Man was his keeping Company with a Whore. He said lately , Mrs. Byrne, I wish I had known your House some Months sooner.</p>

               <p>Abel. The 6th of December following.</p>
               <p>Q. What Goods did you lose?</p>
               <p>Abel. I lost a Silver Coffee-Pot, a Silver Bason, a Silver Boat, two Silver Spoons, and one Pair of Silver Tongs.</p>
               <p>Court. You lost them out of this House.</p>
               <p>Abel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon losing them, how came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Abel. Please you, my Lord, the Prisoner came to my House in the latter End of November: I keep a Tavern in St. Martin's Lane. She came with a Gentleman to my House; they had a Pot of Coffee instead of Wine; so I sent all these Things in. I had known the Person that was with her for 30 Years; and the Things came out again. On December the 6th the Prisoner afterwards came again.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day or Night?</p>
               <p>Abel. About Four o'Clock in the Afternoon: Says she, do you remember me; I answer'd, Yes. Pray, says the Prisoner, make me a Pot of Coffee: I love Coffee as well as the Gentleman, and the Gentleman is coming again to meet me: Accordingly, I sent the Things in, expecting this Gentleman to come. Upon that I sent the Coffee in, and some Time after my Man went in to see if she had done with the Coffee: She said the Gentleman was not come, and she would keep it hot. She call'd my Man to go for this Gentleman; and after she had sent him out, she call'd for the Maid and sent her out on an Errand too. I had been lame for some Time, and observing that, she took her Opportunity , and immediately went out with all this Plate .</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this Room ?</p>
               <p>Abel. 'Tis below Stairs ; it was a publick Drinking-Room .</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean publick for more Company than one ?</p>
               <p>Abel. No, my Lord .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her go away?</p>
               <p>Abel. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay for her Coffee?</p>
               <p>Abel. No, my Lord; she went away without being seen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she went did you miss the Things?</p>
               <p>Abel. Immediately , my Lord. My Servant, who went out on her Errand , came to give her Answer. When she went up into the Room, she said, Madam, the Plate is gone. Afterwards , I immediately sent to my Friend, and I sent and advertis'd that very Night. Upon that my Friend came and was vastly surpris'd. However, he gave me Directions to several Places, but I could not find her. At last, by advertising, she was taken .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she carry'd?</p>
               <p>Abel. To Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where and when did you see her?</p>
               <p>Abel. I saw her in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accuse her with these Things?</p>
               <p>Abel. Yes, my Lord: And she own'd them all; I have a Paper of them that she sign'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own the taking these Things before she writ the Paper, did she mention the several Particulars ?</p>
               <p>Abel. Yes, my Lord. She directed me to those People that have the Plate here.</p>

Mr. Gardiner recommended this Woman to me, said, here is some Silver a Gentlewoman in my Shop has to sell. I answer'd, I don't know how to buy it at present. I hear it is fallen. So Mr. Gardiner said, it was 5 s. 3 d. an Ounce, he had enquir'd; so I gave him that Money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner at the Bar; was she present?</p>
               <p>Hopmaster. No, my Lord, she was not. I know nothing of the Prisoner. I bought these Things of Mr. Gardiner. On a Saturday Evening, just as I was going out, the Prisoner at the Bar came, and said, did not you buy some Silver belonging to me, of Mr. Gardiner. I have a Lawyer I employ, I must give him some Money this Day. The Coffee-Pot I bought of the Prisoner, thro' Mr Gardiner's Recommendation. Mr. Gardiner call'd at my House afterwards, and ask'd if I had not bought the Coffee-Pot.</p>
               <p>Gardiner. Please you my Lord, the Prisoner at the Bar came to my Shop and ask'd for a Gentleman I knew nothing of. After she had sat some Time in the shop, she said, she was a very unhappy Lady. That she was an Heiress of 500 l. a Year, and that a Rogue was endeavouring to get her Estate. I said, Madam, if you please to come in, it is very cold. By the Subtlery of the Woman, she wrung Compassion from me and my Wife. Said, she lodg'd at Kensington. Next Day, she came with Kensington-Stage . She ask'd me to lend her Three-Pence. She laid a Shilling upon the Dresser, and gave Three-Pence to the Coachman. She came and turn'd herself round the Shop, and said, she wanted a pair of Scissars, which came to Nine-Pence, which, and the Three-Pence, made the Shilling, and said, I told you I am a very unhappy Lady. Do you know how Plate sells an Ounce. She pull'd out those Things that were before mention'd and desir'd me to sell them for her. said I, Madam, how can you repose such a Confidence in me? Do you know the Weight of them. No, I don't. Oh! Says she, I have had such a Character of you, I could trust you with 5000 l. And accordingly I went with the Plate, and sold it to Mr. Hopmaster. She told me she was a Relation of Sir

            , of Hertfordshire , who had left an only Daughter: But he knew of no such Person. She said she had an immense deal of Plate to sell, in order to defray her Expences in Law, Come says she, I love to be grateful. Madam, you say you are necessitous , I don't desire you to lay out any Thing with me. She look'd in my Glass, and fix'd her Eyes upon a Ring, and ask'd me the Price of it. Madam, I said, it cost me 18 s. and I never will sell it under. Says she, there is a Gentleman, one Mr. Ross, a Linnendraper, I purpose to buy this Ring, and make a Present of it to him. So she bought the Ring and away she went, and din'd with me the next Day. This Woman look'd reputable enough. On purpose to satisfy my Curiosity , to see if she had any more Family Plate. So on Saturday, while I was gone out, my Cousin told her I had sold it at Mr. Hopmaster's. So my Lord, I gave her an Invitation to come again and dine with me. And I din'd with her one Sunday at a reputable Distiller's, one Mr. Williams, and Ross gave her a good Character, and said she was a Lady of Fortune. Still I could not be easy, I thought it was an Oddity, that Sir Watkin's Butler, who had known the Family, could give no Account of her . So my Lord, on the Fast-Day at Night, Mr. Winsmore came to me, and said, pray don't you sell Case-Knives. He was about to keep a publick H ouse , they pretended to be Husband and Wife. The Prisoner at the Bar had told somebody that she had lodg'd and boarded at my House. After we had made an Agreement about the Knives, he wanted a Bed for his Wife. I said I had a Gentlewoman that lodg'd with my Cousin, and I told the Tale. Then Mr. Winsmore said, if you don't produce the Prisoner I will put you in Newgate. She has made an Elopement from Clerkenwell. There are five Guineas for taking her. Accordingly we call'd a Coach and we found her in Bed. Upon this she was retaken and carry'd to Clerkenwell Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your seeing her in Custody, was any Body sent to about the Plate?</p>
               <p>Gardiner. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her make any Confession about the Plate. All that you say is, that she deliver'd that Plate to you and desir'd you to sell it. And you sold it accordingly.</p>
               <p>Gardiner. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Council for the Crown. Gentlemen, The Prisoner at the Bar has pleaded that he is not Guilty: We , who are concern'd for his Majesty, shall call our Witnesses ; and if we prove to your Satisfaction , you'll please to find him Guilty.</p>
               <p>Another Council. I am Council of the same Side on the Behalf of the Crown, against the Prisoner . The Offence , you observe, he stands now indicted for, has been in some Measure open'd by the Gentleman before me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I believe it is pretty well known to you, that great Part of the Property of the Subjects of this Kingdom is in Government Paper-Securities. In order to secure that Property to the Subject, it is but necessary the severest Penalties should be inflicted upon those that should venture to alter those Securities . With Regard to this present Indictment it is laid different Ways . There are Charges upon the Prisoner at the Bar , that he in Fact did forge and alter this . It is likewise laid, that he did vend and sell the Ticket so alter'd and forg'd, as there are various Accounts in the Indictment. If we shall either shew to you that the Prisoner himself actually forg'd, or which is the same Thing, the same in its Consequences, he sold this Lottery Ticket knowing it to be counterfeit, the Offence will be the same . To prove that he actually forg'd this himself, it may be a difficult Matter, or to produce any Person that was present when he did. Gentlemen, you'll consider, that Forgeries are Works of a very dark Nature; but really the Evidence we shall lay before you, will amount , in my humble Apprehension, to a demonstrative Proof, that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person who was actually guilty of altering this Ticket himself. Tho' supposing it does not come up to that, our Evidences will shew, that he did actually sell this Ticket so alter'd , knowing it to be so forg'd. Gentlemen , I think in order to find the Prisoner Guilty, there will be three Things to prove to you: First, That this was a forg'd, alter'd, counterfeit Ticket. This is the first Fact I shall lay before you. The next Thing , in order to bring it home to the Prisoner at the Bar, will be to shew you, that this Ticket so altered, counterfeited and forged , was sold by him to a Person at Hazard's Lottery-Office . The Third, that he knew it to be counterfeited and alter'd; or, which will amount to the same Thing, that he actually forg'd it himself. Gentlemen, I believe I shall be able to prove all these Things to you strictly and demonstratively. Gentlemen, the Method in which I propose to lay this Evidence before you, will be in the first Place to shew you, that the Ticket is in Fact an alter'd, counterfeit, not a true Ticket. In order to shew that, it may be necessary to observe to you the Manner of making out these Lottery Tickets. 'Tis directed, that there shall be a Book made, and that in that Book there shall be three Columns. I shall first mention to you the Columns, then the Reason. The Act of Parliament directs, that the Book shall be divided into three Columns, the middle Column is to be the Ticket, which is to be sold and dispos'd off to the Proprietor of the Lottery. The outside is to be given to the Adventurer. The Ticket next to that goes into the Wheel, but between them there are Flourishes, and those Flourishes must exactly agree. Further, at the End of the other Ticket there is another Flourish, which, when the Party comes to the Government to receive the Prize, supposing it to be a Prize, 'tis check'd with a Flourish remaining upon the Back; and if it does not agree with it, 'tis clear 'tis a Forgery. I don't think the Wisdom of Man could have invented a greater Method of certain Security, than having these particular Flourishes, so divided by a Pair of Scissars. Then, Gentlemen, let us consider , whether this Ticket deserves the Name of a true genuine Ticket; or, whether it deserves the Name of a counterfeit or forged Ticket. Upon the Face of the Ticket itself, we shall produce the Purport to be of Number 19165; that Purport is upon the Face of it. But Gentlemen, we shall shew to you these Tickets, as sign'd by Mr. Hans, who is the proper Officer for signing Tickets. We shall shew you this Number 105 is not the Ticket it was at the Time it was made out, but it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260032"/> has been alter'd and counterfeited; and the Method is this; that it is not the Number 19105, but that it was a Ticket number'd 19165, so the Alteration that had been made in this Ticket, is by taking off the Top of the 6, the Bottom of the 6 remaining as a 0 , which will reduce the Number to 19105. To shew you this has been so, we have a Book from the Office here, and by comparing this Ticket with the Book of the Office, from which it was cut, do exactly tally ; the Flourish on this Ticket and the Flourish in the Lottery-Office Book do exactly tally with Number 19165. This proves that this Ticket must have borne Number 19165. To go further, that this could not be the original Ticket, the real Number of which was 19165; because comparing it with the Check of that Number, it entirely disagrees with it. This will plainly shew to you that this Ticket we now produce to you, is not the Ticket first deliver'd out. Gentlemen, there is likewise another Thing pretty plain here, that this could not be the original Ticket, because the Number 19105, it seems, the real Ticket, bearing Date 19105, has come to the Office to be claim'd, and that Ticket does exactly tally with its proper Number.</p>

               <p>The second Part will be more particular to your Consideration, which relates to the Prisoner at the Bar, that is, to bring home to him. The second Point will be to shew that the Prisoner at the Bar sold this very Ticket, now purporting to bear the Number 19, 105, and which will prove to you, that he sold the Ticket for 20 l. and it may not be improper to suggest to you the Reason the Person may have to alter the Number; 19, 165 was drawn a Blank, the Number 19, 105 was drawn a Prize, 20 l. If a Man by his Ingenuity, instead of being the Proprietor of a Blank, he was then entitled to a Prize of 20 l. We shall prove that the Prisoner brought this Ticket to Hazard's Lottery-Office as a Prize of 20 l. But, Gentlemen, there is a Step further we must go, and that is, to induce you to be of Opinion, that the Prisoner at the Bar, when he sold this Ticket, knew it not to be a real genuine Ticket; but that he either alter'd it himself with his own Hand, or he knew it to be alter'd by some other Person; and, Gentlemen, in Things of this Kind, as I mention'd before it, it is impossible to call any Person who was by at the Time of his forging of it. Would he call any Witness to see him perform it; nor after he had done it, would be in Prudence acquaint any Person that he had done it? Then how is it Persons are ever prov'd guilty of Facts of this Kind, but from Circumstances, if they are strong, clear and plain; such  will convince you that he did know? These are the Things that will be most proper for your Consideration; and, Gentlemen, we think we shall be able to do it.</p>
               <p>I would begin first with laying down one Fact. which shews , in my Opinion, the Wickedness of the Intention of the Prisoner at the Bar; that was this: This Ticket he bought at Wilson's Lottery-Office ; when he came there, he enquir'd for some Lottery Tickets to buy, and enquir'd for Numbers where there were either 6 or 9 in these Numbers: The People with regard to Chances might be superstitious; a plansible Reason he gives why he desir'd Numbers of 6 and 9, was that they were fortunate and lucky Numbers: Gentlemen, I am afraid it will be the Reverse to himself. Gentlemen, if you consider it, it is an easy Thing to take off 6 and make it an o. Thus the 6 and 9, by the Alteration of one of these Numbers, you have twenty-three Chances to one but it comes up a Prize; if you have the Number wherein there is a 6 and 9, keep it, see whether it comes up a Prize or not: If it comes up a Blank, if I will own this Number, in five Numbers suppose 6 and 9 to be among them, according to my Instruction you may have twenty-three Chances, in order to have a Chance of that's coming up a Prize; therefore he shews cum animo, that he applied at Wilson's Office to have a Ticket with a 6 and 9. As Matters of this Nature depend on Circumstances, we must lay all before you, and you must connect them all together. And after some Time that he had bought this Ticket , and it came up a Blank, he went and sold it for a Prize at Mr. Hazard's Lottery-Office. I believe it may be known to you to be pretty usual , when a Ticket is sold for a Prize, that the Owner of the Ticket, or the Person that sells the Ticket, is requir'd to indorse his Name on the Back of the Ticket; accordingly the Prisoner at the Bar was directed so to do when he sold this for a Prize of 20 l. Gentlemen, did he put his Name on the Back of it? No. What was the Name?

But, Gentlemen, you'll excuse me, however, from not relying singly on that Circumstance of his acknowledging alone ; though, to be sure, it is the strongest Evidence in the World; but to strengthen and corroborate that, we, on the Part of the Crown, think it our Duly to lay before you all the Circumstances. These are the Circumstances we must mention; we don't doubt , when we have laid these before you, but you will think this Ticket before you is forged and alter'd . Gentlemen, the bare selling a Ticket which has been alter'd, is of itself a pretty strong Suspicion upon the Party, at least it throws him upon this Proof. Any Man, indeed, may go into Change-Alley and buy a Ticket alter'd by another Person: But if one does do it, and goes to sell that again, it throws the Proof upon the Party to shew how he came by it. We can shew how this Gentleman came by this Ticket; that it was sold to him at Hazard's Lottery Office . That 19, 105 at Wilson's Lottery Office . As to 19, 105, that was never sold at that Office. So far the Council for the Crown.</p>

            (to Mr. Hand.) I think you are one of the Receivers, and appointed to sign the Lottery Tickets. Pray, Sir, look upon that Ticket; Did you sign that Ticket? Is that your Hand-writing ? Did you cut that Ticket out of the Book?</p>
               <p>Hand. No, I did not cut it, but I sign'd it.</p>
               <p>Council, to Mr. Hand. Where did you receive that Parchment?</p>
               <p>Hand. I receiv'd it from the Bank; this was sign'd by the Lords of the Treasury .</p>
               <p>Council, to Mr. Hand. When was it you wrote.</p>
               <p>Hand. The printed Part was all the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it separate, or in the Book?</p>
               <p>Hand. But five of them in a Leaf.</p>
               <p>Q. When you wrote it, it was then in a Book?</p>
               <p>Hand. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the Number, and write the Name so particularly ? Can you venture to swear that the Time you wrote your Name it bore the Number 19, 165 ?</p>
               <p>Hand. No, I do not particularly remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, I suppose you wrote them cursorily as they fall?</p>
               <p>Hand. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the Book deliver'd to, to sign?</p>
               <p>Hand. We take, perhaps, 10,000 at a Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible, in transcribing so many Numbers, that aMan may make aCypher, and forget to put a Top to it?</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Brother, I don't think that is a proper Question to be ask'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hand has prov'd that this was an undrawn Ticket of the last Lottery deliver'd out.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Jones, Secretary to the Managers of the Lottery . Produce the Book out of which it was cut. Are you sworn? What is that you have in your Hand?</p>
               <p>Jones. The Book that contains 100 Tickets for the Lottery.</p>
               <p>Council. Be so good as to put this Number to 19, 105, and tell me how it tallies. Does it tally with the Check or not?</p>
               <p>Jones. It does not.</p>
               <p>Council. Now turn it to 19165, tell me how it tallies with that.</p>
               <p>Jones. It tallies with 19165.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you concern'd in the Lottery? I desire to know what is your Opinion, whence that Ticket was cut: Was it cut from 19165?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes. Because the Check agrees to it exactly.</p>

            (to the Constable) What was you charg'd with the Prisoner for?</p>
               <p>Constable. I was charg'd with him for counterfeiting a Lottery-Ticket. The Time he was in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174602260035"/> Custody, he own'd that that was his Hand-Writing. That was all that I heard him say.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner . If your Lordship will favour me upon this Act of Parliament in Point of Law - Now my Brother says that he has done - And if he has done, I apprehend clearly upon the Construction of this Act of Parliament, that your Lordship must direct the Prisoner to be immediately acquitted. This Indictment consists of eight several Accounts. Notwithstanding the fair Admonition they had to put it in a proper Way, if they could have done it, they have, with great Submission to the Court, in Point of Law, fail'd. My Lord, it is a new Prosecution, and founded upon a new Act of Parliament. Nor would I be understood by any Thing that may drop from me, in the least to encourage or cotennances the smallest Attempt to impose upon the Publick. My Brother will own, that I did desire last Sessions that this young Gentleman might be continued, on the Account of their failing in their Indictment then. I apprehend the same Objection still remains that was then debated, to be essentially necessary to the contributing to this Crime, which seems now to be defective, both upon the Face of the Indictment, and Appearance of the Evidence, that stands upon it. In the first Place, upon the Face of the Indictment, it was clearly determin'd by the Court, and upon the b est Reasons, that they fail'd for want of laying it in the Indictment. That this must be to defraud some Person or another; because any person living might take it and cut it to Pieces, and make what Alteration in it he pleased, provided he did it without an Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever; and this very Statute and very Clause, that authorises this Prosecution, seems to vindicate this Thing, and quote a proper Method for a Determination of it. First, whether this is a real or proper Ticket or not. I must confess that the Evidence that is given, never desires to carry it any further than the Law will bear. Here has been a Ticket that does not tally with these Books. My Brother talk'd of producing the real and true, that purports the Number, which this is alter'd to, which was actually, and bona side , entitled to this Prize. If it did come up a Prize. He says he had it; he should have produced it. Now if he had the Ticket, and do not produce it, tho' he suggests there is such a Ticket, as that, they are bound on their Oaths not to believe it; whatsoever Alteration there is in this Ticket produced in Point of Law, whether by Design or Accident must be reckon'd a real Ticket, unless they could have prov'd that any Person did actually alter it. And it seems to be calculated, upon reading this whole Clause, that the Legislature has determin'd, before there shall be a criminal Prosecution, that there shall be a thorough Examination into the Matter; therefore, your Lordship will please to observe, how the Statute has determin'd this Thing. Here is a Dispute between the Number of two Tickets. If this Ticket has been alter'd from 19165 to 19105, the Contest must arise, who is entitled to the Prize of the real Number, or the Owner and Proprietor of this alter'd Ticket, that imports at present to bear this Number; therefore, they should have gone to the Commissioners and Managers to adjust this, before the Prosecution could have been set on Foot [some Clanses in the Act of Parliament were read]. Next Place it says, if any Dispute should arise - Here is a Contention and a Dispute; the Contention is, whether this Number now importing 19105, which they say is alter'd; or whether the Ticket 19165 is the real Benefit Ticket. This must invariably be, I apprehend in Point of Reason and Point of Law, between the Proprietor of the real Ticket and the Owner of this Ticket.</p>
