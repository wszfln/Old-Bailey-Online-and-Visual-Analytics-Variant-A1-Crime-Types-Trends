I am thirteen years old—I live with my father and mother in Little Saffron-hill—on Tuesday, 2d February, I went to Bald-win's-gardens that morning—I saw the prisoner Ford there, and Casseldine was with him—I knew Ford before—it was between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning—they were just by the top of Leather-lane—Casseldine said, "They are going to get me a pair of boots, will you come?"—I said "Yes"—I went with them down Field-lane, Casseldine there went into a place—she came back, and we went into Seven-dials—the boots were bought at a place down some steps—we went back to Baldwin's-gardens—I went into a public-house kept by Hatton—I went into the skittle-ground alone—that was in the morning—after I had been in there, Ford and Casseldine came in—we all three remained there till between 5 and 6 o'clock—Walsh came into the skittle-ground between 5 and 6 o'clock—Walsh said, "Come on;" and we all four went out and went down a court in Holborn—(I saw Hatton before we left—he did not say anything to us)—after we were in Holborn, we went up to a street where there is a crockery-ware shop at the corner—we went down there into Fleet-street—when we were there Casseldine met a gentle<lb/>man,</p>

               <p>and I lost sight of her—she came back to us, and Walsh and Ford said, "We will go <hi rend="italic">Stop butting"</hi>—that means taking silk handkerchiefs out of gentlemen's pockets—we walked on together to a shop by Temple-bar, where there are some fountains playing—we stopped at that shop, and I saw Ford take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket—he gave it to Cassel<lb/>dine—she was near the arch when he took it—I and Walsh were standing at the shop-after Ford had given the handkerchief to Casseldine, he said to her and Walsh, "He has got a purse"—Ford then went back to the same gentleman that he took the handkerchief from, put his hand in his coat tail pocket, and took out a pocket-book, and gave it to Walsh—I should know the gentleman again—I saw him before the Magistrate—it was Mr. Beddoe—we then all went up a street over the road, and there Walsh opened the pocket-book—before he opened it he had given it to Casseldine—when Walsh opened the pocket-book he took out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "Here is a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, here is the water-mark"—he put it back into the pocket-book, and we all four went back to Baldwin's-place—we afterwards went back to Hatton's public-house—it was then between 8 and 9 o'clock, perhaps not so late as that—it was between 7 and 9—we went to the skittle-ground at the back of the house—I saw Hatton—he was in the bar—when we got to the skittle-ground the pot-boy was there, and some other boy—Ford and Walsh took the papers out of the pocket-book, and they both threw them down the water-closet in the skittle-ground—a big boy burnt some of them over the gas—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was given to Casseldine—she went with it to Hatton—Ford and Walsh and I went with her—Casseldine carried the note in her pocket—she left us and went to Hatton at the bar—I saw her go—she and Hatton then came to the foot of the stairs—Hatton had the note in his hand—and after they had been there a little time Hatton and Casseldine and Ford and Walsh all went up-stairs—I did not go up—Walsh and Ford told the big boy who had burnt some of the papers over the gas not to let me come up-stairs—they were up-stairs about half-an-hour—and then Walsh, Ford, and Casseldine, came down together—I did not see Mr. Hatton—Casseldine offered me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Ford took it from her and gave it to me—when Casseldine came down, she said the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was not a good one, she had only got 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—she said she had given the pocket-book and the stamps to Hatton (I had seen some stamps in it before that)—after the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given to me, we all left, and Walsh and Ford, Casseldine and I; went to the play—the boy whom I had seen at Hatton's went with us—after we came out of the theatre Walsh left us, and Ford and Casseldine took me to a lodging-house—I did not go home—the next morning I went to Baldwin's-gardens—I saw Ford and Casseldine—I went home in the evening—I made a statement to my mother—my father took me the same evening to the police-station—I told the police-constable some of the papers were thrown down the water-closet—I saw them there the next morning when I went to Hatton's with Ford and Casseldine—I saw some papers down the water close t—I can't tell what sort of papers they were—they were written on.</p>

               <p>and my husband took them up stairs—after a time Tones came down again and asked for a pint of porter, and walked up stairs with it—about ten minutes after they both came down and went out of the door—Jones went out first and held the door open with his right hand for the other to pass out—his left hand was in his pocket After they had gone I ran up stairs and the balls were gone—there were nine of them—they were ivory, and are valued at 18".—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—can swear to three of them—Mr. Hill knows the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Steptoe—on the evening of 17th January, I saw both the prisoners at our house—I saw them playing at bagatelle in the tap room—there is a parlour at the back of the house, where there is another bagatelle board—I went into that room about 10 minutes past 12—the balls were all safe then—I was the last person in the parlour, and put out the gas—about five minutes after I heard the parlour door slam—my master sent me to see who was there; in con<lb/>sequence of that I opened the door, and looked all round the room, but could see nobody—directly afterwards I heard the door slam again—I went and took two lucifers from the bar to light the gas, and I met Hill coming out—I said, "Hallo"—he said, "All right, I have only been to the closet"—he was then buttoning up part of his trowsers—he came from the direc<lb/>tion of the bagatelle room, where the balls were—the next morning the balls were missing.</p>

I keep a general shop at Mark's-place, Fulham-road—on 27th January I came home about 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming out of my shop—I went in my shop, and my wife showed me a half-crown which was bad—I called the prisoner back, and told her it was a bad half-crown—she said, "Is it? I will leave the things, and call for them presently"—the goods came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and my wife gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she left the goods and the change—I gave her the half-crown, and let her go—I followed her till I met a policeman, and gave her in custody—the half-crown I had given her back was found in her hand—I had noticed a mark which my wife had made on it with her teeth, before the prisoner left the shop—the prisoner was taken to the station, but I did not press the charge, and she was allowed to go. This is the half-crown—here is the mark made on it by my wife's teeth.</p>

               <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD CHIEF BARON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">after the reading of three affidavits in mitigation of punishment) pronounced the judgment of the Court as follows:—"You have been convicted of a fraudulent breach of trust, contrary to the 5th and 6th Vic e 30, and you have now to receive the judgment of the Court; and to me it it a most painful duty to pass upon persons who have filled the respectable stations in life that you have, the judgment of a Court of criminal jurisprudence. At the trial, the guilt of each of you was abundantly made out by the evidence. Upon your part a statement was produced, made before a Commissioner of Bankruptcy, in which that guilt was distinctly avowed; but it was produced by your Counsel for the purpose of claiming an exemption from prosecution and punishment, by reason of the statement that you then made. The point was reserved for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and sentence was respited for that purpose. The case was argued in the course of last term, and the Judges, differing in opinion with respect to your right to the exemption claimed, by a majority of nine to five, affirmed the proceedings in this Court, the majority thinking that you were not entitled by reason of what passed before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy, to any exemption from punishment. I think it is proper that the public at large and that you should understand what was the difference of opinion among the Judges. There was no doubt at all amongst them that you had violated the law; they were all of opinion that you had been guilty of a dishonest breach of trust; the only difference of opinion was whether you were entitled to the benefit of a clause which said, that if a person who had been guilty of these acts disclosed the transaction before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy, he should not be liable to indictment unless he had been already in<lb/>dicted. The majority of the Judges thought that 'disclosure' meant the com<lb/>munication of something that had not been publicly and generally known be<lb/>fore; and that when you had been before a Magistrate, and the whole matter had been sifted and made public, and when you had already been committed to take your trial for the offence, it was too late then to consider any communication before the Commissioner as 'a disclosure' of that which was then publicly known to every person in any way connected with the transaction. The minority of the Judges were of opinion undoubtedly that the object of the statute was to give the creditors the fullest possible benefit of any communication made before the Com<lb/>missioner and that the object of the exemption from punishment was with a view to favour the pecuniary interests of thorn who were prosecuting the commission on the fiat in bankruptcy; the majority of the Judges, on the other hand, held that the legislature did not intend to postpone the public interests and the pun<lb/>ishment of the criminal, and that the clause was framed to guard against any person in your situation from being injured, by such a statement being used in the course of a prosecution, either directly or indirectly; but there was certainly no doubt whatever in the minds of any of the Judges, as probably there cannot be in the mind of any honest person, that you had been guilty of the breach of trust and fraud with which you were charged. It is a mistake to suppose that you are indicted for the purpose of procuring restitution to the prosecutor of his bill of lading, or that your having restored it by means of your friends hat done anything towards satisfying public Justice; and it is a mistake even to suppose that because you may have had no intention to defraud the prosecutor, you are there<lb/>fore free from the violation of the law. "The learned Judge, after commenting upon the various matters alluded to in the affidavits, proceeded to past a sentence of Twelve Months' Imprisonment.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post-office—On 22d February I received instructions to send a letter to the Post-office in the Borough—I made up a test-letter—I put in it a half-sovereign, two shil<lb/>lings, and five postage stamps—I marked them all—I put the whole of the coins in a slip card, secured with a piece of paper—I put them all in the letter—the half-sovereign was fastened, so as to prevent its slipping out of the letter—I sealed the letter with black—it was directed to Mary Johnson, Dartford, Kent—I gave the letter to Mr. Clare, and instructed him to post it at the South Eastern District Office in the Borough—if it were posted there before 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it ought to have arrived at the General Post-office about 35 minutes past 4—when the bag arrived that ought to have had that letter, I examined it to see if that letter addressed to Dart-ford was there, and it was not there—the next bag arrived about 35 minutes past 5—I examined that also, and the letter was not there—finding that the letter had not come, I went to the district office in the Borough, in company with Mr. Clare and an officer of the name of Smee, about half-past 6 o'clock—when I got there the prisoner was brought into a private room where I way, and I told him I wished to make inquiries respecting a letter addressed to Dartford—I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said he did not—I then asked him if he had any money in his pockets—he admitted that he had, and I then directed Smee, the constable, to search him, and from one of his pockets Smee took some silver, and from another pocket the half-sovereign which I had enclosed in the letter—I told the prisoner that that half-sovereign had been enclosed in the letter that I was inquiring for, and I asked him where he got it—he said, "I brought it from home"—I said, "When?"—he said, "This morning"—I said, "It was in the letter about 4 o'clock this afternoon"—he said, "Indeed, Sir"—this is the half-sovereign—while I was still at the post-office the letter was shown me—this is it.</p>

Den and Co., of 146, Cheapside—Mr. Charles Weatherley, one of the partners, occupies the house—in February last, about half-past 7 in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the top of the kitchen stairs with a bundle under his arm, done up in a pocket handkerchief—(the kitchen is on the first floor)—I caught hold of him, and said, "What do you do here?"—he replied in a foreign language which I could not understand, dropped the bundle and ran away—I followed him into Wood-street—a man stopped him, and a policeman took</p>

I am a grocer, of 51, Seymour-place—on Sunday, 6th February, my house was closed at night in the usual way—I retired to bed at twenty minutes past eleven, having seen all safe at eleven—I was dis<lb/>turbed at night by my wife, who threw the window open, and called out "Police!" and "Thieves!"—I went down stairs and found seven canisters of tea removed from their places in the shop—five were put on the counter, and two on the floor—I found a square of glass cut out of the kitchen win<lb/>dow, and another square cut out of the outer door leading into the kitchen, through which, if a hand had been put, the bolt was within reach—I found</p>

I am a daughter of the last witness—I was disturbed from my sleep on 7th February between twelve and one o'clock by footsteps going from the first floor down stain, and saw the shade of a light go out—I went into my father's room, and a man rose from the bottom of the bed, and rushed by me—I said something to my mother, and she threw up the window, and called "Thieves!" and "Police!"—I could not see the man's face, as I had no light—I went down into the drawing-room, and missed half a dozen tea-spoons, a silver fruit knife, and some silver decanter labels—the plate basket had been removed from the cupboard—a cash box con<lb/>taining 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was taken from my mother's bedroom—the place was in confusion.</p>

On 17th December, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Church-street, Greenwich, and saw the prisoners come out of the Mitre—I had watched Lovell in, and then I saw Winckels and Ellis come out first, and Lovell afterwards—Winckels and Ellis were walking arm in arm, and Lovell was on the opposite side of the road—I saw Winckels and Ellis go into Mr. Kershaw's shop in London-street, while Lovell stood in the street, looking to and fro—they came out and went into Mr. Wilson's shop, another draper's—Lovell was standing in the same place and walked over and talked with them all the way to Deptford; about half a mile—Ellis then let go of his arm, and Winckels and Ellis went into the prosecutor's shop—Lovell walked a little way ahead, and stood about 10 yards off on the kerb, looking sometimes right up and down, sometimes towards the shop, and sometimes away from it—when Winckels and Ellis came out, he joined and spoke to them, and they went into the Centurion public-house—I was in a shop opposite—How and Dubois joined me, and we went into the Centurion and saw the prisoners sitting in three chairs, with some beer in a glass—Ellis was between the other two—I asked them if they had any objection to be searched—Lovell said, "No; I have no objection"—I asked him to stand up, unbuttoned his coat, and found this handkerchief in his coat pocket, not the one he had bought—I asked him how he accounted for it—he said, "I found it just now in the street"—I took him in custody, and Winckels asked me what I was taking him for—I said, "For robbing people"—he rushed at me, caught me by the throat, and we were fighting for a quarter of an hour—How laid hold of him, and I laid hold of Lovell—the woman escaped, and I fell over the table—Lovell ran to get the poker and I got How's umbrella—he struck us, knocked the corner of a chair with the poker, and said that he would knock our brains out—Winckels said, "I have something in my pocket, too, if you do not let us go"—I saw this bundle of 44 handkerchiefs and 7 scarfs on the chair where Lovell was sitting—the woman was brought back.</p>

I am a butcher of Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 1st February, I had a quantity of meat in my slaughter-house, which was fastened in the usual way with bolts and a chain—on the following morning I found an entrance had been made, and part of a bullock had been taken away, and some salt beef, about thirty or forty pounds in all—it was worth about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the entrance had been made by getting into a neighbouring yard, and over a shed into my yard, and Into the slaughter-house—there is no door to the slaughter-house inside—that was the way they got in, and they let themselves out at the back door—they would have to unbolt it and to undo the chain—the salt beef was on the tub the previous night, and the fresh beef they took from a carcase which was hanging up.</p>

Horsley was up in the van—I called out, "Will you stop, please, while I get further away, as there is not sufficient room;" in a loud voice—Horsley could hear me—no answer was</p>

               <p>made, but they kept coming on—I told him to stop, but Heath kept telling me to go on, and kept whipping the horses on—I went as fast as I could to get out of the way—I was between the two handles of the truck, as if they were shafts—the fore wheel of the wagon crushed the truck and turned it round, and then the child fell over underneath the barrow—the hind wheel went completely over the truck and crushed the child, and I fell down in the mud—I saw the hind wheel go over it—the wagon went on and some-body stopped the men—there is a foot pavement there—I was not two inches from the kerb stone.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at the model lodging-houses, Vauxhall-wharf—I was at the spot when the fore wheel of the wagon caught the barrow, and the hind wheel went over it, capsized the child, and jammed it between the barrow and the wagon—the wagon went on till it was detained by the owner of the barrow—I heard nothing said before the accident by anybody; but after it was over, Horsley, who was in the wagon, said to Heath, "Go on"—Horsley came down from the wagon after it had been stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at West Hill, Wands-worth—at the end of last December I was engaged to go to Mr. Mellor's house of a morning to assist in the house work—the prisoner at that time was his only servant—there was another servant who had left for a holiday—I used to go about seven o'clock, and stayed till ten—Mr. Mellor was in the habit of letting me in each morning—on 28th December I went there about seven o'clock—Mr. Mellor let me in, he was quite dressed—and I went and lighted the kitchen fire—while I was there the prisoner came down—she complained of being unwell, and had a glass of brandy—she said nothing at that time about any fire having occurred—about a quarter to eight I went up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom on the first floor to make his bed—there was no fire in the grate—in making the bed there was not the slightest appearance of any fire having taken place—I turned over the pil<lb/>lows and sheets and mattress; there was no bed—I went down to the kitchen again a little after eight—there was no fire or candle in the bed-room then—I did not leave any in the room—I had no candle—Mr. Mellor was then having his breakfast in the parlour—about nine o'clock I was sweeping in Annie's (the prisoner's) bedroom—that is very near Mr. Mellor's bedroom, not on the same floor—it was not her proper bedroom—not the bedroom in which she had been sleeping—it is one at the back of the house, about six steps below Mr. Mellor's—at that time she was occupying a room on the same floor as Mr. Mellor—whilst I was sweeping in that bedroom the prisoner came to me and said, "Come, Amelia, and see where this smoke comes from"—I went with her into Mr. Mellor's bedroom—she was a few steps in front of me—when I went into the room the pillow was blazing on the bed, and a flannel at the side of it that I had left there when I made the bed, folded in a square, and Mr. Mellor's night-cap—the flannel was not burning, but the squares were singed as it lay folded in about six—the nightcap was quite burnt to tinder—as far as I can remember the flannel was in the same position in which I had placed it when I made the bed—Mr. Mellor always had a small flannel laid on the bed at night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280062"/>
               <p>he mostly laid it there himself—water was thrown over the pillow to put out the fire—Annie took the jug from the bason, and I took it from her hand and succeeded in extinguishing the fire—I took the pillow up into the attic and put it on the floor in the middle of the room—at the time I was sweeping out the room Mr. Mellor was in the parlour—I had cleared away his breakfast things, and taken them into the kitchen—he was down in the kitchen nearly the whole of the time—I did not perceive him go upstairs—at the time I put the pillow on the attic floor it was very much saturated with water—it had soaked through the pillow, and wetted my arm as I was carrying it up—there was no fire in the pillow at that time, it was quite put out—the prisoner said that Mr. Mellor must have taken the flannel down-stairs and dried it, and taken it upstairs again on fire—after cleaning up the room, I made the prisoner's bed—that is in the best bedroom, opposite Mr. Mellor's room, not the room that I had been sweeping out before—I then went across to my own house—nearly an hour afterwards the prisoner came across and told my mother to tell me to come over again—I went over with her—she was rather in front of me—I asked my father to come too—when I got to the house, the prisoner said that the fire was blazing in the same place—I went into the yard and fetched a pail of water, and went up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom—I found the pillow that was at the head of the bed, moved to the foot, quite to the opposite corner—the bedclothes both upper and under were all removed back quite to the foot of the bed, and the mattress was quite bare, and was burning at the corner-the fire was not from underneath, it was only the top of the mattress—there was something on the other pillow, I am not sure what it was, it might have been another nightcap placed there—it was completely burnt to tinder—the second pillow was blazing at the foot—that pillow was on the top of the other clothes—my father wrapped the pillow in a sheet of another bed which stood in the room, and I carried it down stairs into the back yard—the fire was all put out with the pail of water that I took up—I threw it on the bed—while I was down-stairs Annie came and said there was a fire in the garret—Mr. Mellor was out nearly the whole of the morning—he went out just before I came home, and he was about ten yards before me when I came across: he was a little way down the hill going away from the house—he was back again a very few minutes after I went into the house—he was away about an hour—he came in five or ten minutes after I came in the second time—when my father came in he left the door open for Mr. Mellor, as he saw him coming—it was some time afterwards, about twelve o'clock, that Annie called my attention to the fire in the garret—she took me and my father up—I found the pillow which I had placed on the floor, on the drawers—the first fire was about nine o'clock, and it was a little after ten when I went back the second time—the alarm of fire in the garret was about twelve—between ten and twelve we cleared up the mattress, and the tinder that had been made in the bed, folded up the clothes that had been brought down stairs, and then I had to clean Mr. Mellor's room over—it had been made very wet from the water that was thrown about—my father took the carpets out on the lawn and brushed them—this took up nearly the whole of the time—the prisoner was helping us—Mr. Mellor went out again after he came in—he went out twice that morning—after we had cleaned up we had lunch in the kitchen—the prisoner was not with us all the time—she was up and down stands doing the different things she had to do about the house—it was about twelve when I went up with my father and the prisoner to the garret—I found the pillow on the top of a chest of drawers with some green glazed lining which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280063"/>
               <p>was partly in the top small drawer and partly lying on the pillow—Mr. Mellor was down stairs when the alarm of fire in the attic was given—part of the lining was blazing in the drawer—my father folded the pillow together, and told Annie to go and fetch Mr. Mellor, and show him where it was—she went and fetched him, and he could scarcely get into the room for the smoke—his cough seized him—my father folded the pillow together, and gave it into my hand—I took it down stairs, and he took down the drawer—I put the fire out by folding the pillow together, and when we got down stairs we put the things under the tap—the drawer was burnt—my father scraped a hole with a penny piece—it was charred very much—I can't say whether that drawer was open or closed when I put the pillow in the attic in the morning—I remained in the house after this until after one o'clock, clearing up and doing one thing and another—Mr. Mellor was in the parlour nearly the whole of the time—he came up stalls once or twice—he came into the garret, and in coming down from the garret he told my father he would have all the things out of the bedroom—the prisoner was there the whole of the time—Mr. Mellor directed the things to be taken out of his room, and that was done—the prisoner assisted in taking them out—there were sheets, blankets, and the counterpane—they were brought down stairs—at that time there was not the slightest appearance of fire or smoke any-where about that room—after that was done I went back to my father's house about one o'clock—I had not been home five or ten minutes before I observed flames in Mr. Mellor's bedroom—it was about half-an-hour before I went home that we had taken the sheets and blankets out of Mr. Mellor's room, but I had been in the room after that just before I came home, and at that time there was no appearance of smoke or fire—the room was nicely drying up where it had been cleaned, and there was not the slightest sign of fire—Mr. Mellor was then in the parlour, just going to have his dinner—upon seeing the flames in the bedroom I went back to the house—I saw a young man go over first—I called my father's attention to it—some of the neighbours had seen it, and went over too—on going into the room I found the fire was behind the door—I scarcely saw the fire on that occa<lb/>sion—there were two gentlemen in the room—I fetched water to extinguish it—on going into the room afterwards, I found that Mr. Mellor's dressing-gown was burnt—it was lying in the wet behind the door, and the door was very much burnt—the dressing-gown had been hanging there all the morning—I had seen it several times during the morning—at the time I found it burnt, there were no sheets on the bed, they had been all taken down before—the mattress was there—there were no curtains to the bed—the dressing-gown was, I should think, a yard and a half from the foot of the bed—by the aid of the water, the fire against the door was put out—I remained in the room, and cleared it all up again—I did not come away again until the house was all in flames—I remained in that room, I should think, about a quarter of an hour—while I was at work in that room, I saw the prisoner come upstairs—she held her dress up in her hand, and went into the best bedroom, the one she had been occupying—there is a passage which separates that room from Mr. Mellor's—I can't say how wide the passage is—it is a good sized passage, sufficiently wide for two flights of stairs, one to go up, and the other leading to the garret—the door of that room had been wide open the whole of the time that I saw it that morning—when the prisoner went into the room she shut the door after her—she remained there about seven or eight minutes—I saw her come out, she shut the door after her, and went down stairs—at that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280064"/>
               <p>my father was on the landing cleaning—I was just inside the door, and he was sweeping the dirt that had been congregated together on the land<lb/>ing—I faced my father's back and Annie's face when she came out—I had been into the best bedroom several times that morning—I think I went in just before Mr. Chidley and Mr. Meyers went in—that was after the dressing-gown fire—I merely went in with the others to see that all was safe—Chidley and Meyers went in to see that there were no signs of fire there, and I went in to look—that is the last time I remember being in the room—when the prisoner came out of the room she went down stairs—I followed her in a few minutes down to the kitchen—I found her sitting in a chair—I asked her how she felt—she rose up from the chair, and said, "Oh, very bad"—I went into the yard after that—I was not absent a minute, I only went to get a clean pail of water—when I came back, the prisoner had gone part of the way up the kitchen stairs, and at that time my father came down, and told her that the house was on fire, and nothing could save it—I believe the words he used were, "My God, Annie, you have set that room on fire"—she made him no answer—she stood with her hands so, and looked at him, but did not say a word—she stood with her hands as though she was very ill, or something particular was the matter with her—Mr. Mellor was at this time sitting in the parlour, with his shoes off, warming his feet by the fire—I can't say how long he had been sitting in that way—I saw him some little time before in that same posi<lb/>tion—he was up stairs at the time of the dressing-gown fire—he was back-wards and forwards—he was in his room once, I know—I am not aware whether he went into the best bedroom or not—it was a long time before I saw the prisoner go into the room, that I saw Mr. Mellor—I can't say whether he went into the room with Chidley and Meyers, I don't think he did—he was up stairs at that time—he did not go up stairs after that—Annie had had a glass of brandy the first thing in the morning, and some porter was had about twelve, or a little after, with our lunch—after father went, the prisoner had some raw gin, and she gave me some gin and water—I have known the prisoner ever since she has lived with Mr. Mellor—I think that is three years come July—I don't think she was quite sober on this occasion, in fact, I am sure she was not—I think she was sober when I first went—I noticed she was not so towards eleven or twelve—I think she was slightly intoxicated when she came over for me a little after ten—I did net see anything more of the fire, only as I came out, I saw the flames coming out of the window, and I was too terrified to stay any longer.</p>

               <p>him in the High-street, Wandsworth, between the first and second time of my going to the house—I am not aware that I said he was in the house all the morning, except that one occasion—Mr. Mellor is a very old gentleman, between 85 and 86—he is rather eccentric and queer in his ways—when I first saw the prisoner, and she complained of being unwell, I believed she was poorly, as women are—she seemed to be in great pain, and she took a little brandy to relieve it—I should not have known anything about the first or second fires, except for the prisoner's calling my attention to them—she assisted as far as she could in putting out all the fires—on the last occasion, she was very much excited—when my father said the house was on fire, she appeared paralysed; I can't say what with—she wrung her hands—she had a very large quantity of clothes, and very good—I believe Mr. Mellor was in the habit of airing his flannels—I am not aware that I ever saw him do it—I have seen him air his towels, in fact, he would frequently wash them himself, bring them to the parlour fire, and dry them—I have seen them scorched—I have never seen one on fire—I had not been into the parlour and seen Mr. Mellor there just before the last fire—they were preparing for dinner, he had not dined—I can't say how long before I had seen him there with his shoes off—I do not think it was so long as half an hour—that would be the extent—I am aware that he was in the parlour, but I had not been in—the parlour-'door was wide open, and one could see him in passing—I did see him in the parlour not a quarter of an hour before the fire—I am not aware whether he was insured or not—I have heard since that he was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, West Hill, Wandsworth—the last witness is my daughter—I remember her being called from my house by the prisoner about 10 o'clock on the morning of 28th December—I went over to the house five or ten minutes afterwards—the prisoner was standing at the door—she said nothing to me—I said to her, "Don't shut the door, Annie; Mr. Mellor is just here"—I saw him in the street—it appeared as if he were coming up the street—I went direct up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom—I found that the mattress had been on fire—water had been thrown over the mattress when I got there—the fire was out except a little at the pillow at the bottom of the bed, the other things were stripped off—I took the pillow and wrapped a sheet round it, and it was carried down-stairs to the yard—I afterwards returned to Mr. Mellor's room—I did not minutely examine behind the wardrobe and such places, but I looked at the bedstead and the fire-place—there was not the slightest appearance of fire or anything burning—we took the carpets, and such like, down stairs, by the direction of Mr. Mellor—he came up stairs while we were in the room—he had his hat and stick—we did not take the sheets down then—we then had luncheon down in the kitchen—while we were at luncheon, I</p>

               <p>do not know whether the prisoner was up stairs in the bedroom or in the parlour with Mr. Mellor—she left the kitchen a portion of the time—the laundress' daughter came in while I was there—the prisoner came down and said there was a strong smell of fire upstairs again, would we come up stairs and see—she came down the kitchen-stairs—I do not know whether she came from Mr. Mellor's room or the bedroom—I went up to the garret with the prisoner and my daughter, and found a pillow on a chest of drawers, also some glazed stuff on the top of it, on fire—the glaze was also burning in the drawer—I told the prisoner to ask Mr. Mellor to come up stairs and see it, and she did so—she went down a flight of stairs, and I believe Mr. Mellor was coming up—he was very quickly up in the garret—I believe, at the time I went up to the garret, Mr. Mellor was in the parlour, but I can't say for certain that he was—I saw him on the top of the landing—I wished him to come into the room to see the fire, but he could not come in, owing to the smoke from the calico—the drawer and the pillow were taken down into the back yard—I took the drawer up stairs again, after making a hole in it with a penny-piece, and was about to place it in the drawers again, but Mr. Mellor objected, and I put it down by the wash-stand—I then came down stairs again and finished my lunch, and stopped in the kitchen, and did one thing and another, some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—afterwards, by Mr. Mellor's request, I went to his bed-room and took the sheets and blankets and counterpane into some glass-house at the back of the house—the pillow had been removed before—at that time Mr. Mellor and me, the prisoner and my daughter, went through the six rooms of the house, that is, the garret, the two bedrooms, and the two parlours, and there was not a vestige of fire in any room except the fire in the parlour grate and in the kitchen—this might have been from ten minutes to a quarter to 1—after I had done that, I went over to my own house to my dinner—whilst we were having our dinner, there was a knock<lb/>ing at the door, and an alarm of fire—I went across with Mr. Meyers and Mr. Chidley, two neighbours—they were before me, and just as I went into Mr. Mellor's room, Mr. Chidley threw a jug of water on the embers of the dressing-gown, which was hanging behind the door—the dressing-gown had been burnt to tinder, and the door was charred and burning—Mr. Meyer, who is a builder, took a rule out of his pocket and took the charred wood off with it—we then moved every portable article out of the room down-stairs into the kitchen and back premises—I took the two mattresses right out on the lawn—I returned with my daughter, and another person named Aiger, clearing up on the first floor—I was cleaning on the landing—whilst I was there, I saw the prisoner come up stairs, and go into the room she had been sleeping in—she shut the door after her—she was there, probably, six, seven, eight or ten minutes, not exceeding ten minutes at the most—I then saw her come out again and go down stairs—I had been into that room once before, that was when I examined the house with Mr. Mellor, the prisoner, and my daughter, not afterwards—I saw Mr. Meyers and Mr. Chidley go into the room after the dressing-gown fire—that was, I dare say, a quarter of an hour before I saw the prisoner go in—I did not see Mr. Mellor up stairs again at all after Chidley and Meyers went in there—when the prisoner came out of the bedroom, she closed the door after her and went down stairs direct—she passed close by me as I was sweeping on the landing—the next thing I perceived was smoke coming into Mr. Mellor's bedroom over the door—I was then in Mr. Mellor's bedroom—that was, at the most, not more than ten minutes after the prisoner had gone down-stairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280067"/>
               <p>I should say some minute or two under that—no one had come up stairs during that ten minutes except my daughter with a pail of water for my use and her own—I had not gone more than a foot or two into Mr. Mellor's room from the landing and the door was open—upon seeing the smoke, I asked Aiger where it came from—he said he could not tell—I looked about for some minute or so—I took a chair and pulled down the paper of the room over the door, thinking it might come from there, but it did not—I then got down from the chair, and when I got within about four steps of the best bedroom door, I smelt fire very strong—I opened the door, and the flames then rushed oat upon me—they appeared to come round the doorway—the door opens on to the bedstead, and the flames seemed to come round from behind the door, as if the bed or the bed-clothes were on fire on that side—I immediately ran down stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the kitchen-stairs, and said, "My God, Annie, you have set light" or "fire to that room"—she never made any reply—she stood there—I immediately ran up to the door—there was a great rush and noise at the door—Mr. Meyers was the first person I saw in the house—there were several near him—I don't think they rushed quite up stairs, they might have done—I did not go up to the room again—I only assisted then in taking the things out of the house—the fire spread very rapidly indeed—the house was completely burnt—we had no assistance of water—the inside of the house was what is commonly called "gutted"—when I opened the door, I did not see how much of the room appeared to be on fire, I did not stop long enough—I had not presence of mind to shut the door, I was too much excited, seeing the fire—the door of that room had been open all the morning to the best of my knowledge, except when the prisoner went in and shut it—I can't say where Mr. Mellor was after the dressing-gown fire—I believe he was somewhere down stairs—he never came upstairs to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been on the landing when you saw the prisoner go into the room the last time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know that I was directly on the landing when she did go in, I might be just against the door—the best bedroom and Mr. Mellor's are on the same floor, and the windows look the same way—they are separated by the passage, and the stairs leading to the garret—the staircase is in the middle of the house—I dare say it was three-quarters of an hour before I saw the prisoner go into the room and shut the door that Mr. Mellor went in with me and my daughter and the prisoner—it must have been more than half an hour, because I had been down stairs and had my luncheon, and been home—it was not intended that I should come and do anything at the house that day—I stopped to clean up, partly by speaking to the prisoner and my daughter, and Mr. Mellor asked me to remove the carpets and things—it was partly at the prisoner's suggestion that I staid and cleaned up—it was not Mr. Mellor who came while I was having my luncheon, and said there was a smell of fire—when I did go up I did not find Mr. Mellor on the landing, he was coming up the stairs—I went into the garret—when I came out again I saw Mr. Mellor—there are two rooms on that floor—when I said to the prisoner, "You have set fire to that room" she appeared to be as it were motionless. I called it "paralysed" in the depositions—I have not been reading over the depositions—I recollect the observation—she did appear to be paralysed—I do not know that she fetched me water on more than one occasion—I don't recollect seeing her bring water on any occasion—she did all she could to assist in putting the fire out in the room—I did not see that she was either pleased or displeased when it was put out.</p>

I am a tailor at Wimbledon—my parents live at Wandsworth—I was there on 28th December—about 1 o'clock my attention was called to a fire on the first floor at Mr. Mellor's—I went to the door, the prisoner opened it—I asked her whether she was aware that the house was on fire—she said, "Fire! no"—I cannot exactly say the state she was in, she seemed very excited—that was after I told her the house was on fire—I went up stairs to the door of the room that I had seen on fire—I tried to get into the room, but I found the flames were so fierce I could not—they were close to the door—I went down and met Mr. Meyers—I went for the engine, and when I came back the fire had broken out in the other room on the same floor—I assisted in getting the goods out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at West Hill, Wandsworth—on 28th December, about 1 o'clock, I heard an alarm of fire at Mr. Mellor's—the door was open, and Mr. Mellor was at the door—I went up to the bedroom on the first-floor—I believe Linfield was coming down the stairs as I went up—I found a dressing-gown on fire behind the door—I threw a jug of water over it—Mr. Meyers came up directly afterwards—I left word for all the furniture to be carried out of the room down to the garden; I did not see it done—before I left I went into the best bedroom, the two sitting-rooms, and the kitchen—there was not the slightest appearance of fire in the best bedroom—I don't remember that anybody else went into that room with me—I believe Mr. Mellor was up there, but I don't remember seeing him in the best bedroom—I then left the house, and in about twenty minutes or half an hour I heard an alarm of fire again—I then saw flames coming out of the best bedroom—I did not go into the house then—I saw I could do no good there—I had some conversation with the prisoner in the kitchen after I had extinguished the dressing-gown fire,—I said, "It is a strange thing these fires"—(I had then heard that there had been other fires that day)—she said that Mr. Mellor was a very old and infirm man, and obliged to put things between his legs—she pointed to a flannel, and said, he would hang them before the fire to dry them, and she supposed they had caught fire, and he had taken them up stairs and thrown them on the bed, and set the bed on fire—the prisoner was very much excited; but I could not say what it proceeded from—I had not known her before—I could not say whether she was in liquor.</p>

I am a builder at Wandsworth, and a neighbour of Mr. Mellor's—on 28th December, about 1 o'clock, I was alarmed by a cry of fire at Mr. Mellor's—I went up stairs to the bedroom—I did not see the dressing-gown on fire—after the fire I looked round the room and took a rule from my pocket and scraped the panels of the door—something had been burning over the small cabinet close to the door, between the door and the wardrobe—I examined the wardrobe—at that time I ascertained that the fire was completely extinguished in that room—I and Mr. Chidley walked across the landing and went into the best bedroom—there was no appear<lb/>ance of fire there whatever Mr. Mellor was not in that room with me—I don't know where he was, I did not see him after he left the room that was first on fire—he was in that room, his own bedroom, but not when I got there—he came in with the prisoner—that was about five minutes to 1, while I was about putting out the fire—after I had been into the best bedroom I went down stairs to the parlour—I don't think Mr. Mellor was there—I think I saw</p>

               <p>him in the kitchen as Chidley and I were going through—I then went home—my house is next door—about twenty minutes afterwards I heard the alarm of fire again—I went into the house—I passed Mr. Mellor at the front door—I went up to the door of the room—the door was ajar—the place was full of smoke—I was obliged to stoop to see the flames—the top of the bed was on fire, and the foot-board of the bedstead was then lighting—there was no fire underneath the bed—it was flaming over the bed—it appeared to me that it was the bed itself that was on fire—I called for a pail of water—I do not know who brought it—I threw it on the fire, and the flames spread all over me, and all over the room, and rose higher a great deal than they did before—I have seen turpentine on fire, and it appeared to me to be a similar thing—I left the room, for the flames spread all over me and encompassed me, my whiskers and my hand were burnt—I said there was no alternative but the engine—the place was all a body of flame, and I went out of the house—I have seen turpentine on fire in a pot—I have seen the effect of throwing water over it—it will not quench it—it will augment the flame and cause it to rise—if bedding is on fire and water is thrown over it in my opinion it would smother it—if the fire had been nothing but the bed consuming, the water I threw on it would certainly put it out, unless there had been something combustible—the water did not quench it, but the flames came higher in the room and spread all over me—there was not sufficient water to diminish the fire—I could not procure water—the fire did not diminish in consequence of the water being thrown—Mr. Mellor had not come up stairs while I was at the door—I left the house directly.</p>

I had a house at Wandsworth, where these fires took place—I am eighty-five years of age—the prisoner has been in my service about two years—I believe the house was insured, my furniture was not—the first I saw or heard of a fire, on 28th December, was early in the morn<lb/>ing—I have generally been a very early riser; and as I stood by my bed-side, I thought I saw something of smoke or fire issuing from the pillow on the bed—I took up the pillow and turned it over, and underneath it there was a very small portion of fire, not more than the end of my finger, still there was fire; and in consequence I finished my dressing, and went down as early as I could into the parlour—I did not see that anything had been burnt—the fire was under the pillow—I was not in the habit of being called in the morning—I get up between 6 and 7—I have no fire in my bedroom, nor any light—I was nearly dressed when I saw this little bit of fire—I had not used any lucifer matches that morning—I do not sleep with my door locked—the prisoner was generally down in the morning before me—I don't think she had been into my room that morning before I went down—I don't remem<lb/>ber whether I let the witness Louisa Cotterell in that morning, my memory is very fallacious, and hardly to be depended upon now—I don't recollect whether I said anything to her about seeing fire in my room that morning—I came down about 7 o'clock and went into my parlour, where there was a fire made for me—I could not charge my memory how long I remained there—I staid there till I had had breakfast, and I was there when I heard there was a fire up stairs in my bedroom—that was about 9 o'clock—I had not gone out then—I had not gone up stairs before I heard of the fire—I went up stairs when they told me that there was something carried up into the garret, and I found that a pillow had been taken up into the garret, and was placed on a mahogany chest of drawers—that was the first time I went up stairs after I had come down in the morning—I think Mr. Cotterell was up stairs when I went, but I cannot charge my memory—I desired that everything which appeared to have any fire about it should be removed and carried into the yard—I don't recollect where I went to after that—I re<lb/>member hearing of another fire in my room, when the dressing-gown was burnt—I had seen the dressing-gown hanging on the door of my bedroom, and when it took fire they brought water and threw it on the door and dressing-gown, to put it out—I did not see it take fire—I can't say whether I had been into my bedroom before that, since I left it in the morning—I recollect persons coming and putting out the fire—there is another bed-room opposite mine, called the best bedroom—I did not go into that room</p>

               <p>that I know of after the dressing-gown had been on fire—I had been in there in the course of the morning several times, from the circumstance of talking about fire—at the time I was there there was no appearance of fire—the bedstead in that room was what they call an Arabian bedstead—I don't remember how long it was before the fire in that room that I had been there—I don't remember how the fires proceeded at all—I paid no more attention to it, only giving directions that everything should be done to extinguish fire wherever it might be found—I did not carry any fire about with me that morning—nothing of the kind—a great deal has been said about my carrying fire about—I have been obliged, from my infirmities, to wear a small piece of flannel, a towel, or something of that kind, next my person, that generally became wet, and I have taken it to the fire to dry; but that is a mere bagatelle—I never set fire to any of these flannels or towels—I cannot say whether I dried any on the morning of the 26th—I frequently dried them—no flannels or towels caught fire that morning, I am quite certain of that—I don't remember taking any towel or flannel up stairs that morning after drying it—when I did take them up I used to ibid them up and put them in a drawer—I used to dry them by the parlour fire, and leave them folded up there until I went up stairs—I never took any of them up into the garret—since the fire I have missed a great variety of things—I have had a large family, eleven children, sons and daughters—most of them are married; and I think I have twenty-eight or twenty-nine grand-children, and I have been in the habit of purchasing them trinkets, such as gold watches, gold chains, gold rings, and such like, to a considerable amount—I have distributed most of them, but 1 had several in my possession at the time of the fire—I used to keep some of them in a table drawer in the parl<lb/>our—that table was not saved from the fire, it was consumed and all its contents—I used to keep a part of the things in my bedroom, in a cupboard of the wardrobe, by the side of my bed, and all that was left there was con<lb/>sumed by the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you saw a fire in the morning when you got up, while you were dressing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had no light in the room that morning, I am quite sure of that; nothing but the light of day—it was approaching 7 o'clock, and there was sufficient light to see—I generally burn a rushlight at night, which I put into a large washing-basin—I assure you there was no light in the room while I was dressing—I had been dressing for a very few minutes before I discovered the little bit of fire behind my pillow, it may have been half a dozen minutes—I never was very particular in regard to dress, and no man ever dressed quicker—I keep a box of little wax lights in the room on the chimney-piece—I sometimes use them, not very often—I have not the least recollection of the prisoner being in the room that morning before I found the fire—I say she was not—I called to her to come and put out the little bit of fire, and she did—my sight is very indifferent now, I have been blind with my left eye for a great number of years—I may have scorched the towels and flannels while airing them, but have never set fire to them—I don't know that I was frequently in the best bed room that morning—I had no occasion to go there—I did go—I can't say that I went several times—perhaps I might go more than once—I will not say whether I did or not—I went into all the rooms, hearing them talk of fire, it made me anxious to know all about it—the prisoner has been with me nearly two years—I had the greatest confidence in her—I never knew her to do a single thing to my prejudice or with any motive of deceiving or taking things improperly—I have now the highest opinion of her—I should hesitate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280072"/>
               <p>now about giving her a character, but if these circumstances had not occurred I should have given her as good a character as could be given to a servant; as far as my own knowledge goes I would give her that character now, but from circumstances since this, and from things that have been said I should rather hesitate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you have expressed a very strong opinion that she never set the place on tire at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that I never could suppose it, and I feel now that she was incapable of doing so bad a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think so now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think now of her that she is incapable of doing anything of the kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you called to the prisoner when you saw this speck of fire on the pillow in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; to come and extinguish it—I think she came and brought some water, but I won't charge ray memory with that, it is too fallacious—I think she threw some water on the bed—I don't recollect that she said anything to me about fire being there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had been sleeping there all night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was the only person who slept in that room—nobody had been in in the morning—I had got no fire—I cannot account for how it caught fire—I am entirely ignorant of the origin of the fire—I have not the least conception of how it could occur—I might have been in the best bedroom several times that day—I think I always went in by myself, not with Chidley or Meyers—I think perhaps I might go in with Mr. Meyers, but I am not quite certain—it was a considerable time before the last fire that I was in there: more than half an hour, perhaps an hour—I do not recollect what I had been doing—I had nothing at all to do—I might be walking about the house, or about the garden—when I did go into the best bedroom I did not take any candle in my hand, nor any match, or fire, or anything of the sort, I am quite sure—I hare not the least idea in the world that I caused the fire by any accident—I am rather particular in regard to fire, and I always direct my servants to be very cautious and careful about fire—I cannot account for how it happened the least in the world—I had a good many trinkets and things—I never missed any of them till after the fire, then I lost them all—according to my belief, they were all safe up to the time of the fire—I had seen them several times in the day—I saw them the day before perhaps—I saw them most days—I did not see them on the morning of the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I went with Payne to assist at the fire—I found Mr. Mellor in the parlour when I went in—afterwards I saw him endeavouring to go up stairs, I pulled him out of the house—I had some difficulty in getting him from the house—there was a good deal of furniture taken from the house, I think most of it was saved from the parlour, but I do not know—I assisted in taking it out—I don't think anything was burnt in either of the parlours, but I do not know—I saw the prisoner a short time after the fire—she was not sober then—I saw her during the fire, she was not sober at that time—I was with Payne when she was taken into custody—I took her to Payne's house—I said to her, "It is very curious how these places should come on fire, how was it?"—she said, "When I first saw it, Mr. Mellor's night-cap was on fire on the pillow, and the next time I saw it, it was in one of the drawers in the bedroom"—I said, "Was that drawer open?"—she said, "Yes, about that much," which I understood to be about an inch—I said, "It is very curious how a fire should be in the drawer"—she made no reply, and said nothing more about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think she said not only the night-cap was on fire, but also a piece of flannel was on the pillow the first time. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think she</p>

               <p>did—Mr. Mellor did not appear at all rational: in my opinion he did not know at all what he was about, he wanted to go up stain in the flames to get his shoes—the prisoner appeared excited—I had known her before to speak to her, she was sensible—I judged her to be intoxicated by her appearance, and when I was taking her she staggered against me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I think it was almost impossible for any person to have gone into the room between the time of the prisoner coming out and my smelling the fire—I don't think there could have been a possibility of it, without my seeing them—I was on the landing, or just inside Mr. Mellor's door, 'with the door open—I was in and out of the room—I was never away from the landing from the time the prisoner went into the room, but once, and that was to take the things down into the glass-house—that was while she was in the room—I came up again and then I saw her come out—I was sweeping on the landing when she came out, and shut the door—after that I went into Mr. Mellor's room again and assisted in removing one thing and another from the room, and then I saw the smoke—I don't think it possible for any person to have gone into the room without my seeing them; I may be mistaken—Mr. Mellor could not have come up and down stairs in that time—he would not have been able to do so without my seeing him—the only persons in the house were my daughter, myself, Mr. Aiger, Mr. Mellor and the prisoner: Chidley and Meyers had gone.</p>
