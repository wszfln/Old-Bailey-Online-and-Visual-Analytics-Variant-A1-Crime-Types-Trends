               <p>Q. How long did he live with you. - A I went out of town on the 27th of May; on the 29th I was called to town, upon intimation that he had left my service.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into your service was any part of your plate under his care. - A. It was particularly under his care, all the articles in the indictment; so much so that a few days after he came into my service he desired to have a list given him of the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any silver spoons delivered to him. - A. Yes, about a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Any desert spoons. - A. Yes, about a dozen or eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Any silver sauce ladle. - A. Yes, and a soup ladle; the tankard was not delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. A silver wine strainer, - A. Yes, and he had six silver forks in his custody, and a silver fish slice, and four silver sauce spoons, a silver skewer, and a small silver cup.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you went out of town had you seen them. - A. I had seen them all on the Monday, and part of them I saw on the Tuesday; I went out of town on the Wednesday morning. The silver tankard I had seen on the Monday in the stand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to town, upon information that you received, was this plate or any part of it gone. - A. It was all gone that is in the indictment, and the prisoner had left my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the plate kept by him. - A. It was kept in a cupboard which belonged to him exclusively, in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of town did you leave the prisoner in your service. - A. I did; when I returned he was gone, and the plate was gone. I returned on Saturday the 29th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 29th of May were you informed of the prisoner. - A. On the Tuesday following, I saw him at Horsemonger-lane; in consequence of a letter I received, I went and saw him.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with him about this transaction. - A. I had a good deal of conversation with him there about this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing to you relative to this did you tell him it would be better for him to confess. - A. No; he told me if I would not hurt him he would make my loss good; I told him whether he made my loss good or not, I should prosecute him most severely; I said that over and over again to the prisoner in the jail. He told me that he had been instigated to rob me by

He then told me that he had taken the plate to Thompson's house, and that Thompson had got two jews to purchase it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what plate he took from your house. - A. When he made his confession before the magistrate, he particularised every thing. At the time I had the conversation with him, he said only generally the plate. In consequence of that information I went to Union Hall, and got an officer, and went to Thompson's house on Tuesday morning after I had been with the prisoner.

             in the house, I asked him if his name was Thompson, he said yes. After some conversation about a horse, that has nothing to do with this prosecution, I asked him if he had any transaction with a gentleman's servant with regard to plate; he said that a hundred gentlemen's servants came to his house, but that he had no transaction of that kind. I then asked him if he knew of any gentleman's servant of the name of Dench; he said he knew no such person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him so distinctly that he knew the name of the person you mentioned. - A. He answered distinctly that he knew no such person. The officers then proceeded to search him; in one of his coat pockets they found five tea spoons, which I have no doubt are mine. I then told him that we had been directed to his house by Singleton; he then broke out in a passion, and said, as the rascal has betrayed poor Thompson, I will now tell the whole truth of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after the spoons were taken out of his pocket. - A. Yes, after taking the spoons out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess. - A. Oh no, certainly not. He then said that Singleton brought the plate to him, and that he advised him to take it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the name of Singleton or Dench. - A. I cannot say, I used the name of Dench first, but I used both the names after; the officers then proceeded to search his wife and the house; I do not think that we went into any further particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a crest on the plate that you lost. - A. There was a shell-drake with a shell in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any crest on the plate that was taken out of his pocket - A. Yes; on one or two of the spoons (the spoons produced).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010004"/> Q. Are these the spoons that were found in his pocket. - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the fellow to them. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark, independent of your crest, by which you know them. - A. There is the mark of the broad arrow, which I understand is the polisher's mark, which is upon all the five that were found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you observe any of the crest upon all of them. - A. Upon two the shell-drake is quite distinct.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of their being your property. - A. Not the smallest.</p>
               <p>Q. About what is the value of this plate that was taken from you to sell. - A. Between twenty and thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cloth - A. I have since seen the rest of the cloths, which correspond with it; my servant knows it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long did this person live with you. - A. From the 13th of May till the 27th, I went out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you with a good character, I presume. - A. I took him with a good character from major - , as to honesty and sobriety.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the complete controul of the plate. - A. Yes, of all that is in the list.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he might take it at different times, as he had the controul of it; it is impossible for you to say whether they were taken at one time or no. - A. I know that they were there on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether some part of the plate was taken at one part of the day, and some at the other, it is impossible for you to say. - A. Certainly; I cannot say, I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing observed respecting this man's conduct and behaviour while he was with you. - A. No, he seemed very desirous to do his duty, I must confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Any appearance of derangement in him. - A. No, he was rather a stupid man, and a heavy appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it occurred to you at any time to suppose him at all deranged. - A. O no, clearly not deranged; I thought him a stupid fellow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. What is the value of the tankard. - A. Five pounds; I think it is worth that to sell for old silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of its being worth forty shillings. - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Q. On Thursday the 28th of May last, what time did he go out on that morning. - A. At half past eleven o'clock, and returned about ten minutes before four.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the plate kept. - A. In a closet in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of it. - A. Yes, my mistress gave him a list of it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the course of that morning seen any of the plate. - A. Yes, I saw a quantity of plate in the tin tray, and the silver tankard lay before it on the table; I saw it several times in the day, because he left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the latest time that you saw it. - A. At three o'clock the tin tray appeared to be as full of plate as ever it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in about ten minutes before four, where did he go to. - A. When he came I opened the door and let him in; he asked me if he had been wanted during his absence; I told him he had been wanted, he said he could not help it. I left him in the back kitchen, where the plate was; I went to the front kitchen; I had not been many minutes there before I heard a loud noise, as if it was the sound of glass; there was a great quantity of glass in the cupboard where the plate stood; I went into the kitchen to him, he was standing before the cupboard, with the door open where the plate and the glass were kept. I asked him what he had been smashing, he said nothing; I then returned into the front kitchen, I was there two or three minutes, I went into the back kitchen again; he was standing in the same situation wish his arm projected out. I went into the front kitchen, and in two or three minutes he followed me; he took a mahogany knife tray out of the closet in the kitchen, and went up stairs into the parlour; he put his knife tray down in the parlour, very loud; I heard it. I heard him walking over the passage; he went out and slammed the street door to very loud. I saw the top of his head and shoulders as he was crossing the street.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the day was this. - A. Just after four o'clock. About six in the evening I went to the cupboard where the plate was kept, to006. for my mistress, the other servant being out; I missed the whole of the plate; I went there to get the tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. From three o'clock to the time that you missed it, was any other person there but the prisoner. A. No one; I was there the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any cloth that was found. - A. Yes. (the cloth produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any cloth missing. - A. Yes, on the 28th of May when the plate was missing; it is a linen cloth, there was a dozen glass clothes, half a dozen of one sort and half a dozen of another, put into the drawer a little before he came in; they were perfectly clean when I missed the plate. It is dirty now.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Thompson, did you see him about the house at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court What servants were in the house besides you and the prisoner. - A. Two nursery maids and the house maid; they were all up stairs at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody had come in the street door in the mean time had they. - A. No person but our own family.</p>

            ; written before us, T. Evance, and W. Holland.)</p>
               <p>The examinant saith that his real name is William Singleton, but he having deserted from the ninth regiment of light dragoons, he has since gone by the name of Dench; that about five or six weeks ago he went into the service of Mr. Rawlinson, with whom he continued till Thursday evening last, the 28th of May, when he left the service without giving any intimation of so doing; and took away the several articles of plate, a silver tankard, a silver stand, eight silver table spoons, a silver skewer, six silver forks, nine silver tea spoons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010005"/> two silver salt spoons, all of which he wrapped up in a cloth, now produced by the constable, and after leaving his master's house, he went to Thompson an hair dresser, with whom he had been acquainted for some time; that he asked Thompson what he should do with the plate, and whether he should not take it back again; Thompson said by no means take it back, if you do it will hang you; that he put the whole of the plate in a basket, and went out with it, and returned and said that he had seen a jew, and directed him, the examinant, to go with him to a clothes shop, where the examinant saw the jew, who looked at the plate, said it was worth two guineas; examinant said he would not take two guineas, he would have eight; the jew gave two guineas and a half, which he took. When Thompson brought the plate back the examinant looked at the plate to see if it was all there; that there was another jew present who did not take any part in the business, except lending the money; that Thompson returned from the jew, and told him he had sold the plate for two guineas and a half; that having his master's clothes on, he said I can put you in a way to get other clothes, you must go on the road; that same evening he bought a pistol, and on Sunday afternoon Thompson hired a horse for the examinant; he rid over Kew bridge, he met a man, examinant stopped him, and robbed him of his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Lloyd) Did you go to the house of Thompson. - A I did, I saw him in his house in Barlow-street, Marybone; he keeps a hair dresser's shop. Mr. Rawlinson went in first and we followed; Mr. Rawlinson asked him if he knew a gentleman's servant; he described the clothes that he wore, he said he did not; he asked him if he knew a person of the name of Dench, he denied any knowledge at all of that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any search warrant. - A. Collingburn had the search warrant. I asked Thompson myself generally whether he had any transaction with any gentleman's servant about any plate, he said he had not; I desired my brother officer to shew the search warrant, then I proceeded to search Thompson, in his left hand coat pocket I found wrapped up in paper these five tea spoons (producing them); I observed the crest rubbed out; I asked him how that came, and what he would say to having these in his pocket; he said as the damned villain has betrayed poor Thompson, I will tell all I know about it. I then asked him how the crest became obliterated, he said they were in the same manner then as when the young fellow had left them with him; he said he had left the spoons with him for five shillings that he owed him for dressing and shaving him. He begged to tell all he knew. I told him it was useless, the young man was in custody; upon a duplicate being found by my brother officer in his wife's pocket, he said that he had no more transaction with the young man; he had lent him a basket; that he had no transaction with the plate; the spoons and the duplicate of the ladle were all that he had, they were left him for five shillings. (The spoons produced)</p>
               <p>Q. What are these spoons worth, are they worth three or four shillings. - A. They are worth a great deal more than that, there are five of them. On that day we took Thompson and his wife in custody, his wife directed us to go back to the house, and we should find the cloth; we found it on the ground in the middle of the room; she said that was the cloth that he brought the plate to their house in.</p>

               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Look at that ladle, is that yours. - A. I have lost two ladles precisely like this, but the crest is obliterated.</p>

               <p>Singleton left his defence to his counsel called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I will speak the truth and nothing but the truth. He came to my shop on Friday the 29th of May, between twelve and one at noon; I had not seen him then for better than five weeks; I have cut his hair but four times; when he came in the shop, I sat the chair for him, he said he did not want any thing, he only wanted to speak to me; I went out with him; going along he asked me if I had any money in my pocket, I said, I have six-pence, that will do he says; we went into a public house, he said he had some plate, he opened it, I would not look at it; when I went out of the public house, he followed me into my shop. I was sent for to a gentleman, when I returned I found he had opened the plate to my wife, and Mrs. Mesbin; I saw the plate was broke and disfigured: he wanted me to go to a jew and sell the plate; I would not go, nor would I pawn it; I told him the pawnbroker knew me very well, and would not take it in. After that I met a jew passing my shop, I told him there was a gentleman's servant had got some plate, he said he would buy it. Then he wanted me to go to speak to the jew or my wife; my wife would not, nor would I; then he took it himself. These five tea spoons in the flurry he was in were put on the bureau; the plate he took out in my basket, and sold to a jew for two guineas, and he left the spoons.</p>

She had lived in the room, but she had left it in January. I found my coat laying by the side of her on the stairs, she said it belonged to her. I went up to Mr. Ray, and had her taken in custody.

               <p>Q. Was any thing deposited in your custody by him. A. A box of plate in the year 1800; that was in my custody during the time the prisoner lived in my house. There was a silver tea-pot and other silver articles in the box; my daughter had the key, and I had the box. About nine o'clock one morning in April or May 1802, the prisoner came down; I was in the act of shaving myself, he looked about the room, the cupboard door happened to be open, he saw the box of plate, he asked what it was, he took it down and shook it; I told him to put it back again, and I might tell him it was Mr. Harris's plate. that he had left it under my care while he was gone to the West Indies; I then was sent for into the shop by my young man: it might be ten minutes before I returned again. The prisoner had then taken the box of plate up stairs into his own room. I went up stairs immediately to him, I asked him what he meaned by taking the box; I saw the box in his apartment, it was open, and the plate was on the table. He told me he would put the plate in the box again directly and bring me the box down stairs. I was sent for again into my shop, a person wanted to see me in a hurry; I returned in about five or ten minutes up stairs. The prisoner and the box of plate was gone. After diner I saw the prisoner; I asked him about the plate, he said, my good man, you shall have it in the evening, I was very much distressed about it, he tried to pacify me, but he never brought it; I made frequent applications to him about it; he always refused to communicate where it was. The prisoner at this time kept a carriage. I was not in a very good state of health at the time he lived in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after this - A. One morning after this he asked me to go with him in his carriage; I went with him to a Mr. Hill, that lives in a lane in Fenchurch-street; the prisoner went into Mr. Hill's; I remained in the carriage alone; he returned to me, he ordered the man to drive to Westminster; when we came to Westminster the coach stopped, he got out of the carriage; I thought he went into the hall, it was some time before he returned; when he returned a man came with him; I asked the man who he was, he told me he was a tipstaff, and that I was his prisoner; I said, your prisoner, for what? I never did any body wrong in my life; says he, that does not signify, be quiet. I said I did not know how to be quiet; Andrews said, my good man be quiet, every thing shall be settled in a little time; well then, says I, I will go with you. I did not know where I was going to. I was left in the King's bench, distressed enough, nobody then knew where I was but Andrews himself and the tipstaff; I was very ill a long while in the King's bench, which brought on me an epilepsy. During the time I was in the King's bench Mrs. Andrews called on me once. I was discharged from the King's bench in 1804, under the insolvent act. About a year after I was discharged I met Mr. Andrews near the Buffalo tavern, Bloomsbury-square; he was talking to a gentleman whom I did not know. I waited till he had done with the gentleman, and then I said how have you done this long while; he asked me to walk into a public-house, I refused. I lived then in Middle Row place.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not return to the same house that you had left. - A. No, I did not return to Harpur-street, that house was let, and all the goods were gone. I walked with the prisoner after I had met him at the Buffalo's head, down Gray's Inn lane; I called at Mr. Best's, my butter shop, for him to assist me in taking the prisoner; I wanted him to send to Mr. Harris; the prisoner tried to get away. I laid hold of his coat, I begged the butterman to assist me in keeping the prisoner, I said he had robbed me. The master of the shop did not give me the least assistance, I was in a weak state, there were several people about the door, no one would give me any assistance; the prisoner got away, and I hallooed out stop thief; the prisoner got away, and I did not see him for some time. The next time I saw him I had a letter from a gentleman in the Bank; I went to the public office, there I saw him, and gave in every particular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Then you mean to say that between the time of your being in the King's bench, and the time you saw the prisoner at the police<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010007"/> office, Queen's square, you never saw him only once. - A. Yes; only once in the bench; then I went to see Mr. Lessoo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before any magistrate at that time. - A. No, I was informed it would be of no use.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your being arrested at the suit of Mr. Baron, a druggist, before you went to the King's bench. - A. I do; I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the transaction of the box of plate. - A. Yes, but no great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Bail was given to the sheriff for your arrest. - A. I do not know, I was released.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not at all understand at the time the tipstaff took you to the bench, that that was a surrender of your bail. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That we shall hear hereafter. - Then from the time of the box of plate being taken, down to your going to the King's bench, you were daily importuning Mr. Andrews for the box of plate. - A. I was, I wanted to get it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought him a most wicked and guilty man. A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you would not forgive him for that wicked act. - A. Yes, I told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time of his taking the plate, and the time of his putting you in the bench, as you call it, how many times have you dined with him. - A. A few times. I was in hopes of getting the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. What with dining and threatening, you were in hopes of getting the plate. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were so angry with him that you could never write to him that you loved him as a son. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, is that your hand writing. - A. It is. (The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Addressed to MR. ANDREWS.</p>
               <p>MAY 27, 1802</p>
               <p>"Dear friend.</p>
               <p>"I am positively assured part of the goods are sold, but without your knowledge; I love you as my son, and I believe you have affection for me as a father. Out of the notes accepted by me I had thirty pounds; that will not qualify this business, nor any other. If the goods are sold, it is but right I should know it - and it appears some are sold - if with your sanction, I hope I shall be out by Saturday.</p>
               <p>"Yours, sincerely, J. HARRIS."</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, upon your being arrested about the time this plate was taken, you were not short of cash. - A. I was</p>
               <p>Q. Being short of cash, I dare say it never occurred to you of pawning this plate to make a little money. - A. No, I never did do such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. To be sure it was your daughter's, it would be an awkward thing; have not you never told any body that you was sorry that you pawned the plate. - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Just now that was true, that you never wrote that letter - did you never say that you was sorry for it, and that you consented to it - A. Do not ask me them questions, because I speak the truth.</p>

He then said if I did, I should ruin him and lord Craven's groom to; he also said, in an impertinent way, I will never sell a horse for you again; he said all servants must live. I immediately said have not you wages, he replied a man must get something for selling a horse, these things are always happening, we must live in this sort of way, a man cannot live upon his wages, it is a regular way.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you had no part out of that eighty four pounds. - A. I had no part of the eighty four pounds; he gave it me as a present out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was it not your bargain to pay seventy four pounds for the horse, and to divide the sum of six guineas between each of you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>LORD CRAVEN - Mr. Gurney. I believe the last witness was your groom. - A. He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your lordship receive that receipt for the money. - A. I did, afterwards.</p>

Yes; the prisoner rode up to me one morning, just after I had let his lordship out; he asked me if his lordship was at home, I said no, sir, he is just gone out; he said he wished to speak to him concerning a horse he had sold to his groom Pentford; I suppose, says he, you have heard the story; no, I said, I know nothing at all about it; says he it is concerning a horse that I sold to his groom Pentford, and I find the man is like to lose his situation; he said, I certainly sold the horse for more than what I might have taken for him, but Pentford is not to blame, he had nothing to do in it, and I should be very sorry if the man lost his situation through it.</p>

The half boots his eldest child brought me up in her hands. I believe she is about two years old. The women's shoes I know nothing of, they were not there when the constable opened the box. I was taken to the counter. On the next morning I heard they had found some women's shoes; I said I know nothing of shoes, nor were they found at the time when they opened my box.</p>

               <p>Q. On account of this discovery, how much of your property did you miss. - A. I could not tell that morning, they had pulled the pieces about in every place. When I came to calculate I found there were fifty pieces missing; I had four or five hundred pieces. The fifty pieces that I missed were all shawls, or for shawls; some of them were white, but they were chiefly printed. I knew that the quantity of goods that I had been robbed of must have been taken away in a cart. I sent my workmen about the neighbourhood to make enquiries, and on the evening of the 16th I saw part of my goods at Worship-street. I saw six seven quarter-shawls, and a single six-quarter square of muslin, that I know to be mine by the pattern, and one piece that had not been printed; twelve yards with the excise officers marks tore off; it was brought with it to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any other part of the goods that have been missing. - A. Not any.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of the prosecutor applying to our office that he had been robbed, we went in search of a cart, upon which name, number, and the street were inserted. I found that cart in Castle-street, Bethnall Green, at one Mrs. Bovine's; from information that we received there, we went to Mrs. Sidebotham's, No. 3, New-street, St. Andrew's-hill; I found her there, she said it was her house. The front door of the house was open, I asked a girl that was there if Mrs. Sidebotham was at home, she said yes; I found Mrs. Sidebotham in the back parlour, which is made a bed room; the door was locked; I went into the back yard, leaving Mr. Clark the marshalman, and Mr. Nicholls at that door; the back window sash was up, the curtains were down; I moved the curtains and searched the bed furniture; I observed Mrs. Sidebottham dressing herself; in about three or four minutes she had put on her clothes; she then opened the room door; the moment she came out, I asked her if she had got any man in the house, a girl that was standing by said she did not know; she seemed to be very much flurried; I then immediately says to Mrs. Sidebotham, have you got any man or men in your room, she said yes; there was one, that was the prisoner at the bar; the was then laying upon the boards under the bed, dressed in his boots and every thing. I asked Mrs. Sidebotham if she had any bundle left at her house by any person that day; she said she had, and it was left by the prisoner Harman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present. - A. He was not then; she opened her drawer, it was taken out in the presence of Mr. Clark; that was in the front room. She unlocked the drawer and took them out, and produced two or three shawls, which Clark has got in his possession. I had secured the prisoner Harman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Harman when she shewed this. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010011"/> We had put him in the coach just by the door; immediately I received information where the prisoner's lodgings was; I went to No. 2, Ireland-yard, at the bottom of St. Andrew's-hill, I found the door locked on the ground floor; I went to Harman, and asked him for the key of his door; I told him where I had been, he delivered this key to me and it opened the door; there I found six pistols, three of them were loaded; there is an hanger; this is a center bit, this center bit will make a hole big enough for any man to put his arm through to unlock any door or draw a bolt; I found two dark lanthorns, about an hundred keys, a phorsphorus bottle; there were several matches laying in the room. I found three crows, they are of different sizes, and a black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any goods that were stolen in that house. - A. No; all the goods that were found was in Mrs. Sidebotham's house. I went down to Waltham-Abbey, I took these crows and the keys with me; I tried that pick-lock to the shop door where these good were taken from; I opened the lock with this key. I found a mark of this iron crow where they had attempted to break open a place, nearly adjoining to where the goods were taken from; there seemed to be two or three marks where they had tried to wrench the door open.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information, did you go to Mrs. Sidebotham's with Ray and Clark. - A. I did. The prisoner Harman was brought to me and I took care of him in the coach at the bottom of Creed-lane, with Mrs. Bovine and a man of the name of Welch, whom I had brought from Bethnal-green; I was waiting at the bottom of Creed-lane close to New-street, where they lived Ray brought the prisoner Harman to the coach to me, bid me to take care of him, and delivered him into my custody. I sat with Welch on the fore part of the coach, and Bovine and Harman sat on the hind part of the coach. After Ray had left Harman with me, he went away; in a few minutes he returned back again; he says to Harman, have you got the key of No. 2, Ireland-yard; he said he did not know. Ray said, search him Mason; then he pulled out the key and delivered it. Shortly after that Ray brought the pistols, and these things, and put them into the coach. While Ray was absent I saw something in Harman's hand, which he wanted to conceal under his thigh; after he got out of the coach I found it was two stripes of fag ends of muslin; I produce them; I have kept them ever since. At the public house at the office, he said these thing were his; that was on the Monday following him and Mrs. Sidebotham were together at the public house; she said that he brought them there, and desired her to take care of them. He did not contradict it.</p>

            . I am a publican, I keep the sign of the Green Man. On the 15th of May, about half after eight o'clock, Harman, in company with another man, came to my house; he had a little chaise cart, it was a moon light night; they went away about half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that other man was. - A. I do not. I saw Harman again in Worship-street. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your public house from this shop of Mr. Littler's that was broken open. - A. About three quarters of a mile. When they went away from my house they said they were going to Low Layton.</p>

            , I live at No. 13, Ireland-yard. On the 16th of May, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, I saw Mrs. Sidebotham and Mr. Harman in her front parlour. No. 2, Ireland-yard; that is the room that Harman lives in, and two other men with him; they were looking over pieces of linen or cotton, there appeared to be a great many; I saw them empty them some from a black bag, such a one as I saw in the officer's hands. Harman and another man was engaged in holding up the pieces. Mrs. Sidebotham and the other men was looking on. Mrs. Sidebotham turned round and observed that I was looking at them; she said something which caused them so move the goods to the furthest part of the parlour; they moved them from my sight; my window was directly opposite to their parlour. I saw Harman go in and out repeatedly that morning. About a quarter before two in the afternoon I saw the goods removed; I saw Harman and one of the other men that were with him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know him if you were to see him. - A. Yes, I have frequently seen him come in and out of that parlour; I saw Mr. Harman come to the street door and look at each way before he came out; he had done so frequently that morning. The other man stood behind him at the parlour door with a large parcel on his shoulder, wrapped in a green baize, and skewered up. Harman went into the parlour and pulled off a pair of old drawers; he took a pair of small pistols, something like these now produced; he put one into each pocket. He then said to the man with the parcel, it is clear, now, now come; the man came out first, and Harman followed him. In the evening I told the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You was not examined before the magistrate. - A. I was; I then gave the same account as I gave now.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am a married woman, my husband is a lamp lighther.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon very good terms with Mrs. Sidebotham. - A. I never associated with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not owe her any money. - A. No more than you do; that I will swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will swear that, according to the law, that you did not owe her any money, but your husband might. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was some money due from your husband to her; although unjustly, I dare say. - A. Yes, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010012"/> claim there was; I had paid the money that she called for before to a man that she lived with, on the same day, I borrowed it; and I paid it again into a court of justice.</p>
               <p>Court. How much was it. - A. One pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And therefore I dare say you owed her a great deal of good will. - A. I owed her no good will.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Harman left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Sidebotham's Defence. Please your worship, I never saw any thing of this gentleman's but the handkerchief; he asked me to let him leave it with me; when the officers asked me if any left a parcel with me, I told him there was this small parcel.</p>
               <p>Sidebotham called seven witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            , junior. - Mr. Bolland Where do you live. - A. No 105, Fenchurch-street, I am at school there.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 28th of April did you receive any bill from your father. - A. Yes, about the 28th of April, I took it to Baker's coffee house; I did not see Mr. Still there, and so I took a letter from my father, and left it at No. 6, St. Michael's-alley, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it. - A. On the side of the door there was Vaughan, and on the front of the door was Winkley, Brothers, and company; I saw a lady there, and I left the letter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time receive any other bill from your father. - A. Yes; I took the last bill on the 4th or on the 5th of May, to the same house No. 6, St. Michael's-alley; then I saw Mr. Still; he said, is it you that brought this letter up, I said yes; he said he was going to meet one of the partners of the country bank at the Edinburgh Castle, and then he would give me the notes for the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. What kind of a bill was it you had from your father - was it a bank of England bill. - A. No, it was a bill drawn upon a person in town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you go to the Edinburgh Castle. - A. Yes, I got there about a quarter past six o'clock; I met Mr. Still there, and a person that called himself Mr. Hitchen. Hitchen told me that he knew my father, and if I mentioned his name to him he would recollect him; he had been to his house. He gave me the bills, and bid me good by; he gave me five pound notes to the amount of one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two bills, are these two of the bills so given you on that day. - A. Yes, I know it by this mark on this one, and I tried to imitate it on this.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark. - A. Crossing the 5. After I had done this, I was afraid I might spoil the bill; I put my finger on it to get the ink off; I sent the bills to my father by the post in a letter, and in about four or five days I received part of them back from my father, and part of them my father brought up to town himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bills after you received them from your father the second time. - A. I kept them and looked them up. After I had found the house of Winkley, Brothers, and Co. had stopped payment, I wrote to them to give up my father's bill. I saw neither Mr. Still or Mr. Hitchen afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you received the bills from your father, did you learn that they had stopped payment. - A. The next day; in consequence of that I informed my father, and I kept these two bills; and the other bills I delivered to Mr. Humphries.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether you received that of Mr. Still - A. Mr. Still wrote that in my presence. I wrote Baker's coffee-house on the back of it, that I might remember where Mr. Still wrote that note. (The note read.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You have been speaking of the marks on the note, did you give the account of them marks before the lord mayor. - A. No, I did not recollect them then; but looking over them some time afterwards, I saw the marks I had made. These notes were not produced before the lord mayor; I have kept them in my desk: I brought them here this morning, and gave them to Mr. Humphries.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the two marked notes part of those your father sent or which he brought up with him. - A. I do not know; the notes that I received from Hitchen were wafered most of them, and those I received from Still were not wafered; and these two notes form a part of the notes I received from Hitchen. I remember perfectly the one that is marked; I made the mark on or about the 4th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was that the day that you received them. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you mean to say that these two are a part of those you received from Hitchen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that out of the number that was delivered to you by one and by the other, that these notes might not be part of those you received from Still, as well as part of those you received from Hitchen. A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I understand you to answer my friend this way - that Mr. Humphries desired you to select the notes that you thought you had received from Hitchen - had you previous to that taken notice of one note from the other. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why should Mr. Humphries desire you to select those you thought you received from Hitchen. - A. Those that I knew I received from Mr. Hitchen, were all wafered; and these I received from Mr. Still were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you said before to Mr. Humphries that you did not distinguish one from the other. - A. I believe I did</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010013"/> Court. When did you recollect that Hitchen's were wafered. - A. I have recollected it all along.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Notwithstanding that you said you could not distinguish one from the other. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been able to pitch upon these notes that you received from Hitchen. - A. I believe two days ago; I saw the mark on the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told the court that the notes you received from Hitchen were wafered. - A. Not all of them; this note is not wafered. I delivered seventy-five or eighty to Mr. Humphries that were wafered.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th of May did you receive any notes by post in a package. - A. Yes, five-pound bills, to the amount of one hundred pound, purporting to be of the Ipswich and Suffolk bank; on that day I received a letter in the packet; on the next day another letter came from my son. There is one thing necessary for me to correct; though I applied for these bills, I did not apply for any discount; I received the full amount. I did not know at that time whether there was any discount, nor is it considered; the circulation of the bills is looked upon the same of one side as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received a prior hundred pound of these bills a few days before from your son. - A. I think on the 30th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing with that second remittance, before you received any letter from your son. - A. I had; on the day I received them, I paid a great many of them bills away.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them two bills, are you able to say whether either of the bills were included in the second remittance. - A. Yes, these that I hold in my hand; I was enabled to know the note the moment I received it in my hand, by the name of

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received from your son, did you send back part of the bills that you had received. - A. Yes, I believe to the amount of one hundred pounds about two days afterwards; I afterwards brought up the remainder on the 14th of May, and delivered them to him on the 15th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (to jury). Gentleman, the bill that he speaks to, is the bill that the son made the imitation upon.</p>
               <p>Q. (to witness) Did you know the prisoner at the bar, Hitchen, was he ever at your house. - A. I know neither of the prisoners at the bar; I never saw them before to the best of my knowledge; Hitchen never was at my house in his life; I have never transacted any business with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. You say you are not acquainted with either of the partners. - A. I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you had as good opinion of this bank as any other, and you wished your paper to be converted into their paper - A. I had a good opinion of their bank of course.</p>

               <p>Q. What did these plates purport to be. - A. Promissory notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two bills, did you engrave the plate from which this was struck. - A. I originally engraved it, it has been altered since; there is a tree introduced it was originally the Ipswich bank; it is now Ipswich, and Suffolk bank; the five is done in a different manner to what the note was originally done; the alterations are done by another engraver. Mr. Still paid me for engraving that work; he desired me to make a bill out in the name of Ralph, Holden, and Co I suppose I printed off two hundred from each plate altogether.</p>

Yes, the tree was put in by me; I altered the five, and put it in Suffolk bank by Mr. Still's order. On December 30th was the first alteration that I made; there were several alterations, and I worked off nearly in the whole twelve thousand bills; one's two's and five's. They were delivered at No. 6, Michael's-alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any agreement made between Hitchen and you about that house. - A. Not the first time; he called again in the evening, and then an agreement was made.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Hitchen when he first called - A. He wished to hire the house unfurnished; I did not chose to let the house unfurnished, upon account that we did not agree; he stated that he wanted to hire the house to open a bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who were to be the bankers. - A. He did not; he wrote in a memorandum the name of Mr. Haydon and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. (to Miss Smith) When did Mr. Hitchen call upon you again. - A. I called upon him, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the Ipswich paper; that was near a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not hear any more of him not till a month. - A. No. I agreed for the letting the house on the 30th of September.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland (to witness). You are not to tell me any thing of that first agreement - did he enter into any further agreement about the house on the 30th of September. - A. No; he entered into that agreement. I let him the house on the 30th of September.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no other letting him the house on the 30th of September but by that written paper which you have not got. - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you his writing in your pocket of an agreement of letting Hitchen the house. - A. I have (producing it). When I called, I told Mr. Hitchen I called in consequence of seeing different names to the house; he said it was part of the same firm, and he had this agreement ready for me, to take place instead of the other. I gave him possession of the house on the 30th of September; I let him the house at one hundred pounds a-year.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did Hitchen carry on in that house. - A. Banking business; there was BANK on the door; I never see any name on the door; I received the rent of Mr. Hitchen sometimes myself; I was very ill the chief of the winter; I did not always go myself. When I have been there I have seen Young and another; he styled himself Tyler. I did not see him transact any business.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Were these persons, Mr. Brant and Mr. Arle, friends of Mr. Still or Mr. Hitchen. - A. Brant was not a friend of Mr. Still as I know of, nor do I know that he was a friend of Mr. Hitchen. I suppose Arle was a friend of their's, I have heard him mention their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an accidental meeting of them and you at this house. - A. I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you invite them to meet you or they invite you. - A. I applied to Mr. Humphries for money; he would not give me any, and by Mr. Humphries desire I applied to Mr. Hitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the Mr. Arle that wrote that letter to you. - A. I should suppose it is, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that letter. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, this is another letter; be so good as to tell me whether you received that letter by the post. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That letter is marked No. 1.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, look at that letter No. 2, and tell me whether you received that by post. - A. Yes, the post mark is on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is that, to the best of your knowledge. - A. Mr. Still's, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that No. 3. and tell me is that Mr. Still's hand writing. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is not by the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter No. 4, and tell me whose hand writing you believe that to be. - A. I believe that to be Mr. Holden's.</p>
               <p>Court. What, the man that you met with Arle. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the hand writing of Hitchen because Holden writes like it; why cannot you swear to the writing of one as well as the other. - A. The hand writing is very different, though the signatures are very similar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Suppose I had shewed you that letter without the signature, whose hand writing should you have supposed that to be. - A. I should not have supposed it to be Mr. Hitchen's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that person calling himself

               <p>Q. Do you mean that the body of that letter is unlike Mr. Hitchen's hand writing. - A. I think it is very much unlike it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the body of the letter, No. 4, and the signature, to be done by different persons. - A. By the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. You received that letter. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whose hand writing you believe that to be. - A. This is Mr. Hitchen's sir.</p>
               <p>Q. This I will put the letter A upon - here is another letter, whose hand writing do you believe that to be. - A. Mr. Hitchen's.</p>
               <p>Q. That is No. 5 - take these two bills into your hand again; now attend - supposing these two bills should be presented to your bank, should you or should you not have taken them. - A. No, they are only payable in London. I should have said they were genuine ones, and should have referred them to St. Michael's alley.</p>

Yes, on the 2nd of May I pursued and took them; I found upon them notes to the amount of seven or eight hundred pounds; these are the notes; they are as they delivered them up. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Still's Defence. My lord - I shall trouble you with as few observations as possible, and which I trust will be more than sufficient to explain my conduct to the satisfaction of the court and the jury, with respect to the charge of which I am accused. I have been long in the most respectable connections, my payments having been from 100,000 l. to above 320,000 l. a-year in the mercantile and commission business.</p>
               <p>Shortly previous to Christmas 1805, Mr. Hitchen took a counting house of mine for himself and partner, Mr. Roche, where they conducted business as merchants to a very considerable amount; and after they had been some time there, Mr. Hitchen solicited me to take some of their consignments, as they had a greater quantity of goods on hand than their finances would permit them to hold with convenience; to which I consented, and made them the necessary advances, to the amount of 2 or 3000 l.</p>
               <p>About the middle of the year 1806, Mr. Hitchen informed me that some differences had arisen between him and his partner, and that he had made up his mind to discontinue his connection with him, and having overtures from a gentleman of the name of Holden, whom he had long known in Liverpool, to join him in the corn and provision trade, and that if they could settle their plan, he would shortly dissolve his copartnership with Roche.</p>
               <p>Soon after, I learnt that Mr. Hitchen and Roche had agreed to dissolve their copartnership, and that Mr. Hitchen had joined with Mr. Holden and others in a mercantile concern, which they were about to establish in the country, and I was requested to take their consignments in addition to my other concerns in the same line. I agreed to take them, without thinking it at all necessary to make those enquiries as to Mr. Holden or Saunders that I should have done had it been to trust them.</p>
               <p>I received several large lots of cheese into my warehouse in October last, which I sold on their account. I afterwards received heavy consignments of cargoes of oats and other goods; so that I was obliged to transfer some to cornfactors, and which generally left a profit. They afterwards consigned direct to houses on the corn exchange.</p>
               <p>After they got established at Ipswich, I received an intimation from Mr. Hitchen that they had it in contemplation to issue their own notes payable on demand in London, similar to country banks, as they found it would materially tend to the advantage of their mercantile concerns; and they at the same time stated that they found a difficulty in prevailing on the London bankers to pay them, as they were to be issued for so small an amount as one pound; and they requested me to take a house for them, which I did in the first instance, and I supposed at that time that one of their own partners would superintend it; but afterwards, for various reasons, I was prevailed upon to become the payer, they promising that I should always have sufficient assets to answer any demand that should be made upon me. I disliked becoming the payer, principally from its being out of my usual business, and materially so, as it would appear to the world that I had two accompting-houses, being obliged to keep my mercantile one in the Borough, and they thought it indispensable that their notes should be paid in the city. This appearance was obviated by my getting my friend Winkley and his brother to allow me to make use of their names before mine in the firm of Winkley, Brothers, and company - determining in all cases and events, and which determination I always abided by, never to raise, or suffer to be raised, any money or credit directly or indirectly by that firm, and never to do any business there but pay the notes of Holden and company - never to accept any bill in that firm, or use any deception or disguise whatever. And on all occasions I directed every one to consider me the principal in it; and in my own mind and conduct, the firm was nothing else than the usual point of note where the holders might apply for their money, and which I considered myself no longer bound to pay than as I received remittances for the purpose. I always acted to the best of my judgment and abilities as the agent of Holden and company, and I exerted myself as much as possible for their interest, which they honourably acknowledge.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010019"/> knowledge. I received the minutest instructions from their letters in my possession to get their plates engraved; I communicated those instructions to my clerk, Mr. Vaughan, who gave them to the engraver. With respect to Mr. Page's son, it is not true, that I gave him any of Holden and Co's. notes, on or at all near so recent as the 28th of April; nor did he have any of these notes from me which he has sworn to have had. With respect to the last parcel; and his last application, I thought it imprudent at that particular period of Holden and Co's. difficulty to give Page's son of myself notes for his bill; and more so as Mr. Hitchen was himself in town, who knew his own resources best, and who was more confident in raising money for the bank to go on, than I was or could be. - I therefore told the lad, that as one of the partners was in London, he had better meet him with me at the Edinburgh coffee house, at three o'clock that day, Monday the 4th of May, which he did; and Mr. Hitchen gave him notes for his bill, assuring me after the boy was gone, that the bank of Ipswich was paying regularly, which it was; and that he was promised the loan of a thousand pounds the next morning, to enable me to continue their concern in town. However, it was of no avail; because I was taken up the same day, on the idea that I had circulated notes, knowing that Mr. Hitchen had forged Mr. Holden's name to them; and the lord mayor was so impressed with the criminality, that he would not listen to any defence; though Mr. Holden and Mr. Hitchen came into court on my first and second examination, expecting to be called.</p>
               <p>In the month of January or February last, Mr. Hayes, who was a very able man to get connections for Messrs Holden and Co. in the West of England, was introduced to me by Mr. Hitchen; and was I requested to send him the notes from London, which I regularly did, till about the 28th of April; when he was more eager for me to send him notes than ever, and less liberal in his remittances in return. I kept paying as far as the 28th of April, he sent me only twenty pounds, and not any since, when I presume the ballance of notes he had obtained exceeded two thousand pound. It unfortunately happened that my remittances were very deficient from other quarters, at the same time. I therefore wrote to Mr. Hitchen to come to London immediately, and meet me on the 30th, and used every exertion I was empowered with, to raise money on their notes and goods in my possession. On the 28th I concluded some accident had happened to Mr. Hayes; I sent my clerk, Vaughan, in the country, with his companions, with notes he had before paid, perhaps four or five times over, and which I never saw, either them or any other signed; conceiving every exertion to be my duty in supporting Holden and Co. I was particularly careful so mark all the notes which were thus given to negotiate, that they in particular should at all events be paid, and even most sanguinely expected every other also would be taken up.</p>
               <p>The witness must acknowledge that no representation, much more any misrepresentation was made by me. I particularly desired that if, at any time, any questions were asked them, to tell the truth, and to refer immediately to me, as the principal in the firm of Winkley and Co. I had no motive or inducement whatever, to act with deception or disguise; I had no idea but Holden and Co. were honorably correct in all their transactions. I never saw, nor had I any cause for any suspicion to the contrary; the worst I knew was, they often bought more corn than I thought prudent with safety, to the due payment of their notes; so that I was sometimes obliged to write to their friends for particular exertions in sending me money; though I never did, or had occasion to use extraordinary measures myself, till I saw my empty letter on the 28th; though I had their authority to circulate as occasion required.</p>
               <p>I will not tresspass longer on your patience, but beg leave to assure you that my intentions in every thing I have done were perfectly honest, and with the best of motives. Therefore I must rely on your justice; first in believing there was no fraud, and therefore there cannot be any forgery. And secondly, if Mr. Hitchen signed Mr. Holden's name on emergency, he was fully authorised so to do, by a regular power of attorney for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Hitchen's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the the jury, I have but little to add after what has been said by Mr. Still. In the month of June in the last year, I agreed to enter into partnership with Mr. Holden and Mr. Sanders, in the corn and provision trade; in which I have been brought up to from my youth, and with the concurrence of my partners I went to Ipswich, and took premises suitable for our business; and having left workmen to do what I considered necessary, I came to London untill they should be completed; Previous to my going down to commence business, my partner and myself waited upon Mr. Still, and requested him to take our consignments, to which he consented. provided the quantity did not exceed his finances for the usual advance. I then returned into the country; and as Mr. Holden who was the senior partner, was only occasionally at Ipswich, I requested to have his letter of attorney, to authorise me to sign his name in his absence, which he accordingly gave me.</p>
               <p>After some short time, we considered it would be beneficial to our interests to have small notes payable in London, in the same manner as country merchants and bankers do; and we accordingly applied, as Mr. Still has stated, to several London bankers, to request them to pay our notes, but they declined paying so small notes as one pound. We then requested Mr. Still to pay them; he at first declined, but he afterwards aceeded to our solicitations, upon understanding that he was in no shape to be responsible, and upon condition that his name was not inserted upon the face of the notes. Every thing being thus far settled, we sent Mr. Still's directions to get the plates engraved, sending him at the same time the form; and upon this being completed, we commenced issuing notes on the 5th of November 1806; and from that time untill the begining of May in the present year every note issued by us was duly honored. A great many of the notes thus issued were signed by Mr. Holden; and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that a great many were signed by me, and which I considered I was authorised to do by virtue of the letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>It has been asserted, that some fraud must have been intended from my name not appearing upon the face of the notes. This I most solemnly assure you is not the case; the only reason for its suppression, was that between three and four years ago, in consequence of sustaining very heavy losses, I failed in business, and it was apprehended that if my name appeared it would come to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010020"/> the knowledge of some persons who were acquainted with my former failure, and who might, by mentioning the circumstance, injure the credit of the establishment at Ipswich; but to all those with whom I transacted business, I ingenuously avowed that I was a principal in the firm. This is well known to my clerks, and to every one at Ipswich.</p>
               <p>During the time we were in business in Suffolk our dealings were extensive and regular; we had always one or two ships in our employ, and our consignments being very considerable, and requiring larger advances than could be made by Mr. Still, they were made by other gentlemen, who are in attendance, and will prove the regularity of our mercantile transactions with them. - Gentlemen, Mr. Still has truly told you that our failure originated with Hayes; had he acted honestly, not a note of ours would have been unpaid. It was with the utmost astonishment and concern that on my arrival in London on or about the 30th of April, that I for the first time learnt from Mr. Still the conduct of Hayes. Notwithstanding which, we determined if possible to withstand the blow. I sent to Ipswich instructions to pay as far as the last shilling would admit, and used every exertion to raise money to answer the emergency. I had determined to go in the country in search of Hayes, when the apprehension of Mr. Still put an end to all further exertions, as no hopes could be then entertained of retrieving our credit.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, both myself and partners attended before the lord mayor upon Mr. Still's first examination, in order to give evidence on his behalf, which circumstance his lordship perfectly well recollected upon my being afterwards taken into custody. We also attended in the neighbourhood during several subsequent examinations, for the same purpose; I was conscious that I had done nothing intentionally wrong, and I was not therefore anxious to shrink from investigation. I visited Mr. Still several times in prison, but at last, upon one of these occasional visits, I was detained, and examined with Mr. Still before the lord mayor, who committed us for trial. - Gentlemen, I am perfectly aware of the situation I stand in, and the prejudice entertained against me in the minds of the public. - Here I am, gentlemen, on a commitment, standing before you, confident that no prejudice prevails in this honourable court, but that it will do me the honour to give me an impartial hearing. I have done my utmost endeavour to shew you and the court the simple transaction under the agreement of partnership of myself, Holden, and company; and clear am I, had we not met with the losses before stated by Hayes, together with the unfortunate apprehension of Still, we might have carried on the business with honour and advantage to ourselves and families, with accommodation and benefit to individuals, as well as the public at large, to the general good of trade and commerce.</p>
               <p>Having said thus much - allow me just to shew the misfortunes that has since attended us, from the losses sustained aforesaid - first, by stating briefly the charges alleged against us, with our simple and candid defence thereto, for the clearer comprehension of you, gentlemen, as to the facts, previous to your verdict, where our lives, and all that is dear to us, is pending.</p>
               <p>I stand here indicted for a forgery; perhaps it may have been proved I did utter such notes; and perhaps it may have been partly proved I have written, signed, or endorsed the name of

If it was our misfortune to meet with losses so heavy, as to deprive us of the means of honouring our bills, after so many months establishment, we ought to have been called upon in the usual way at Guild-hall, when we became insolvent, to yield all our property fairly for the benefit of the whole of our bona fide creditors.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, is it not unprecedented to attempt a criminal charge; - under such circumstances I feel myself justified in conceiving it originated in the jealousy of other bankers, and the extravagance of the public prints - and I trust from the evidence this day given on the part of the prosecution, your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, will coincide with me in this opinion and that nothing has appeared to constitute forgery or fraud, but what may be completely done away by the evidence hereafter to be produced in my defence. - I therefore crave the indulgence of the court, by no means to form their judgment until the whole of such evidence on my behalf is finished and gone through - leaving my fate to your lordship, the court, and jury, and to my defence hereafter to follow, I bow with submission, waiting most anxiously for the decision, which I doubt not will be an acquittal.</p>

I did; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010022"/> I left London on the 4th of September; on my arrival in Ipswich, having occasion to disburse a dividend there, I changed a five pound bank note; I received a two pound bank of England note, and a two pound note in change, with the name of Holden upon it; I knowing the name of Holden, I went down to the bank to see him; the first day I waited upon Mr. Holden, I saw him twice; I received from his hands small notes, ones and fives, and in return I gave him a forty pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and tell me whether they are the sort of notes that you received for the forty pound bank note. - A. I do not think they are; there seems to be an addition; I received three notes drawn upon Winkley and Co. Michael's alley, Cornhill; I knew Mr. Holden as soon as I saw him, I saw him twice or three times there; on the ensung day I saw him at the Griffin inn, and twice before dinner in the bank transacting business.</p>

               <p>Q. You said she put her hand under her clothes - what do you mean. - A.

               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the 9th of June the prisoner coming into Mr. Godden's shop. - A. I do; she asked to look at some shawls, I put some on the counter; she said they would not do, she wished to look at some which were rather better; I turned my back to her to take some more down, I throwed her down a light coloured shawl, which she said would not do. I told her I thought she had taken a shawl from off the counter, she said she had not; I told her then the child had got it if she had not; I desired her to take the child from her breast, and I dare say the shawl would fall; she did take the child from her breast, but the shawl did not fall down. I came out from behind the counter, and told her she must be searched. I put the door to; at that time Mr. Godden came in; the prisoner wanted to get out, she walked backwards and forwards some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the shawl drop from her. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010025"/> I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it induced you to think she had taken the shawl. - A. I had taken two quantities of shawls down of the same colour; I missed one of them, I did not know how many there were at the time; it proved only to be one of each colour, and one was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of her taking this one until you missed it. - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a child in my arms when I went into this shop; the young man took down a parcel of shawls, as much as his hands could contain, he turned his back to reach some more down; if I had a mind to take them I could have taken a great many; when he turned round he said he missed a shawl, I said he was welcome to search me, I did not pretend to get out. When he came out from behind the counter, he brought out the shawl on his foot, and then he said that I had it.</p>

I was in my own place on the 14th of June last; one of my own lodgers came home and knocked at the door, I got up to let him in, it was about one o'clock at night, and Conway knocked him down; I said, Mr. Conway go home to your own place, he lives opposite to me; I laid hold of him by the arm and led him to his own door; Conway run up stairs and brought down a sword with him. My lodger Davis was at the door, Conway and Slater both laid hold of him by the bosom and the collar, one pulled him along, and the other shoved him into a passage; Davies hallooed out murder; I ran to assist him; Conway says, here he comes, I'll run him through; Davis got out of the passage all, cut; by that he made a stab at me; I got hold of the blade of the sword.</p>
               <p>Q. And by that means your hand got out. - A. Yes, he made a cut at me, and I laid hold of the sword; my hand was cut by his thrusting the sword at me; Slater took hold of me by the collar, and held a stick over my head; there was assistance came up to me, and we took the sword from Conway.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear before the prisoner struck him any words pass between them. - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did nothing more than lay your hand on the prisoner to lead him across. - A. No more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany it with no further violence than that. - A. No more, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your hand cut, deep or slightly. - A. Very deep, he knocked a piece out of it.</p>

No, not at that time; then Conway came down stairs with his sword, and stood outside of the door some time; Davis come out again; my husband was in doors; Conway and Slater pulled Davis into Slater's passage; Davis cried out murder, my husband went out to try to save him, I saw Davis come out of the passage all of a gore of blood; I went to the passage, I saw Slater, he had hold of Carrol by the collar, holding a large stick over his head, and Conway had the sword across Carrol's body, and Slater's wife had a candle; I took the candle from her; I went to Conway and pulled down his two arms, and Carrol took the sword from him; Conway turned into Slater's apartment; I took the stick from Slater, and gave it to the night constable.</p>

Davis knocked at the door to get in, Conway came up and knocked him down; upon that Carrol came out and took Davis in; Conway went up stairs and brought down his sword. Carrol after he brought Davis in doors, he forced Conway into his passage, he took hold of him by his arms; when Conway came down with the sword he swore bitterly that he would kill one before he would part with his sword; I begged of him to go up stairs with his sword; he went to Slater's passage, and stood with the sword at his back; I begged him to drop the sword, he said he would not; Davis came out of Carrol's house to make water, Conway drew his sword, and raised his hand to strike Davis; Davis cried out murder, Carrol came out at the time Conway and Davis were in the passage; when Carrol came out Conway said, here he comes, and I will run him through; then I went to call the watchmen, and when I came with them Carrol had Conway's sword, and his hand was bloody. I saw the blow given to Davis, but I did not to Carrol.</p>

            . I was officer of the night; Carrol delivered the sword to me, and this stick was taken from the prisoner in his own room, he used it as a defence against me.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Carrol) Look at that sword, is that the sword that you were describing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it bent in that way. - A. In forcing it from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - on Sunday morning the 14th of June last, between two and three o'clock, I saw a man whom I supposed to be a deserter; I followed him sharply, he took to his heels and threw himself under a gateway; when I came up to him; I asked him what he was doing there, he replied what is that to you; I called the watchman, and charged him with being a deserter. My lord, there is a set of people that live opposite of me, that would deprive me of my life and liberty, by false swearing; they are eternally calling me a crimp. After securing the man in the watchhouse, coming home I stopped to speak to a woman who lived next door to me, these people rushed out of the house, knocked me down in the passage, and secured the sword from me, and broke the blade; and in their securing the sword from me, I have every reason to believe the parties were cut; I got away from them, went up stairs to a neighbour, I staid in her room, and when I thought every thing was quiet I got over the yard, and went to my own room; these people came and broke my room door open. I declare I am an innocent man.</p>

            . I was sitting in my own room No. 7, Charlotte-buildings; I heard a noise in the court, I opened the window and looked out; I saw the prisoner standing in the court with Davis, Carrol and his wife, and Welch; they were arguing with the prisoner, the prisoner turned round and went into Slater's house; they all followed him, even Carrol's wife did; I do not know what they did there, I saw Carrol come out of the house with a naked sword in his hand; calling out bloody Conway, bloody Slater; Carrol struck the window shutter and broke the glass, I did not see Conway after that. One morning as I was coming from my work, I heard Carrol cry out bloody Conway, I will send you to Pimlico, to get another silver plate in your head; Carrol's wife said she should be very well satisfied if she saw him hung in the Old Bailey. Davis, Slater, Carrol, and me, we all work for the same master, and this morning I saw Slater in my master's yard.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Charlotte-buildings. On the 14th of June I happened to be up that night, being very busy; Carrol and Conway had some words before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did this happen. - A. To the best of my knowledge about half after two in the morning. About a week before this happened Mr. Carrol came out in the middle of the day, he pulled his shirt sleeves up and called Conway, Conway looked out of the window and asked him what he wanted, he said I want no more of you than to come down stairs; the prisoner said he would not come down; I told Carrol to go in doors, I thought he wanted him to fight with him. The next time I saw him was when the fight was; the prisoner's room is opposite of mine, Carrol lives in the next house to me; I saw a little short man, he wanted to take the sword out of the prisoner's hand. I fancy his hand was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Carrol. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Davis. - A. That was the name of the little man; his hand bled very much, Carrol went to his assistance, Conway went into Slater's house to save himself; they both pursued the prisoner to get the sword out of his hands.</p>

Between two and three in the morning; he said Carrol and his wife and Davis had been ill using him, and they had taken his sword from him; I told Mr. Conway if he would stay in the house I would go down. I went down stairs and opened the door, I saw Carrol with Conway's sword in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010027"/> hand, breaking the lower part of the parlour window; Carrol came to me, he asked me if Conway was in my room, I told him no; he said he had better not let him lay hold of him, if he did he would murder him.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know whether he was knocked down before you opened the door to him. - A. I cannot say, he was knocked down twice after I opened the door to him; my husband came out and took him in, Carrol went and put his hand to Conway's arm, and said go home good man; I think he went with him as far as the step of the door, after Davis went in. He was in a considerable time and then he went out again; with that Conway and Slater pushed him into the passage; I went out of the door when I heard the noise, I saw Slater and Conway pulling him into Slater's passage; I did not go nigh them till I saw Davis coming out all of a gore of blood. He cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at that time. - A. He was in his own apartment; he went to his assistance to bring him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Davis when you saw him of a gore of blood. - A. He was coming out of Slater's passage, he came into my place.</p>

               <p>Q. Had your husband gone out to him before you saw him on a gore of blood. - A. Yes, upon Davis coming out, I asked him where Carrol was, he said he believed he was killed; I went into Slater's passage, I saw my husband held by Slater, and Slater's wife had a candle in her hand; and held him with the other hand; I did not see him strike him; Conway had the sword across Carrol's body; I went inside of them, I laid hold of Conway's arm, till Carrol took the sword out of his hands.</p>

               <p>Q. On Friday the 22nd of May were you in possession of a cow. - A. I was, I saw her about nine o'clock in the evening in the meadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your gate secured. - A. It was locked. On the next morning about five o'clock I missed her; the gate was lifted off the hinges, and the cow was gone. It was a little black cow.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information on the Monday morning following, did you come to Smithfield. - A. I did, with a person of the name of Fleming, and Garment joined us soon after; I came to Smithfield on Monday morning a little after three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your cow in Smithfield. - A. About four, or a little after four, I found my cow tied to a rail in Smithfield market.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010028"/> did, a tall man in a blue coat; it was the prisoner at the bar, he had on a red handkerchief, and there were white spots in it; the prisoner was so dressed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the cow was he standing. - A. About three yards, I suppose.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do upon seeing that man and seeing the cow. - A. About an hour and a half after that I saw a friend of mine, Mr. Garment; I kept watching the cow and the man during that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man keep near the cow or leave her. - A. I believe during that time the man put the cow in some other person's hand and left the cow.</p>
               <p>Q. When Garment joined you, did you desire him to do any thing. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you desired him to do, did you see him go towards the cow. - A. I did, I observed him to be conversing with Curtis a salesman; I saw the prisoner again in about ten minutes, I pointed him out to Garment; he went up to the prisoner, I believe he conversed with him about half an hour, I stood near him watching him; at last I went up to him, and at that time Garment was buying the cow of the prisoner; I charged the constable with the prisoner for selling the cow to Garment.</p>
               <p>Court. You charged him with stealing it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your cow. - A. Yes, I am very certain it was; the prisoner said what do you charge me for, I replied for the cow; I asked Garment if he had not sold him that cow, he said yes, that black cow for seven guineas; I said that is my cow; then I charged the constable with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What is the value of the cow. - A. Ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since shewn that cow to Hunt. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out that cow to Hunt, or did he select it himself. - A. He selected it himself, it was with two others in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you shewn that cow to Mrs. Ryning. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks about the cow. - A. Yes, some grey hairs over the right eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Then the only mark that I understand you to know her by, the cow has some grey hairs over her right eye - is that the only mark. - A. She has a full staring eye.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you never see a cow with a full staring eye. - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to a few grey gairs, I suppose you have seen a cow with that before. - A. I cannot say that I have exactly like that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the cow. - A. About four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner with you in your business. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of what the prosecutor said to you, did you accost the prisoner. - A. I went to the prisoner, about pigs; after that we got into conversation about the price of beasts; I told him I had been cheapening a little cow in the market for a friend of mine; he told me that he had got one in the market; I asked him what part of the market it was, he told me it was at the further part of the market; I made answer that I had been cheapening one at the further part of the market, a small cow; I asked him if he would like to take a walk with me to the further part of 
the market, as I had been cheapening this cow; he took a walk with me to the cow; then I asked him if it was his property, he said it was his cow. I asked the price of the cow, the salesman said the price of the cow was eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Curtis. - A. I do not know his name; I told the prisoner that price was too much, it was more than I could afford to give, I would give him seven guineas; the prisoner soon after made answer you shall have it; he was taken up immediately; I looked round immediately to Mr. Bliss.</p>
               <p>Q. On your looking round to Mr. Bliss he came up, and the constable took him into custody. - A. Yes, and the cow was taken away.</p>


               <p>Q. Was that the cow which Mr. Bliss claimed. - A. Yes, the same cow which Mr. Bliss claimed to be his property.</p>

            . Mr. Gurney. I believe you keep a public house at Chelsea. - A. Yes, called the World's-end.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday May the 23d did the prisoner come to your house. - A. He did, about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. On that morning did he bring any thing with him. - A. He brought a black cow with him; her horn was tied by a cord to her foot, she was put into my yard; he asked me to let my servant milk the cow; in consequence of his request she did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had milked the cow, did she say any thing. - A. I have a little black cow, very much like that cow; she said though that cow was like mine, it did not give so much milk; he replied, she had been brought nineteen miles that accounted for her not giving so much milk. I asked him if he had bought the cow at the fair; he told me he had.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say what fair. - A. He did not; he told me to take care of the cow, and he would call in the evening; the cow remained there till the evening; he called again, and requested the servant to milk her again in the evening, and the morning. He told me he should take her away on Monday morning to Smithfield; accordingly she was taken on the Monday morning to Smithfield, I was in bed, I heard the cow go out. I saw the cow at Mr. Bliss's. That is the cow that was at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say that this cow the prisoner had was like your cow. - A. Yes, if I saw them together I should know my own cow, there is a difference in the heads of the two cows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I propose to read this examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know how that can be evidence to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I have no objection to it.</p>
               <p>(The examination read). The prisoner being asked what he had to say, saith, that on the 23d of September, about half past nine in the morning, he was at the World's-end, public house, King's-road, Chelsea, in company with two or three other persons; that on leaving that house, they went into the road, and met a man with the cow, that he returned with the man and the cow to the World's-end; and that the man offered him the cow for seven guineas, and he took six guineas and a half for the cow.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called no witnesses to character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes, I am never otherwise. The prisoner at the bar was the person that drawed the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of his person. - A. I never left him from the minute he took it; my wife and I was going down Well-street; he came up against me; I said at the moment, that man has got my watch; when he shoved up against me I felt the watch drawn out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in his hand. - A. I only felt it go from me; I pursued after him in a minute.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010030"/> Q. Were there many people in the street at that time. - A. Not a soul was in the street but him, he was alone; I cried stop thief, and pursued him immediately; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he get before he was stopped. - A. I believe the space that he ran before he was obliged to turn back again was twenty or thirty yards; my crying stop thief alarmed the people; he run down Red Cross-square, and turned back to avoid the people; he returned back because of the quantity of people that were coming up Red Cross-square; I laid hold of him by the collar and had him on the ground; some other person came up and he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch found upon him. - A. When we took him to the watchhouse he was searched, and no watch found upon him; Mr. Brock went back to the same place where the scuffle was; there he picked up the watch, and brought it to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Andrews. You say it was half past eleven at night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were passing through Well-street, Cripplegate - is that in the road to Barbican. - A. It is the strait road to Red-Cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner came to you and attempted to take the watch from your pocket - had you been drinking - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober. - A. I am always sober.</p>
               <p>Q. So I heard you say before. - A. I defy any man to say otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say that he returned back because of a mob coming, will you say that you never lost sight of him. - A. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see him. - A. It was light enough for me to see him, because I was never farther from him than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was nine days old - do you mean to say it was light enough for you to see the face of a man, so that you could identify the person that took the watch from you. - A. If I were not positive I would not appear in this place.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know the probability of your story, not your reason - what dress had the prisoner got on. - A. A brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any other man in a brown coat. - A. I had hold of the man before there was another man to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where your watch was lost was it from where it was picked up. - A. Not above forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any person being present when the prisoner was brought up to you. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said that you could not identify the person that robbed you. - A. No, I never quitted him till the constable took him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable or any other person that you could not identify the person that robbed you. A. I never did.</p>

I did, on Monday afternoon the 15th of June, it is situated the corner of Primrose-street; I went with my neighbour, we found the stone gorge inside of the pantry door; we took it into the parlour of the public house, and waited there a few minutes, till Sapwell the constable brought the prisoner into the parlour; then I charged the prisoner with stealing it. He began telling a long story about my stopping half a day's wages on the Saturday; he did not deny doing it, but he said how could he live if he did not do something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stopped half a day's wages. - A. I had, in consequence of his stopping away half a day; his wages were eighteen shillings a week. After Sapwell delivered him into the care of another officer, I and Sapwell went to his lodgings, he had told me where he lived; we went to No. 9, Read's place, Hoxton; we found the door fast and no person at home; I waited till eleven o'clock, and then we found his wife at home. We searched and found all the articles in the indictment, and a great many more.</p>

            . I am an independent man, I live in St. George's in the East. On Tuesday the 26th of May last, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I was at the end of Barbican, the corner of Golden-lane; I stopped there, resting my hand upon the post, my wife was looking at a haberdasher's shop, I was looking towards Long-lane, that she might not pass me; it was getting dark, there were several men standing behind the post in Golden-lane; I did not take notice of them, my eye being fixed along Barbican; several men rushed upon me and took me bodily away from the post, several yards down <placeName id="t18070701-28-crimeloc171">Barbican</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070701-28-crimeloc171" type="placeName" value="Barbican"/>

                        targets="t18070701-28-off169 t18070701-28-crimeloc171"/>; I felt a sudden twitch of my pocket and when I felt the switch I saw the motion of the prisoner's hand as soon as they had quitted me; I clapped my hand to my pocket and exclaimed that I had been robbed of my watch; the prisoner and several others went down Red Cross-street as hard as they could run; I pursued him, calling stop thief, still keeping him in sight; the prisoner was stopt; I laid hold of him; at the time he had his coat off; he gave his coat to a man that was standing on his left hand; I had hold of the prisoner with my left hand, I seized the man with my right hand; a scuffle ensued, they both got from me; I hurt my hand, it has been so bad this three weeks I do not know what to do with it hardly; the prisoner was taken in a few minutes afterwards, he was taken to a public house and there searched; there was nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man. - A. The other man got off; he dropped the coat and another person picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he one of those that drove you from the post. - A. I cannot say positively that I saw him where they stood; I was not more than three yards from them, I saw them standing in Golden-lane; I never saw their faces, I was standing outside of the post by a pawnbrokers, not to hinder the foot passengers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the party. - A. Yes, I fixed my eye upon him, he was one of the party that rushed on me; he was the man; when I felt the snatch I saw his motion, I am sure he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. This was past nine o'clock. - A. Yes, the clock struck nine when I was in Charterhouse-square.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dusk. - A. Yes, but it was a remarkable clear day.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were several men - how many do you think there might be. - A. I dare say there was half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was hurried along in that manner, I should imagine you could not take much notice - when a man is in that situation he cannot make much observation - they rushed you down Barbican. - A. No, about six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was the shortest man, were you in the confusion competent to ascertain which was the shortest man among them. - A. He was the shortest man, I took notice of the colour of his coat, it was a light great coat; I catched my eyes upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of any body else's coat that was there. - A. There were two others with dark great coats, and some with short coats.</p>
               <p>Q. This a little astonished you. - A. Yes, and I dare say if you had been in my situation, it would have astonished you.</p>
               <p>Q. I know it would; so much so that I should not be able to say who was the shortest man - you getting among a parcel of riotous men, and losing your wife, must be very much flurried. - A. No, not at all.</p>


               <p>Q. Then you were not flurried. - A. No, I was in a frustration.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you known that your watch was in your pocket. - A. When I left my friend's house, No. 58, St. John-street, just by Hicks'-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. You had your eye upon the prisoner all the time. - A. Yes, he was before me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the others were behind you. - A. No, some were before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have seen them; have you always given the same account - A. Exactly. When a man states the truth, he cannot deviate from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same story. - A. Yes, I think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Never made the least deviation. - A. I do not say; I may have made a deviation in a word, the facts are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost you watch at the corner of Golden-lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said you lost it at the corner of Barbican by Long-lane. - A. I said that end of Barbican, the corner of Golden-lane; that was correct. In an instant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010032"/> I mentioned Long-lane instead of Golden-lane, and the alderman corrected me in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not always told the same story. - A. I said not in a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself positively to swear, that you saw this person, whom you never saw before in your life; that the prisoner was one of the party. - A. I will swear to the prisoner, that he was one of the party that hustled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coat - A. He put it on again, it was searched, there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>

I rather think I was going to speak; he said be silent, give me your watch, sir; I took out my watch and gave it him; I think I said to him, it is a metal watch, you had better not take it; he repeated be silent, your money; I took out my money and gave it to him, it was loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him. - A. I gave him two guineas, to the best of my recollection, and one or two shillings I said at the time, the money you are welcome to, but you had better give me my watch, it is a metal watch; he still repeated be silent, and held up his stick. The other man who kept close to me, put his hand upon the outside of my left hand breeches pocket, I told him there was nothing there but trinkets of no value, he had better not take them; I had forgot at the time that I had these ducats in the pocket, but they were packed up with some trinkets; he put his hand into the pocket and took them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of these ducats. - A. I understand about nine shillings a piece, they are Dutch coin. He then asked me for my pocket book, I told him that I had no pocket book; he repeated his demand, I told him I had none; he then quitted his hold of me, and said be off, sir; accordingly I stepped on two or three steps on the road, they urged me still to go on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. It was a fine night, but no moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish; and to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010033"/> the persons of the men that robbed you. - A. There might have been; if I had not been a good deal agitated, and the transaction took place a very short time, not above a minute or two. I can only speak to the impression it made in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity during the time this transaction happened, during the flurry you were in, of seeing the features of the men. - A. No, his features appeared to me small, and rather pale-faced.</p>
               <p>Q. What size in bulk. - A. He was not large made.</p>

From information I had from Bow-street office I had him taken in custody; when the constable came I told him what I had taken him for, that the watch had been stolen; he said he bought the watch; he did not tell me when nor where he bought the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that openly said, or in secret. - A. It was said in the tap room. The prisoner said I want such a thing myself, but I do not think I have got money enough to purchase it; the prisoner said how much do you ask for the watch, he said about four guineas, he said he had not got money enough to purchase it now; perhaps he might pledge it and make up the money. I saw him pull out two pounds myself, I saw the watch opened, I had it not in my hand, to the best of my recollection; I saw Cornhill inside of it; that is the watch, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 22nd of June, about half past ten in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the bar at our shop window; I then had suspicion that he was a tradesman like myself, waiting for my employer coming in, for a situation; I kept my eye on him for a few minutes, but not knowing his face, I took no further notice of him; I missed him from the window a minute or two, I saw him return to the window again, and I saw him lift a trunk off the top of the window; I then ran up into the street, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the trunk going towards Leadenhall-street; I pursued him and laid hold of him by St. Peter's-alley, Cornhill; I asked him how he came by that property, he said a gentleman told him to bring it with him and he would give him a shilling; I looked round, saw no gentleman, I brought him back to the shop; I then asked him who he was, he said his name was White, he was a fishmonger, residing in Holborn; I detained him till my master came in; I believe he had been drinking.</p>

               <p>Q. Which pocket was it. - A. My left hand side pocket; I felt her take it out of my pocket, and the moment that I disengaged myself from her, I charged her with the robbery; I called the watch; I observed just as she had attacked me the watchman was standing within two or three yards of her, of the name of Bennet; he did not take charge of her, but another watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010034"/> came up of the name of Cromack, he took charge of her, she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your pocket book - A. That I did not see; after she took my pocket book she put her hand behind, she passed it behind her I believe to the watchman Bennet; her head was situated so on my left shoulder so as I could not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your hands at that time. - A. My hands she artfully kept down.</p>
               <p>Q. How - A. By the method she used she clasped me round my body.</p>
               <p>Q. If she kept your arms down with both her hands, I do not know how she had one hand to spare to take your pocket book. - A. She got her left arm around my waist, and placed her body so close to the right arm, that both my arms were kept down; she laid hold of my left arm by her left arm, her arm was round me; she was taken to the watch house and searched by Cromack; nothing was found. Bennet has since absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long had you been at this public house. - A. I might be there doing a little business with a friend, about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking had not you. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were perfectly sober. - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life are you in. - A. I am a traveller; I deal in silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you travel for. - A. I am now collecting for a friend in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this. - A. About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your pocket book. - A. I have not; I had seen the note five minutes previous to my coming out of the house.</p>

On the 1st of June they came on the over night to work at twelve o'clock, when our family go to bed, leaving them up to work. Some little time after five in the morning my wife and I thought we heard our bar window open; we both got up, and my wife saw the prisoner Kendall get out of the bar upon her hands and knees; my wife asked her what she wanted there, she said that she had been into the bar for a bit of cheese; I dressed myself and came down and opened the bar, to see if I could find any thing missing; I found by the print of the saw dust that somebody had been in my bar I next examined my till, I found there were more more halfpence taken out of the till than there were left in the till. There was sixteen or seventeen shillings left in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you suppose there were taken out. - A. About fourteen or fifteen shillings, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010035"/> exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any silver. - A. There was no silver; we took that up the overnight with us; I desired my wife not to take any notice of it to the prisoner, but to let them finish their work. I sent for Ray the officer, and he searched the prisoners; there were nine or ten shillings found upon Kendall, and about three or four shillings upon Moulder; she said she received them from Kendall, she never was in the bar in her life. Ray the officer asked her how much money they had when they came into the house; they said they had only two or three halfpence; they said they had sent some liquor home to their lodgings. We searched their different lodgings.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 1st of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I went to Mr. Manwaring's house, where I found both the prisoners; I took them both into custody; I searched Kendall first; in her pocket was nighteen shillings of half pence and penny pieces and farthings; there was one paper done up; she seemed very much alarmed, downed upon her knees, and begged for mercy. On the other prisoner Moulder I found about three shillings in penny pieces and farthings; she said she was very sorry, and begged that Mr. Manwaring would not hurt her. I went to Moulder's lodgings, where I found a bottle of vinegar, and a bottle of rum and brandy, it seems to be mixed; she said that it belonged to Mr. Manwaring, they had taken it out of the bar. Then I went to Kendal; there seemed to be just the same quantity found there.</p>

             of Bow employed you to bring any thing for him. - A. Yes, one hundred quarters of malt from Rotherhithe, from Mr. Northcote's; and forty-five quarters two bushels, from Messrs. Sawyer and Williams; I gave Briscoe the order to fetch it, and to hire sacks for it. On the 23d of April, in consequence of information, I told Briscoe that he had sold Mr. Cherry two quarters of malt; he replied, I know I have; he said he had it over at Northcote's; I asked him if he had hired the sacks on my account; he said no; he gave me the sack ticket for two hundred and ninety sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sack hire ticket that was delivered to you. - A. It is; he told me the sacks were in the barge's hold. I went and brought four sacks marked R W out of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from Briscoe they were the sacks that delivered the malt to Cherry. - A. I did; he said he supposed Ward's men had by mistake put four sacks too many; he said he threw the sacks down at Northcote's, and he supposed they filled them.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you understood from him that he threw down four sacks too many, and Northcote filled them four sacks by mistake. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more sacks in the barge. - A. No, not when I took them out. I saw Mr. Cherry about two or three days after I had his conversation with Briscoe; as soon as I accosted Cherry I said to him, I wish you would not buy malt of my man; he said he knew he bought it and they had a right to it, as it was over, as they had put up four sacks more than the quantity. I sent the four sacks home to Mr. Ward, and I had a return ticket for two hundred and ninety-four sacks. I saw Briscoe the next day, I told him that I should acquaint the parties with it; he said I had better let it drop. When I spoke to Cherry, he said he bought it fair enough in Halliday's tap room, they had a right to all that was over, as they paid for all that was lost; he said we wanted it ourselves, or else we should not make that stir about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the trade of barge master. - A. About three years; I never heard of any such practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you want that corn, or should you have brought it home if you had seen it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Ingleton by at the time you had these conversations. - A. Yes, she said if there were no receivers there would be no thieves; he replied that he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You are the owner of this barge. - A. No, Mr. Hearn is the owner, I am not a free lighterman.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to Rotherhithe. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of what was delivered there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that was passing at the time the barge arrived. - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. He was about leaving you at this time. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was leaving you to go to a person of the name of Kettlewell, in whose service he was when he surrendered to meet this case. - A. I understood he was going there.</p>

               <p>Q. He was a very good servant. - A. He certainly was.</p>

As soon as ever Mr. Hodson heard of it; about a fortnight after it happened; it had been talked of in the neighbourhood, and Mr. Hodson heard it, he communicated it to Mr. Northcote; we went before sir D. Williams to get a warrant, he heard our story and refused it. Then we went to Worship-street office, we had a warrant granted us there.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 20th of April last, did you deliver any malt to the prisoner Briscoe for Mr. Hodson. - A. I delivered one hundred quarters in sacks; he came in a barge, and brought the sacks to receive it, a hundred quarters of malt would fill two hundred sacks, I was present at the delivery, I did not count the sacks; I wrote a note for the delivery of one hundred quarters, that is the note; I gave it to Briscoe to carry to Mr. Hodson, (the note read), it was pale malt of a very good quality. I afterwards went to Cherry's, she brought me a handful of malt, which I really believe to be of the same quality of that malt I sent to Mr. Hodson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of it. - A. Seventy seven shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Be so good as to tell us the mode that is pursued at your malt house, to prevent more malt from being delivered than is ordered. - A. When the barge comes to the wharf; when the people are at leisure they go into the barge and fetch the empty sacks, which are in bundles of twenty sacks each bundle; these are carried into the malt room, and there told over, then they are doubled up in one fold; and the twenty sacks is laid open and reversed, to denote that is for ten quarters; when they have told out two hundred sacks, then they tell out two hundred strings to tie them; they are told out the same as the sacks, and laid twenty strings in a bundle; then the delivery note of an hundred quarters is given to the bargeman, to take to Mr. Hodson; Briscoe goes from my malt house down to the barge; the sacks are filled and delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was directed by you for the purpose of preventing any mistake or fraud. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If this had been pursued, is it possible for more than two hundred sacks to be delivered. - A. It is highly improbable; I was present at the whole of the delivery, my being present if there had been any more than the regular quantity, I believe I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count the sacks yourself, or stand over your servants while they counted them. - A. I believe the sacks were counted previous to my going into the malt house.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether they had been counted correct or incorrect, you had not any opportunity of knowing. - A. I should distinguish that while the malt was filling in the sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count them. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot be able of your own knowledge to say whether they filled two hundred or two hundred and four without counting. - A. I think I should without counting.</p>


               <p>Q. How soon after the delivery of these sacks, did you receive any information. - A. The first information I received was from Mr.

               <p>Cherry's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I rejoice at the day having arrived that I hope to be restored to peace and honour by your acquital. On the 22nd of April Briscoe was on shore at the Dog and Partridge; I called in the public house to look at the paper, when he informed me that he was going to leave Mr. Baker's lighter and that he had also some malt to sell I asked him if it was his own; he said yes, and he would sell it to whom he pleased; I then said let me have a sample if I like it I will give you a fair price for it I found the malt was tolerably good but mixed; I told him I could not give him more than seventy shillings a quarter for it. On Friday the first of May I paid him seven pound for it and took a stamp receipt for it; a few days afterwards Mr. Baker told me I had bought some malt of his man; I most readily told him yes I had. My servant will prove that it was done most publickly, it was brought along the public road into my shop-door, no concealment being made nor requested by me; and my personal surrender before the magistrate to give evidence to prove my innocence, and shewing a sample of the malt to Mr. Northcote, and offering to give it up before the magistrate; my keeping the malt seven weeks, when I might have removed it, must also afford a demonstration of my innocence. Gentlemen, some of you may censure me of being guilty of imprudence, and that you would have acted otherwise; but, gentlemen imprudence is not guilt; and for my imprudence already my punishment is more than I can bear; already to become the companions of felons in guilt, and to expect the taunts of my enemies, which your acquittal cannot prevent. As to my own fate I have suffered more than death. I have a tender wife and two infant daughters, which I love; it is for them I am anxious; it is for them you must decide.</p>
               <p>Briscoe called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cherry called sixteen witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in the pocket book. - A. Three ten pound note, two ten pound drafts, and two indentures of the apprentices; one of them was the indenture of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the drawer. - A. No, I believe the prisoner was out at the time I put it there; he returned about eleven o'clock, I was below stairs; he went into the shop up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass the room where you slept to go to the shop. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bed room door locked. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband during this time. - A. My husband went out just as the prisoner came in; my husband returned at two o'clock, and a few minutes after that the prisoner went out; about three or four o'clock my husband went up for the pocket book; he missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time find any bank notes upon the floor of your room. - A. I did, in the parlour; that was two or three weeks following; I found five one pound bank notes, at the time I picked them up the prisoner was in custody</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in that room before he was taken in custody. - A. Just before.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember on Sunday the 10th of May - do you remember your wife putting any pocket book of yours in the drawer. - A. No; on Saturday night I received the ten pound notes; I told my wife to put them in my pocket book, and to take care of them. On Sunday the 10th of May I had occasion for some money; I asked her where the pocket book was; she told me it was in the looking glass drawer, in the bed room. I went and looked for it and it was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner on suspicion that he had done this. - A. Yes, I apprehended him on Tuesday the 19th of May; upon searching him the officer found a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece; on Monday he stopped out all night, and on the Tuesday I apprehended him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any watch before that time. - A. Not to my knowledge; and there was another watch found in the lath and plaster in the room where the prisoner slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found in the room near where the prisoner was, when the officer took hold of him. - A. Not on the same day, that was the day after; there were five one pound notes found much about the same spot as he stood when the officer searched him, and found a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You found on his person a watch, a one pound note, and a seven shilling piece. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow your apprentices over money if they work. - A. Yes, he can get from five to seven shillings a week for himself; he has lived with me eight years, I always found him honest.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time your master having left his pocket book on the desk in the shop. - A. Yes, about two months before; Meaking saw it, he opened it, he said his indentures were in it; he took them out and put them in again; one night afterwards he stopped out rather late, and master scolded him for it; he told me if he could get his indentures he would not stop; he told me if I should see them to give them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when your master's pocket book was missing. - A. Yes, it was on a Sunday; the next day Meakings told me if I would keep a secret he would give me a watch; I told him I would; he said he had got a pocket book, and he brought the watch home at night; he did not say whose pocket book it was, nor what he had done with it; afterwards he told me that he had burned the two papers that were in the pocket book, that was two drafts I suppose. On Monday night he brought me a watch, he put it in the wall in the bed room in the back parlour; he said I might take it, after it had been there some time; and in the course of a week I saw him put two guineas in the window frame of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Alley. You are this man's apprentice - did you happen to be taken in custody for this yourself. - A. Yes, on Wednesday week after the pocket book was lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the back parlour of the prosecutor's house. - A.

            , I live at No. 30, Broad-street, St. Giles'. I am a silversmith and salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that watch - do you remember selling that watch to any body. - A. I sold it on Saturday evening, the 16th of May, for five guineas, to two young men, they appeared like blacksmiths; I am not certain as to the identity of the prisoner; the other watch was sold out of my shop, but I cannot recollect when; I have some recollection of the prisoner, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

            . Q Do you keep the York hotel in Charles-street, Covent Garden. - A. Yes, it is in the parish of St. Pauls, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the keeper of the house, are you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Newton sleeping at your house. - A. Yes, he came to town on the 23rd of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time he went up stairs. - A. It was between one and two o'clock when Mr. Newton went to bed; he went to the theatre that night and the theatre was very late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Sparks lodge at your house that night. - A. Yes, he came between ten and eleven o'clock, he asked if he could have a bed. I looked at him, and after some hesitation I told him he might, as he was drest genteel and respectable; he ordered a glass of brandy and water, and sat down in the coffee room, he sat there till near two o'clock, till the coffee room was quite clear. I desired the waiter to give him a bed pair of slippers, and a bed candle, and to shew him his room, which he did; and he went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his room near that in which Mr. Newton slept. - A. The adjoining room. After he had gone up stairs I went up to bed in nearly a quarter of an hour; I went to my own room, which is in the next floor above to where the prisoner, lay; I shut my door to, and had partly undressed myself, I heard some little noise, as if some person was opening a door or moving about the passage; it was a very trifling noise; knowing there was a stranger in the house, I opened my door to see what it was, I saw a light, and by my opening the door it made some little noise, and the light vanished away, it was gone; I stopped outside of the door a minute or two till the light came again; I then went down two stairs, in doing that the stairs made some little noise, and the light went away again; I was then sufficiently got enough down the stairs to see the door of the prisoner's room stood at that time a-jar, and the light was in his room; I concluded that it was not right for him to have the door open; I stopped where I was for the space of ten minutes, then I saw him come out with the candle in his hand, he was undressed, he slept in the room No. 5, he came across the passage and went into the room No. 3.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Newton's. - A. No, no person slept in that room that night. He then went to the drawers, which he opened one by one; I stood on the stairs and heard him open the drawers one by one; there were just five drawers, he opened four, one was locked. I was then fully satisfied what his intention was. I went into the room to inform Mrs. Stonnard, and when I was comming down the stairs again, the stairs made further noise; the prisoner ran into his room again, and locked the door; when the prisoner had locked his door he could not unlock it again. In the same room where he slept, in the cupboard, were some trunks of a gentleman; I was afraid he was trying to open them, I found them safe afterwards. I called one of my waiters up to get an officer, that I might give the prisoner in charge; one of the waiters went out and got an officer, I went down stairs myself just after the waiter was gone; and while I was down stairs I heard the prisoner come out of his room with a candle in his hand, he was naked; one of the maid servants at that time was on the stairs, she called to him; I was at the bottom of the stairs below; I heard her call to him. I ran up stairs and went into his room, the prisoner pretended to be much frightened; I insisted upon his going out of the house directly; I told him I knew what his intention was. I looked in the cupboard and found every thing was safe.</p>

               <p>Q. You having no reason to suppose that he had taken any thing let him go. - A. Yes, I told the officer to let him go, and he went away. The next morning Mr. Newton asked me if I had seen his watch, if he had left it in the coffee room on the over night; I told him no. In consequence of that I went to the office, got an officer; we went to No. 4, Leather-lane, where the prisoner had stated he lived; we there learned that he was at a house, No. 7, Earl-street, Seven Dials; we went there, and there we saw the prisoner coming from a house No. 7, Earl-street, Seven Dials. We searched him and took the watch out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the latch catched when you went out. - A. I did not try to see whether it caught; when I opened the door and found a man in the passage, I asked him who he was, he had a bundle under his arm; he said he wanted a person of the name of Wilson; I told him there was no such a person lived in the house; then he walked out of the house, taking the bundle with him.

Immediately the girl went out of the court I run out in the road after the girl, who informed me that the bundle belonged to that house; I could not find her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to feel in your pocket between Kingsland and St. Paul's church yard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you felt in your pocket book, and perceived your pocket book safe in it. A. When I was rather beyond the church door in St. Paul's church yard I felt in my pocket, it was safe then. When I got rather beyond the print shop, the two elder ones of the prisoners they were very troublesome to me indeed; the tallest one was as close to me as she could; I had a young woman with me, she separated me from her; I do not say that they robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the shorter of the two elderly women. - A. She was before me; the taller of the two was very troublesome indeed with pushing me about.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people very near to you. - A. Yes, but they were not troublesome, they appeared to be in company together, the tall one and the shorter. When I first went into St. Paul's church yard they seemed to select me out to push me about; they were one before me and the other behind me, and both of them were near enough to touch me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the tall woman then. - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pushing at all violent. - A. Particularly the tall one; I pushed her off from me as the crowd were about; I was a good deal pushed about; when I came to Ludgate Hill I went into a friend's; then I found I had lost my pocket book and the note.

               <p>Q. Were you in St. Paul's church yard the day the charity children were. - A. I was on duty at the north door. After I had information I followed the three women, I saw them hustle several people; I saw the three prisoners in company together, they were going in a direction from Cheapside to Ludgate Hill; Hart and I watched them till they got to a good many people, at Newberry's corner of Ludgate Hill; we could see them hustling about for six or seven minutes, but we could not see their hands for the quantity of people that were about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all catch sight of Mrs. Winter at this time. - A. I did not; all at once they all three took a start, and went through London House yard into Pater-noster-row; I told Hart to come along, they had got something; in Pater-noster-row I laid hold of

               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Watson, and did you see some of your property there. - A. I went to Mr. Watson's. and I afterward went to Mr. Purse, a pawnbroker in London Wall, and there Mr. Mill, the clerk, shewed me eight pieces of shawl belonging to our firm; I had no doubt of their being our property; the names were on the shawls in full length; he had not taken the precaution of taking the names off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see after that any piece of British calico. A. I saw one piece; the officer brought it down stairs from the room in which he lodged, and two single shawls.

               <p>Q. How lately had any been brought to you. - A. On the 17th or 18th of May; he then brought two pieces.</p>

Yes, they are part of the eight pieces that were shewn to Mr. Peel; Mr. Peel claimed them as his own; I have got them here, but they are so much alike I cannot distinguish them, they are of two patterns; I produce the eight pieces; I took in six of them myself.</p>

On the 19th of May, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010042"/> seven o'clock in the evening I went to Mr. Peel's, Lawrence-lane; I rung at the bell, and the prisoner opened the door, and told me that he had looked out the goods for me; he took me into the warehouse, and shewed me about ten pieces of them; I asked him then if he was a partner in the house, he told me he was not, he was only a warehouseman; I then asked him whose goods they were, he told me that they were Mr. Peel's; I asked him whether Mr. Peel knew I was buying these goods, or of his selling them; he said he did not know it; I told him he was doing very wrong in selling Mr. Peel's goods without his knowledge; he then told me I might have any goods I saw in the warehouse, to the amount of several thousands worth; I might pick them out, and he would sell them me; I told him I would have nothing to do with the shawls, as they were not his own. I gave information to Mr. Watson, who formerly belonged to Mr. Peel's house.</p>

On the 29th of May, the prisoner came in the shop to look at a pasteboard bonnet shape; I asked her six-pence for it, she said it was too much; she would look at some ribbons, I shewed her some ribbons, and she fixed upon a primrose ribbon, and said she should like a mazarine blue of the same width; I shewed her that, and then I missed the primrose ribbon. I took hold of her hand, and the ribbon fell from under her left arm. She begged for mercy.</p>

I searched his clothes and found nothing; I made a further search in his lodgings; I found the banker's book, containing the banker's check of one hundred and eleven pounds, and the bill of exchange for twelve pounds seventeen shillings; he then says I will tell you all about it. He said that he had the two fifty pounds bank notes in his fob pocket, and that he suspected Dalton had picked his pocket of them; he said the other two prisoners were to meet him at the Crooked Billet. I afterwards found the other prisoners at the Crooked Billet. Papps told me that he was at Merlin's Cave playing at skittles, they were almost drunk, he had lost them there, Dalton had picked his pocket; Dalton seemed offended at Papps accusing him of picking his pocket.</p>

            . On the 9th of June I received information of a burglary committed upon Saffron-hill; myself and Chapman went down Saffron-hill, knowing disorderly persons that lived in White's-yard, Saffron-hill. We then watched there; one of the persons was pointed out as supposed to be one of the persons that committed that burglary. I watched; after that I saw Barker come out in company with a young woman, whom he keeps; I took him in custody on suspicion of that burglary. The consequence was two or three days afterwards the prosecutor made application to the office to know if there was not a person of the name of Barker in custody. I told him there was.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Barker before - A. Yes, perfectly well; in consequence of that, with the magistrate's approbation, I took the prosecutor down; immediately he saw Barker, he said he was one of the men. The prosecutor told me there was a girl that knew more of the robbery than he did; I took a summons, left it with her father, she appeared, she swore to Barker, and told me of the other, Engan.</p>
               <p>Barker Mr. Trott is giving that girl presents every day, because she is to have eighty pound to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Ridley) Have you had any money. - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Barker. You told Margeret Engan so. - A. I did not, I have not had one halfpenny given me. I am in danger of my life for speaking the truth.</p>

            . I live partly by graizing, and partly upon a copyhold estate, in the marsh at Hackney. On the 21st of May, the prisoner came to my house at Hackney, he asked me if I had any grass to let, I told him I had plenty, I was going to open a field. On that same day he turned in a black cropped horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him. - A. No, I had never seen him to the best of my knowledge before, I enquired of him where he lived, and as it was in the new neighbourhood at Hackney, the new buildings, I did not think it necessary to enquire. On Thursday he came again, and asked me if I would let him turn in another horse; I told him I could for a guinea a month; being a small horse, and he a name sake, I was rather inclined to favour him. I heard no more of the black horse till the 9th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was leaning over the hatchway of my outward premises; a neighbour coming by said, there is a strange piece of work down in the new neighbourhood; I heard no more of it till Atkins came for the horse; I had suspicion that the horse was not honestly come by; I followed Atkins, Salmon and the prisoner, they were all three together. I saw the prisoner in the act of haltering the black horse, they had got in the field; I said, generally, I addressed myself to neither of the three. I hope you are not going to take this horse out without paying me for keep, if you are it is very unusual; Atkins replied, I do not know that we shall pay you for the keep, for I conceive this horse is stolen, and I shall take it away; I said I thought myself justified in detaining it. They gave me their address; from that time the horse was out of my possession. That horse was in my possession from the 21th of May, till the 9th of June.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 9th of June I in company with Atkins, apprehended the prisoner at the bar in Hackney field; we asked the prisoner what he had done with a little black horse he had at Leicester, and whether he had sold him; he paused a little; he then said he had not sold him, if we would give him leave to walk with us, he would show us where the horse was; accordingly we all three went together; he pointed out the horse in the field; he said that is the horse, if you will give me leave, I will catch him; he accordingly catched the horse, put a halter on him, and delivered him into my hands; he said that was the horse that he had from Leicester. Mr. Baxter has seen it and has sworn to it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOX. I am servant to Mr. Baxter On the 19th of May the prisoner came and asked to hire a horse to go to Hinkley, which is thirteen miles from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010046"/> Leicester. He said he was going of a very unpleasant errand. he was going money hunting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I do not know that I did; I saddled and bridled the poney for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he to return. - A. The next morning at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to pay. - A. Ten shillings, he hired it for two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse since. - A. Yes, I saw him in Lincoln's Inn fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you shewn the horse by Salmon. - A. Yes, I knew the horse very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose horse is it. - A. Mr. Baxter's, the black one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner describe where he lived when he came to you at Leicester. - A. No, he did not say five words to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You say he hired him to take a journey from Leicester to Hinkly. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you agree that if he kept him longer, he was wellcome to do so, provided he paid five shillings a day. - A. No, he said he would come back the next day at ten.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) You have seen that horse. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it, a black gelding. - A. Yes, a black gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it. - A. I had it on the 26th of March, when I entered on that public house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Pearce) Did you find out where he lived. - A. No, I did not know any thing of him; he lived in the new buildings, knowing they were all new inhabitants, I made no enquiry.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday she told me she had lost a gown, and that it laid between me and the woman in the two pair of stairs, and that the pawnbroker knew the person; I told her I would go with her to the pawnbroker's or to any magistrate; she turned the woman out of doors, she said she did not think it was me. It was pawned in my sister in law's name; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

About one o'clock, when I fastened the house up and went to bed myself, I unlocked this table drawer; I found this money deficient; I suspected the prisoner, he being drunk. I went up stairs, I found him on the bed with his clothes on; I awoke his comrade that was with him, and then I awoke him; I asked him what money he had got about him, he said none at all; I searched him. In his fob pocket. I found four one pound notes, a half guinea, two shillings, and two sixpences; in his jacket pocket I found a screw driver, with which he forced the lock; it exactly corresponded with the hole where he had been forcing the lock; I asked him how he came by that money, he said it was not his, nor had he it in his possession; I put him in the watchhouse. On the following morning I found all the remainder of the money except sixteen shillings and sixpence. I told him if he would return me the property I would forgive him.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, from agitation which every man must feel, being in this awful situation, together with the confinement of a prison, so overcomes me that I am not able to give my defence, without the indulgence of this honourable court in permitting this to be read. My lord and gentlemen, in the first place I am a sworn broker and appraiser; I am now in the fifty ninth year of my age; my conduct hitherto has been irreproachable. I have an ailing wife and four children, two of which are solely dependent on me for support. On the afternoon mentioned, I had been to Tottenham Court Road, to destrain goods for some rent for Mr. Dixon in the Old Bailey. After I left Mr. Dixon, I went into Fleet market, and was asking the price of some peas; and before I could turn round, the prosecutor or some person got hold of me, and said I had got their handkerchief; my answer was candid and honest, I said I had never seen him or his handkerchief. The market at this time was crowded, and no doubt with people of various descriptions; I was immediately laid hold of, and was informed the handkerchief was taken from off the ground. The prosecutor before the alderman said that I dropped the handkerchief on the ground, but from the crowd that were about at the time, I think it impossible for him or any man to distinguish from whom it fell. I solemnly declare that I never had the handkerchief in my possession. - Gentlemen, so far from the prosecutor knowing me to be the person that robbed him, he was not even aware that he had lost his property, till a woman pointed out me to him; whether she did it through ill will or malice, I cannot state; I think the latter from the best information; I learned that I did destrain the goods of this very woman, which so pointed me out. This is the manner she has chosen to be revenged of me, for the distress I brought upon her as she thought; whereas I did only the part of a broker. Gentlemen, if ever the case of innocence deserved the protection of a British jury, this does; I was dragged to a prison, and put to a great expence, entirely through a foolish woman, who would sacrifice the miserable life of an old man, to gratify her revenge. I trust you have already received the impressions of truth in my favour; and that by your generous verdict, I shall be restored to my family.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) I want to know whether you can say you saw the handkerchief drop from the hand of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010048"/> prisoner. - A. I saw it drop by the side of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any person so near the side of him, that it could have fell from them. - A. There were other people before him; I saw it drop, I supposed it came from him; I did not see it in his hand, it is possible it may fall from one behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty whether it fell from him or any other person. - A. I saw it drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do very right to speak what is true, whatever may be the consequence of that truth; you are bound to speak the truth if you are conscious, and if you firmly believe it dropped from him, say so. - A. I am certain it dropped from him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Abbey. I stopped the prisoner when he had got about five yards from the gate, at his hour of going home from work; I brought him in and searched him, and found four quarters of cocoa upon him, in separate parcels; the prisoner said he was very sorry, and he hoped to obtain Mr. Abbey's pardon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of this charge, I never robbed my master; that pound of cocoa is not my master's property, nor never was; I bought it of a man at the Blossoms inn, I gave him five shilling for it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the shop. - A About twenty minutes; she bought the stockings at sixteen pence; I did not miss the stockings, there was a lady in the shop that gave me a jog on the arm. I am sure I saw the gloves and the stockings on the counter while the prisoner was in the shop. In consequence of the lady jogging my arm, I placed myself in such a manner as to watch her going out, she dropped a glove as she was going out in the middle of the shop, I accused her of it; she said the child had taken it up with the stockings that she had bought perhaps; I cast my eye round, I saw all the gloves hanging out of her pocket; I took hold of her and turned her round the shop, and while I was attempting to search her pockets, she threw the gloves and stockings both down.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of gloves. - A. Seventeen pair of gloves, and three pair of stockings; I saw her pull them from her pocket, the stockings were black worsted, the same as she had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not see her in the act of taking them. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about this. - A. She said she had not got them.</p>

            . Q. Was the prisoner at the bar your lodger. - A. Yes, she took possession of the lodgings on the 15th of June for herself, two rooms on the first floor, at half a guinea a week. On the 23d,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010049"/> not approving of her conduct, I gave her a week's warning, that she was to quit on the 29th. On Saturday she went out loaded with two bundles; which gave me reason to suspect that she had got more than her own. I followed her and overtook her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell me where your dwelling is. - A. Kingsland-road, near the turnpike. I followed her near a mile, the went to Islington; I observed a bundle that looked like sheets; I then told an officer the circumstance; he stopped her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to wash the linen. - A. My wife; when the constable stopped her, we found both the sheets and a great many other things. The sheets were not dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she had them. - A. A week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were not over and above clean. - A. She said she was taking the sheets to be washed</p>
               <p>Q. And she had dirty sheets with her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had paid you for her lodgings. - A. Yes</p>

               <p>Q. How far was it that you saw the track of that cart from where your boat was. - A. About a mile. I discovered the cart by the track of this place where it stood; that it had been secreted in a field; there was the track of the horse's feet in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Shoulder of Mutton field. - A. It is nearly opposite; it is on the right hand side going towards Twickenham, there is a field within twenty yards of this bridge; there I saw where the horse had stood, by the impressions of the horse's feet having stood a long time. I traced the horse and cart from that field to the bridge; on looking at the ground where the tail of the cart had been; I there discovered grains of malt scattered about the field; I will say there was forty grains of malt where the cart had been; I took some of that malt up, it had the flavour and appearance of my malt; I then looked to see which way the cart went from there, and as I imagined, I saw it went over from Isleworth to Brentford; but previous to that I observed where this horse had stood, that on the near foot before the horse had a shoe off; that I observed near where the cart was standing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much trampling of the horse there. - A. There was, and that horse had scratched a good deal, as if he had gibbed, as if he did not go away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010050"/> very kindly from the spot. I made enquires of the watchmen, I got some information; in consequence of that I went to the magistrate, he granted me a search warrant against Hearn and others. I searched Hearn's house and found nothing. We searched Cradle's, and their in a room on the ground floor I found fifteen sacks of malt, the quantity lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had these sacks that you found. - A. They were marked W. Raymond on one side, and Richmond on the other, with red paint; our sacks are generally marked so. I can swear they are my sacks, and they contained malt.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you can swear to grain of that description, can you say it is the same sort of malt as you lost. - A. As near as a person can swear to it, it is mine; I believe it is the malt that was taken from my vessel; I have some of them both here; I had a sample left in the boat, and I believe it to be the same upon comparison.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the sacks. - A. The sacks cost me three shillings a piece, I will put them at two shillings. The malt is worth seventy two shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth twenty pounds. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to a man of the name of Ratcliffe. - A. I did; the horse was not at home, the horse had gone to the farrier's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Is any body interested in your business. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart stationed in the field, from where your barge was moored. - A. About a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that the only conveyance of your malt to this cart must be by boats. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much would be the value of a sack of malt, including the sack at two shillings. - A. The sack and the malt would be worth about thirty seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. A small boat would not carry many sack at one time. - A. The boat would carry fifteen sacks at one time, and rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in your malt from any other maltster's. - A. We colour your malt different from a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people may do it in the same way as you do. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You have been asked whether a wherry would carry fifteen sacks - did you afterwards see Rouse's boat. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that carry fifteen sacks. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Hearn's house. - A. The next day; in the afternoon I went to Cradles, and there I found the fifteen sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a sample left. - A. Yes, one part comes from what was lost, and the other from the bulk (a sample of each shown to the jury).</p>
               <p>Jury. There is not the least doubt but they are of one sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp (to prosecutor). Had you sold any malt of that flavour. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you sold any to Hearne or Cradle. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you sell the fifteen sacks out of that barge. - A. No, I do not recollect selling fifteen sacks to any individual. That is not the exact quantity.</p>

There were one or two, they were towing up of the horse's side; I did not take notice of them; Mr. Raymond came down just at the time I was calling out to Cradle. Mr. Raymond and I went ashore at Rail's head Ferry place; we observed at the foot of the bridge, that goes over the creek, a cart had been loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the cart stand. - A. Just at the foot of the bridge in Mr. Keare's field; we observed some scattered malt on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were standing there, did you make any observations of the place where the horse had stood - A. Yes, the horse had scratched a good deal, and had been very much loaded; it appeared as if he had struggled with the load; on the near foot before I observed the horse had no shoe on. I traced the cart over the bridge.</p>

I took him to a public house, I ordered him something to eat, and left him in the care of the constable of the town; after he had something to eat, he had a mug of ale, and half an hour after that he burst out crying; he said he was sent by Hearn and Cradle to get a cart, he went with the cart, he drove it into a field near Islworth; he waited there pretty near an hour and a half; Cradle and Hearn came up with some bags, filled with something, that he did not know; they put a quantity in the cart; as they were driving the horse out of the field, the horse gibbed, and would not carry the load; they took it back again to the boat, and ordered him to take the horse back again, which he did.</p>

               <p>On the morning of the 25th of June did you go to your pine house. - A. I was informed by my servant. I went to the pinehouse about nine o'clock in the morning; I found the door going into the garden had been broken open, and I saw one of the front lights of the pine house had been taken out, and that some one had entered the pine house; I saw a cavity there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pine apples were gone. - A. About thirty in all; two of them were ripe, and some were nigh ripe, and others were green.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing that gave you suspicion that the person who had done this, whoever he was, must have known the premises. - A. I had every reason to believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been your servant. - A. Yes, four months ago he was my <rs id="t18070701-60-deflabel372" type="occupation">gardener</rs>

               <p>Q. You came or sent to Covent Garden market directly. - A. I came to Covent Garden that same day; I have seen the pine apples at Bow-street; I have no doubt they are mine.</p>

               <p>Q. At what hour the next morning did you go to the pine house. - A. About seven o'clock I found the front light of the pine house pulled out, and about thirty two pines were cut from the plant; about eight or nine of them were ripe, the rest were green. On Saturday I came to London; I saw the pines at Covent Garden, and they were produced at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to any of them being your master's. - A. I can speak to one, it was a singular one; I had never seen the like before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the pine that you speak of being so singular. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the singularity of that pine apple. - A. They generally swell up here (describing it); about an inch from that it had been hurt in the root, and it came up with a double crown.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you never see one with a double crown before. - A. No, not both connected together, with a double crown, and not to swell at the top.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now look at the others, and tell me whether they are such as you raised. - A. Yes; I have every reason to believe they are the pine apples that were taken out of my master's pine house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lloyd, five miles beyond Croydon.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Thursday the 25th of June were you near Sanders's workhouse. - A. Yes, I was on horseback; that is three miles beyond Croydon; I overtook the prisoner, he was walking, he had green pine apples in a handkerchief, and ripe ones in a flag basket; he had a handkerchief, with a cabbage leaf inside of it, and some grapes; he was coming from Wineham to Croydon, and so towards town; I carried the basket and the handkerchief for him, they were tied together; he said he had started about one o'clock in the morning; this was about nine I believe when I saw him; he said the grapes were all of his own growing. I came three miles with him of the high road, and just as we came to the pay gate he turned off there; his stockings were torn, he said it was getting over Dubble Hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. No; I understood since that he lived at Dubble Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a great many people in your riding and walking together. - A. We met three men. I unluckily let one of the pine apples fall; one of these men picked it up, and said they found it; they brought it to our house, my mistress bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. BENTLEY. I keep a shop in Covent Garden market. On the afternoon of Thursday the 25th of June, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and offered me five pine apples; I told him they were too green, and they were not cut as in general they were to come to market; he told me they were just upon the turn, and if they were put in the window they would ripen in a day or two; he said he came from Croydon, just by Haydon park; I asked him why he cut them so; he said he generally cut them so to set them flat in a plate; we generally have the stalks about three inches long; some will come only an inch long, but none come in this way. He said he was a gardneer; I asked him if they were his perquisites; he said his master was a very good kind of a man, and never said any thing so long as he kept the table well supplied; I asked him if he should have any other kind of fruit to dispose of; he said he should in the course of the season have two or three dozen of peaches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the pine apples. - A. Yes, I gave him fifty-five shillings for them. I told him as I bought the pine apples of him, and they were not ripe, he should give me the refusal of the other fruit when he came to town. I put them in the window; Mr. Carpmeal and Frazer, the gardener, came together; they went into the parlour; I put the pine apples I bought of the prisoner on the table. They desired I would take care of them, which I did.</p>

The prisoner went to the opposite counter, and brought two of these pieces of gingham to the person that I was serving, that was with her she; asked the price of them, and commended the quality to a person who was with her; I sold three yards and a half of Irish linen to the person that she was with; and immediately upon their leaving the shop, I missed one of these ginghams; I went out of the door to look after them, and my young man was coming, I sent him after them.

In the course of the evening I received information where the gown was pledged.

            . I received information of Mr. Mathews of the robbery of this gown. I have been a number of times after these prisoners. I took him at his lodgings with the woman that he cohabits with, in Holywell-street; upon her I found the duplicate of the gown and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Grant's Defence. The prosecutor states that I robbed him of his gown. On that night he said that he had lost a gown; I said, Mr. Matthews, if you think I have robbed you of a gown, put me in charge of a constable. I told him that I came there, knowing that he took in working tools; he said no, be off about your business; I then said, I will be off. The man that was behind the counter, he said he saw two men come in, and one of them he believed had taken it; he went out to see, when he ordered me out, I said I will not go till your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010056"/> man comes back. I am innocent of robbing that man, and that he knows.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what day was these copper staken. - A. On the 22nd of May I had seen them there; three or four days before they were in a fixed state; one was in the back kitchen and the other was in the front kitchen; about seven o'clock on Friday morning I heard a noise in No. 20; it being an empty house I took the keys to go and see that every thing was right; I tried the latch, I heard that unfasten, but the lock would not open; I am certain that four or five days before I fastened the house, and nobody had been in but me; finding I could not get in I went back to No. 21, I went of a short message into St. Alban's street, I got a few yards from the house, I saw the prisoner with the two coppers upon his right shoulder; in the other hand he had got a basket, which contained a crow and a small saw, and some pick lock keys; I turned round and stopped him; I asked him where he was going with these coppers, he said he was going home with them, his master had sent him for them; I told him he must go back with me, I was confident they belonged to our house; he neither told me who was his master, nor where he was going to take them to, nor did I ask him. After I turned him round he put the two coppers on the second step of No. 20, the house they were taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had taken them from. - A. No, nor did I ask him; he kept the basket in his hand. I took him into the passage of No. 21.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master at home then. - A. He was; I told him that I had stopped the prisoner with two coppers belonging to No. 20.</p>

I had never seen her but once before, that was at the play house; an acquaintance of mine was with me that knew her; not knowing her I did not lend her the shilling; she had to come through the room where the lace and the spoon were to come to me; about a quarter of an hour after she went away I missed the spoon and the lace; the other prisoner did not stir out in the yard all the time. In consequence of this I went to the Circus to find Jones; I passed her on Westminster bridge, she called after me, and asked me if I was going to the Circus; I told her I was, but I did not mention any thing to her till she got to the house; the other prisoner was with her. I then asked Jones if she had seen any thing of a piece of lace and a silver tea spoon; she said she had not; then I beckoned to the other prisoner and asked her the same question, she burst out in tears, she told me that

The man and his wife; the prisoner staid about a quarter of an hour after them; when she went away I asked her if the basket belonged to her, she told me it did; then she went away; I did not see what was in the basket. A few minutes afterwards Cooper came in, he looked under the table; I asked him what he wanted, he said a basket; I told him the prisoner had taken it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. On the Monday fortnight I went to the magistrate, I said that was the woman as soon as I saw her; I am sure she is the woman that was sitting with Cooper and his wife, and that took the basket away.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police. On the 2nd of June I was on the river on duty at Limehouse Reach; I boarded a boat, in which was the prisoner and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the Middlesex side of the river, or the Kent side when you boarded the boat. - A. On the Middlesex side. I observed a bundle in the boat behind the back board: I asked her who that bundle belonged to, the prisoner said it belonged to her; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010058"/> what was in it, the prisoner said a mop; I told her I must examine it, then she said there were two pots, besides that there was a mop; in looking at the pots, I saw that they belonged to two publicans at Greenwich; one of them to Mr. Atkinson; the prisoner said she had borrowed them to measure fruit with; I took them in custody. I went to Mr. Atkinson, he claimed the pot.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One of the pots was lent to me, and the other was given me. I had them to measure my goosberries.</p>

            , No. 12, Swallow-street. On the 20th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I was going with a shopmate of mine near Hyde Park Corner gate, he was a little intoxicated, I was going to see him home; we had been drinking at the Pitt's head, Great Cumberland-street, Portman-square; that is the house where we are paid. It was near eleven o'clock when we left the house. I was a little in liquor too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your friend safe into the house. - A. No, I saw him through Hyde Park gate, he had got to go to Sloane-street; I thought he would be safe. I met the prisoner very near Hyde Park Corner gate.</p>
               <p>Q. You had got a little tipsy at this house, are you quite sure that you had any money about you when you left that house. - A. I am sure I had one guinea and four shillings; I was perfectly sensible of that, though I was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you joined in company with the prisoner. - A. Yes, I went with her to <placeName id="t18070701-77-crimeloc474">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070701-77-crimeloc474" type="placeName"

               <p>Q. That is all out of your way to Swallow-street. - A. I know it it is. I went to her lodgings in Pye-street, into a one pair of stairs back room; there was nobody in the room but she and me, when we went in I stopped some time there; I gave her three shillings as the place had so decent an appearance; then I wanted to come away, she refused to let me; she went out of the room; I heard her talk to a man on the stairs, which very much alarmed me; I was afraid to make any resistance; she came round me, and put her arms about my knees, and coaksed me to stop; she put her hand into my pocket, and took the guinea out; I had suspicion by her putting her hand down my side; I felt her hand, but I was not positive that it was in my pocket, it was in my right hand breeches pocket. I felt so much that excited suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a very different thing, you said she put her hand into your pocket. - A. I felt her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said both ways, attend to me - did not you say you believed her hand was in your pocket, because you felt it on your side, that gave you suspicion, and you have sworn that you felt her hand in your pocket. - A. I am sure I felt her hand in my pocket. I gave her three shillings; I am sure that I left the guinea and a shilling in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon feeling her hand in your pocket, did you afterwards put your hand into your pocket to feel if your money was gone. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given her the three shillings - here I must ask you a question - are you sure that you did not lye down on the bed. - A. No, by no means; I had no connection with her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you were in no posture, that it would fall from you. - A. I am sure of it; I had not fell down on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had suspected that she had taken your money what passed then. - A. I saw it in her hand; she said she would give it me back in the morning if I would stop all night; she would not give it me then; I refused stopping all night, I told her I should be glad if she would give it me then; she still refused and went out of the room and left me there; I waited about an hour and a half, she never returned; at the expiration of that time a man came in the room, he asked me how I came there, and accused me of breaking into his room; I told him no, I had not; I was brought in, I described the woman to him; he said she had broken open the door. This was Saturday night, I saw the prisoner on Sunday evening; and on Monday morning I saw her in her own apartment, then I charged the officer with her.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you never found your guinea or your shilling. - A. No.</p>

            . On Monday, the 22nd of June, I apprehended the prisoner at her lodgings, Duck-lane; I searched her, she had no money about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday night the prosecutor was very much intoxicated; he and his friend pushed against me. He went home with me, gave me three shillings, and went to bed; about half an hour after he was in bed, he said he could stop no longer, he must go. On Sunday morning he came to me, and asked me for the guinea; he said he would give me half if I would return him half; I told him I had not seen it, or else I would give it him with pleasure. He dropped his watch on the floor, I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did drop my watch, I catched it in my hand as well as she; it was owing to my own dexterity that I got it, or he would not have given it me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the lead that was so produced to you by the officer, such lead as you had about the premises. - A. I had great reason to believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you responsible to his majesty for the different property under your superintendence. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You are the superintendent on the building. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the building done on contract. - A. No, there is two master plumbers employed. We have a quantity of old lead, and we have erected a casting house there. The old lead is delivered to the two master plumbers, and they melt it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 26th of May the two prisoners were employed there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself weigh the lead to see there was a deficiency. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the workmen go away. - A. The plumbers at six, and the other workmen at seven; then the gates are shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the lead that has been produced by the officer, is any mark upon it. - A. There is no private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark private or public. - A. Not as I know of.</p>

            . I am a coach painter, I work for Mr. Comford; my master's shop where I work adjoins Mr. Ford's shop. On Friday the 22nd of May I heard somebody rattle the iron about in the next shop; it being five o'clock in the afternoon I knew it was the time for the men to be all at tea; I looked through the crevice of the boards of Mr. Ford's shop; I saw the prisoner standing against the door of the warehouse; he seemed confused and he was looking as if to see whether any body was coming into the shop; I looked through the party wall, I saw him try to get into the store room; he got part of the way in but could get no further; I got upon a carriage, so as to look over the party wall, I saw him attempting to get into the warehouse; he retreated back, came again, and ripped down another bar of the warehouse; then he went in, he began taking the brass coach door plates, he took some out the first time, and he came a second time; with that I called my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any in the presence of you and your master. - A. Yes, my master came and saw him; he went round and caught him; master asked him what he was after, he said nothing; my master replied you must be after something down there; he said he was looking for a piece of leather.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not break the place down, the place was broken down.</p>

I told him I was sure he was about something, I could see him, and he was in there taking the plates.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. I was sent for to take this man in custody; I searched him, I found nothing upon him but a few nails. These are the coach door plates, I found them in the body of a stage coach; and these plates I found at Mrs. Hill's, an old iron shop. The next morning the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done; I told him I thought he had a warning before.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of these plates are they worth five or six shillings. - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not put these coach plates in the stage coach. - A. No; I lost many before; I put them in that place; I could see my stock was diminished; he left only one out of eleven dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no leather to work with; my mistress told me to look about the warehouse; I put my arm in, and the pale broke in; I pulled out the leather, and two of the plates came out with it.</p>

On the 13th of June the prisoner came into my shop, I was then in the back warehouse; I came into the shop where he was looking at some leather; he placed one piece on the counter, I told him I thought he had some pieces of leather under his coat; I had suspected him for some time past; he denied it; I said that I was sure that he had; he pulled out one piece; I told him I was sure that he had got more; then he pulled out ten pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your leather. - A. I believe it to be my leather. He said he hoped I would forgive him, he had done it through distress, and his wife was laying-in.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the leather. - A. About twenty pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a customer of Mr. Barker's nine years; I went into his shop to buy some leather; I looked the leather out of the bin, I put it under my arm, as I thought, to put it on the counter; before I got to the counter Mr. Barker said I had got some under my coat; I did not know but I put it under my arm; in the act of stooping I put it under my coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of shoes from your shop at any time. - A. Yes On the 21st of May, about nine in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop to change a pair of shoes that she had not bought at the shop: I at last agreed to change them; she fitted on a pair; I papered them uy for her, and she gave me nine pence, which was the difference; she said her garter was down, she did not mind me, I was a married man; she went on the stairs to tie it up, I missed a pair of shoes from the place where she had sat, she came and sat down again and there seemed to be a riot in the street; she got up and was going out. I then said to her, I think you have got more about you than you should have; I asked her to go into the back room and deliver them up to my wife; she denied it; I sent for a constable; the shoes were found in her pocket. When the shoes were found upon her she said that she did not know she had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a little in liquor, I did not know that I had the shoes; I insisted upon having the constable sent for; he offered to let me go if I would pay for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She was a little in liquor; she denied having them, and insisted upon the constable being sent for.</p>

             I am a servant to Mr. Page, pawnbroker, 35, Wardour-street. On Saturday the 16th of May the prisoner offered this spoon to pledge; I asked her whose it was, she said it was her own, she had bought this and another, and four tea-spoons for two pound of Mr. Lightfoot, Bulstrode-street, Marybone; I asked her how long she had them, she said twelve months, and she had pledged the others in High-street, Marybone, but she did not know the name of the person; I then sent for an officer, he took her in custody, I went with him; going along she said if I would let her go she would tell me the particulars about it.</p>

On the 16th of May, the prisoner came to our house, she washed for us; she left our house between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day; between nine and ten I saw the spoon safe in the plate closet; the door was locked when I went up stairs; she brought the basket of linen to me, I told her to go down in the kitchen; the postman came with a letter, I went up stairs to get the money to pay for the letter; she opened the door then.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her. - A. No, when I came up the door was locked, and when I came down the plate closet door was open. The key was in the kitchen but not in the door.</p>

            . I am a watchman my box is near the Bull and Gate. On the 1st of June I had just called the hour of the night, when the prisoner at the bar came to me, he said you make a worse noise than a ship's corporal on board a ship but you have a better light; he was taken at the corner of Queen-street. He and I walked to the box close to the Bull and Gate, he asked me how <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>t was to the top of Holborn; I told him; and then sat down in my box; he had nothing with him then. About half an hour afterwards I went out, I saw him rolling something up in a cloth, I thought it was a bed quilt as he came out of the gate, the pocket being narrow, I saw what he had got; I asked him where he was going, he said to Gravesend, I took him by the collar and told him he should go to the watchhouse: he took the two cushions from his shoulder, they were covered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010062"/> up in a great horse rug; he said if I took him to the watchhouse he would cut my guts out, and struck me in the face.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, on the 1st of June last, I received directions from captain Fowler, of his majesty's ship Britannia, to come to London to look after my prize money. On my arriving at Gravesend, I took the boat to London; when I arrived at Billingsgate, I went with a girl of the town to the Bull and Gate, which is a house for the reception of prostitutes, and there at the corner of the gateway I saw a bundle, I took it up and swore I fell in with a prize. The watchman was calling the hour, he says you are half seas over, what prize is this you have got; I opened the bundle, I said they will do for my hammoc; I am an innocent far. I have served his majesty eighteen years, I was with lord Howe on the 1st of June; I have sailed with lord Duncan, and I was in the action of Trasalgar, with the immortal Lord Nelson.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Parr). Had he any girl of the town with him when you saw. - A. No, he was alone.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 14th of June, did you lose any thing from your shop. - A. The prisoner worked in the house. On the 13th of June, the prisoner brought a pair of shoes down to me that he had made; I was serving some customers at the time; and some more came in, I got him to serve them, and after he had served them, I perceived something in his pocket; another person came in, and while I was serving that person, he went up stairs into the workshop, where he and two others were working; he came down stairs almost immediately, that pocket appeared to be empty. While he was having his supper, I went into the workshop (he was the only lodger that was in the house then); I found five pair of shoes up the chimney. I let him alone till the 14th, which was Sunday; I watched him till about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard him come up stairs, and he went down almost immediately; he came up again and was some little time in the room, and he went down; instantly as he was gone I followed him; he went out of the door; a person that is here stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the shoes with him then. - A. Yes, they were tied up in a bundle; we examined the bundle and found the shoes. These were the shoes that were in the chimney piece; I looked there before I followed him. They are worth twenty-five shillings. The prisoner is a single man, and bore an honest character.</p>

On the 28th of May, between one and two o'clock, it was taken away; I had seen it five minutes before that time, it hung up by the side of the window for sale. I took the bonnet from the prisoner, as she was going into Little Pulteney-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the bonnet. - A. Seven shillings.</p>
               <p>SARAH HOOPER. I live at the Black Horse, Swallow-street. As I was going by Mrs. Benjamin's shop, I saw the prisoner take the bonnet and go away with it; I called to Mrs. Benjamin, she pursued her, and I saw Mrs. Benjamin take the bonnet from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going by the door, I picked up the bonnet a little distance from the door, this woman came after me and said I stole it. I gave her the bonnet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a glass oil cover at any time. - A. Yes; the last time I saw it was within three months of the present time; it was not sold, because a part of it was defective; it was put in a glass case in the back shop; it is worth about six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You had not seen this for some time before the 10th of July; you say it is defective, and therefore it being not a complete article it could not be sold; have you not many servants that serve in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They may have sold it for any thing you know, though it is not usual. - A. All the servants that ever sell are here, they can speak to their own knowledge; the prisoner was a <rs id="t18070701-90-deflabel550" type="occupation">cleaner of glass</rs>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. On the 10th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I received information that a parcel of people frequented the lodgings of the prisoner, at his mother's in Lilley-street, Saffron-Hill; they have only one room in the one pair of stairs; there I found the glass article in a box, among some old rags. The prisoner was laying in bed, there was two bed, there was two bedsteads there; I asked him whose glass oil cover that was, he said it was his, and he worked for Mr. Parker and Mr. Perry. I have shewed the glass oil cover to Mr. Perry, he claimed it. The prisoner said he was allowed all the glass that was cracked; I said here is not all cracked glass here.</p>

I examined the house, I found they were gone, I pursued Gudger to the third field, I came up to Colley, he had them upon his shoulder; Gudger was about thirty yards a head, I put my hand upon the bag I told him to stop, he said for what; I said he had my property, Colley immediately put the bag down, and stood along side of it; I ran up to Gudger, and catched hold of his shoulder, he said what is the matter; I told him he should go along with me, and just as he came up to Colley, he began to cry, and said he hoped I would not hurt him; I told him I would not hurt him no more than the law would allow: I would hang him if I could, for we had been robbed so many times before; he said he had taken them out of the house, between three and four in the morning; I told Colley to take the iron up, and follow me; Colley said Gudger was to give him a pint of beer to carry it; Gudger said he was the only person that took it; he was to give Colley some beer for carrying it.</p>

I did, on the 15th; I brought down a portmanteau; Mr. Jaques claimed a towel that was in it; I searched the room afterwards, I found three papers of nails in the closet, I took them to Mr. Houlditch; they claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you about four or five o'clock in the afternoon of that day. - A. At about five o'clock I was at the Three Crowns, in the Old Jewry; there I received information that a man had shot two men, and they wanted a peace officer to go and take him; I went in company with Sherrin, my brother officer, to <placeName id="t18070701-93-crimeloc569">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. What I want to know is this, was there any alarm in the crowd of what had been done. - A. I do not recollect particular that there might; when I got to the door, I was going to pull my staff out, some person thought it was not adviseable to pull my staff out, and told me to be careful, for he was armed. I looked up the passage, I saw Mr. Garren standing at a passage door, up the passage; there is a door that parts two passages; there are two doors close together, and a passage to each; I saw him at the passage door with a pistol in each hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, and saw the crown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010064"/> about the house, did you then generally understand whether any mischief had been done. - A. I do not recollect whether there was any thing about mischief mentioned; I was anxious to get the man; I did not go up the passage to meet him, I went through a door in the passage, into a hardware shop, and went into the kitchen, at the back of the hardware shop; there I saw Mr. Garren's daughter and Barber the sheriff's officer. The door of the kitchen was fastened on the inside with a cross wooden bar, and I think Barber took the bar down, and the door was opened; and when I first saw him, I was nearly opposite of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How far distant were you from him, when you first saw him. - A. Not more than three yards, if so much; I said what is the matter Mr. Garren, you know me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you. - A. I think he must, I knew him; I have been in the habit of meeting him in the street frequently; I have conversed with him about a dozen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in the street, did he appear to know you. - A. I have sometimes bowed to him when I passed, and he returned it; and sometimes we passed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have bowed to him in the street, have you ever had your staff. - A. Never to shew it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him he knew you, what answer did he make. - A. I do not recollect any thing. I am sure he had both the pistols in his hands I went up close to him; by this he got into the other passage were the stairs (as I understand) led up to his apartments; he got about two yards from where he first stood, we were face to face; I took the opportunity of striking his right hand with my left, to make him drop the pistol. but he did not drop it; he was not pointing the pistol towards me, he was holding it down; when I found that he did not lose his hold I took my right hand and laid hold of him by his left arm, and threw him on the stairs and threw myself upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do that for. - A. Thinking he might shoot me, and to secure him, and to take the pistols from him; when I threw myself upon him he he turned one of the pistols at my head, and I kept it down; he turned the muzzle of the pistol towards my head as I was laying upon him, he was upon his back and I was upon my belly; I kept the pistol down with my left hand, and it went off almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he pointed it towards you so that the contents might reach you. - A. I believe so I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of this pistol going off. - A. I had the flash in my face, it was black; I received no injury at all. The contents of that pistol lodged in the skirting board; Sherrin will produce you the piece of wood, he took it out afterwards; both the stairs and the skirting board were penetrated by the firing of the pistol. I then got the pistols from him; after I had got both the pistols from him he reached out his hand to catch the pistol; there were plenty of help then, he was secured. The other pistol I took in company of Bennet to Bartholomew-lane; here is the contents of it, it was loaded with five small pieces of lead and some gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. It is a dozen years since you and Mr. Garren spoke together. - A. I do not know that it is as much as that, it is a good many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in the street, having known him as a clergyman, you pulled off your hat. - A. I seldom pulled off my hat; I sometimes bowed to him but seldom did that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first of all went to his house, upon seeing him in the passage, you went round and got this door open, and got into the passage; was there a considerable noise in the front of him. - A. In the front, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. He was looking towards the street when you first met him. - A. No, he turned round to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You chucked him upon the stairs and threw yourself upon him. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person join with you in laying upon him. - A. I cannot say, my attention was too much upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether Sherrin was upon him or not you cannot say. - A. He was not upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was upon you. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistol was turned towards your head, you took hold of it with your left hand and turned it down - A. I turned it down; I cannot say whether it was my right hand or left; I think it was my left.</p>
               <p>Q. You had touched it with your left hand before it went off. - A. I think I did, for it went off just at the instant that I touched it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the powder of the flash discoloured your face. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume your laying hold of it with your left hand was rather a sudden act. - A. My hand was not near the trigger.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the pistol turned toward you you gave it a sudden snatch. - A. It was a quick motion.</p>
               <p>Q. But finding the muzzle approach you you took hold of it, and it instantly went off - there was some struggling between him and you before this took place. - A. There was not much struggling before the pistol went off, it was done almost as soon as he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he or had he not pointed the pistol to you before you laid hold of it. - A. He pointed the pistol to me before I turned it down; I seized the pistol between the lock and the muzzle.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been disposed to have shot at you before you were down he had opportunity enough. - A. He had; I went to him, having full confidence that he knew me, thinking he would not.</p>
               <p>Court. If the pistol had gone off in the direction in which it was before you put your left hand to it, do you believe it would have hit you - A. I have every reason to believe if I had not prevented him he would have shot me; there was not time for a great deal of aim, but he put it round towards my head; my putting my left hand to it altered the direction,</p>

On the 6th of May I was at the public house in the Old Jewry, in company with Leadbetter; I went from thence with him to Fenchurch-street to Mr. Garren's house; from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010065"/> Information of a boy that two men had been shot; I went to the dwelling house of some person, I was given to understand it was his house; I suppose there were two or three hundred people assembled round the house.</p>
               <p>Court. First of all let me ask you whether there was any cry in the croud about what had passed. - A. I think I heard the mob say he had fire arms, and to take care of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had fire arms. - A. Mr. Garren; a man had been shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that. - A. I cannot pretend to say that; I went into this passage with Leadbetter, I then saw Mr. Garren with a pistol in each hand at the further end of the passage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. At this moment had either of you shewn any staff of office. - A. I shewed none at all; not Leadbetter as I know of. Then a door was opened to Leadbetter, which led him through a hardware shop into the kitchen; I remained in the passage, the prisoner was walking about at the further end of the passage; Leadbetter came out of a door, which I judged to be the kitchen door, where the prisoner was standing. I then heard Mr. Leadbetter say to Mr. Garren, you have known me for some years; I did not hear the prisoner make any reply. Leadbetter went up to him; he turned himself round as if he was going out of the passage, with intention of going up stairs; I then observed Leadbetter rush on him; and he throwed him on the stairs quite flat, and throwed himself upon him; and I immediately fell upon him also, before the pistol was fired; I then heard the report of a pistol, I did not see the motion of his hand, I merely heard the sound; and the flash of the pistol came into my face; the confusion was great, I was upon Leadbetter at that time. After we were upon him, there were a large quantity of people rushed in upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards observe the effect that that firing had. - A. I did; I took the bit of the stairs and the skirting board out (producing them); that nail in the stair turned the bullet off; the bullet is in the wood. I now produce them. We secured him and brought him away to the counter; in going I did not hear him say any thing; he hung back and was obstropolous.</p>

            . I am a serjeant at mace.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the kitchen of this house when Leadbetter came in. - A. I was; when Leadbetter came the prisoner had shot a man.</p>
               <p>Court. Relate under what circumstance the prisoner had shot a man before Leadbetter came. - A. Porcus, a serjeant at mace, had a warrant against a person of the name of Gerrard, I was with him; about thirty yards to our coming to Mr. Garren's house, he saw the prisoner standing at the door; he says there he is; when we got there Porcus went up stairs along with the prisoner, he told the prisoner that he had got an execution against him for one hundred and twenty pounds; the prisoner says to his daughter, these fellows are come to rob the house, to rob me, and murder you. The prisoner at the bar made his escape; he went into the kitchen and went up stairs; Porcus followed him, he called to me, and said, Barber follow me; when Porcus got midway of the stair case, the prisoner chucked down large pieces of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. In a direction to hit you and Porcus. - A. Yes, two large pieces; Porcus and I withdrew, and Porcus left me in the passage. Porcus returned with a man of the name of Jones, a fireman and ticket porter; when he returned I pushed my foot against the door and forced it open; the prisoner was on the landing place on the stairs; we advanced on the stairs towards the prisoner, Porcus was in my rear; when Jones had got on the sixth or seventh step on the stairs, I saw the prisoner point the pistol at me, he shot at me, and shot Jones; I took Jones down stairs and I delivered him to Porcus; he took him to the doctor; he was dangerously wounded; he was four or five weeks in Bartholomew's hospital. After I delivered Jones into the care of Porcus, I went up two or three stairs, I came down stairs and said I would not be shot; he had another pistol pointed. When the constable came I told him he had got fire arms, I was in the kitchen; I saw the warrant; Porcus shewed it to the prisoner before Jones was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have since found that the prisoner was not the real man against whom that warrant was directed. - A. He was not; I found it out the next day (the warrant produced).</p>

            . - Court. Did you go with that warrant to arrest the prisoner. - A. I shewed him that warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you explain to him the nature of that warrant. - A. An explanation he would not allow, I saw that from the conduct of the man. That is the warrant which Barber and I went to make the arrest of the man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pooley (to Barber). You had a letter from Mr. Fenwick, while you had been suspended. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and tell me whether that is the letter. - A. That is the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a card enclosed in that letter, have you found that card. - A. No, I have not been able to find it.</p>

               <p>Q. That card was addressed to No. 63, he lives at No. 61. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you was there, do you recollect Porcus, calling him by name. - A. I was not near enough to hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him you were come to take him in execution of a warrant for one hundred and twenty pounds. - A. Porcus did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you he owed no such thing. - A. I never heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know very well that Mr. Garren is not the person against whom this writ is. - A. I understood that the day after, or else I should never have taken the trouble to have my friend shot.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you believe at the time that you went to make the arrest, that he was the person. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (to Porcus). I believe that card was given to you, have you found it. - A. I have endeavoured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010066"/> to find it among Barber's papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Barber says he gave it you. - A. He may say what he likes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the card it was to arrest Mr. Garrard, No. 63 - now you had known Fenchurch-street before that time. - A. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had known that the reverend Mr. Garren was living at No 61. - A Not directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then indirectly; did you not know it directly or indirectly. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know Mr. Garren's by the number. - A. With submission to his lordship, I will state the outset.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garron lived at No. 61. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garren lived in Fenchurch-street. - A. I certainly did know that his name was on the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You knew that Mr. Garren lived in Fenchurch-street, but not at No. 61. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the reverend Mr. Garren's name was on a brass plate on the door. - A. No, it is white paint; you will not allow me to state the outset; there is an outset in every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door, when you entered the door. - A. Not correctly, not on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before you entered the door see the the name of the reverend B. Garren on the door. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Pray sir, have not you passed that door many thousand times in your life. - A. Many.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you know that the name of the reverend B. Garren was on the door. - A. I was incorrect upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is not an answer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you not hear the question, that admits of an answer, aye or no - did you before you went into the door, see the name on the door, aye or no. - A. Not the name when I made the arrest.</p>
               <p>Q. When you entered the door, did you see the name on the door. - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I know you did not see it on that day because you did not look, had you not seen it in former days. - A. Not minutely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I shall not put up with that answer.</p>
               <p>Court. You are either a foolish fellow, or you are keeping back something - at the time you entered that door, were you acquainted with the name of B. Garren being on that door. - A. I knew there was a name, but whether it was Garrard or Garren I did not know; I certainly was not correct whether it was Garrard or Garren.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now I should like one plain answer - had not you before that day observed the name of the reverend B. Garren on that door, aye or no; now recollect. - A. I do not conceive that I have seen the name on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you entered the house did you look to see whether it was 61 or 63. - A. I certainly did not; as we were going along Fenchurch-street I saw him at the door, I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him at the house, which afterwards turned out to be 61. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. After you had done the mischief, I take it for granted you went to 63. - A. Yes, the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. On the door of 63 did you see W. Garrard painted on a board at the door. - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>

From information I pursued after the prisoner, I found him at Mr. Windsor's shop, Whitechapel; he was offering the pantaloons to pledge, I laid hold of him, I said they were the pantaloons that hung in our shop, and he had just stolen them; he said they were his. I know them to be my mistresses' property, they have our shop mark.</p>
