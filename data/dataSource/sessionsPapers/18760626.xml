                  </hi>. I am now living at 397, New North Road—I went there on 24th May last—previous to that I resided at 6, Formosa Street, Maida Vale—I was formerly proprietor of the Upper Welsh Harp, at Hendon; I left there on 31st August, 1875—from there I went to 6, For<lb/>mosa Street, the residence of Miss Crew, to whom I was engaged to be married, and whom I married, on 5th October, 1875—between the time of leaving the Welsh Harp and being married I always resided at Formosa Street—after my marriage I went to Dover; I stayed there about five weeks—I then went to France—I returned to London about 5th or 6th November—I then went to reside at 6, Formosa Street, and have always resided there up to the time of going to New North Road—when I left the Welsh Harp my father and mother, who lived there'with me, went to live at Buckingham Villas, Willesden, one of two semi-detached villas—Mr. and Mrs. Green lived in the other—I have never at any time resided at Buckingham Villas; I have been there several times, but never to stay—I slept there about three nights before I was married; that was between the time of my leaving the Welsh Harp and my marriage—between 5th November, when I returned to town, and 20th November I never slept there; I never went there between those times—on the evening of 20th November I was at 6, Formosa Street—I had never been at Buckingham Villas at all on that day—I did not have any conversation with either of the defendants—on the 20th November I—did not see either of them—the first I heard of the writ being issued against me on these bills of exchange was when my father told me of it—I believe an action had been commenced against me by Mr. Rawlins in January, 1875, and I had given bills of exchange for the amount—I forget the dates when those bills became due; I have not the bills with me. (Mr. Sleigh <hi rend="italic">said that there were four bills at three, five, six, and eight months, the first three for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each, the last for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd</hi>.) No writ was served on me; I have never seen it; I had received no intimation of it from Mr. Rawlins—it is not true that the two defendants saw me at my father's house at Buckingham Villas on 20th November; I was not there, I was not at Willesden at all—it is not true that the writ of summons had at any time come to my knowledge before 20th November, or that I had evaded the service of it—I did not know Nutt before I saw him at Bow Street; that was the first I saw of him; I had never seen him or Nikell before—I did not see Nutt at the Welsh Harp in January—I was present at the first hearing of the summons at Bow Street; I there saw a man named Harrington standing in the passage with Nutt—he said to Nutt "That is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>" and pointed towards me—I had been in the Court some time.</p>

I believed I have subpœnaed the two Miss Blanches to appear here to day; I have instructed my solicitor to do so—this case was dismissed by Mr. Vaughan; I don't know after how mmy adjournments—I did not hear what Mr. Vaughan said—after the summons was dismissed I was bound over to prosecute under the Vexatious Indictments Act, at least Mr. Besley did it for me—since that time I have seen the Miss Blanches several times; I don't believe they volunteered to give evidence for the defence at the police-court, I believe they were paid—</p>

               <p>from Mr. Rawlins, on 1st October, 1875—I did not have a house called the Hide Volunteers, I held it far a debt, I believe I proved for it—I had a claim on it and had a security by document; I can't tell you the amount, it was my father's house, he built it—I proved against my father's estate 450Z., I am twenty-seven years of age now—my father owed me money, 400f., that was for money lent at different periods—I had receipts for it; I don't know where they are; I except they are somewhere at home—I never kept a banking account—I have had various transactions with my father—I never received a cheque of my father's in payment of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or in payment of any sum at all—I can't tell you at what dates the 400?. Was lent to my father, I have not got the papers here, I have had enough this week to upset me and to take all memory out of my head—I had money left me by my grandmother, and there was my wages and earnings and savings for six years as barman—my wages were more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, over a guinea a week, my father never agreed to pay me anything, he used to give me what he thought fit; I used to have presents from my father; I had no settled wages—the Lord Palmerston belonged to my father, he built it; I bought apiece of land next to the Palmerston, I was at the auction mart, my father bid for it, he did not pay for it; I signed the contract after paying the deposit—800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was left to me my grand<lb/>mother, she left no will, it was left with my cousin for me, it was given to my cousin, William Kirk, before she died—I received it in cash, notes and gold, I kept it in my pocket, it is no trouble to carry 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your pocket—I did not carry it about at night, because I took off my trousers—there was lots of furniture at the Upper "Welsh Harp—Mr. George bought it and paid for it, all that was mine; there was some of my father's, which he took with him; none of my furniture was taken to Buckingham Villas, not so much as a chair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This trial was postponed from last Session on the appli<lb/>cation of the defendant's Counsel, because Miss Blanch was not here, and for that reason I have subpœnaed her—she lives a short distance from my father, about 100 yards, it is not a house, it is a wooden place—I stayed at Dover five weeks—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill for my lodging for the last week, at the London Packet, the house I was about taking—I had nothing to do with the music hall—it is untrue that that was my last—known place of business, I was not in business there at all—I slept three nights in different weeks at Buckingham Villas between the time of my leaving tie Welsh Harp and my marriage—I had never been there since my marriage up to 29th December—I have seen my wife this morning, she is in bed, hourly expecting her confinement—I produce a certificate from the doctor, she cannot be moved—I was present when she was examined at the police-court in the prisoner's presence.

I am the wife of John Green, and live at 1, Bucking<lb/>ham Villas, Willesden—I have a little boy twelve years old—my husband is a plasterer by trade, he takes small contracts, and works occasionally for masters—on Saturday evening, 20th November, my husband and I and the child were in our sitting-room at the side of the house—we have a bow window in the front—at the back of the premises there are two stables at the end of the garden—our sitting-room is in front; our house is the nearest to London, and Mr. Elisha Bannister is next door—he and his wife came to live there about 31st August; they had no child there—I used to go in their house frequently, perhaps two or three times a day, as she was all alone and not very well—I would go in and bit with her and take my needle-work—between the time of their coming to live there and 20th of November Charles Edward Bannister never slept there, to my knowledge; he has never lived there—I knew him by sight perfectly well—it is a very lonely road; the nearest house is about 250 or 300 yards off—I remember the evening of 20th November—my husband had come home between 2 and 3 o'clock, and we had tea in the sitting-room—we had a lamp burning in the evening; our attention was called by some voices—we went to the back door, and the moment we got the door open I heard someone say "Will you take this and give to your son?"—Mr. Bannister said "My son does not live here, therefore I cannot give it to him,' and he said "You are trespassing, will you get off?" and by that they either got over the fence or through it, I could not tell which, and after they got over I saw a piece of paper held up by Nutt, and he said "Will you give this to your son f—Mr. Bannister said "I tell you my son does not live here, and therefore I can't give it to him," and by that they went away—at the time Mr. Ban<lb/>nister spoke about trespassing he was only about a yard, or from that to a yard and a half, from Nutt, but it was impossible for me to see him, because we have a little brick building which just hid him from me—I saw both the strangers, and I knew Mr. Bannister's voiee—he was not near enough to them to take them by the neck; on my oath he never did, because I could see them so distinctly; he never put his hands upon them at all, not while we stood at the door, and they went away before we left the door—about ten days or a fortnight after, Nutt came to our house; it was on a Monday, about the 5th of December, but I will not say to a day, it was about 12 o'clock, or between 12 and 1 o'clock—some man was with him, who I did not know at the time; he has since been pointed out to me,</p>

               <p>he is a man that came from the Crown, at Cricklewood—my little boy was in the room with me, Nutt knocked at the door, and my little boy went to the door; I heard what passed—Nutt said "Does Mr. Charles Bannister live here"—my boy said "No, he does not, he never has lived here, he has not been here for about eight weeks"—Nutt said "You have a thoroughfare from here into the next house"—my boy said "No, we have not"—Nutt said "Are you Mr. Bannister's son"—he said "No," and by that I got up and went to the door—he said "Are you Mrs. Bannister?"—I said "No, I am not," and the man said "No, that is Green, the plasterer's wife"—Nutt said "Mr. Charles Bannister lives here"—I said "No, he does not, he never has lived here"—he said "You have a thoroughfare from here into the next house"—I said "No"—he said "Did not Mr. Charles Bannister sit in that room with you a week ago last Saturday night"—I said "No, it was not Mr. Charles Bannister, it was my husband"—he said "Oh, no, it was not, it was Charles Bannister, I know him very well"—I said "Well, I can assure you it was my husband"—he said "Oh, I know Mr. Bannister, I came up from Dover in the same train as he did last week, will you swear that Mr. Bannister did not sit in that room with you"—I said "I can swear it, it was my husband"—he said "Oh, I suppose if you was wanted to swear it was him you would swear so," and by that I shut the door in his face, and he went away—he came down again about a week after, on a Monday and brought with him three or four people—my husband opened the door, they insisted on coming in, and they came in—Nutt said he was going to leave the men in, and he left them and abused me most fearfully—he asked about the thoroughfare, and I had to show him to convince him there was none—there I was no person in my house on 20th November hammering—the only persons in the house were my-husband, myself and child.</p>

I live at 15, Little Queen Street, Holborn—in 1875, I was staying at the Upper Welsh Harp, at Hendon—I was there in January and February, I recollect Nutt coming there, I" don't know the date, I believe I saw him serve a writ on Mr. Elisha Bannister—Charles Edward Bannister was not present at the time, he was at the Welsh Harp, but was not present—I had a slight knowledge of Nutt—I saw him in the passage at Bow Street, and asked what he was there for—he said in Bannister's matter, I looked round and saw Charles Bannister, and a friend or two with him, and I said "That is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Bannister"—he said "Oh, which is Charles," and I pointed him out to him—I was in the Court during the examination of the witnesses, and Nutt handed me a little bit of paper—this is it—I had handed a piece of paper to him, and this was his answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "I have shown your answer to my note to Mr. Williams, and probably he may call you to prove that you never knew Bannister, and that you did not point him out to me; why should I ask you to point him to me when I knew him personally.

(the other officer had joined me at that time)—he said "If I have I am not aware of it"—we took the prisoner a little way' and searched him—a brown paper packet containing three paper parcels, and in each parcel was ten counterfeit shillings, each divided by a piece of paper, had been found by the other officer in the prisoner's great coat pocket; he asked him where the other man was, and he said that he was with no other man—I said "How can you say that when I watched you myself with the other officer at the corner of the Gray's Inn Road?" he said "I never saw that man before in my life" he was quite half an hour with that man—it was pouring with rain the whole time—the other officer took him to the station and I walked close behind—he had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money—I was in plain clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boy sorter at the inland branch—on 21st June I saw the prisoner sitting on a corner of Ellis' table with his hat in his hand—I saw Ellis speak to Smith, who spoke to Mr. Joel, and he fetohed the prisoner back—he went to the northern table—I saw him shake his sleeve, and Ellis said there is the packet, Mr. Joel; and when he took his hand away I saw the packet where his hand had been—I was deputed to attend in the Missing Letter Department of the General Post-office in this case, and when the prisoner came in he made a motion, I thought he meant, was I there on his business; I nodded my head—he was afterwards behind a screen and came and asked me if had been doing the same as he had, I said "No?" he said "What are you here for?" I said "On a little business referring to yourself;" he said, "Did you see anything?" I said "That is my business;" he said "Did you see the packet drop from—my sleeve?" I said "I cannot answer you that;" he said then you think I took it, and if you think I took it you had better say so; if I get half a chance I shall say that Ellis must have put the packet there.</p>

I will give you a cheque at once"—he said his name was Plato, and that he was principal agent for the Australian business for all sorts of things, that he did a great deal of business, but he did not exactly say the extent—he said he wanted these to send with other bronzes, china and porcelain, to Australia—I consented to let him have the goods for the cheque—he told me to deliver the goods at Mr. Southgate's, in London Wall—on Monday I went with somebody and delivered the goods at Southgate's—they did not seem to know anything about the goods coming—I went next door to Plato, who was waiting for me—I said to him "I bring the goods here, but I have not unloaded them—he said "I will come down with you"—he did so, and told Southgate's man to receive the goods for him; they were then unloaded—the prisoner said "After you have unloaded the goods come upstairs to my place," and I did—he made me enter a second room, which was full of bronzes and china goods, and he said those were to be sent off with mine to Australia—he said "I can't give you a cheque to-day," and I was asked through bis head clerk as an interpreter whether, as the bargain could not be concluded that day, I would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—what passed at my place was in English—I saw "London &amp; Westminster" on the cheque<lb/>book he produced—I never got a cheque—I was induced to part with the bronzes seeing the quantity of bronzes and china goods—I had also confi<lb/>dence in the house of Southgate, also having shown to me some invoices and receipts showing that he was in connection with many French houses—I expected to receive a cheque for my goods, and I went to him three weeks after, and he then offered me three bills—I told him before taking those bills I must have his private address, but I never could get it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Redding the prayer of the Bill</hi>). Miller &amp; Miller were the solicitors to Mr. Saul, and to the bill—the result of that bill was that an order was obtained from the Court of Chancery directing the trus<lb/>tees to release all parties from their covenants, and bills were given by the firm to the children of Mrs. Saul as they came of age, in lieu of money—In the next suit of Saul <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saul, filled on 18th August, 1864, I think I acted for William Saul—I think there was another bill filled in 1868 against Godfrey by one of the Sauls, but I was not concerned in it, and I hare not got it—I remember the taxing the costs in two of the Chancery suits, and I remember an order of court to pay Miller &amp; Miller 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I discussed the articles of partnership carefully with Mrs. Saul, and explained them to her, and she said that if she could get out of the business when re-con<lb/>structed with 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for herself and her children to live on she should be grateful as long as she lived—she did not say that she regretted that</p>

               <p>she was compelled to go into partnership—there was a meeting at Guild. hall Coffee House in 1868, Mrs. Saul was not present, but her son was; it was a formal meeting for putting an end to the litigation, and Mr. Miller put an end to it by serving an injunction on Mr. Saul, of Northampton, he was the executor of Thomas Saul—an injunction, was also served on the executor of William Devonshire Saul, as inspector under the deed of part<lb/>nership—that put an end to the friendly arrangement which ought to have taken place at the meeting—I heard of a bill being filed by Godfrey against Sarah Saul, on 22nd December, 1871, praying for a dissolution of the part<lb/>nership, but I know nothing about it—I had ceased to have anything to do with it then—I continued to act during the litigation for the trustees of the estate of William Devonshire Saul—the trustees insisted on the order being discharged for the purpose of getting out their 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the order of 2nd August was to release the parties from their covenant—I know that those bills were duly delivered to Mrs. Saul's children, as they were entitled to them—I think the amount of those three bills was 2,803<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about it, except hearing it talked about—I know nothing about the way the business was managed or mismanaged after it came into the receiver's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not draw the partnership deed of 1858—when it was necessary to put fresh capital into the business, the children's trustees lent 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as that was a breach of trust they were anxious to relieve themselves from any responsibility—a bill was filed by Mr. Webb, for the purpose of fixing the trustees, but the Court decreed it to be a proper dis<lb/>position of the money and said that the trustees should be allowed to lend the money and take acceptances—that did not affect Godfrey or Brown in any way—the result was that the 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent by Mrs. Saul's children through the trustees, and acceptances taken for the amount—I had nothing to do with the proceedings till the meeting at the London Coffee House-Brown's 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was credited to him in the books as his share; he gave personal security for it.</p>

Northampton, the inspector—I know William Saul's writing and I found his receipt for 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 27th August, among the papers at Aldersgate Street; and there is interest besides that amount, including another amount that was ordered to be paid back to me, and was paid back to me by order of the Court of Chancery—I find that the gross pay<lb/>ments of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown in June, 1872, amounted to 3,784<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includ<lb/>ing 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn out by Godfrey—supposing no sales had been made in that mouth to the nominees, and that Godfrey had not drawn out, they would</p>

               <p>have had 1,131<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to their credit over and above their payments, without the necessity of selling anything—from 1st July to 29th August the day that I went into possession, the total receipts of the firm amounted to 7,545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which 1,204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is made up of monies purporting to be paid by Balchin, Yerworth, Keating &amp; Son, Pattern &amp; Mitchell, and deduct<lb/>ing that 1,204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that leaves 6,344<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. net receipts, irrespective of sales to nominees—I have here the monthly balances from my appointment taking out the amounts of sales to nominees, and taking into account all the payments made by them on the acceptances to the Saul family, and I say that they had ample funds to meet all liabilities, including the amounts to the Saul family, without selling any wines at all, and I am prepared to show that, month by month—I can-not trace a angle entry in previous years to show that they ever made any forced sales—after I was appointed receiver I had to meet liabilities incurred after January 1st, 1872, for goods purchased, the amount of which in round numbers was 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I can point out cases where wine so purchased on credit, and which I had to pay for afterwards, was sold to Keating &amp; Son, and Balchin—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the payments to the Saul family, and to William Saul, of Northampton, I made out from the cash-book—those are payments made subsequent to January, 1872; only one or two were made before that—the total is 3,509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I still say that they always had sufficient cash in hand without forced sales, and without borrowing money—the amount of purchases from 1st January, 1872, to my appointment was about 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but in June the purchases only amounted to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from the end of June to my appointment only one bottle of champagne was purchased—I have also extracted this list of the customers of the firm standing on the books on 31st December, 1871, who had dealings with the firm in 1871—here are 670 active customers; they are mostly inn and hotel keepers in the country—I have ascertained from the books that on 25th June bills were dis<lb/>counted by Godfrey to the amount of 846<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were the acceptances of different customers of the firm, and they were paid to the bankers and turned into money—on June 3rd bills were discounted to the amount of 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque-book of the firm of Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown—this counterfoil of 5th June, "Sundries, 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., change," is in God<lb/>frey's writing—this cheque for 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the signature, are in Godfrey's writing, and this, "W. J. Brown," is in Brown's writing—that appears in the pass-book, and the cheque is cancelled as cashed—I understand that 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out to pay someone; it was turned into cash, but being called "change," other cheques may have been paid in of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from some other source—cash was paid into the bank on 5th June amounting, to 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when cash is paid into the bank I can generally find from whom it has been received—this is the paying-in book, and I find here "5th June, paid in 1,110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find that on on 25th June they discounted bills with the bank to the amount of 846<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that Godfrey drew out 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st July and 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 8th—I find that on 18th July they discounted bills to the amount of 574<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that on the same day Godfrey drew out 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce the cheques for those amounts, signed by Godfrey, and passed through the bankers—when I was appointed I found about 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of acceptances of the firm under discount," and two-thirds of that amount, about 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were dishonoured, but they were ultimately met, except to the extent of 970<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not unusual that customers may not be ready with the money, but yet they may be good</p>

               <p>bills in the long run—the retained bills came back through the bankers, and I had to refund them the money; the estate at one time owed me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had had to refund—when I took possession, about 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed to me, including money in the bank, and there was about 530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—in consequence of those bills being returned I had not the money to resuscitate the business, and I realised the stock at a profit of about 20 per cent., the usual amount—I find in the cash-book three entries with T. E. against them—that means "Trade expenses of Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown;" on is on 13th July, 1872, for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to-George Books, Esq., and on the same day, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Brawn, the other defendant, and on August 6, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Messrs. Eooks &amp; Co.—all those cheques are signed with the usual signature of the two defendants, and debited to cash, expenses—this counterfoil of July 18, is in. Godfrey's, writing, it has written underneath "To my solicitor, for my protection"—on the counter<lb/>foil of the next cheque, dated July 18, is "To Mr. Crook, for the protection of W. J. Brown," and on August 6, three days before my appointment here, is written on a cheque "To my solicitor, for my protection, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are all countersigned by William Saul, of Northampton, the inspector—at folio 187 of the private ledger, the three amounts I hare mentioned, one is headed "Trade expenses," those amounts are not debited in the books or in the ledger to the private account either of Godfrey or of Brown—those are monies drawn out of the assets of Saul Godfrey, &amp; Brown, and debited to trade expenses, and not entered to the debit of any particular partner—here are twenty or thirty copies of letters in the copy book, applying for money, to the customers of the old firm written while he was there—here is one of June 28, 1872, written by Smethurst, on behalf of the firm—he was partly clerk and partly collector—there are other letters here stating that the business is wound-up, and that it is necessary to call in the accounts—the letters do not solicit a transfer of the custom—I had an empty cask returned to me with this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on it—I found this circular at 15, Aldersgate Street—it is a blank form.

                  </hi>. I am a forwarding agent and merchant at 2, Fen-church Street Buildings—in May, 1872, Mr. William J. Brown came to my office respecting a sale of wines—he married my sister—I had known the firm of Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown many years before this interview—I had: bought their wine for private use—I had seen Brown before with reference to a sale; I saw him somewhere about March or April, 1872—I recollect a sale of wine by Mr. Godsall in April, 1872—I had seen Mr. Brown about 11th January, 1872; when he brought me wine warrants—the wines they represented were sold in bond, partially by Mr. Godsall—I delivered the warrants afterwards to someone else—about 11th January Mr. Brown called on me and stated that he had a lot of family bills coming due, and had not the money to meet them, and not liking to expose the affairs of the firm to money-lenders, he had arranged for a private advance on dock warrants, using my name, for which I should have a commission—I agreed to the arrangement, and he handed me certain dock warrants, of which this is a list—it is in Brown's writing—he handed me a cheque for 758<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid into my bankers, and handed him a cheque for 742<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at the same time be gave me a letter which I have searched for but cannot find—it authorised me to sell the goods—it was a sort of letter of hypothecation—I don't remember by whom it was signed—that is all that took place, on that occasion—I saw him before 18th April, the day of sale—it was arranged between us that the goods were to be sold if the money was not coming—I put them in Godsall's hands for sale—I put in for sale from 397 to 437—the same goods described here were given me by Mr. Brown—we protected the goods at the sale and got excellent prices—I was present at the sale—some of them were not sold, they were bought in by my orders; properly protected—the wines were booked to Brown—I saw him again about May, when he proposed that he should use my name for the purchase of goods on the Aldersgate Street concern; he was then in Worship Street; I objected and recommended him to have nothing to do with it, and advised him to buy the goods in the open market—he said that Godfrey wanted to get his money but of the whole concern and did not want to sacrifice the goods at auction—he then represented that he had had large transactions of a similar nature with Keiling, whom I knew as a highly-respectable firm—I said "If Keiling's have no objection I have none, provided proper values are given"—I then allowed invoices to be sent from Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown, Aldersgate Street, to me—I paid this firm for the whole of the goods by cheque at different times—none of the goods were delivered to me—I received from Brown similar amounts, including a small commission—I was in funds from Brown before I paid, Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown, of Aldergate Street, for the goods invoiced to me.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my father—on 11th May I was living with him and my mother at 26 Redhill Street, Regent's Park, my two sisters and a little brother, we were all living in the same room, a kitchen—my mother's name was Susan Milligan., she was 36 years of age—I shall 15 in August, my sisters are 7 and 5 and my little brother 2—my father was a coal porter in St. Pancras Road, my mother kept a mangle—I was employed at a chemists; on 11th May I left home to go to my work about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—my mother was at home and appeared to be in her usual state of health—I returned home about 10 o'clock in the evening, my mother was standing in a corner of the room and ray father was standing close alongside of her, undressed, he had only his shirt on; my mother was dressed, father was not sober, mother was—they were having words with one another, I don't know what about—I shortly afterwards left the room and two or three minutes afterwards I went to a window which looked into the kitchen: I heard my father swearing very much, calling mother names and I saw him kick my mother in the stomach—he had no boots on; mother was standing at the time and had her hand on the end of the mangle and she sat down on the end of the mangle directly after—I afterwards went into the room, my mother seemed in great pain, she was cry<lb/>ing and my little sister was by the side of her—my father was about in the middle of the room, not in bed—mother said he was no man to kick a woman in the manner that he did—he said "Confound you will your hold your noise" mother said "No," on that he threw a basin at her, it struck her on the forehead—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the pieces of the basin, it is a slop basin; her forehead bled very much—he threatened to throw a loaf at her which was on the table—at the time the basin was thrown my mother was still sitting on the mangle—after this father got in to bed; my mother sent me to fetch a lodger, Mrs. Bayliss, father said he would not have anybody brought in the room—after that I went to bed—I left my mother on the mangle still dressed—I did not see her on the floor at any time; she told me to go to bed—I awoke about 7.15 in the morning I found that my father had left the room—mother was lying on the bed dressed as she had been the night before—she spoke to me, she seemed to be ill—I then left to go to my work—I was fetched from my work about</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The room in which we lived was an underground room, it looked into an area which was covered with a railing level with the pave<lb/>ment—there are two windows to the room, they only come up a few inches above the railings—I had not to stoop down to look into the room, I was out in the street and could see straight through to the other side of the room—there was a light in the room—one of the windows had upright railings before it—I looked through the other with the flat railing; it is a corner house—there was usually a blind to the window, but not at that time, it was down, so that I could see through—when I returned at 10 o'clock my sisters and brother were in bed—the room had the ordinary furniture, table, chairs, bed, and fire-irons, and cooking things—the mangle was a large one and took up a good space there were two iron bedsteads, one a large one in' which my father and my mother slept with the girls, and a small one where I and my little brother slept; there are two doors, one into the passage and one into the area, you go up steps from the area into the street—I went to sleep in about five minutes after I went to bed—I had to go over the way to put up some shutters first—father and mother had quarrelled before this at times; once he left the house in consequence of a quarrel and passed the night in the street—my mother worked hard at the mangle; she sometimes took a little drop of beer, not very much, not spirits; at Christmas time, I think, I did see her have too much—at Easter or Whitsuntide she very likely took a little—father had to leave for his work early in the morning—some<lb/>times on pay nights he might take a little too much—he worked regularly—he did not bring his money home regularly to his wife—I was standing in. the gutter when I was looking through the window—my mother's side was towards me, she was standing at the end of the mangle—they were not in the same positions when I came back as when I went away—I never saw my father's face scratched at any of the quarrels or his whiskers pulled—I did not not notice whether his whiskers were pulled on this night—my mother was sitting on the mangle when I came back, not when my father kicked her; she stood up when he came towards her and he kicked, her, she did not move towards him, she did not go above half a foot nearer; she looked as if she got up to avoid him—she was sitting down when the basin was thrown; father was standing in the same position as before—I went off to sleep and heard nothing more till I awoke about 7 o'clock—I did not go for any doctor or lodger.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S., and obstetric assistant at University College Hospital—on Friday, 12th May, I was sent for a few minutes before 11 o'clock—Mr. Broster sent for me—I went at once to 26, Redhill Street,—I got there a few minutes after 11 o'clock—Mr. Broster was there—I went into a room downstairs and there saw Susan Milligan lying on the bed, dressed—the police were there and some women—the pri<lb/>soner was not there—I examined the woman, she was faint from loss of blood and was losing a little then; she was conscious, the pulse was very weak—I examined the womb, she was in labour and bleeding a little—I attended to her and stopped the bleeding by rupturing the membranes—I gave her a stimulant—I stayed with her a little over an hour and then left Mr. Broster in charge of the case—she was very low, but I considered her in a fit state to be left, or I would not have left her; she was not in danger</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187606260042"/>
               <p>at that time—she had a cut on the forehead above the right eye which might have been caused by a basin—there was a great deal of blood underneath the bed and in the bed, it had gone through the bed—there was also dried blood in the corner by the mangle on the floor—a little before 2 o'clock in the afternoon I was sent for again—Mr. Broster was still there—I found the child had then been born—she was conscious, but very weak and faint from loss of blood; she was in danger—Dr. Williams went there with me and he examined the womb; I saw him do so; it was relaxed and she was bleeding from it—she rallied a little, but had a relapse a little after 4 o'clock from fresh bleeding—I was with her when she died, about 4.30—I apprehended danger when I got there the second time with Dr. Williams at 2 o'clock—I took Dr. Williams there in consequence of what I heard—she spoke to me afterwards, she asked to be left alone, to be let die in peace, two or three times—I had not told her that she was in danger—I saw the child, it was born dead, it was about an eight months' child—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination on Sunday 15th—I found the body of the woman well nourished—the cut on the forehead was about three-quarters of an inch in length—there were three or four bruises on the lower limbs below the knees—there were no other external marks—the organs of the body were healthy, very bloodless—I examined the uterus, it had the usual appearance of a woman after labour—the immediate cause of death was loss of blood—a woman eight months gone in the family way kicked in the stomach might bring on pre<lb/>mature labour and bleeding from the womb before death; I don't say that it would, but external violence is a frequent cause of it—there were no abnormal appearances on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> why this labour should have been premature, nor anything in the appearance of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruises on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> were slight, and I should think three or four days old; they were in about the middle of the shin, they might have been caused twenty-four hours before my seeing her—the cut on the forehead had been washed, that was all—that injury was not in any way connected with the premature confinement—I found no external bruise in the neighbourhood of the abdomen; I examined with a special view to that—I found no injury to the uterus, or on the muscles—I ruptured the membranes on the first occasion, that was to stop the bleeding, that would lead to the discharge of the waters—there had been no discharge of the waters before that—the discharge of the waters necessarily results in delivery—the consequence of violence to the abdomen of a woman in her advanced state of pregnancy would not be the discharge of the waters; I had never attended her before—abortion is due to disease, fright may cause it, premature confinement does not occur from natural causes—a blow or a fall, or unusual exertion may produce it, as well as a kick; I don't think previous premature confinement caused by fright would render her more liable to it again, it would only show that fright would have more effect on the nervous system—if I had not been informed of the kick I should have asked for the cause of the first bleeding; there was nothing in the appearance of the body to indicate violence; I attribute death to hemorrhage, and I should have inquired into the cause of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the woman before; I say a kick would probably cause the bleeding.</p>

Supposing a woman to be kicked in that part-1 should not expect to find external marks, bruise or discolouration, because the parts are so soft that they would yield to the kick—a bruise proceeds from extra-vasation of blood—the distention of the part by the foetus would not produce sufficient hardness to give discoloration, because the foetus is surrounded by water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bayliss, and live at 26, Red Hill Street, on the second floor the Milligans lived on the ground-floor—they had lived there nearly twelve months—on Thursday evening, 11th May, about 8 o'clock or 8.30, I saw Mrs. Milligan in the washhouse, she was in and out talking to me all the afternoon—I knew she was pregnant—and had arranged to attend her in her confinement—I saw nothing of her during the night after 8 o'clock—next morning I sent down two sheets to be mangled, her little girl came up for me twice; I went down about 9 o'clock or 9.15, I found her lying on her side on the bed, her face was covered with dried blood—I asked if she wanted me; she did not answer—I touched her and said "It is me Mrs. Milligan"—she said "I am dying." (The Court <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that this would not be sufficient to admit, as a dying declaration, any statement made by the deceased; two things must to exist to make it admissable: that she was in a dying state, and that she made the statement under the full belief that she was in a dying state, so as to give it the sanction of an oath</hi>). She put her hand across her stomach; I did not examine it.</p>

About 2.30 on Friday night, 28th April I was on duty at the Highgate police-station when Bullamore was brought in by two other constables—I examined his clothes; there were ten cuts in his cape, such as would be done by a sharp pointed-knife; six in his great coat, two in the right breast, one in the left; one in the left arm near the elbow, and one on the left shoulder blade; in the under coat I found four cuts, two on the right breast, one on the left shoulder, one on the left arm and one in the left breast; his clothing was satursted with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to William Izzard and another, of 46, East<lb/>cheap—the prisoner entered the service on 22nd May, for a fortnight's trial—on 1st June, between 2 and 3 o'clock he asked me to let the lad go to the London and County Bank and cash a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he produced—he had previously asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in favour of Thomas Dundee, and was signed John Masterman</hi>.) I called his attention to the front of it not being endorsed and he wrote on it "Charles Dundas" in my presence—I sent the lad to the bank and the prisoner left the office half an hour afterwards and did not return—the lad then came back and made a communication to me; I went to a drawer in the sale where the cheque-books were kept and missed a cheque-book marked B, all the cheques in which were marked S. 16,996—three cheques are missing from this cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) so numbered—the prisoner did not come again till Saturday the 3rd, when he asked me if his salary had been drawn; I had sent for a policeman—he then asked me about the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had lent him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187606260049"/>
               <p>and said "I have a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket I will pay you back"—I said "Very well give it to me"—he hesitated and said "Are there any little matters in the office I can clear up before I leave"—I said "No"—he seemed fidgetty and I said "Well come and have a glass of wine"—we went and while having it he said "How about the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque"—I said "There seems to bo something wrong about that, the bankers have not cashed it"—he said "Where is it"—I said upstairs in the drawer—he said "You can bring it to me," giving the name of another firm where he said he-had got a situation—we then walked towards Seething Lane police-station where I charged him with stealing a cheque belonging to Mr. Izzard—I saw the missing cheque-book found in his pocket and in his pooket-book this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be signed by Izzard &amp; Betts—this is not the signa<lb/>ture of the firm; I asked him where he got the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, he said from a publican who was in business within a quarter of a mile—I asked him to take me there, but he made no reply—the inspector asked him who the publican was, but he gave no name.</p>

On 16th June I received information and went to the Weymouth Arms, saw the prisoner and watched him to 4a, Wimpole Mews, where he asked how his horse was and patted him—I said "Is that your horse?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Where did you get it?"—he said "I live at Stony Stratford, if you want to know anything more about the horse, I shan't tell you"—we got a telegram and the prosecutor came; the prisoner was placed with four other men and was identified by Morris—he said that ho bought the horse at Stony Stratford—when he was charged he said "They cannot charge me with stealing it for I have not received a halfpenny for it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I live at 33, Perth Street, Stepney—I did not live with the prisoner at this time—on Saturday, 11th May, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Mile End, at the corner of the Cambridge Road—I met the prisoner there—he asked me if I had anything to give him—I said I had not—he asked me if I would treat him—I said "No"—he then struck me on the side of the face; I cannot remem<lb/>ber any more—he crossed the road—I crossed too and said "You are a bad man to hit me because I have nothing to give you"—he put his fingers in my mouth and stretched it—a policeman came up and I said "I charge this man"—he said 'I did not see him strike you and I cannot charge him, you go that way and he shall go the other"—I crossed the road and he went another way, towards Commercial Road—I went straight down the Mile End Road till I came to the Three Cranes public-house—I bought a trotter out<lb/>side the door; that is about five minutes' walk from where the policeman separated us—the prisoner came round the corner from behind and took hold of me by one shoulder and I felt the knife in my throat, he held me by one shoulder and put the knife along my neck with the other hand, and he said "Now, where are you"—I don't remember any more, I felt the knife cutting me, I felt two cuts—I then got away from him and got into the public-house somehow—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife, I know it quite well, it is a table knife that we had in use when I lived with him.</p>

I did not speak to you that night, only in answer to your question, we were very unfriendly—I did not say I would knock your eye out—I am sure you wilfully put your fingers in my mouth—we have been separated more than once, thrice, or thrice, but at this time about a month—my friends were supporting me and have been ever since; I have not been well enough to work—I have three relations to help me, my sisters support me—I don't walk the Mile End Road till 12 o'clock at night—when I left you I took an empty room and bought a bed and put it there, and that was the only thing there when you were locked up—I never stayed from home except from your violence when I was really afraid of you.</p>

In gold, and the rest in notes"—I received eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and,35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I put into the purse—I then left the bank, went to the Burlington Arcade and searched for Hilton, but could not find him—I ultimately went back to my lodgings—neither Hilton nor Down were there; I then went to 22, Wood Street, Chelsea, the residence of Emma Goldspink, who I have seen frequently with Down—I then went to South Kensington, and from. there to Liverpool Street, and from there to Forest Gate, to Hilton's house, 1, Stafford Villas—I arrived there at 8.30 or 9 o'clock, and found Mrs. Hilton there—I had some conversation with her—the bouse was poorly furnished—the first person who "came in was Down, at a little after 9 o'clock, but they had no clock so I could no tell exactly—there were not many chairs there—Down said "Have you got the money all right?"—I said "Yes, I have"—he said "Hand it over?"—I handed him the purse, and he laid it on the wash-house table—he asked me whether I had got it all right—I said that I believed I had—he said "Where's <hi rend="italic">Jos?</hi>"—I said "I do not know; he promised to wait for me at Burlington Arcade, and he had gone when I came out, so I thought perhaps he had come back to you"—he said "No, I have not seen him"—Hilton came in about 10 o'clock; Down and I were then in the washhouse—he said "Oh, here you are "—I said "Where have you been to; I have missed you"—he said "I missed you; I went to the <hi rend="italic">pub</hi> and I thought I had missed you"—he asked me "If I had got the money?"—I said "Yes, what are you in such a flurry about"——Down said "Here it is," on the table—Hilton sat down on the only chair they had got, moved the cups and saucers back, turned the money out on the table and counted it—when he had done that he gave Down several bank notes; I do not know whether he gave them all—Hilton said to Down "That squares up my account with you?"—Hilton put the gold in his pocket; I do not know what became of the purse; I afterwards saw Hilton take the money out of his pocket and give it to his wife—he then said that the last train had gone—Down said "I must go to night"—Hilton said "There is a place for either one or other of you to sleep"—Down went away and I stayed—it was then past 11 o'clock—I slept on some rags in a corner—there was no furniture in the room—I was aroused at 6 o'clock a.m. by Hilton, and had some breakfast—Hilton saw me to the station and I went on to my father's office—I was at work the rest of that day, and on the next day, the 11th; I went to see a friend off from</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Vickers &amp; Co of Victoria Street, Westminster—I keep a drawing account at the western branch of the Bank of England—this cheque is not in my writing or written by my authority—I know Hilton—I first became acquainted with him at Christmas last year—he spoke to me about making an advance to him on his wife's reversion under the will of Colonel Hutchinson and proposed to give me a policy on his wife's life, but I found that bis wife, or the lady who passed as his wife, was under age, and it was not completed—I lent his mother-in-law on the 11th January by cheque, on one of the ordinary forms, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 2nd February I advanced him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque on the usual form—Hilton introduced Down to me in February and Down asked me to purchase his reversion, which I did. and made him various advances, all of them by cheque, except the deposit under the contract—he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th February, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st March, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th March, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th April—the purchase was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I subsequently lent him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because he said he bad taken a tobacconist's business and wanted a little help—every one of these advances was made by cheque with my usual signature—I have banked with the bank nearly four years and have never but once sent a plain cheque and that was not in a transaction with Down or Hilton—all the cheques to them were on the ordinary forms—Down sent me two I O U's which were irre<lb/>gular, not being stamped; they included a promise to pay, and therefore I sent them back to be stamped; one was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I after<lb/>wards got from Downs these two I O U's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 12th April—that was the last transaction I had with him, and the last trans<lb/>action with Hilton was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 2nd February—my impression is that the body of this cheque is in Down's writing—on comparing, his I O U's with it there is a very great similarity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Belhouse, a builder of 11, Queen Street, Tower Hill—on the morning of 6th June, Abrahams came in in a very excited state and said that he had been in India and had been very ill, and a Mr. Bowling had been very kind to him there, and he had brought him some horns and six parrots—he asked me where Mr. Bowling lived—I could not tell him, but said that if he waited till my husband came in, perhaps he could tell him—he asked me three times if I was a Christian lady, and got hold of my hand, and said that he would not sell his birds or give them to Jews, but he would give them to me—Lazarus afterwards came in—they went out for a few minutes and Lazarus came back with the horns and put them on the floor, Abrahams followed him and broke a square of glass—my husband came in and Abrahams asked for Mr. Bowling, and said that he had brought the birds for him—my husband said that a Mr. Beaumont, a brush maker, lived there—Abrahams said that was not the man, and then he asked for a hammer—my husband gave him one, and he said that he would smash the horns up because he could not find Mr. Bowling—my husband said that it was a pity to break them up, and offered him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he said "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for my man," and then he asked for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, but I would not give it to him—Abrahams told my husband that the parrots were next door, at the public-house, and went out to fetch them, he came back and said the birds had gone to King's Cross; my husband said "I must go with you to King's Cross," my husband went out and I heard no more.</p>

I am a builder, of 11, Queen's Street, Tower Hill—on 6th June, at 9 a.m., Lazarus came to my shop with some horns and Arahams followed him, and asked for a man named Bowling—I said there was such a man living in the same street some time ago, and I would go and see if I could find him—I went out and returned and saw Abrahams in the next house, which is a public-house, he came in again in a hurry, and said he would not stop any longer for he had been deceived before when he came from abroad, and asked me for a hammer to smash the horns up, I said "Don't do that,"he said"Will you give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them altogether"—I said "Yes," for he was kicking up a row that I did not know what I was about—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my man"—I then began to think I was going to be duped—I went to my next door neigh<lb/>bour, and before I got to the house I saw the prisoners running away—he had said that the parrots were next door and went there, and said he would bring them, and came back and said that the man had taken them to King's Cross—I ran after the prisoners, they ran through a public-house, and so did I—they ran into John Street, Minories, where they jumped into a policeman's arms.</p>

Ingle &amp; Co., the then solicitors to the Planet Insurance Corporation, who eventually lent him the money upon therever<lb/>sion—I frequently saw him between 1871 and 1875—about February 1875, he informed me that his sister who had been apprenticed to a milliner, was anxious to go into business, and for that purpose required to sell her share, which was similar to his own; under the same will—eventually I purchased it—he brought a person who he introduced as his sister Ellen Ann Offley, a few days after the first interview—she informed me sub<lb/>stantially what the prisoner had stated, and came frequently to my office afterwards, seeing my solicitor and myself—he brought a certificate of her birth and eventually this contract (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was entered into; I saw it signed "Ellen Ann Offley," by the woman in the presence of Mr. Stopber, the solicitor, Offley, and myself—I got a receipt, at the bottom of the contract, signed in the same way—I paid the money in three cheques to the order of Miss E.

On Whit-Tuesday evening I went to have my hair cut, the prisoner was there, either shaving Duffy or cutting his hair—he was going out and the prisoner went towards the door demanding payment—I told Duffy he had better pay the man, but he struck him two or three times on the fingers to make him let go of the door—I remonstrated, and the prisoner held out something, but I could not see what it was—Duffy then put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter and attempted to go out; the prisoner lifted his hand twice in a threatening attitude with the scissors in it; in the mean time the door came open, and as Duffy went out the prisoner made a blow at him, but whether he struck him or not I cannot say or whether the scissors were in his hand then.</p>
