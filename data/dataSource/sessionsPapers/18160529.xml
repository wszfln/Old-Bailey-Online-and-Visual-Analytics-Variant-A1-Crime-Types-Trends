            . I live in Baches-row, Hoxton. On the 13th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking very deliberately through <placeName id="t18160529-1-crimeloc3">Brook-street</placeName>

Upon his withdrawing his hand, he came to the right about, and ran across the Market-place, with a full cry of stop thief; I mean a number of persons after him. I believe I should have told you, that the man who spoke from the window was the first. I should have fallen from the violence of the push, only persons were behind me; if there were any persons belonging to the prisoner, they were behind me; but I don't know that they belonged to him, of my own knowledge. He was pursued closely by the man who saw him commit the act; that man picked up the case of the watch, which had fallen, and gave it to me, and said, I will pursue him, which he did, crying stop thief. I did not see him taken. I perfectly well observed the man, and I am as positive it was the prisoner, as I am of my own existence. I afterwards saw him in custody; I then declared myself positive that he was the man; I knew him to be the man, and said so among fifty or sixty people; he was close to me when I declared so; when I said so, he did not say any thing, but muttered something, which I could not understand. I have not seen my watch since; I saw the prisoner searched; but he had not got it. When he ran away, I saw nobody else running, but the persons who ran after him to take him. At the time he put his hand down, I cringed inwards, and he gave me a chuck under the chin with his other elbow. The box, or inner part of the watch, was silver-gilt; the outer case was metal; the chain was gold, and there were three valuable gold seals.</p>

            . On the 13th of May, I was looking out of my window, and saw three young men stop Mr. Holt, two pushed behind, and one before; I saw them take his watch; the one that was in the front took his watch; I saw the persons of the men; the prisoner was behind; he was not the man who took the watch. Directly I saw the watch drawed, the prisoner ran round the prosecutor, he ran round his right arm, and ran in front of him; the other two men ran the other way. I ran down stairs, and I followed the prisoner; the other two ran first, while the prisoner at the bar held Mr. Holt; he was longest there. Before I pursued the prisoner, I saw the case fall close to Mr. Holt's heels, behind him. I ran to the King's Arms public-house, and found the prisoner in the privy. The man who took the watch, put his elbow in Mr. Holt's throat, and knocked his head up; that was not the prisoner. I can't exactly say what the man did with the watch. I pursued the prisoner to the public-house; he went round, and in backwards, and the mob went in forwards; I saw him in the privy; the landlord opened the door, and I said that was the man; his clothes were not unbuttoned then. Mr. Ho't came in, and said, that is the man that robbed me of my watch.</p>

            . I was in the Market-place, Hoxton. I saw three men come up to the prosecutor; one struck him under the chin, and two men behind him; I did not see who robbed him of his watch; I did not positively see whether a watch was taken or not; but I saw the case of a watch drop; a man picked it up; it was on the ground, near to where the prosecutor was standing. The prisoner ran up Charles-square; I saw the other two no more; they ran another way; I ran after this man; he ran round Charles-square, and round the public-house, and hid himself in the privy; when the door was first opened, the prisoner was sitting, his breeches were then unbuttoned.</p>

            , ESQ. I know the prisoner at the bar; she was in my service from the middle of February, 1815, to the middle of February, in the present year. I left town to go the Circuit, on the 3rd of July, in the last year; I left nobody else at my house but her; I left property to a very considerable amount in my house; I left a great deal in my bed room on the second floor; I was occasionally at my house in the course of the autumn; but did not return until the 19th of January; I had an express came down to the country, to inform me that there had been a fire, and when I came up to town the chest of drawers in my bed room was consumed; the whole of it had been apparently burnt; I afterwards discovered a vast quantity of things pledged; the whole of those mentioned in the indictment; I found them about March last. I first of all sent for the prisoner, and enquired of her particularly about the fire, in consequence of missing a quantity of table linen, which was kept in a different part of the house from where the fire was; and the prisoner said, she hoped I would take pains to find it out; she supposed they had been stolen in the fire, and it was very prejudicial to her character; and I then said, that I was going to Bow-street, or that I had been to Bow-street, and I never saw her after that; in a few hours she absconded. In the evening of that day, in consequence of the foreman of a Mr. Tate, a pawnbroker, living at No. 1, Cambridge-street, Golden-square, calling on me, I went to his master's house. and saw there a quantity of caps; I think six or eight. I also went to the house of a Mr. Daubrise, another pawnbroker, in Oxford-street, and found the curtains of the bed in my room, which was consumed; also a necklace, a watch, and a ring. These had been all in the chest of drawers which was burnt; the curtains were on the bed, (which was also consumed,) when I left town.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was not the lady's maid with me when I had the drawers opened?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, once; but I have opened several locks since that. I know Mr. Pollen's lady's maid; I remember opening a door once when she was present.</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes, once she was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish to clear myself concerning the fire. I had to air all the mattrasses before the family came to town; the straw mattrass and the hair mattrass I aired, and put by; but I had to leave the white mattrass all night. I went up about five o'clock in the evening, but for fear of greasing the house, I did not take up any candle; I left a little fire in, and the white mattrass at the fire, and there was only breadth enough for a chair to stand between the fire and the bed, and the curtains were hanging over the mattrass. I then shut the drawing room window shutters, and all the shutters, and then went down stairs into the kitchen, and I never went up stairs from that time until a gentleman knocked at the door, and gave me the alarm of fire; he said, my good woman, your house is all on fire; I immediately ran up stairs, and the gentleman followed me, and I opened the room door, and was just going to rush in, when the gentleman pulled me back, and some more people came up, and soon after a fireman came, and we got water, and I assisted in getting water as quick as possible, and after the fire was extinguished, I came down stairs again, and when I came down the fireman said, what have you been doing with the mattrasses, and I said, I had aired them; and he said that it was from that mattrass which was near the fire that the fire began, and the furniture. The hair mattrass and the straw mattrass were burnt completely, and there was not so much of them left as could be worked up with new stuff again. I pledged these things, I own it, and it was my intention to redeem them again.</p>

I put the key in my pocket. It was quite dark when I went away; I had not the stable door in my view all the time; I had not seen it between eight and half past eight; if any one had entered the stable door between eight and half past eight o'clock, I was not in such a situation as I must have seen them. I returned to the stables at about a quarter after nine o'clock; I saw a light in the room up over the stables; my father was with me. We found the door open. My father went in, and stood at the door; I heard my father call out Bob, two or three times; he meant the postillion; I heard an answer made in a strange voice. My father then came out, and locked the door; we have two keys to the stable door; I had one, and my father the other. My father told me to go for assistance; I went to the ale-house, and brought assistance; Mr. Wright and Mr. Mackenzie came with me. When I got back to the stable, my father told Wright to take care of the stable, and he would go for more persons; he did so. On his return, they opened the door, and went in; he went up stairs, Mr. Wright, Mr. Mackenzie, and my father went up. Two or three days afterwards, I found a crow and two skeleton-keys in the litter of the horses in one of the stals; we clean out the litter once a week; we put fresh straw over the old, and so go on for about a week. It was light when I locked the door.</p>

Wright and Mackinzie seized them first, and I said is there any more of you; they said no. I said, I won't believe you; then I looked all round, and there was no more. After we got them down stairs, we took them to the watchhouse, and had them searched; we lodged the bundle in the watchhouse also. I know the handkerchief in which the bundle was tied up; it belonged to a brother of mine; a tablecloth was in the bundle, that was his Lordship's; also a pair of breeches, they belonged to

            . I live with Mr. Palmer, 199, Oxford-street, he is a coach-harness plater. I remember the evening of the 17th of May; I was sent by my master to Lord Darlington's stables, to take two territs; it was about nine o'clock when I got there, it was pitch dark; not knowing the stable, I hallooed out at the end of the mews, and was answered by a woman; I asked which was Lord Darlington's stables, and she told me they were the last on the left hand. In consequence of her information, I found out the stable; I tried the stable door to go up stairs, and found it fastened; I stopped there about four or five minutes; at last I could not make any one hear, and I hallooed out very loud boy, and a postillion answered me from the window, and I perceived by the light of a lamp opposite, that he was in his shirt sleeves, and he said, he was getting into bed, and could not come down, but told me where the coachman was. He sent me to the coachman at the public-house; instead of going to the Golden Lion, I went to the Red Lion, and left the territs there for the coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was quite pitch dark. I never returned to the stable after having gone to the public-house; all was quiet when I was at the stable; it had gone nine I rather think when I got there; it was four or five minutes after, and I returned straight home from the public-house, it was not a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after nine. Who had been at the stable between seven and eight o'clock, I don't know. All I know is that the door was locked at the time I was there; there was no lock outside; I know that, because I felt; I could not see. I felt the door, and felt a little staple, and put my finger through it, and shook the door, and found it was locked inside. The postillion was on the inside of the room.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. I found this staple by feeling; for I could not see. I left the two territs for the coachman at the public house; there was two coachmen, only I took the territs to the wrong public-house.</p>

Afterwards I saw the articles in the bundle; there was a pair of breeches in it which were mine; I had worn them that day; I hung them up in the room on a pin that day, when I took them off.

               <p>MR.

On the 11th of April last, I went out at about ten o'clock in the evening; I had been washing, and after that went out; I staid away about ten minutes; I locked the door after me; I am sure I locked it. When I came back again, I found it locked; I unlocked it with the key, and had hardly time to put the key in my pocket, when two men rushed out; I hallooed out stop thief; they did not touch me as they went out. After I hallooed out stop thief, they dropped a waistcoat and jacket; they were about two yards from me then? it was one of the two dropped them, but which, I don't know. I picked them up, and delivered them at the watch-house to Mr. Moore. They went a little farther, and dropped something else; the watchman took them, and I went to see what it was. The watchman and two other gentlemen secured them. I never lost sight of them from the time they went out of my house until the time they were secured. When they were secured, I went back to see what they had dropped, and found it was a whole quantity of keys, in a ridicule; one of the prisoners stooped a little when he dropped that, which I afterwards discovered to be a bag of keys. I gave those keys to the watchman to be taken to the watchhouse. I afterwards saw one of those keys tried on my lock, and it opened it. When I got back again to my own house, I found a bundle of wet clothes tied up in a strange handkerchief; that bundle was on a chair. I had left those in a clothes-basket on the table; there was another bundle of dry clothes tied up in another strange handkerchief, that was on another table.</p>

When I say rushed out, I mean they came out with speed, and I ran after them, and hallooed out stop thief; they had not got past my window before I hallooed out; the keys were dropped about three doors off; the watchman took the men about four doors off. This was the night before Good Friday. These men ran pretty fast; they did not resist; they begged of the watchman to let them go. Nobody was present when I picked up the jacket or the keys.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night before Good Friday, I was in my rounds in Sun-yard, at about ten minutes after ten, as near as I can tell, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the two prisoners running, and I took them into custody. Nobody was with me when I stopped them, but myself. I know where Mrs. Davis lives; it was about thirty yards from her house as near as I can guess; I took the prisoners to the watchhouse, with some assistance; the prisoners were not searched in my presence. Before I stopped them, I did not see either of them stoop down, or drop any thing. Near my box, when we came back, some keys were picked up by one of the witnesses; that was where I stopped the prisoners; my box is in Sun-yard. There were a good many keys; but I don't know how many. I delivered the prisoner to the care of the watch-house-keeper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. When I heard the cry of stop thief, I did not know whose voice it was; it appeared to be a woman's; the person who was crying it was about thirty yards off; I don't know whether it might be twenty, twenty-five, or thirty. I did not know where the prosecutrix's house was. Both the men were running, and when I laid hold of one, the other stooped first behind. I knew them, because I had seen them lurking about the night before; they did not resist. I saw the keys found; Newman found them; Mrs. Davis might be there to the best of my belief. I saw some keys produced the same night.</p>

            . I am a licensed victualler. I was in Sun-yard on the night of Thursday before Good Friday; I was standing in my bar, and heard the cry of stop thief; my public-house is in Sunyard. On hearing that cry, I ran outside the door, and saw the watchman have hold of the two men; I took hold of one of the men, and went with them to the watchhouse. When I came back from the watch-house, I found some duplicates; he tore one duplicate in half, and I took the other half of it in his hand. When I came back, I picked up the duplicates, a screw-driver, and pen-knive; I picked one key up; it seemed to be a key of a little box; I did not pick up any other keys; there were skeleton keys produced while I was there by a person of the name of Wapshere.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Mrs. Davis had been out of our house from two to five minutes before this. To the best of my knowledge, she might have been in my house a quarter of an hour, or half an hour; but I can't say positively; I did not see her come in, I don't know whether she was in company with any one or not; she was standing at the bar; I don't know whether she was with a sailor and some young ladies. As soon as ever I came out, the watchman had stopped these men; the watch-box is only about four doors from Mrs. Davis's She came to my bar and had a glass; I did not serve her myself.</p>

I never took any more notice then; but went in doors. I had not been in more than nine or ten minutes, before I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran out, and they passed my door, and this jacket and waistcoat were dropped; I did not know who dropped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290008"/>them; they were on the ground; I pursued the prisoners, and the watchman stopped them both; the keys were dropped, and no one else was returned at that time, but the two prisoners; I did not see either of them stoop; Mrs. Davis was following, and she stopped to pick up the waistcoat and jacket; she picked up the keys, and gave them to me; one key dropped out of the ridicule, and somebody else picked another up; but I don't know who. After I found the two prisoners were safe in the watchhouse, I went back and then these skeleton keys were found. I went with the prisoners to the watchhouse; Harvey as he was going along, tried to get his hands into his breeches pocket, and dropped something out just by the watchhouse, it was duplicates; he had torn one in half, and thrown half away, and the other half was taken out of his hand; I left the keys in custody of the officers;

I was paid the last, and was playing at shittels in the skittle-ground; until I was paid; I was about two hours in the skittle-ground; the prisoner was there. When I had got my money, I was going home to my lodging; as I was going through a bank in Stepney-fields, where there was an opening, the prisoner and another man were lying down on the other side, and the other man gave me a smack, and knocked me down, and this prisoner took my money; there were two ten-pound note, and three single notes. I never saw the prisoner from the time I was robbed, until about six weeks ago, nor did I ever see him before I saw him in the skittle-ground. After the robbery, I met a man, who advised me to go to Shadwell office, and tell what had happened; I did so, and an officer went with me, and looked every where after the man who had robbed me. I gave the officers a description of the man. I went to sea soon after I was robbed, and was gone for eight months. When I came back, I did not stay here long, but went to Russia almost directly; nobody was with me when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. He is older now; he has different clothes on; but his face is not materially altered; he had larger whiskers then than he has now; I described him to the officers has having long whiskers when he robbed me. I can't say I was sober at the time, nor was I drunk; I could stand, or go, or do any thing. I will swear I was not sick in the public-house. This was a very public field. The officers have been supporting me since the last session; I have heard that there is a forty pound reward if the man is cast.</p>

I first saw the last witness in the Summer of 1814; but on what day I can't remember; it was about eight o'clock at night, when I was shutting up the office; he said he had been robbed about half an hour before; he did not give me a description at that time; he gave me a description on the 30th of March, after he had been a voyage. We made every search for the man without effect. In consequence of the description he gave me, the prisoner was apprehended.

I asked the prisoner when I could have some bobs, meaning bad shillings; he said, he could let me have half a dozen then. I asked him what the price would be, and he said, the old price, half and half. I told him I had no objection, provided they were good ones, meaning good bad ones, and he handed me over half a dozen; I gave him a three-shilling piece, and told him that so small a quantity was no use to me, I wanted a couple of dozen more; he said, he could let me have them by eight o'clock the same evening; this was about three o'clock. I told him I could not wait so long, and asked him if he could not get them quicker; after some consideration, he said he could, and would go home, and set them to work, and would return in half an hour. He went away in about five minutes, and I went into the room where Vaughan and Dickins were, and pulled off my disguise, and followed him; I followed him to Angel-court; I saw him go into a house, which turned out to be No. 2; I waited at the door a few minutes, and when he did not come out, I returned to the public-house, which was about two hundred yards off; I found my brother officers there, and they came back with me; I went up stairs first; the upper room door was fastened; I peeped through the key-hole, and saw Carey rubbing something in his hand. Vaughan and Dickins had followed me; it was in the two pair of stairs. Near Carey was a chair, on which I could distinctly see three pieces, resembling shillings. We bursted the door open afterwards, and then Sloane had a pair of pinchers in his hand, and a file; he was filing something. The other two were sitting on another chair, with a basin between them, rubbing something with their fingers. I did not wait at the door above a minute; the other officers looked after me. We then burst the door open, and I seized the prisoner Carey, who immediately dropped what he had in his hands, into that basin, (points to another basin produced.) I secured him and Sloane, and the other officers secured the other two. Sloane immediately dropped the pinchers, and they fell at my feet, together with a round bit of brass. On searching Carey, this shilling dropped from him; these three were on the chair were he was sitting; this basin was also on the chair were he was sitting, and it had this wash in it, which I put into this bottle. Near Sloane were these five blanks. We secured the prisoners, and brought them away; their hands were all over a white stuff, which Dickins will produce; their hands looked as if they had been handling the peels of wallnuts; there was an empty bottle which was corked, and when the cork was drawn, it made a report; the cork also seemed very much burnt. I asked Carey where the good money was which I had given to him, and he said, he did not know.</p>

There was no more plate than Sir George's; there were some persons coming from the Argyle Rooms to take the seats away, which Sir George had hired. Persons going by, might observe that there was a stir and bustle going on in the house.</p>

            's house, to remove some of the things which he had hired. I was taking away cane seats, tables, and tressels. There was another porter named Roach. It was necessary that the door should be left open. In the course of the work, between half past one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the bar. To the best of my belief I saw her on the two pair of stairs landing place. I don't know whether she had any thing; she had a pair of pattens in her hand. I was coming down; thinking she was one of the servants of the house, I remarked to her, that it was a nice day, to what the day before was, when we brought the things, for it had been a rainy day; and she said, yes it was. From that moment's conversation I had sight and view enough of her to know it was she, when I saw her again; in the course of about three hours, or something less, I was as sure of her then, as I am now. I think she had something in her apron before her, but I can't swear.</p>

            . I am a linen draper, at No. 119, Oxford-street. On the day in question, I took notice of the prisoner by her being in my house. It is two turnings from John-street, which leads to Great Portland-street. It was about twelve o'clock. I had the Rev. Mr. Helm in my house, who on going out to his silversmith's left the street - door open, and I found the prisoner in my house. I knew her person; I saw her in about an hour and a half afterwards in Edward-street, Cavendish-square. She had then a large bundle of things in a table-cloth. From that to Sir George's house, which is about four or five hundred yards, or rather less than a quarter of a mile. I took particular notice of her and walked past her. When I turned round, she was out of my sight; she had gone down a gateway, where there was no thoroughfare. I went down also and heard a noise behind a stable gate, and I looked, behind, and immediately she ran off from behind it and up some steps, and said, I am undone, take the property? the property is yours, or something to that purpose. She was greatly confused. I called several persons but not one of them would secure her. I took her; I afterwards took the bundle from behind the gate, where she had left it. I afterwards examined it. There were one hundred and one pieces of silver plate. All these I gave to the officer. They were never out of my hands until I gave them to the officer. I delivered the prisoner to him also.</p>

I was with another young man; as we were coming along we saw a gang, apparently a great number together, fifty or sixty, as near as I can tell. They were coming through the wood, and we were going through; when about twenty of them had passed us, then they attacked both of us at once. I was struck over the head with a stick, and knocked down in the pathway. The other person who was along with me was thrown into the ditch, at the same time. I got up, and was immediately knocked down again. Then as many of them as could well get at me with their hands turned my pockets inside out. I had five shillings and sixpence in silver, and a metal watch about me. The five shillings and sixpence was taken from me, and they took my watch out of my fob; and as they were taking it, I caught hold of it, and they pulled and the chain broke. I then got up, and when they found I would not give up my watch, they knocked me down again. Then I was knocked down the third time; they kicked me on my sides and neck; when I got up, they cried ditch the b-gg-r, ditch him, and I was immediately thrown into the ditch. I got up again, and threw myself among them in the wood. When they found I fought so very hard, a very big one of them called out for a knife, and said, stand aside, and I will do for the b-gg-r. Immediately about half a dozen of them threw themselves upon me, and I caught hold of the prisoner Imber, who was one of them, and struggled with him, and he got away from me and ran into the fields, and I got away from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290011"/>others had got the watch, but I had it, in my hand. I had not observed the prisoner until I had got hold of him; he was one of the five or six who were upon me at last. I saw Vaughan and Jefferson when it was all over; I saw them coming down through the wood; Vaughan, Jefferson, Dickinson, and Rice; we told them what had been done to us. We afterwards went to the Sluice House; when we went there I went up stairs, and the officers went with me; I should think there were near an hundred or two hundred persons in the room up stairs; I picked the prisoner Imber out from amongst the persons in that room; I knew him; he was taken into custody by one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. This was on a Sunday. I did not see them fighting; I had no scuffle nor fight with any body there, nor went there to see any fighting. I carried away the watch from the place; I deceived them, because I had it in my hand, and they thought some of the others had it. They called it a tickler, and said if I did not give it to them they would do for me.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The persons we met, were men and boys; I do not know how far the Sluice House is from the place where I was robbed.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the public office Bow-street. I happened to be in Hornsey Wood, and saw Dickins, Maidment, and Rice there; we were going through the Wood about six o'clock in the morning, and met a great many men, the greater part of whom I knew myself, and amongst the rest was the prisoner Imber; they seemed as if they were hastening from a field at the farther end of the Wood. I knew Imber by sight before. In consequence of some conversation that took place between me and the other officers, we went towards this field at the farther end of the Wood. We saw two men, the prosecutor, and another, just recovering themselves, and they got up, and ran away; I hallooed out to them that we were officers, and produced my staff. and then they came up to us. In consequence of what they communicated to us, I took them to Sluice House, which is about a quarter of a mile from the place where I met them. In consequence of information which I received from Jefferson, who was below stairs, I found that the gang had gone up stairs; I went up stairs with Morgan and his companion, and the whole of the officers; when we were in the room, the prosecutor pointed out Imber, and I immediately took him into custody.</p>

I went out to go a palming that morning, and I met some men who had been palming too; there was a great many people behind us, and they all turned back into this mob of people, and as I came amongst them, they pushed me down; I hallooed out murder, and they pushed me down again, and took two shillings and five-pence from me, and I thought my life would be taken away from me every minute.</p>

Two holes were bored through the shutters, one with a gimlet, and the other with a centre-bit; they had first made a hole on that side of the shutter which would not enable them to get down the bar; then they made another hole on the other side large enough for them to get their hands through. I then discovered that the things mentioned in the indictment were gone; I discovered a basket was missing, which had been ready placed with the things to go to the mangle. At the lowest rate, the things I lost came to sixteen pounds, eighteen pounds, or twenty pounds; they were all my property; I was the sole occupier of the house, with my family. I can't say I was the last up the night previous; of my own knowledge, I know that the sash of the kitchen was fastened down; I went to bed at about eleven o'clock; I had seen the greater part of the things the night previous, before I went to bed; some I had worn, and some my children had worn. I was not disturbed at all until five o'clock. When I came down stairs in the morning, I found a gimlet in the kitchen, immediately under the shelf; in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290012"/>front court I found a large oak stick, and the kitchen bar, the bar which fastens the shutters; I found a candle also turned with the wick downwards in a salt-seller in the roasting-jack; there was salt in the salt-seller.

I can say so far as this here, that I was going over to Kingsland to my sister-in-law who lives there, to get her to stand Godmother to my child, and I saw this man, Butler, in a brick-field, and he called me over, and shewed me these bundles in the straw, and we agreed to take them to the next public-house, and as we were going along, these people stopped us, and as for running away, I never ran away at all.</p>

            . I saw Bone, Noble, and Banks; they were in the yard of this court; they were talking close to me about the prisoners, saying, they must say, they found some bits of muslin on them or it would not do. They said, they did not care if they stretched them, so as they got the money. A few pounds would be of use to them. Noble said, the few pounds would be of use, and the others conversed about the muslin.</p>

            . I was standing in the same way as the last witness decribed, and heard towards the latter part of this coversation. I heard them say that they would not mind stretching the b-gg-s if so be as they could get a few pounds, for it would be of use to them.</p>

When I over-heard this conversation between these witnesses, there were a great many people about; but I did not take notice who they were. I am sure I did not take notice whether there were so many as twenty or thirty; I heard this conversation near the outer-door.</p>

We went in, and I saw the two prisoners together at the Star and Horse Shoe. I was rather intoxicated, but not drunk, nor yet sober; I knew very well what I was doing. As we were going in, another young man was coming in; and he and my friend had rum and gin; he did not know my friend; he said, I will drink with you, for you are two taylors; from that he gave the glass to me, and after that to the prisoner; then the strange young man, tossed for half a pint of rum. The prisoners offered to toss to make it up a pint. There was not any particular conversation passed, any other wise then their drinking with us. I believe we all tossed. I tossed and we had the rum between us; five drunk out of a pint and a half; I had only one glass myself. The two prisoners at the bar walked away with me after that; they walked on each side of me. They said we could get some coffee, and we went to a coffee shop in <placeName id="t18160529-10-crimeloc60">Wych-street</placeName>

I went in, but immediately said to the prisoners I don't like the look of this place. I turned out directly, and got about six or seven yards from the door, when the prisoner Colville came up by the side of me, and presently the other prisoner came up. Before I got very little further, I found the prisoner Colville after putting his hand into my pocket. I believe he did not put his hand in, for I think I catched it. I said, you are after robbing me. By holding of him by the hand, I was knocked down, but I don't know by whom. The prisoners had no weapons with them that I perceived. I don't know whether it was with a stick that I was knocked down or how. My head was cut with the fall. It did not make me insensible. I saw nothing of the prisoners after that. As soon as I got up again, I missed my money. I discovered that I had lost between fifteen and sixteen shillings. I saw the prisoners no more, until they were taken to the watch-house. My friend was some distance off. at the farther end of the street, when I was knocked down. I saw the prisoners taken to the watch house in a very little time after.

            . I am a constable. On the Sunday morning, at about half past three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners at the bar, in company with the prosecutor, in Picket-street; there were two more behind, which I did not know at that time. Knowing Chapman, I followed them into Wych-street; they then went into the coffee-shop with the two others; they then came out of the coffee-shop, and I followed them until they came to the corner of Newcastle-street, in Wych-street; they stopped there about ten minutes; they then moved down Wych-street, towards the dark part, which is about the middle; I then crossed over the way. They then stayed there about ten minutes, and I heard some one say, you are robbing me; one of the men fell. I then went down towards them, and the two prisoners ran from the spot by me; I followed them until they got to a coffee-shop in Blackmore-street, Drury-lane. When I saw the prisoners go in there, I told the patrole, who was with me, to go back, and fetch the prosecutor. When he came, we went into the coffee-shop; I went up stairs, and I laid hold of Chapman by the collar, in consequence of what the prosecutor told me. I brought him down; I told him I wanted him; Colville followed down; I told Colville I wanted him also. The moment they came down, the prosecutor laid hold of Colville, and said, that is the man that had his hand in my pocket. I then took them and the prosecutor to St. Clement's watchhouse. I asked Colville what money he had about him, and after some hesitation, he said, fourteen or fifteen shillings; I searched him, and found sixteen shillings and four-pence, with two three-shilling pieces among it. He said, he had changed a one-pound note, when I asked him where he got it. I asked him where he changed it; but he did not know. I searched the other prisoner; but he had nothing at all. When I saw them in the first coffee-shop, I spoke to Chapman; he knew I was an officer; he did not see me in the street after that, because I evaded his sight. I am sure the prosecutor did not join two other men than the prisoners, after he came out of the first coffee-shop in Wych-street. Chapman said to me in the first coffee-shop, how are you Mr. Berry, I hope you will not take any notice of my being here.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I asked the prisoner Colville, how he got the money, and he said, he had been in Shoe-lane to receive some money for his work. I asked him how much, and he said, he believed a one-pound note. I then asked him where he had changed it, but he could not tell where he got change. I then locked them up, and on the Sunday morning, Colville's mother came, and I asked her in his presence, if she knew any thing of his getting a one-pound note for work; and she said, she did not. Then he said, he received one pound one shilling all in silver. When the prosecutor came to the watchhouse, he was violently bruised, and all over mud.</p>

I saw the prisoner Colville before; I never knew him before; I knew it was him, because I went to the watchhouse; I was about twelve yards from him when he knocked him down, and after he got up, he knocked him down again.</p>

               <p>Chapman's Defence. When the prosecutor first came in, he said all the money he had was two three-shilling pieces, and he lent his friend a three shilling piece, and spent two shillings and eightpence himself, and then the landlord would not draw any more liquor, and we all came out together, and then the prosecutor said, he had lost his two three-shilling pieces, and he accused us of robbing him, and I shoved him down.</p>

            . I am a constable. At about ten o'clock in the morning of the 23rd of May, I was just going out of my door, and saw the prisoner at the bar running from the corner of Limehouse Causeway; I stood at the corner of the house seeing him run with a hat in a handkerchief in his hand; I was preparing myself to have a run after him. When I heard the cry of stop thief, I immediately pursued him, and when he had got about half way across a field, he threw away the hat, which I picked up in pursuing him. In a moment, I missed him, and found him again up an alley, where there is no thoroughfare. On searching him, I found a socket chisel on him, which has been bent for the purpose of prizing things. I took him to the watchhouse, and gave the hat to the night-beadle. We went afterwards, and found marks where the window had been prized up, which this chissel exactly fitted. The window had one line broke, and would not slide easy.</p>

I asked him what I was to stand for them, and he said, the old price, half and half. I told him, I had no objection, provided they were good ones. He then produced these half dozen, for which I gave him a three-shilling bank token. I looked at those he gave me, and said, I had seen better ones than those; I told him I wanted a larger quantity, and he said, he would endeavour to alter them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am a poor friendless young man, only twenty three years of age, seven of which I have spent in his Majesty's service. It was the first offence I was ever guilty of and real distress was the cause of it, as I had no employment whatever since I was discharged. Immediately on my apprehension, I confessed my guilt, as Mr. Newman, the Publican, promised that I should not be prosecuted. I have only one friend in London, who at present lies dangerously ill, and therefore can't attend to give me a character, although he knows me from my infancy. I however, most humbly hope and implore that your lordship, as it is my first offence, will pass on me a favourable sentence, and your lordship's supplicant will ever pray</p>

            . I am a Scotchman. I know the prisoner. I recollect the Sunday he was taken into custody; I parted with him at about half past ten; I left him in Sun-yard, Nightingale-lane, with the woman of the house, the prosecutrix; he had money when he went up stairs in that house; I am quite sure it was that house, kept by that woman,(pointing to the prosecutrix,) I knew the other woman who went up stairs with the prisoner. I remained in the house after he went up stairs with the woman, and after he came down again; he was not above a quarter of an hour with the girl, and they came down quarrelling; it was near ten and eleven o'clock when he came down, as near as I can recollect. The other young man and I went out, and left him quarrelling with the old woman, the prosecutrix. I am quite sure I left the prisoner taking about ten minutes with her, before I left the house.</p>

On the 17th of May last, I had been passing the evening with some friends in Hungerford-street, in the Strand; it was nearly eleven o'clock when I left them; I drank nothing but ale all the evening; I came directly down the Strand, and Fleet-street, and up Ludgate hill, in my way home. When I got to the top of Ludgate-hill, I was going to cross to get to the left hand side of St. Paul's Church-yard, when an elderly gentleman, with either grey or powdered hair, ran against me; a few words ensued, and the two prisoners came up to me; I have no doubt of them. They said, the old man was in fault; they said they would stand my friends, and they each took hold of my arms, and took me out of the crowd which had collected. We then proceeded up St. Paul's Churchyard, and got into Friday-street, and met a watchman there, and asked him if any house was open in the neighbourhood where the prisoners and I might have a friendly glass together; it was I that proposed to take a friendly glass. The watchman told us that they were up at the White Horse, in Friday-street; we went there, and got a glass each, I and the two prisoners; I had a glass of brandy and water, and they had each a glass of rum; one of them paid for it. We all went out together; we were not in the house ten minutes; we all left it together. I then asked them the way to the Belle Savage Inn, on Ludgate-hill, as it was so late, and they said, they would tell me. We then turned down to the right into Fish-street; I was a stranger to that neighbourhood, and have learned since that that is the name of the street. We then turned down <placeName id="t18160529-28-crimeloc141">Lambeth-hill</placeName>

The effect of the blow was that I fell. I was a good deal stunned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what happened to you while you were on the ground - A. I was robbed while I was on the ground; my pocket-book and watch were taken from me while I was down; I missed them when I came to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any body taking them - A. No; I did not. I was stunned by the blow or fall. I had my pocket-book and watch immediately before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the last time you felt your pocketbook and watch about you - A. In Fish-street; when I had left Mr. Mountain's, then I had them safe. When I got up, Jonas was with me, and he only. The watchman came up just at that moment, and I told him, I was robbed of my pocket-book and watch. Jonas was present when I told the watchman this. He said, you don't think I have robbed you, do you, if you do, I will go with you to the watchhouse. We then proceeded down the hill altogether; when we got near to the bottom, Jonas asked the watchman how far it was to the watchhouse. The watchman told him it was close at hand, when he immediately ran off, and the watchman after him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290018"/>got clear off. I went down to the watchhouse. I saw them again in about a fortnight after; not before; I can't exactly say. I had given a description of them. I knew the notes, and the numbers of them; I went to the Bank of England the next morning; eleven of them came into the Bank of England, but they have all fictitious addresses on them; I had nineteen five-pound bank notes, and eleven of them have been stopped.</p>

            . I keep the White Horse Inn, in Friday-street. On the night of the 7th of May, the last witness came into my shop, at about a quarter before twelve; the two prisoners came in with him; they had each a glass of rum, and he had a glass of brandy, to which I put some water; they were in company at my house together, and stood together; they stood about ten minutes together; they went out together; I am positive the prisoners are the men.</p>

            . I was a watchman on Lambeth-hill. On the 7th of May, I heard a scuffle and noise between twelve and one; I made up to the spot as quick as I could; when I got there, I found a little man, but can't swear to the prisoner Jonas. I found Mr. Shaw and that little man arm in arm; Mr. Shaw stood a little, and then said, he was robbed of his pocket-book; then he said, he was robbed of his watch. The little man said, if he thought he had robbed him, he would go with him to the watch-house, and he searched. I laid hold of the gentleman one side, and he on the other; we were alls going to the watchhouse together, and when we got a little distance from the watchhouse, the little man asked me how far it was off, and I told him not far, and he immediately loosed the gentleman, and ran away from him, and I after him, crying stop thief; but he got clear away, and was not stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of this robbery from Richard Shaw; I think that was about Friday, the 10th; I received a description of the prisoners two or three days after the robbery, from Mr. Mountain; I did not know Mr. Shaw. In consequence of that description, I desired the two prisoners, whom I knew, to meet me at the Mansion House coffee-house; they met me there on the 21st. I did not tell Mr. Shaw that they were in the room; but I immediately went to Mr. Mountain, and requested him and his waiter would step down, and go into the parlour, and see if there was any body there they knew; the waiter came first, and I sent him into the room, and he came out into passage, and said he believed the little one to be one. I then desired him to go back and fetch his master. Mr. Mountain then came, and pointed out the little one. I then went up to the Mansion House; but found the Lord Mayor was gone. I locked them up in the Compter for that night; the next morning I brought them before the Lord Mayor. I suppose there were at least seven or eight persons in the room where the prisoners were, when Mr. Shaw went in; it is a back room; I had seen the two men at the bar the day before.</p>

They were marked on the near hip with a wheel pitch mark. I left them in the care of Colman, my drover, and I never saw the lot again until they came to Smithfield. Then two were missing from the lot belonging to Tuckwell. I afterwards found them at Uxbridge, at a butcher's of the name of Maden. They were the same sheep; that was on the 21st.</p>

I did not miss any until they came here on Thursday night. When I droved them, I found two missing; They were Mr. Tuckwell's; that was Thursday night, the 18th. On friday afternoon, I enquired after them. On Saturday morning, I went to Maden's, and found the two sheep; they were the two I had lost; they were wethers.</p>

            . On the Friday morning, my boy told me what had happened. Upon that, I went to the pig-stye, and saw the sheep. They were what were clamed by Mr. Ebsworth. I saw the prisoner the same day. He told me he had put in two tired sheep out of the drove, and wished I would kill them and send them to London. He wanted me to make a dead bill of them, and give him the money. I did not consent to that. That is not the regular course of business. We never give a dead bill before the sheep are dead and sold. He left word for me to kill them, and send them to London. I suspected something, and therefore would not.</p>

            . That is in the way from Southall to Uxbridge. In the afternoon of Thursday, I saw the prisoner at about two o'clock take two sheep athwait our green. I had seen him before, and knew him. He had only two; he and is dog were after them. He appeared to come from Southall, and went off for Ryslip, instead of going the nighest way to Uxbridge. That is the farthest way; It is going crossways; I think it is seven miles, or more, to go by Ryslip, and by the nearest road, it is only five miles; Ryslip way is a bad road, but is more private.</p>

On Friday evening, the 10th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I happened to go to that part of the shop where the prisoner was at work, and found some metal concealed under some iron plates. I asked my apprentice if he had put it there, and he denied it. Accordingly I marked the metal, and left it where it was. I went into the shop between nine and ten at night, and it was there then; but it was gone the next morning between seven and eight; I got an officer, and as the prisoner was going to breakfast, I stopped him, and accused him of robbing me, which he denied. I told him, I would take him up on suspicion, and he went, and looked under the iron plates, and said, there is none there. I told him he knew that as well as I did. Then I ordered the officer to take him into custody, and then he said, I will find you the metal; he then went down stairs, and the officer and I followed him, and in the shop, under the stairs, where there were several casks of sand and rubbish, he brought the metal out from where he had concealed it. I then told him that was not all, and we went to his house, and found the plates mentioned in the indictment on the shelves in the kitchen, and the teapot on his premises.</p>

On the day in the indictment, as I was going up stairs, I met the prisoner on the second flight, coming down with the property in question; she enquired for a gentleman of a different name from that of any one living in the house. The coats were on her arms; I called a gentleman whose chambers were on the first floor to assist me. She was secured, and an officer was sent for; one coat belonged to my master, and the other to Mr. Boyes.</p>

I was robbed in Skinner-street, within thirty yards of my own door, on Saturday, the 27th of April, at about twelve o'clock at night; I was on the Sun-street side of <placeName id="t18160529-44-crimeloc238">Skinner-street</placeName>

I saw the two prisoners at the bar, there was a sailor with them; they were dressed much the same as they are now; I have not seen the sailor since. The two prisoners stopped me at the corner of Skinner-street, at the oil-shop corner. The prisoner Dunnage put his elbow against the wall, and would not let me pass. Then the tall one, the <rs id="t18160529-44-deflabel239" type="occupation">sailor</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

I turned off from them then, and went to the side of the street that my house was on. Then the prisoners crossed down upon me, and came before me within about thirty yards of my own door, and then they said, now b-gg-r your eyes, we have got you; give us up your money, all you have got, or we will have your life. I said, I had got no money, and they said, I was a b-y liar, and they said, they knew better, for I had money, and they would have it, or murder me directly. I turned round then, thinking to turn back, and did not think that the sailor was behind me; I turned round, and the sailor caught me by the throat, and nearly throttled me with his nails, and prevented my going away, and told me to stand still; I had hard to do to breathe. The two prisoners then held my arms, and the sailor felt my pockets, to see if I had a watch, but I had not. I was then endeavouring to get away, and was looking every way to make an alarm, and they said, if I made any alarm, they would murder me outright. The two prisoners took from me a pocketbook; it contained my fishing materials; I am positive there were not less than six fishing lines, and six hooks; they also took from me four penny-pieces; I gave them three, and told them if they would let me go, I would give them a pint of beer. They took a knife also, which was in the pocketbook, it was part of the furniture of the book, and five keys; my keys were in my coat pocket. I was endeavouring to get away several times, and before I could get away, these two prisoners said, if he will be so very obstropolous kill him out of the way, any how you like. Then they beat my hat down over my face, so that I could not see, and struck me at the back of my head into the middle of the road, and then when I pulled my hat off, I found there was nobody near me; they dragged me clean off my feet for two yards. The next time I saw any of them was at Bishopsgate watchhouse, on the Monday night, where I saw the two prisoners; they were taken in consequence of a description of them which I had given to Mr. Sapwell; I described them as soon as possible. When I saw them at the watchhouse, I had a strong idea that they were the men; they were sitting, and I desired them to stand up, and then I was sure of them, and that confirmed my recollection of them, and when they spoke, I had had such an opportunity of observing their voices from the ill language they had given to me, that I was sure and positive of them. I have never seen any of the articles that were taken from me on the Saturday night. I had first described their persons to Mr. Armstrong, and then he sent me to Mr. Sapwell, and I described them to him then, and to Shepherd. At the time I charged them at the watchhouse, they said nothing that is particular.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoners on Monday the 29th; I took them both at eight o'clock at night; that was on the Monday, after the Saturday that this man says he was robbed. I took them just at the skirts of the City, just at the end of Bishopsgate-street. I have heard the prosecutor describe the place where he was robbed, and that is in the City. I siezed hold of Dunnage first. I had had a description of three, but only took these two, and took them by the descriptions. Fellows wipped past my left hand. I took Dunnage, and gave him to Gildersleve, the patrole, and then persued Fellows, and took him. I had not told them when I took them at first, what I took them for; Fellows asked me what I wanted with him; he said he was not in company with the other, and did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290023"/>him, meaning Dunnage. I had seen them together in the fore part of the day. I saw them together, so as to know they were companions. I had seen him twice the day before in company with the other. I took them both to the watch-house. I knew where to find the prosecutor, and informed him that I had got them. In consequence of that information, he came to the watch-house. I told him to look at them; they were the only persons in custody. I told him to be very circumspect before he said any thing; he looked at them; he sat close to them. There was nothing said then. He came out with me and Sapwell, and then went in again, and desired that they might stand up, and button their coats, and put their hats on. I asked him then if he knew them, and he said he was certain that they were the men. I asked him if he had any doubt, and he said none whatever. He said he recollected their person, and said, I know your voices particularly. Nothing was found on them relating to this charge. I afterwards went with Sapwell, to search Dunnage's lodging, but nothing was found.</p>

My lord, and gentlemen of the jury; I most humbly address these few lines to you in this form, hoping that your kindness and great humanity, will extend to a poor friendless boy, and not be led away by the influence of false swearers. Though poor and distressed, I have not been guilty of the crime imputed to me, and should I be so fortunate as to meet your kind humanity, my lords, and gentlemen, be assured nothing shall tempt me to do wrong, or fall into the hands of bad company, which I have at all times avoided before. I have an aged mother in a most distressed state, whose only care is for my liberty, and wellfare, and should I meet your kindness and compassion, be sure I will fly to the arms of a tender mother, and never more disgrace her, or give her pain, but ever make it my study through life to make her comfortable, and happy. Humbly praying your kindness and consideration, and merciful goodness towards me, for which I shall be in duty bound to pray, and humble submission I remain,

            . I lived at Pitt-street, Tottenham-court-road. I had known the prisoner about two months before this first occured; I washed for him occasionally. On Saturday, the 6th of April last, he came to my lodging in Pitt-street, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he asked me if I could accompany him to the City upon a little business; I hesitated at going at first, because I nursed children; his washerwoman being in my room, she offered to take charge of the children while I went; by which reason, I agreed to go. The prisoner told me he would pay me for my trouble, and loss of time. I then went with him. He told me he was going to the Bank, to receive a little money, it was his sister's. He said, he had received a letter from his sister, who being in the country, in situation, she could not possibly come to Town; and he had received this letter, with instructions to get a woman to go with him to the Bank. Mr. Gregory in his way thither, told me I was not to write in the book. I had asked him a question whether I was to write my name; and he said, I was not; but to make a mark. I then asked him if writing my name, would not answer the same purpose; he told me, no. I don't remember whether he mentioned the young woman's name or not; I don't think he did; but he said, her mark was in the book before, and therefore it must be a mark. We then proceeded onwards towards the Bank. He told me if the broker asked me any questions, to say, my time was very limited, and to beg the favour of the broker to dismiss us as soon as possible. I don't recollect any thing else. I then sat down, and he told me, he would go and speak to the broker. When he returned, I don't recollect any thing particular that he said to me. He gave me his papers; but I don't recollect whether he went to speak to the broker or not. I think he told me one of the papers was the power of attorney, and the other was of no use. I saw Mr. Weeden, the broker, soon after, he came up together. I think Weeden gave me that paper. (Paper put into the hand of the witness.) But Gregory stood by. The broker put a name on it, and then put it by, and I went into the office with him. I then went to a place, and saw a book, and put a mark in it, by the direction of Gregory; Gregory was present at the time, as was Mr. Weeden. (A book produced to witness.) That is the mark I made. That being done, we returned to the broker's desk, and the broker gave Mr. Gregory a check, it was a bit of paper; I did not read it, Then Gregory and I went to Banbury's and Co, the bankers; we went into the bankers. I saw Gregory give the check to the clerk, and the clerk asked him what notes he would have it in, and he said, one-pound notes; and he received twenty-one, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290024"/>silver and halfpence, but I don't know how much; we then returned as far as Bloomsbury-square together; he then left me to go into a watch-maker's; I then went on by myself, and Mr. Gregory overtook me, in Store-street, near Goodge-street. He had left me for about ten minutes, and then came again. On our way home, he told me not to mention this to any one person. When he came to my lodging, he still wanted it to be kept a secret before me and his washerwoman; he might stay about half an hour in Pitt-street; this was on the Saturday. I communicated what passed to Mr. Hutchins, the father of two children that I had the charge of; I communicated it also to my brother, and on the Tuesday morning, I went to Marlborough-street; then I sent to the Bank of England. I went of my own accord to the magistrates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I had only known the prisoner two months before. They did not read over what it was to me which I put my mark to.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. The broker never read any thing to me. I was able to read, as well as to write. I saw the broker write after I had made the mark; I did not see what name he wrote. I don't recollect that the prisoner gave me any directions when he gave me the papers. The prisoner was a tailor.</p>

            . I am a stock broker. On the 24th of March, I first saw the prisoner; he was introduced to me by a gentleman named Pidlake; he stated that he wished for a power of attorney for the transfer of some stock, that he was ignorant of the business, that it was stock standing in the name of

            ; he said there was only twenty five pounds navy five per cents. I then asked him to let me look at the stock receipt, which he did.(Receipt put into the hand of the witness.) That is the receipt. I stated to him then the impropriety of of having a guinea and sixpence for so small a sum of stock; he said, it was a great deal of money to pay, I told him he had better put it off all together, and he wished me a good morning, and went away. On the next day, he came again, and stated that he had seen the party, or heard from her; he said that she was in the country, and wished for the money, and I was to procure a power of attorney for the money. I then inquired of him for the Bank stock receipt a second time, and then I prepared the necessary instructions for drawing the power of attorney; before I lodged instructions I examined, and found it correct. That is the power of attorney. (paper put into the hand of the witness.) He waited on me at the Bank at twelve o'clock on the next day, and I asked him for a guinea and sixpence, and he said he had not so much, but would thank me to pay the same for him. I paid the guinea and sixpence, and I asked him when it would be likely to be returned; he said in the course of a day or two. He came to me on the following morning, and stated that the family were Miss Coward was in service had arrived unexpectedly in town, from Brighton, and she would attend herself to make the transfer. He did not return me the power of attorney. I saw no more of the prisoner for three, four, or five days. I then met with him on the Rotunda, on the 31th of March; I then asked him were Miss Coward was; he waited there from eleven to twelve o'clock, He told me he had made an appointment with her to meet that day. No one came that day. He stated he was much surprized at her not coming, as he had said she was coming at twelve o'clock. On Saturday, the 16th of April, he came to me in the Rotunda; I had then only left my clerkship three days, he stated that Mrs. Coward would be there, and he would thank me to put the ticket forward, as he hoped she would not be kept long. I then prepared the transfer ticket. I paid a private transfer on the ticket, and sold the stock to Mr.

I then went to the division, and enquired if a ticket was entered in the name of Coward, and found it was. (Turning to the book.) This is the transfer.

I attested it, and Mr. Mappel and Mr. Gibbins witnessed it, and I witnessed the identity. We then went back to the desk in the Rotunda. I then enquired of them who was to pay the guinea and sixpence for the power of attorney, and the prisoner told me to pay myself; I made him out an account, and paid him twenty-one pounds and three-pence; I gave a check for that amount.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. I never asked the woman whether her name was Coward; but I think I said to her at the time I saw her, good morning, Mrs. Coward. My acquaintance with Gregory had been of but twelve days standing. On his representation, I took this woman to be Mrs. Coward. From the power of attorney, and from my examining the account, and finding it correspond, I thought it was all correct. I asker her to sign her name, and she said, she could not; but she made her mark. I told her it was for twenty-five pounds navy five per cents. I did not read over any part of the transfer to her, except saying it was transfer twenty-five navy from Coward to Partridge; I don't recollect that I read the words

            . I lived with a family in Hanover-square. I know the prisoner at the bar; I have known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to you for money - A. Yes; he was always asking me for money. From time to time, I lent him different sums. I had a sum of twenty-five pounds in the funds. I did not purchase it myself. I received the dividends on that stock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever ask you for your receipt - A. Yes; but not to destroy. I can't recollect what time I lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of last year - A. I can't tell what month; it was since Christmas; he had it about a month, before I asked him for it. I don't remember when he was taken up. It was on a Friday he asked me for it again; and as I learn, this transfer was made the next day, Saturday. He asked me for it again on the same evening that he had returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the Bank in the course of this last year to make any transfer of that stock - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any mark in any book for transfering that stock, or to any receipt - A. No. I once went with the prisoner to the Bank; but did not get it out. I saw the prisoner on the Friday before this happened; he did not say any thing about going to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. Q. How came you to lend him this receipt - A. Only to shew people that he had money. He often asked me to get it out, but I always said, I could not promise him to go. I went with him once for the purpose of getting it out; but could not get it out, for the Bank was shut; I don't know when that was; it was since Christmas; but before I received my January dividend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he propose to you to get it transfered - A. He asked me; but I refused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about its being transfered without your going to the Bank - A No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you some one else could supply your place in transfering it - A. I believe he did once; but I told him he could not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. He requested you to consent to that, and you refused - A. No. He asked me to allow some one else to supply my place, and I said, no one else could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he could not get a person-did you not say he might if he could - A. No. I never authorized him to get it out.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. Did you mean to give him permission to get another person, if such person could be found - A. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lent him money by going to the Bank, and transfering money there - A. Yes; I took seven pounds out for him last year.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Did you ever go with him to take out money to lend him - A. Never.</p>

Before we went from the door, she asked me if I had got the transfer of the money, and I told her I had, and accordingly gave it to her. She asked me if I could go home with her, and I told her my circumstances, and that I had got some things to do, and if she could lend me some money, I would thank her, and she said, she could, but she had not got it about her, it was in the Bank, and if I could get a person to go with me to get it, I was wellcome. I did not know the danger of these things, and I went to this person, and asked her to come, and we went.

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. I remember the deceased being brought to the Hospital on Saturday, the 22nd of April. On examining him, I discovered a contusion on the forehead, and a mortification of the foot and leg, and a fracture of the larger bone of the leg. It appeared that the fracture had arisen from violence, either a blow or a fall might produce it, and suppose the injury might have been done three or four days; It is impossible to say exactly. The mortification which had succeeded, would certainly occasion death. I don't think the decased could have walked after the fracture. I attribute the mortification to the fracture, and the violence done to the leg. There were a few excoriation or scars about the knee; they were not of a recent nature. The mortification had proceeded to that lenght that amputation was necessaray. The amputation took place, and the deceased survived it but twelve minutes or a quarter of an hour. I attibute his death to the violence done to the leg, and to the mortification.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. The deceased had been seven days in the Hospital before the amputation took place; there was a fever on the deceased, which were symptomatick.</p>

In April last, I was in my own house, and I remember the male prisoner, the deceased, and another boy coming at about ten o'clock in the morning; it was the 2nd of April; they went into a room over my head, which was empty, for the purpose of sweeping the chimney. After they had been there some time, I heard the cries of a child screaming violently, and I heard blows. In consequence of this I called Mrs. Reeves, who went up stairs and I followed her. The first thing I saw when I got into the room was the prisoner, stooping up the chimney shaking back handed at the child up the chimney with such a brush as chimney sweepers usuly have; the child was screaming violently, and had been screaming for half an hour before we went up. I told him the child was not his own, or he would not use it so; he said it was nothing to me, and pulled him down by his legs, and dashed him down on the hearh stone. The child layed on its back, and received a violent blow on the back of its head by this fall. I told him if I was not confined in the manner in which I was, namely child-bed, I would lay an information against him. The child was then put up the chimney; he lifted it up in his arms and put it up the chimney, and put the other boy after it, The other boy was about ten years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The other boy went up without force or violence. I went down stairs then, and did not see the little boy afterwards.</p>

            . On the day the last witness has mentioned, I remember the prisoner and the two boys coming to our house to sweep the chimney. I remember Mrs. Ware calling to me, and my going up stairs with her into the room where the prisoner was. Before she called me, I had not heard any noise. The little boy was then some little distance up the chimney; I could not see any part of him. The prisoner was standing by the chimney, and he was extending his arm up the chimney, and I saw him bring the child down by its little legs. I don't know whether I was in the room before Mrs. Ware or not. Then he put him up the chimney again, and the child cried, and said his knees hurted him. Then the child came down again; he took it by the back part of its little breeches, and dashed it on the hearth. Then he put it on the big boys back, and sent him up the chimney, and when they came down again, the prisoner took the hearth broom, and struck the little boy several blows on the back and loins. He was then standing on the hearth shaking the soot off its cloths, It put its little shoes on, and trembled very much, and the prisoner put a black bag on it, and then they went down. The child walked down stairs with his hand against the wall, and the prisoner turned round to him, and swore he would serve him out. I followed them down towards the door, and saw them walk out.</p>
               <p>Evidence was here about to given of some transactions supposed to have taken place relative to the prisoner and the deceased on the 23rd of April, the day stated in the indictment to be the day on which the deceased sustaind the injuries that occasioned his death but</p>
               <p>THE COURT, Interposed to prevent such evidence from being given, in as much as the prosecuting party had gone in the first instance to establish the guilt of the prisoners by evidence of a transaction which took place so far back as the 2nd of April; it was by no means from any desire to stifle inquirs or prevent the ends of justice that the court here interposed, because in all cases, but more particularly perhaps where the case of a helpless infant came under consideration injury would always be traced as far as consistence with regularity would permit.</p>

            . I am an attorney. In December last, I lived in James-street, Lambeth Marsh. I became acquainted with the prisoner on the 1st of December last; he and Austen called at my residence; the prisoner said he came in consequence of my letter relative to the reversion of five hundred pounds at the death of a lady aged sixty. I asked him what he expected for it, and he said, three hundred and fifty pounds. I then stated to him that it was necessary I should have an extract of the will from the Commons, under which the lady claimed. He said, he should get it, and nothing farther passed at that interview. I think I saw him next on the 8th, he called on me in company with Austen, with the extract, and shewed it to me. On perusing the extract of the will, and observing it to be in the names of the trustees, I said, that the surviving trustee must join in the transfer; the prisoner thought not. I told him, I should apply to some one professionably, and I applied to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges, they are solicitors in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street; I went to their office shortly after I received the extract; I saw Mr. Ballachi. I afterwards communicated to the prisoner what passed. I told him that two hundred and seventy pounds or two hundred and seventy-five pounds had been offered, and Mr. Ballachi said it depended on the nature of the stock, The prisoner said it was worth three hundred and fifty pounds; but I was to do the best I could. I told him Mr. Ballachi had said that the trustee must join, and I recommended Boyce to go down to Tasker to ask him his conset to the deed of assignment; I understood he lived at Dartford. In five or six days the prisoner proposed to go down. I think he next came on the 20th of December; he came with Austen; they generally came together; he said, he had been down to Mr. Tasker, and had obtained his consent to execute the deed, and requested that the business might be expedited. I mentioned to him that certificates of the deaths of certain parties were necessary to be produced. The prisoner and Austen came together on the 20th; the prisoner said he had been down to Mr. Tasker, at Dartford, and obtained his consent, and Mr. Walker was his attorney. Upon that, I called on Messrs. Ballachi and Co. and told the prisoner afterwards what passed at that interview. I saw the prisoner again at the latter end of December; Austen was with him. I told the prisoner I had been to Ballachi and Bridges's, and two hundred pounds was offered for this; this was at the New York coffee-house, and I said, I thought it was too little, and I recommended him not to take it. However he requested me to try if I could get two hundred and fifty pounds. I went to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges's; Mr. Ballachi was out of Town, and I informed the prisoner after that, that they would extend it to two hundred and ten pounds, and the expences to be paid out of the two hundred and ten pounds. The prisoner said, they would take it. On that, I went to Mr. Bridges's, and told him to prepare the draft of the deed of assignment, as it would be taken. I received the draft of the assignment, I think on the 8th of January, also a letter accompanying it, directed to Mr. Walker, of Dartford. I handed that note and the draft to Mr. Boyce, on the same day, I think, at the New York coffee-house; it was then perused by Boyce, and he said, he should go as that afternoon to Tasker. That is the draft. He proposed going down with the draft and letter, and to see Mr. Walker besides. In the evening of the following day, Mr. Austen came to me, and gave me that draft; there was something written on it then which had not been written before. I saw Boyce a day or two afterwards, at the New York coffee-house, and he then merely asked if the business was going on. I said, you have been to Dartford, and seen Mr. Tasker and Mr. Walker; and he said, he had, I said, I supposed the attorney had been paid, and mentioned that a guinea was usual to be paid; and he said, he had been paid; nothing more passed. The draft was left with me, and I handed it to Messrs. Ballachi and Bridges for the purpose of being endorsed. I received the deed, accompanied by a letter, on Sunday, the 14th of January. That is it. I look at the power of attorney; I saw that at the same time. Boyce called on me the same after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290028"/>noon, and I told him I had procured the deed, with the power of attorney and letter, and stated to him the manner in which it ought to be executed, and he appeared to be extremely ill, and I thought he was very ill, and I asked him, and he said, he was; and I told him, I would go down to Mr. Tasker and Mr. Walker, and see the business executed, and he said, there is no occasion for that, I will go. I then delivered the deed and power of attorney to him. I understood he was going down that evening. I was to see him the next day at one o'clock; I did not see him. Austen came to me with the deed and power of attorney, as executed; as they are now; they purported to be executed by

            . I then immediately went to Ballachi and Bridges, but it was too late to get the stock transfered that day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was Austen alone when you met him at the coffee-house, and he gave you the papers as executed?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes. I saw Boyce the next morning; Austen was with him then; Boyce asked whether the business was done; and I told him I had been to the stock-broker, Mr. Watts, and it appeared on looking at two powers of attorney, one signed John Tasker, 1801, and the other, the present, that they were quite different, and the transfer could not be made until that difference of hand-writing was accounted for. Boyce said, it was very extraordinary. I said, that the gentlemen of the Bank directed me to send a letter to Mr. Tasker, to account for the difference, and it must be put into the post; I did write such a letter, and kept a copy of it; I shewed it to Boyce when I had written it. I proposed to put it into the post; but Boyce said it would go quicker by a returned post chaise, which would go from the Kent-road, and I made an observation that the gentlemen of the Bank expected it to go by the post, as I thought I would take it myself, it did not make any difference; accordingly I folded the letter up in a parcel, and sealed it up, and directed it to Mr. Tasker, Boyce and Austen then accompanied me to the Bull Inn, Kent-road. On going into the parlour, I took up the paper; soon after, Boyce came into me, and said, Mr. Gill, there is a chaise at the door, and the post-boy is in the tap-room. I then went into the tap-room, and gave the parcel to the boy, and asked him if he knew Mr. Tasker, and he said, he did. I asked the boy his name, and he said, 
               <persName id="t18160529-49-person475">
                  Charles

            . Boyce paid him a shilling, and I strictly enjoyned the boy to deliver the parcel to Mr. Tasker the moment he got down, and he assured me he would. I then adjourned into the private room, and the chaise drove off. Boyce did not go in with me; he came in in ten minutes afterwards. I think I saw him afterwards; but I am not quite certain.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. In all the subsequent interviews, Austen was present. I am not certain as to the particular days. When the draft was brought, Boyce was not present, nor when the deed and letter of attorney were brought after supposed execution.</p>

            . I am a boat-builder; I came to Town in December last. I had occasion to see the prisoner, to whom I had written about some money from Rye. When I came to Town, I applied to him about some money in the funds, which was coming to me in right of my wife after the death of my mother-in-law. I saw Mr. Gill several times with the prisoner, After I had seen Mr. Gill several times. I received that draft from Boyce, which he had had to take to Dartford. I can't particularly say when I had received it. I took it to Mr. Gill in the same state as when I received it from the prisoner. The prisoner said he could not attend himself, having an appointment to go else where, and I took it then to Mr. Gill. I afterwards received two more from the prisoner at the Griffin, in Eagle-street, Red Lion-square; there was nobody else there but he and I; I believe it is in the County of Middlesex. These are the papers he produced. There was not then my own name, nor that of my wife. The prisoner was very ill through going to Dartford, and he said it had knocked him up; he said, I was to sign my own name and my wife's, which I refused, wishing to stop until I got to Messrs. Bridges's and Ballachi's, and the prisoner was very angry, and called me a fool, and by his persuation, I signed it there, not thinking any harm. I signed my own name, and my wife's. The prisoner said that it was lawful that I might sign it, and I, not knowing the nature of the law, did so accordingly. The prisoner told me to take them to Mr. Gill, and say that he could not attend as he was so ill. Nothing was said about my wife's signing. I took the deed and power and met Mr. Gill, at the New York Coffee-house, I delivered them to Gill in the same state as I received them from Boyce, only with the addition of my own and my wife's names. From the New York Coffee-house, I went with Gill, to Bridges's and Ballachi's; It was two late that day for the stock to be transfered, and we met again, and the next day to the best of knowledge, I went to the Kent-road. The prisoner at the bar was to have thiry pounds, and said he must be well paid, for he had a great deal of trouble with it.</p>

            . I received directions from Mr. Gill to prepare an assignment of transfer. That is the draft. I think I saw the prisoner twice on this business. He came soon after Mr. Gill, and inquired if Mr. Gill had made application for the preparation of these? I told him he had, and he was perfectly satisfied. And then he came with Austen afterwards. I made this power of attorney. The last time he came was to know how it was getting on; he thought it was not necessary that the surviving trustee should join. Nothing farther passed with the prisoner. I sent a letter with the papers.</p>

            . I am a postillion; I live at the Bull Inn, Dartford. I remember coming with my chaise to the Bull Inn, Kent-road. I saw the prisoner at the bar there, and Mr. Gill. I received a parcel from Mr. Gill at the Bull; the prisoner was with him. The prisoner first asked me, was I going to Dartford, and I said, I was. He then asked me if I would take a parcel down for him; I told him, I would. Then he went for Mr. Gill, and Mr. Gill brought the parcel, and gave it to me; Boyce then told me to be sure to give it to Mr. Tasker, and I said, I would as soon as I got home, and I left them standing there, and I put my horses too, and went off. I had nearly got to the World Turned Upside Down, about a quarter of a mile, when I saw Boyce, the prisoner, who came after me; a person hallooed out that somebody was calling after me; I stopped, and looked round, and saw the prisoner, and he said, you have almost put me out of breath; I will thank you for the parcel, I have something to put in it. I said, I will wait a few minutes; I returned the parcel to him; he said he had something more. I said, I would wait a few minutes if he liked, He said, it was no consequence, I might go, and keep the shilling, for he would not detain me. He never returned the parcel; I drove on without it.</p>

About the middle of December last, or some where there about, I can't say to a week or ten days; the prisoner called upon me; he said, he waited on me on the part of Austen. He said, Austen wished to dispose of his reversionary interest in the stock belonging to his mother-in-law, and I told him, I had had sufficiently trouble with it already; I was engaged as a trustee, and should fulfill that trust; but I would not involve myself in any trouble, and I told him, I would have nothing farther to do with it; that was my final answer. I saw him again in the middle of January. The first time he mentioned that the deed should be prepared, I told him that I could not binder him from transfering; but I should not become a party to any deed, and if it were made, I should refer it to my attorney. When he came a second time, he said, he came with a copy of a deed; I told him, I was very much surprized at that, because I had told him, I would not become a party; and he said, surely, I would look at it; and I told him I should not. He asked me should he shew it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290030"/>my attorney; and I told him, he might exert his own discretion; but if he took up my attorney's time, he must pay him for it, I look at the power of attorney; that signature

            , desiring me to write to you, saying, if I signed a power of attorney on Monday, the 15th instant, for Mr. Austen, to Mr. Smallbones. I have only to say, that I not only signed a power of attorney, but a deed also at Mr. Walker's, my attorney. Mr. Gill tells me that a power of attorney I signed in 1801, is different from the one I signed on Monday, the 15th; but it should be recollected that I do not write now as I did then; fifteen years you must allow, will alter a man's writing; and also that I write my name some times Jno. and at others John. But the signature of mine on Monday, the 15th, I signed my name as I have to this.</p>

            . I am keeper of the Grffin public-house, which is in the County of Midlesex. In the month of December and January last, the prisoner and Austen were at my house five or six times; the last time they were there was a little time before I heard Mr. Boyce was in confinemint.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the month of December, I received a letter from Austen, dated Hastings, telling me he had some money in the funds in right of his wife's mother, and he wished to know if he could sell it; I wrote him answer back that if there were no restrictions in the will to prevent it, he could; and I told him to come to Town, and he had better advertise it in the newspapers. He came up two days after; he then called on me, and asked me to draw an advertisement, which I did, and put it in the Morning Chronicle. In the course of the day, a letter come from Mr. Gill; I shewed it to Austen, and we both went over together; that was the first letter that came. Mr. Gill said that he could get it done in a few days, and we went over four, five, or six times to his house, and we met at the New York coffee-house, and Auston seemed very much in a hurry, and said he would blow Gill's brains out for the delay; and I told him the best way was to go to Ballachi's and Bridges's, and see if it was going on, and I found it was. Mr. Gill was the person employed; I was merely a friend of Austen; I was not in the money line; I went merely to see to it, and knew nothing of the man only six or seven times seeing him; it was recommended to go down to Mr. Tasker, and I told him I would go. I went down, and saw Mr. Tasker he said it had been a very troublesome job, and he would have nothing to do with it, because he would not subject himself to a law suit; I told him, to convince him, that every thing was honourable, I would send him down the rough draft of the deed, and he might shew it to his attorney, and it should be altered if one word was wrong. Mr. Tasker said if he did not have any trouble, he would have no objection. The rough draft was then drawn up, and they asked me to go down; they told me I had better go down, and I went down with the rough draft; when I came there, I saw Mr. Tasker, and he said, he had just received a copy of a deed from a man in St. Alban's-street, and this money was so locked up that Austen had not a right to sell it, for that there were four other persons, making five lives, and he could not dispose of it, Mr. Tasker refused to look over the rough draft at all. I asked him to let his attorney look at it; Mr. Tasker said he was never to be biassed by an attorney, and he said he would not pay the annuity, the mother had sold without a warrant so to do. I then told him, that from that moment, I should take no further trouble about it. When I came back, I met Mr. Austen at the Griffin; I told him I should have nothing more to do with it. He said he would not go to Mr. Thorpe, who had also applied in answer to the advertisement, and he said Mr. Gill should do it. He put the rough draft in his pocket, and said he would send a person down to Mr. Tasker, in whom he could put more confidence then in me, and I said, I would have no more to do with it after that. As to any bargain, or any money, he was to give me, it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290031"/>false. I told him I wanted no money. I called on him on Sunday morning after that, and he said; I am glad you are come, for I wanted to see you, and he said, I wish you would go to Mr. Gill's, for God's sake go, or my business will not be settled, for I can't go myself for my pantaloons are all to pieces, and my shirt is coming out. I told him it would be evening first, before I could go, and from that I went over. He wanted to go down to Dartford, and he had not a farthing, and I was obliged to lend him some money, as I very often did before. He said he was going in a one horse chaise. and I asked him how he could go in a one horse chaise, when he had no money, and he said, he could borrow one, and I parted with him there. I next went to Mr. Gill's, and got a parcel from him, and I called with it at Austen's lodgings, and asked if he had been there, and they said, he had not; and I told them to tell him that I had been there, and to say that I should be in Eagle-street. I never untied the parcel, nor any thing of the kind. there was the power of attorney, and a letter directed to Mr. Walker, and I went to Mr. Wright's, the Griffin, and Austen was there, and I called him to come into the parlour, and I then said, here are the papers; and I went out, and asked for pen and ink, and took them in, and then I went out again, and when I returned, Austen was writing, and I asked him what he was doing, and he had written something, and he said, he would get them done in a day, or two, and he folded the papers up, and put them in his pocket, and drank his grog, and said he would get them done that evening or the next day. From that moment, I knew nothing more about it.I never had any thing to do with it whatever more, and as for Mr. Gill's saving, that I told him that I had seen Mr. Walker, and paid a guinea, it is as great a falsehood as ever man uttered. This is the truth, as I am before the Almighty, I have no witnesses at all. Now with regard to that letter, Austen came to me, and asked me to go over with him and Mr. Gill to the Bull, and I said I was going to Kensington gravelpits, and it was two far; and he said, never mind, we shan't stop, and I went with him. Then I saw them deliver the parcel to the post boy, and Austen told me to give him a shilling for he had no money, After that, Austen came to me, and said, there was a mistake, and there was to be something more added. and he said, he knew he could not go for the boy, for his leg was bad, and he was ill, and I said I would go for him, and I ran after the boy, and overtook him, and it almost put me out of breath, and I said there is a mistake, they want to add something; and with that, he gave me the parcel back again, and I told him he need not wait; he might keep the shilling, and they would send it off by the post, and on my return to the Bull, I met Austen at the door, and gave the parcel to him; and that is all I have got to say.</p>

The prisoner came into my master's shop on the day in the indictment; she asked for a piece of bacon, and I shewed her a piece; she begged me to weigh it, and while I turned my back for that purpose, I saw her shuffle, and get over a pile of cheeses. I told her the bacon came to eleven-pence; she offered sixpence, which I could not take, and then she went shuffling out of the shop; then I looked over the counter, and missed a cheese. I immediately followed her, and stopped her, and the cheese fell down from between her legs; I stopped her, and brought her back, and sent for a constable.</p>

When I got to the other end of St. Paul's a person accosted me, and said, you have lost your pocket-book; and I said, I have not. He said, did you not come up Ludgate Hill; and I told him I did. He then saed, I had again; and I felt in my pocket, and found it was gone. I gave him my address. I never saw the prisoners until I saw them at the Mansion House. On the Friday, in the next week, I received a note, and went and fetched my pocketbook.</p>

The gentleman turned round, and seeing no one kept his hand in that pocket afterwards. Then James Cooper joined in company with John Cooper and Soames, then they proceeded in following Mr. Souter and his friend; Soames went up to Mr. Souter's pocket and just as he was going to cross the road to go to Ludgate Hill, the other two were on the right and left of Soames untill they got to Creed-lane, and just as they were crossing the top of the lane, Soames went up to Mr. Souter's pocket, touched it at the bottom with one hand, and drew the pocket-book out with the other; he put it in his left side, inside his coat, and held his coat with his left arm, and then they turned down the lane; they ran down the lane.

I then went down Ludgate Hill, and down Broad-way, expecting to double upon them; I ran as far as Blackfriars Bridge, thinking they would go over the water; but I could not catch sight of them. I then ran back as fast as I could up Ludgate Hill, and through St. Paul's Church-yard, in search of the prosecutor, and came in sight of him at the Cheapside end; I went up to him and told him that he had lost his pocket book; and he turned round, and looked at me, and said no, I have not. I then said, I was sure he had, for the noted Bill Soames had taken it out of his pocket. He then felt, and said, I have; and I told him he owed to his country to give me his address, and I would send for him when I apprehended them. The next day I saw Dickins, and we went in search of the prisoners. I laid hold of Soames on the Tuesday, one got away from Dickins. We took them before the Lord Mayor, I forget what day the prosecutor attended. I know them so well as to be enable to be sure of them. Mr. Souter shewed me a letter, and I went with him to the workhouse, where the pocket-b-k was delivered up to me. There was a letter directed to Mr. Souter in the pocket-book.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at Brook-green Fair. I saw the prisoner attempt a number of pockets; but without success; he had a great coat thrown loosely across his right arm; he made a drive in among the stalls, and went up to the prosecutor; he stood there for the space of five minutes, and then took a piece of ribbon with his right hand, and put it into his jacket lining, and went away. He came back again, and took another piece, and the handkerchief, and we followed him until he got through the thickest part of the Fair, and then apprehended him, and found the property on him.</p>

Some time after that, I went in myself; when I went in, I found Mansfield just coming out of the house; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290033"/>found Evans in the house, also I found a bag of turkey raisins close by Evans, on the seat by him. I asked him what he had got in that bag; and he said, it was the man's breakfast. He gave it to me, and it was a breakfast bag. I told him I must take him into custody; I had stopped Mansfield, and brought him in; they were both taken before the Lord Mayor. I told Evans he had been receiving stolen property from Mansfield. Mansfield said, he had taken those few raisins to give to Evans, because he was out of work, and very much distressed. Evans said again, that he thought it was Mansfield breakfast bag.</p>

            . I followed Mansfield into the the public-house. I saw him take a bag from underneath his smock-frock, and give it to Evans, who was in the passage. I then saw them talking together, and drinking out of the same pot. Then I went, and gave Mr. Matthews a hint, and called him in. Evans as soon as he saw him, went into the tap-room, and put the bag on the seat in the box, and then they were taken into custody.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors, who are wholesale grocers. The prisoner Mansfield was their porter. On the morning of the 9th of April, Mansfield went out to the bakers to get the rolls, as was usual. In consequence of his being apprehended, and hearing what Matthews has stated, we examined the warehouse, and found a cask of turkey raisins open. There was only one broken, and I missed some raisins from one side; the raisin taken from the side of a cask will have a different appearance from those taken from the middle; and these raisins produced, appear to have been taken from the side of the cask; they are precisely the same sort of raisins that were in the cask in our warehouse which was broken.</p>

She had just left me, when I received a blow, which knocked me down; I don't know who struck me. While I was down, there was a violent pulling at my chain; it was a gold chain; it broke, and was separated from my watch; there was a gold seal and key affixed to it. I then got up, and saw one person; who was about a yard from me; I only saw one person; I am not sure he was the person who had been pulling at my watch chain. I was running after him, and he ran; he took the left hand, and I followed him; I did not overtake him until the watchman got him. I am not positive that he was not out of my sight before he was stopped. The man who ran away from me, was stopped by the watchman; I saw the watchman lay hold of that man; the watchman laid hold of the man who ran from Alderman's-walk. I think the same man who was running from me, was stopped; but I can't swear. The prisoner at the bar was the man whom the watchman took; we went to Bishopsgate watchhouse.

When I was in my watch-house on the 7th of May last, I heard a cry of murder and stop thief; I should suppose it is forty yards from Alderman's-walk to the watchhouse; the sound proceeded from Alderman's-walk. I ran towards the sound; when I passed Alderman's-walk, I saw the prisoner was in custody in the hands of the last witness. The prosecutor was bleeding at the nose and mouth; he had not got a hat on; he was crying out at that time. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house. When he got there, he prefered a charge against the prisoner; he said, he had been knocked down, and robbed of his watch chain and seal. I told him to took at the prisoner; but he said, he did not know his face, for he could not see his features. The prisoner gave an account of himself; he said, he did not come through there nor past Alderman's-walk, but he came up Fore-street, and down the Churchyard. I asked the prosecutor if he was sure of the man; and he said, he never lost sight of him; he did not state it, for he was not above three or four yards from him.</p>

Neither threat nor promise were made to him. I asked him what he had to say; and what he said, I made a minute of. I am sure I have his words here substantially. (Witness reads.)"Was coming out of Bishopsgate Church-yard, heard a cry of stop thief; had been to Fore-street, come along Moorfields, through Church-yard, and was going home to Catherine Wheel-alley; had been to Mrs. Page, sells fish, keeps a stand, stopped a quarter of an hour, asked her to bring me six pounds of prawns for my mother, to save my going to market.

I don't know the prisoner at the bar, any farther than seeing him at market. He had not been to me on the night of the 7th of May; he had not asked me to bring six pounds weight of prawns for his mother; I did not see him that night at all. I moved out of the market at about ten o'clock. There is no other person of the name of Page in the market that I know of; I have been thirty-two years a fishmonger. I knew the prisoner, by seeing him, as another person; I don't know whether I must have remembered it if he had come to me; it is possible that he might have come to my stall and asked me to get six pounds of prawns.</p>

This key was in the key-hole of my door, while I was at work outside; I left it there for the convenience of going in and out without troubling any of my family to let me in. The prisoners were for some time looking at me, while I was at work. I heard them talking to each other, and one said, it is a very complete job, when they got about ten yards from my door. On following the prisoners. and apprehending them after the key was missed, Emery took it out of his breeches pocket and threw it over into a garden. I reached it, and gave them in charge of an officer.</p>

On the 1st of January, in the present year, the prisoner at the bar, came to my house, in company with another person, with one eye. I believe it was about one or two o'clock. They were in the tap-room for sometime, before they came to the bar for change; when they came to the bar for change, Maycock asked me if I could give that man, meaning the other, change for a five pound note. I mean the man with the one eye, that I described, I told him I did not think I could, for he was a stranger, and I did not like to give change to a stranger; the prisoner then told me he was no stranger, for he was very well known in the neighbourhood, and he generally lodged at the Little Bell in St. John's-street, and went by the name of Nelson, but his real name was Wilcock. He said he would be answerable for it, and I might put his name, on it if I pleased. I had seen the prisoner several times, and knew him about ten months; I knew what his name was. I took the note from the other man, and asked my wife if she had change, and she said she had, and I gave her the note to put

They had a pot of ale, and a drop of spirits put in it, at my house. I drank a glass with them, and after it was pretty well drank, the one eyed man tendered me a two pound note. I said, I could not give him change for the note, as I had no silver left. The one eyed man and the prisoner were very pressing for change, for they could not pay the reckoning unless I did. I told them I could not change it by any means; but I offered to give them two one pound notes, and they said, that would do. Maycock said so. I remember they said, they could not pay their reckoning without it I delivered the two one pound notes to the one eyed man. I held the two pound note, and asked the one eyed man his name, and he said, Maycock. I looked at the prisoner, and said, George, that is your name. He said, you may put that on master, it is all right. I wrote on the note directly, before I put it out of my hand. That is the note. The third man, then gave the one eyed man, Adams, one shilling and sixpence with which he paid the reckoning.</p>

            . I am inspector of bank notes, to the bank of England. The prisoner was apprehended on the 23rd of January. I saw him; I went to Marlborough-street. He was not charged with the whole of the present charges. He was only charged with uttering to Dell. He gave me an answer to a question which I put to him; which answer I took down in writing at the time; neither promise nor threat, nor any other inducement was held out to him. He said he knew the man who paid the two pound note at Dell's. He was a corn porter, and he was called One Eye, or Nelson. I saw him on the Monday after the Saturday, (that is the 15th). It was in Smithfield, and he told me he had been in the country as a drover. I never knew any house at which he lived. I never had any other money transaction with him before this. nor since. He did not appear to have any more money about him; nor did I ever see him change any other bank notes. I have known him ten years; I met him in Wilderness-row. He asked me to have something to drink; it was about dusk. We went into Dell's; we had a shillingsworth of wine and water. When we left there, he went away and I went home. I saw him on the Monday, I did not drink with him; and never saw him since; he never paid me any notes. He said his name was Nelson, because he had lost one eye. I read this over to him afterwards. It was not before the magistrates. That is forged in every respect, in the plate signature and paper. The signiture is Y. Butten; there is such a clerk, but it is not his hand writing. That is also a forgery, forged in every respect as the last, only with a variation in the number; it is the same date and the signature, and it is from the same plate as the first. That is forged also in every respect, in plate, paper, and signature. The signature is in the same hand writing as the signatures of the other two. The name signed is S. Hulm. We have different signaturs for the different amounts of notes, and Hulm signs the five pound notes. I am sure he is not the signer of this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave all to my counsel. I know no more of this man, than that he was a horse dealer, and worked up and down the roads.</p>

I saw the prisoner there, whom I searched; I found a silk purse on him with four pawnbrokers duplicates in it, and a box key, which he said belonged to his box. I brought the box to him, and gave him the key I have mentioned, and he opened the box himself, and part of the property named in the indictment was there. In a paper in his pocket were two other keys. I took one of them to his master's till, and found it opened it. He acknowledged that he had another box at his father's which had property of his master's in it, I took the prisoner with me to his father's, and there we found this box, which he acknowledged was his. The third key opened it. I found a quantity of hosiery of all descriptions in it, and at the bottom I found a piece paper with forty-nine pawnbrokers duplicates, the greater part for articles of hosiery.</p>

I had seen them at about half past ten that morning. They consisted of all the articles named in the indictment. I had not seen the prisoner that day, until we apprehended him. I saw him on Tuesday; he was on guard on Monday night, and we took him on Tuesday the 9th of April, at about half past four, about an hour after I missed the things; we took him into custody in Tothill-street, Westminster; he had my small clothes on under his overalls, and he had some more of the things tied up in the bundle in which they are now. The breeches were the only things be had wearing on his person. I asked him if he could tell me where the rest of the things were, and he said no, that he had sold them to people that he did not know.</p>

            , I assisted in taking the prisoner, about half past twelve I had observed him coming out of the house where they lodged, with a box on his shoulder. I stopped him, and put a question to him, where he was going with the box; he said, he had two boxes, and he was going to dispose of the one for which he had no use. I thought that a reasonable excuse. The house is in St. Martin's-court. I afterwards took the prisoner into custody. I found a turnscrew in his pocket, some marks of which were on the box. We asked him where the rest of the things were; and he said, we might have the money, provided the prosecution was stopped; he had twenty-six shillings, which he said, were the produce of the articles, all except six or seven shillings, which he had received as his pay.</p>

I know the prisoner; I was at home when my mother went to the Hospital in February last, she left my sister at home with me; it was on Monday, the 16th; the sister that was left at home with me was about four years old. The prisoner came to my mother's house, when she was not at home on that day; I knew him very well; he said, your mother is gone to the Hospital, is not she, and I said, yes; I said, will you come in Bill, and I put a chair for him to sit down, and he said, here is sixpence for you to go and get some cakes. I said, I must not leave our place, my sister is ill, and my mother would beat me if I left the place; and he said, it would do the child good to take her out. So he reached my sister's bonnet down, and gave the sixpence to my sister, and told her to go, and said, now you go, meaning me, and he pushed my sister and me out, and shut the door; I was gone about ten minutes. I looked in at the window, and saw him go into the parlour; then I went and got the cakes, and then came back, and knocked at the door ever so long before I could get in, and when he opened the door, he said, he did not hear me.</p>

I went round to all the pawnbrokers, and described the articles missing, and told them, should any thing be offered, they should detain the persons. I know nothing of the prisoner.

            . I am the husband of Mrs. Fulmer. I came home at about three o'clock on the day in question, and looked for a three-shilling token and missed it; I had left it in the bureau or desk,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290037"/>in the parlour; I left it with my watch and several other articles, and when I went home in the afternoon, I missed a great many of them. I missed my watch at night. I had two gold rings, two gold breast pins, and four silver clasps. The watch had a gold chain, seat and key. They were all in this desk. It was locked, and I kept the key in my pocket. I found the desk locked; I don't think my wife knew what was there. These were her earrings.</p>

I had not left that piece of an ear ring on the floor when I went out; I am sure it is my ear-ring; I had not seen it for two months before; my husband, when he looked in the drawer said, oh! where is my watch. That drop was broke from the ear-ring these two years; the fellow was whole.</p>

I was alone when I first met them; I was passing by them, and they said, I had shot a dog, and with that they hit me on the face; then they wanted me to go back, and fight, which I declined, and then the prisoner came up, and hit me; then I ran down from the River, and jumped over, into a lane, and he pursued me. I jumped over a hedge and ditch; he pursued me alone; he then overtook me, and threw me into a ditch which runs by the side of the lane. I then got out, and he knocked me down again. He then held me until several others came up, and helped him to hold me; there were ten I dare say. I saw him distinctly put his hand into my pocket, and I missed the watch directly afterwards; it was my right hand breeches pocket; I had eight shillings; then they kicked me. The prisoner continued with them. After they kicked me, I got up, and walked away. In the scuffle, I missed the watch; but can't exactly say who took that; I can't exactly tell the moment when I lost it; it was in the lane; I am certain I had it before I was knocked down in the lane, and I lost it while they were striking and beating me in the lane. Then I got up, and walked straight to the Sluice House back again; they did not pursue me. I saw Jefferson, the officer, about five minutes afterwards; I communicated to him what had passed. Then I went across the fields, towards Hornsey Wood; I afterwards saw the officers Vaughan and Rice; I went with them back towards the Sluice House; I saw the prisoner at the bar again that day; I can't say exactly how soon; but they overtook him just before he came to the Barley Mow, at Islington, about two miles from the Sluice House; he was in company with two or three girls at the time, and several persons together. I knew him again; he was pointed out before I got up. I never saw my watch since. I look at the prisoner, and I have not the least doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. There were several persons in the fields, and they accused me of shooting a dog; I had not shot one. I carry a gun about the fields some times, and go fishing some times. Some words ensued, but not on my side. There were many persons round me at the time. I did not fight. I believe I had about nine shillings about me when I went out; I had felt my money in my pocket, and buttoned my pocket. I don't believe the money could have tumbled out of my pocket. I had had this watch some months; I don't know whether my father knew of it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The prisoner pursued me alone, before the rest came up; it was but a short time before they came up.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. I happened to be out on the morning of the 7th of April; Vaughan and Rice were not with me; they were at Hornsey Wood House. I saw forty or fifty persons that morning. I saw the prosecutor, Edward Cherry, going over a hedge and ditch, into a lane; it was between nine and ten; he was running. I saw the prisoner and a woman pass me at the corner; they were running also. I observed the prisoner hit the prosecutor, and knock him down in the lane. The woman said, go it Frank, that is him that killed the dog. The prosecutor got up, and was knocked down again by the same person; then about twenty more surrounded him. I saw something resembling a watch in some person hand; I was about the length of this court from them. It was thrown up in the hand from the person who was down, and it appeared at that distance like a watch. Then they all left him, and went away, and came by me; and the prosecutor came up to me, and said, he had been robbed; I told him I knew that. I told him I could not assist him by myself; but I sent him up to Hornsey Wood House for Vaughan and other officers. I mentioned Vaughan's name; he went as I desired, and he returned in about twenty minutes, with Vaughan and Rice. I then went along with them until they came to Highbury-barn; I went down the terrace, and they went across the fields. I was not present at the apprehension of the prisoner; I am positive of his person.</p>

There are many innocent individuals go out on that day for their recreation. I suppose there might be two hundred persons out in the fields. I heard the woman urge the prisoner to beat the prosecutor on account of killing a dog. I I saw something in a man's hand, which I thought was a watch, though it might be a snuff-box, or something of that kind.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Bow-street. The prosecutor came up to me at Hornsey House, and I and Rice went with him, first to the Sluice House, and afterwards across the fields, in company with two persons named Smith; Jefferson continued with us for some distance, and the two Smith's continued with us. About fifty yards off, just crossing the Ball's Pond-road, I saw the prisoner in company with three or four more; he was in company with a girl; he was pointed out to me by both the Smith's; Cherry, the prosecutor, was there. The two Smith's got up first, and then the prosecutor came running up, and cried, that is the man, that is the man, the moment he saw him. We took the prisoner and the girl. Cherry charged him with robbing him, and knocking him down, and the prisoner denied it. I searched the prisoner, and found eight shillings and sixpence on him; I can't say exactly how that amount was made up. The money was produced before the magistrate, and the prosecutor could not identify it.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. I have got eight shillings and sixpence; but not the identical eight shillings and sixpence that I took from the prisoner; I don't say positively but that the amount might be made up by three shilling pieces, and eighteen-penny pieces and sixpences.

            . I am landlord of the Green Man; I saw the prisoner at the bar coming down stairs, with the trunk or box in his hand. This was on the 26th of April, between three and four in the afternoon; he went backwards and forwards to the house for years before I went to it. I was alone, by the bar door. and there is a light that looks from the tap-room to the stair-case, and that was where I saw him. The stair-case fronts the door-way, and he went towards the privy, instead of coming out. There was a man came in just at the time, and called for a pot of beer; I drew it, and when I went back to see for the prisoner in the privy, he was not there. The door was open and I never saw any more of the prisoner, There was no trunk or box there; the prisoner had no box at my house of his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I let lodgings. I do not know that the prisoner was a man who goes about the country hawking goods. There was no man there on whom he was in the habit of attending. There were a great many persons it the tap-room at this time. There were no persons up stairs. This was three or four o'clock in the afternoon. The soldier was not in the house at that time, when the serjeant asked for a candle, to go up to bed; he discovered the robbery. My house is in Bedford-street, which is in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields.</p>

            . I belong to Bow street. I went and searched the prisoner's appartment, on Saturday, the 27th of April; I found the door was fastened, and I knocked, and they asked who was there, and I said a friend; and when the door was opened, I saw the prisoner at the bar; I knew him; he has been known some time by the name of the Old Duffer. I told him I had an information against him for taking Cooke's, the serjeant's trunk away, and his property in it. He was very much in liquor at the time, and was getting his dinner. I made him get up, and in his waistcoat pocket, I found this watch-key, and overall chain. On the Tuesday following, I called at the Green Man, in Bedford street, and part of the property was returned.</p>

He said it was but a small one, he wanted to give a child a three shilling piece, and would I give him one for small silver; I said yes, and he gave me two shillings, and two sixpences, and I lighted a candle, and looked at them, and they were perfectly good. I put them into the till; I gave him a three shilling piece out of the till. I took the candle in one hand, and the money in the other, and told him to look at it, and see that it was good. I know that the three shilling piece I gave him was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290040"/>full cheek, and it also had a little half moon on it; I took very particular notice of it, for I would not have given it to him if I had had another. He had another three shilling piece under his fingers, and as I was going to look at it, he put his hand over it. He went away, and he was back in an instant, and said, I don't much like this, mistress, and I will thank you to change it. He held it towards me, and I perceived it was not the one I gave him. I called him a rascal, and told him, I had a great mind to knock him down I snatched both out of his hand, and said, he should not have either until he had been before his betters. I sent for a constable to apprehend him, and as soon as he found the constable was sent for, he left the house, though it rained very hard.</p>

I quitted my shop about eight o'clock in the evening preceeding the robbery, and returned about nine in the morning; I then found that about eighty pairs of boots, and about twenty pairs of shoes had been taken from my shop. They were worth considerably more than sixty pounds. I perceived no marks of violence whatever on any part of the shop. There were nine odd boots, and eight pairs of shoes not bound, which they did not take. I got an officer from Bow street. who had all the locks taken off, and examined. I have now forty two pairs and an old boot. The 10th of May was a Saturday. I saw twelve pairs of shoes at Bow street, and I was confident that they were part of those that had been stolen.</p>

            , my brother, was with me the whole of the time. At about four o'clock in the afternoon, there came two men to No. 4, and knocked at the door, which was opened, and they went in. Afterwards my brother and I went in, and searched the house, but could not find either of the two men. We opened the back yard door, and found the prisoner working at a woman's or child's shoe, in a shed, I asked him if he had seen two gentlemen go out that way, and he said, he had not. There was a ladder against the wall, and there is a communication to the next house, No.3, which is a pigeon shop, the parlour of No. 4, was full of women's and ladies' shoes. The prisoner's brother makes up orders of ladies and children's shoes. Then my brother and I went out, and watched again, and we saw the two men come out who had gone in. That was about five or ten minutes after we came out. I immediately ran round by another street thinking to meet them; but missed them. I and my brother then returned to the house again, and asked leave to search for the property. I rather think I did not say what property. The prisoner made no objection to that; he said, he knew nothing of any property; and while I was talking to him I looked through the back kitchen window, and discovered the toes of several pairs of boots, which appeared to be covered over with a bag. I don't know that that kitchen was occupied by the prisoner. I called to my brother, who was searching No. 3, to come to take care of the prisoner, while I broke open the kitchen, when I saw the property. He came, and took charge of him. I went down to the back kitchen, and tried to break the door open; but could not. I then knocked at the front kitchen door, where a man and woman lived, and asked them for the poker; and they seemed rather confused, and denied me it. I immediately went up stairs to the shed, where the prisoner was at work, and asked him to lead me a hammer to break the door open; he said directly, here is the key of the back kitchen, which two men who have taken the place, have left with me, that key opened the back kitchen door, and there we found forty two pairs of boots, and an odd one, and twelve pairs of shoes. They were afterwards claimed at Bow street.</p>

They were at my house on the 7th of May last, they came about four o'clock; Macdonald came in first; then he had a bundle with him; he asked for weights and scales. I did not produce them. My wife went out at the back door, according to the directions I had given on the previous day. I had dealt with the two prisoners before. I considered them to be both interested on that occasion; they were both present. During the absence of my wife, Carey came in; he placed himself in a chair; he did not say any thing to Macdonald, nor Macdonald to him. My wife returned with some persons, the two Mr. Turner's. She then went out a second time, and brought in a man named Jeffkins; when she returned then, Macdonald and Carey were in my parlour. When the Turner's came, I informed them that I had purchased plate of the prisoners on the 16th of March, and I had reason to believe it was stolen; I said that in the presence of the prisoners. One of them said, he could give a very good account of how he came by it; but if it was stolen, he would recompence me to give him his liberty; it was Carey said this. There was nothing more passed then. The officer was sent for, who, when he came, searched them; it might be a quarter of an hour before Limbrick came. When my wife was returning with Jeffkins, Macdonald slipped out at the door, and Jeffkins laid hold of him, and brought him in. Carey attempted to run out before the officer came in. Young Turner came in I think first. The bundle of plate was secured.</p>

            . I am a neice to Mr. Carey; he lives at Ware-passage, Somers Town. I was at his house in May last; he is a gentleman's servant out of place; he waits at table, keeps a shop, and took in coats to brush, and shoes to clean. I was there on the 7th of May; I was out of place also. He went out that day at a little after two; he had been at home the best part of the morning, until twenty minutes after two; I slept there the night before, and breakfasted with him that morning. I first saw him at eight o'clock, at breakfast; I left there about half past ten; I came back at a quarter before eleven; he was then cleaning shoes and brushing coats. I saw him at dinner and saw him until dinner, a little before one. He was in the shop serving clothes with his wife. He went out at about twenty minutes past two; a person came in with a parcel; I was present. He asked my uncle if he would carry a parcel, and my uncle said he would, and he put on his hat, and went out immediately with the person who came in; that was twenty minutes past two.</p>

            . I am as half-pay lieutenant in the India Company's service; my birth-day is on the 7th of May. On my last birth-day, I was at the prisoner's shop, about two o'clock; I saw the prisoner there; but not at first. I dealt for an article; not agreeing about the price with the first person I spoke to, the prisoner came out, and concluded the article for nine shillings and sixpence, and I gave him six shillings, as I had not so much silver. On the Thursday, I called again, and paid the ballance for the pantaloons, and took them. Mrs. Carey then called me in, and told me something which had happened, and that brought to my mind the exact time I had been there. While I had been there, I recollected a man coming into the shop, who said, Carey, I want you to go on an errand for me, to take a parcel where you have been before; Carey said, he would go with him immediately, and in about three or four minutes went with him. On the next day but one, I heard he was taken up.</p>

            . I was concerned with Purviss in stealing some asses off Lord Ellenborough's lands; we stole three. We brought them to Smithfield; when we got there, Purviss sold them; he went with some men to sell them, and left them for a time with me; he left me for about a quarter of an hour. When he came back, we went to Chick-lane, and after that to Hill's house in an alley. When I got there, I saw the prisoner; he bought the asses; I am not positive whether it was twenty-five shillings or twenty-seven shillings for the three; Hill joined in buying them, and they were apparently both concerned. The asses were driven up into the street to Cow Cross; they all stood at the door when Harl paid for them; it was a public-house. I went into the house, and then Harl and Hill proposed drawing up a paper for six pounds, as the price they had given for the asses, supposing any thing should occur that that had been the value of them. A paper was drawn up by the landlord of the house, and some money was paid in the presence of the landlord. I was afterwards apprehended. I went with the officers to Hill's house, where they found one of the asses.</p>

            . I and my wife and family went to bed on the night of the day in the indictment between twelve and one, and in the morning discovered the articles in the indictment to have been stolen. The way I suppose the entrance was made was by the flap of the cellar window, which was not fastened. I do not know whether it was shut or not, before I went to bed, and there was nothing to prevent a person from going in if it were open. I was awakened in the morning by the watchman, and it was then light enough for me to see what o'clock it was by my watch.</p>

I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran through York passage, into Weston-street, Pentonville; the prisoner was running and several persons after him; and there was a cry of stop thief. I ran immediately to meet him, and he got into the middle of the road; I threw my rattle at his head, which I am not possitive hit him; but I rather think it did; for his hat immediately fell, and the ridicule fell out of it. I picked them up, and delivered them afterwards to Mr. Read.</p>

I asked her what she had got in the bundle; she said, nothing of yours. I requested to see what she had got, and she proceeded a little further down stairs, and then threw the bundle down, and tried to make her escape out at the door. I called for assistance, and she was stopped, and an officer was sent for, and she was taken into custody. There were several things belonging to a young man who travels for the firm; the fowl and green baize belonged to the firm. She said, she had not got any plate; but that was what she wanted; she had got these things from the two pair of stairs.</p>

Before I went into the warehouse, I saw the prisoner and another looking in at the warehouse window; that was about half past seven, or twenty minutes to eight; they saw me also. I went down Watling-street, and they went down the Old Change. I went into the warehouse, and sent for Mr. Evans; he went away again; and then I fastened the warehouse door; then I stationed myself over a fan-light over the door, and I could then command a view of both the outside doors, and the warehouse door to. Williams, and Morgan, the other, came into the passage; they turned the latch of the warehouse door, which I had fastened, and after they got the latch loose from the hasp, the door would open about three quarters of an inch; at the top of the door there is a catch of a bell, which if the door was opened any further, would ring; and with this stick, which was longer than it is now, (but I will tell you how I broke it,) they shoved the bell back; it hangs on an elastic iron, and this took about ten minutes, with a portion of care and nicety. I am sure the door had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290046"/>fast; I had stationed a young man under the dresser in the warehouse close by the door, to see I had fastened it; I told him you see I have fastened the door; and he said, yes, you have; and I said, if it was a jar they would suspect. I made him particularly observe it. When they got it open, the prisoner at the bar went into the warehouse; the other man stood at the warehouse door with this bag, and just before he opened the bag, he looked out at the street door to see if any one was coming. The prisoner at the bar reached some printed cotton, and Morgan held the bag open so, and he chucked it in. Morgan was inside the street door; the prisoner at the bar then went back, as I thought to get some more; but I rushed upon him out of the private door, and Morgan made his escape. The prisoner at the bar was took into the warehouse. The prisoner and I had a little bit of a tustle, and he said, Matthews, don't hurt me, you have got me, and that is all you want.</p>

On the night of the 27th of April, I and my wife went out at about eleven o'clock to the grocers' to get some tea and sugar; Nixon and Burn's near Union-court were the grocers. I observed the prisoner at the bar and two more men standing near the door at the grocers shop. We went in; but it was so crowded, that we thought it best to go a little further, and return.

Before I could render any assistance, he said loudly, d-n your eyes, who are you shoving at; my hat was knocked off, and I had another blow. I stooped for it, and felt a sudden snatch at my fob, and by the feel, I thought my watch, chain, and seals were gone; the chain was broken, and left the watch behind. The watchman was very near the prisoner, and would not stop him, nor spring his rattle; the prisoner ran towards Gloucester-place, and the watchman would not follow him. I look upon it Browne snatched my chain. I was surrounded by girls and different people; I cried stop thief, and after that, I went to the pawnbroker's, and told him how I had been used, and the officer advised me to go to the watchhouse, and Mr. Brand and some more City officers went round until two in the morning; I afterwards saw Mr. Barnley. The next time I saw the prisoner was about five o'clock in a public-house at Cow Cross, on Sunday, the 5th of May; that was in consequence of what my son told me. The prisoner refused to go with the watchman, and asked what for; he was told for the robbery on Saturday night; he said, Thursday night, Friday night; but he did not like Saturday night at all. I never found my chain or seals again.</p>

He and two other persons came up to us near Gloucester-place; they came a breast of us, and the prisoner at the bar first struck me a violent blow; I was going to say, Browne are you tipsy, when my husband cried out murder, watch, and I heard his hat fall; I called out also, and the watchman could have stopped him if he chose, but he did not; and we pursued them up the back alleys to Gray's-inn-lane; but lost them; we could not find them.

I had been buying some roses for my wife, and I went up Church-lane to Mr. Poole's, and Mr. Barnley came in, and said, I was his prisoner.</p>

All the prisoners were at my house that evening; they came there about two o'clock in the afternoon; that afternoon I was cleaning out the skittle ground, and was coming in and out every moment. When I had done, I heard them talking in a low voice in the back parlour. In consequence of hearing that, I listened, and I heard Morgan, (a man who is not here,) say, we are in a bloody mess now; he was in the back parlour, sitting right facing me. He addressed himself to the whole company, as I supposed. There was a stranger in the back parlour, whom I did not know. I next observed the prisoners, all except Mayn, lay their heads together, and say, let us go and stall him off as he comes down stairs. I believe that means making a bustle about, so that a person might not be seen. With that, I ran through the back parlour, past the stair foot door, and I saw a person coming down stairs. There is a room for the accomodation of company on a Sunday and Saturday night up stairs; but it is not used for that purpose at any other times. This was a Tuesday. When I saw this man on the stairs, he had a silk handkerchief in his hand, which he threw over his shoulder behind him. I collared him immediately; I afterwards picked that silk handkerchief up. I called out to my wife to go up stairs; she at that time in my presence, pulled the key of the room we found was broken open out of her pocket. She immediately went up stairs, and when she had got to the top, she cried out we are ruined, for the door is broken open. She then came down stairs, and I went to search the man's pockets. I had continued hold of him all this time. I was going to search him on the stairs at first. The men in the parlour were in such a situation that they could hear what my wife said to me. They followed me out to the foot of the stairs; it was light enough to distinguish faces at that time. I was going to search the man, when the prisoners at the bar began to bustle about, four of them; I can't say Mayn was in that bustle. They came close to me, and pushed me about; I did not at that time distinguish Mayn. I then dragged the man into the bar, for fear they should rescue him, and pushed him into a chair. There had been two strangers in the house; the one I saw in the parlour, and the other was the one I caught on the stairs. Then Thatcher, Baxter, Jones, and Phillips came round the bar. Thatcher said, let the man go, for he is drunk; I said, I can't think of letting the man go, when I have had my place plundered; I will have justice done. With that, Thatcher said, d-n your eyes, if you are all of my mind, he shan't be taken. Thatcher then addressed himself to the other prisoners. They were all then round the bar, as close as possibly could be. After he had said that, they immediately came round to the other side, where I had taken the man, and Thatcher dragged my wife away, and I immediately closed the doors upon them. She had been by the side of me, telling me to let the man go. There are two glass windows at the top of the bar, which bolts, and the lower part locks. With that, they took the shutters which stand by the side of the door, and they battered the door all to pieces. They dragged the man by the hair of his head and the collar of his coat over the door, and opened the side door going into the passage, and carried him out of the house in triumph; three of them had hold of him; I am certain Thatcher, Phillips, and Baxter. At that time that they were endeavouring to pull him out of the bar, and I was endeavouring to hold him, I received several blows. I had a bit of the door in my right hand to defend myself, and that hand was grazed. There were several blows struck at me; but Field warded them off; Field is a man who lives at the back part of the house. I did not see him when he first came in. After they carried the man off in the manner I have described, I saw nothing more of them for about a quarter or half an hour. I sent for some officers while I had the man in the bar; but none came. About five or ten minutes after the man was carried off, officers came in, and said, they would not go, unless they had seen them in the fact. Other officers came about ten o'clock; Thatcher, Baxter, and Phillips had then returned, and called for a pot of beer; it was half or three quarters of an hour before they returned. I served them the beer, while I sent for the officers. In the mean time Baxter came round to the bar, and was drinking there, and Thatcher and Phillips staid in the tap-room. When the officers came in there were seven or eight, and an extra watchman. Baxter went off quietly; but there was an attempt to rescue Phillips and Thatcher, and the officers were obliged to use cutlasses. Phillips and Thatcher heard the charge I gave the officers. The officers asked me if they were the men that had been robbing me, and I told them they were, and to take charge of them on that account. It was after that, that the attempt to rescue was made. Thatcher and Phillips both got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290048"/>out at the window; but Thatcher was taken after a long struggle. The officers then asked me to go out into the mob, and see if there were any more, and I went out, and secured Mayn.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I recollect the 23rd of April; I was up stairs in the bed room, about four o'clock in the afternoon of that day; I locked the bed room door with a padlock, and put the key in my pocket; the stair foot door which leads into the passage is locked with an inside lock, and not a padlock. I put the bedroom key in my pocket, and the other on the mantle piece of the bar. When I got down stairs, my husband had the same man in the bar who had been on the stairs. At the time the man was struggling on the stairs, the prisoners were in sight; I am quite sure some of the prisoners were present, when he threw away the handkerchief. I had a full opportunity of seeing that. They were near enough to hear me say I was ruined, I was ruined. When my husband was in the bar, I saw the men by the bar door in the passage, I took hold of my husband's arm, and begged him to let the man go, for we should all be murdered. There was then a number of others rushing in at two other doors beside. I knew them by seeing them before on other days and that day also. Thatcher then rushed into the bar, and siezed hold of me by my handkercheif, and pulled me away from my husband. There was a carving knife that laid on the table close by the bar door, he took it up, and said, she can swear to her property, let us do for her. I said for god's sake, spare my life, for the sake of my baby. Baxter then come on my right hand side, and got his hand into my pocket. I struggled very much with them, and they cried pinion her hands;

            . I live in Bridgewater court. The prosecutor's backside of his house is within four steps of my door. I recollect the 23rd of April last, I was standing at my own door, between seven and eight o'clock, and I heard a great noise in the Bridgewater Arms. I went into the house, I saw Mr. Hales in the bar with a man, as he said, was a prisoner, whom he had found robbing his house. He had hold of that man, he said that aloud. There were a great many person, standing round at that time, and four or five came into the bar, and said, let the prisoner go. I was in the bar at that time. He said, he would do no such thing, as he had been robbing him. The people said, come, go it my boys, we shall have him. They opened the door then, and went round to another door that went into the parlour, and laid hold of two shutters, and broke the upper part of the bar door open; I was outside the bar when they did this. Mr. Hales and the man were in the bar at this time. As soon as they had done this, Mr. Hale cried out and said, neighbours, is there any one that will come forward and save my life, and assist me. I stepped over his counter then, and laid hold of a large pair of tongs, which were by his fireside, and went to the door to defend him, and prevent the people coming in. At the same time, the people behind threw a pint pot, and a half pint pot, and hit me at the back of the head. I turned back to know who threw them at me, and while I turned about, the man got from Mr. Hales, and got half way in the door that was broken, and the people who had broken the door had him by the head, and breast, and collar to pull him out; the people without, were pulling him over so as to get him quite clear. I stopped for about half a minute more; I don't know whether that man whom they got over the bar door was taken out or went out.</p>

            . I am a ward officer of Cripplegate Ward. I recollect on the evening of the 23rd of April last, being sent for to the Bridgewater Arms, about ten o'clock; when I came there, I went in along with some of my brother officers, and I saw Thatcher, Baxter, Jones, and Mayn; I saw Mr. Hales; he said to me, that is one, pointing to Thatcher; he likewise told me, Baxter was another. I went to take hold of Thatcher, and he was rescued from me by Jones, and a chimney sweeper, and others. I went to catch hold of him a second time, and he was torn from my hands again, and he got out of the window. A minute or two afterwards, I heard a cry help, out side, and I went out, and saw Everett struggling with Thatcher. I immediately secured Thatcher, and he went quietly along. I had to take them in charge. We did not know of the robbery at first. I never knew them before, nor did I know whether they knew me. I had my cutlass with me, and was obliged to use it, I considered it necessary.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was there on the night of the 23rd, with Vint. I saw Baxter in the bar when first I went in, and Mr. Hale gave charge of him for a robbery. I left him there with Cousins and Moore. I and Vint went into the taproom with Mr. Hale, and he pointed out Thatcher and Phillips as two of them. I said, you must go with us. Thatcher said, what for, and I told them for a robbery. Harry Phillips then said he should not go, and Thatcher said, he should not go. They then began to fight with us, and we drew our swords. Then the women and people in the place closed our arms, and they got out at the window. I have every reason to believe that the woman closed our arms on purpose for them to escape.</p>

            . I am a ward officer of Cripple-gate. When I got to the Bridgewater Arms on this occasion. I saw Baxter and Jones was apprehended afterwards; Baxter was in the bar, and was very much elevated in liquor. The landlord gave me the eye to him that he was one of them. The landlord at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290049"/>that time, made a charge of robbery; I am positive it was robbery. Further assistance was sent for, as Everett thought it necessary.

I went into the Bridgewater Arms, and saw Baxter, Thatcher and Phillips; Phillips got through the window, and I took Thatcher coming through it; Phillips got of entirely for that evening. Hales gave me an intimation that Baxter was one; he told me for what to take them into custody for breaking his up stairs room door. We met with a great deal of opposition in apprehending these men.

            . I live at 34, Bridgewater Gardens. My husband is the proprietor of those gardens. I was going through the court on the evening in question, about eight o'clock. During the time I was there, I heard Mrs. Hales cry out they are robbing the house; she was in the passage; I was in the court adjoining the house; I was looking through a window; I had been there about ten minutes. I saw ten or twelve men rush out of the parlour towards the bottom of the stair case, towards the bar; they rushed from the parlour. Mr. Hales had got a man by the collar, and pushed him into the bar, and Mrs. Hales had a handkerchief in her hand, which she said, she had picked up off the stairs. Mr. Hales called out for somebody to fetch Mr. Stevens; Mrs. Hales begged me to fetch him, and I directly went for him, and returned with him; I was gone about two minutes, not more. When I returned, Mr. Stevens went into the bar, and a person said, they have opened the back door, and I went round directly and went in, and saw Mrs. Hales in the passage. I shut the door directly, and put my back against it, and said, no one shall go out this way. Mrs. Hales then went into the parlour. There is a passage between the bar and the parlour. She was in a very violent passion, and raved very much; when I went into her, she was laying on the bench, and kicking; I thought she would go into fits. There was one woman in the room. From the time she went into the room until I went away, there was not one man in the room. There was no men knocking her down, or putting a knife to her throat, or putting their hands into her pocket; if that had been so. I think I must have seen it. I assisted to recover her. She told me she was in the family way, and I was much afraid of her. I stopped with her until five or six men tried to force the bar door open, and finding they could not, they broke it open with the shutters. As they were forcing the door, one of them said, tip it him, and I was alarmed for my husband, who was in the bar. I directly opened the side door to get out. In the situation in which I was, I could not look into the bar. As I got to the front door, they were bringing the man out, two of them. I left her in the chair, and heard her cry out oh, three times. I don't know who the woman was that was in the room with Mrs. Hales. After the man was taken away, Mr. Hales went for officers. Field shewed me a half pint pot, which he said, they had thrown at him; I took it out of his hand, and told him it was not meant for him, and therefore not to make such a noise about it. During the whole time, there was no man in the back parlour put a knife to Mrs. Hales' throat, or rided her pockets. On my being served with a subpoena, I went to Mrs. Hales, and told her I had been so served. I told her as my husband was out of Town, to ask her solicitor, Mr. Burgess, whether I was bound to attend; she said, that my own sense ought to have told me better, for I had no business to accept the subpoena. I am positive that I never told her that my evidence would hang the men, or any thing to that effect.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker. I went to the Bridgewater Arms just as the man was dragged into the bar; I was standing in front of the bar. I saw the man rescued, and taken away. I heard Mrs. Hales scream, and they said, she was fainting; and Mr. Hales called for a person of the name of Stevens, and when he came, he said it was a very troublesome piece of business, and I said, it is; he said, I will have nothing to do with it, for it is a troublesome job. Mr. Stevens went out, and fetched one Mr. Wood, and he would have nothing to do with it. Mr. Hales had hold of a man in the cradle; and a man named Stevenson asked for some brandy for Mrs. Hales, and the servant girl gave a glass of rum; I don't know where Mrs. Hales was then; but I believe she was in the parlour. Some man said, it is a shame for a man to be dragged to prison who has been drinking in the house all day, and a voice said, he sha'nt if they are all of a mind like me; and the top door was shoved open, and I dare say there were twenty men pulling at this man, who had got out of the cradle. Before the man had been rescued, Mrs. Hales came into the bar. I asked her what she had lost; and she said, a row of beads and ear-rings, and she set such store by them, that she had been offered three pounds for them, and would not take it. They knew me very well, because they have a public-house in Petticoat-lane. She said, it is very fortunate that the man did not get to my middle drawer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290050"/>where all my property layed. She said to me, it is immaterial, for she knew two of the men, and they should suffer if ever two men suffered on the new drop, should it cost every bit of property she had left; those were

            . I was helping Mr. Hales to clean the skittle-ground. I recollect the circumstances of this disturbance. I saw Mr. Hales draw a man down stairs, and charge him with robbing him. I could command a view of the stairs at that time. I was going in with the skittles; I saw a great many persons round the bar, and they shoved the top of the bar door in, and pulled the man out. I can't tell whether that was done by one or more. I was in view of the bar all the time. Mrs. Hales fainted away, and I took her into the parlour. She fainted away against the bar, and I took her from there to the parlour; she was then in an insensible state for some time. I saw no violence used to her during the whole time. She did not faint in the parlour; she fainted between the bar door and the parlour, and the people were conveying her in. leading her in. I fetched the glass of rum; I asked the maid for a glass of brandy, and she said, she had none. When I took her the rum, she drank it off in a minute, and seemed better. She never mentioned a word about her having her pockets picked. She never said, a word about a knife being held to her throat.</p>

            . On the morning of last Tuesday fortnight, I went into the distillery to gauge the spirit cask, and saw some bladders laying on it; I went out to call the watchman, who was at the top of the yard, and before I came down again, the prisoners came by me, with the bladders in their aprons. I ran after them, and in making their escape, they dropped the bladders. I had known them before; they had been discharged three weeks or a month; I knew them perfectly well; they came out of the distillery stooping their heads down. Afterwards I picked up the bladders; there were eight in the whole; those left on the cask were full; altogether there were eleven gallons and a half.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a native of Switzerland. At the latter end of last month, I was coming from Ghent to Ostend. I met with the prisoner on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290051"/>board the barge coming from Ghent. He told us he was a partner in the house of Cothey, Roberts, and Co. in Cannon-street; he shewed us some papers that had a relation to that firm, which induced us to believe that he was in it. We gave him some money to pay for his passage. We first gave him seven Louis d'or; and then he said, those had been stolen from him, and we gave him thirteen more. He came over from Ostend in the same packet to Ramsgate with us, and we came by the same coach to London; we came together to <placeName id="t18160529-89-crimeloc480">Blackheath</placeName>

He said, he would be there in the morning. At Ramsgate he gave us a private direction, Mr. Christian, 116, Red Lion-street, London. He invited us to come and see him. We did not give him the keys of our trunks. When we got to Cannon-street the next morning, we found no such house as Cothay and Co; we heard that those gentlemen had removed to somewhere in Little Tower-street. We afterwards went to Red Lion-street, Holborn, but could find no No. 116 there. He explained to me that it was Red Lion-street, Red Lion-square; and therefore we did not go to any other Red Lion-street.</p>

            . I was directed to make search after the prisoner at the bar. The prosecutor gave me a description of his person, and of the sort of articles he had with him. After a long search, on the 25th of May, I found him at No. 11, Tottenham-court. I took him there at about seven o'clock in the morning. I went up stairs; the woman of the house went up stairs to the bed-room door. She asked to speak to him, and he said he would come directly; I rather suspected that he was preparing to meet me, and I forced the door open, and he snapped a pistol at me. I afterwards found it was loaded. I catched the pistol with one hand and knocked him down with the other. I found two trunks in that room; the locks were forced off; the straps were cut, and the chains broken. They were empty; I searched some drawers there, and found all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

A party gave me a shove on the shoulder when I came out. I am sure I did not stagger against any body. They shoved me right off the foot pavement; then another party came up and hit me right on the side of the head, and down I went into the middle of the road. I got up and had one istrike at the man that knocked me down. I never could find the man that knocked me down. There were three together. I think the prisoner was with the man that knocked me down. After I got up from that, a third party knocked me down; and then my watch and hat was taken. I got hold of the prisoner, and he got from me, by his jacket tearing. He was taken the next night; the others ran away, and the prisoner might have run away if he pleased.</p>

I felt someone touch my pocket, and turning round, I saw a man in a great coat gently let go my pocket, and pass on. I suspected my pocket had been picked, but found it had not. I turned round shortly afterwards, but the person I had seen was gone. Mr. Vaughan came up, and asked me if I had lost any thing, and I found my pocket book was gone. He requested me to accompany him to Bow street, which not being able to do, I gave him my address, and a description of the things in the pocket-book, and the pocket itself. I went to Bow street the following morning, and learned that three persons had been apprehended; one of whom, had my pocket-book. On seeing those three persons, I recognized Riley as the man who let go my pocket.</p>

            . I on monday, the 8th of April was in the Stand, at about four o'clock, and saw the three prisoners at the bar in company together. They were coming from Charing Cross, following a gentleman, who was going towards Somerset House; they left him by Akerman's, and followed the prosecutor, Mr. Barnett. Riley went up to Mr. Barnett's pocket, and sounded it with his right hand. He then went and spoke to the two other prisoner; they passed the prosecutor, and joined again behind him; then King, the old man, was on the outside, Riley was next him, and Neale was next the houses. Then Riley went up to Mr. Barnett's pocket, and raised the bottom of it, and had one of his hands partly in; Mr. Barnett turned round, let go of his two friends, and Riley walked on two or three yards, and looked in at a window; then Mr. Barnett walked on towards Charing Cross, and the prisoners joined in company together, in similar situations as before, and walked after the prosecutor. They followed him about thirty or forty yards; when King, the old man, took a silk handkerchief out of his own pocket, and Riley went up to the prosecutor's pocket again, and drew something out, which King immediately caught up in his handkerchief, and then they all three ran towards Covent Garden. I went up to Mr. Barnett, and in consequence of what passed between him and me, I went to Bow-street, and got a brother officer, and we went to a house in Wild-street, where I guessed the prisoners had gone to. We apprehended Riley coming out at the door, and apprehended the other two in the house. On searching Riley, we found a pocket book, which the prosecutor swears to.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Mary-le-strand. On the 8th of May, I was going my rounds at about half past twelve, and I saw Mr. Flogdell and the prisoner in company together; I followed them from Feathers-court down to the Cock and Magpye, where Mr. Flogdell was knocking, trying to get in. I left them then, and was going down White Hart-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290054"/>when I was called by Mr. Flogdell, who said, he had been robbed of eight pounds, and some silver; and I took him into the watchhouse, and after that I apprehended the prisoner going down Covent Garden, and found six one-pound notes and ten-pence in halfpence. The prosecutor was a little elevated in liquor.</p>

I stepped into the bar to settle the days accounts, and one thing or another, and on going down the cellar stairs to shut the door, the light blew out, and I was making the best of my way up to my bed room in the dark, when about half way up I was met by the prisoner and his wife, and they said, it was day, and they would not stop in the house any longer, for there were so many men. I had a great many soldiers in the house. I took the prisoners into the tap-room, and called for lights, and several persons came down stairs, and we found a shirt and flannel waistcoat on the prisoners, which belonged to a dragoon that was quartered at my house. I went out, and got the nearest watchman I could.</p>

I stopped to look at them; I felt some thing press my pocket, but did not take much notice. I brought my hand down, and immediately missed my leather bag, containing my money. I looked round, and the prisoner had his left hand in his breast, with the bag between his fingers; he could not hide it, and I got hold of him, and said you have been picking my pocket. The people said hold him, for he is a pick-pocket, and then he made a start from me for five or six yards; but I caught him, and gave him into the custody of an officer.</p>

I was at Stepney Fair on the 16th of April; as soon as I entered the Fair, I saw the prisoner and two other well known characters very busy, they made several attempts, but without success, and at last they fixed on the prosecutor; one placed himself on his right hand, another on the left, and the prisoner in the centre behind; as soon as they so placed themselves, they made a terrible push, and I directly saw the prisoner put a handkerchief into his bosom. I instantly seized him, and informed the gentleman he had been robbed.</p>

            . I was once an officer. I was attending at Brock Green Fair, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of May, in company with Wonderoffe and Thompson. I observed the prisoners behind the prosecutor, and Merrett drew a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it inside his frock; they then left him; one went one way, and the other went another. I ran after Merrett, and apprehended him, and took the handkerchief from his breast. We lost Truelove; but apprehended him afterwards. I saw Truelove attempt several pockets; I can't say I knew Merrett before; but I am certain they were together, and spoke to each other.</p>

            . On the 14th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to me, and told me he had a great quantity of bolts to sell. I am a coach-maker, and I agreed with him to go and look at them the day following. I went and looked at them. I did not know at that time what capacity the prisoner was in; but after I had learned that he was in the employ of Messrs. Collingridge and Co. in <placeName id="t18160529-126-crimeloc681">Liquorpond street</placeName>

I accordingly went to him with a friend, and told him I was not satisfied concerning the bolts I had bought of him. After taking me to a great many places to see the person of whom he said he bought them, without effect, I determined to take them to Messrs. Collingridge, because I knew that if they were got from their premises, they would have the tools with which they were made. I went there, and as I was going along, the prisoner said, you appear dissatisfied, if you like I will give you your money back again; I told him no; that it was my determination to see the matter properly cleared up, and then I should be satisfied. When I took them to Liquorpondstreet, the prosecutors claimed them.</p>

I asked the man what he wanted there; and he said, he wanted a man who portered for me. I told him if he would go with me I would shew him where to find him. I took him near my manufactory, and then he tried to make a run; and I got some of the men out of the factory to assist me in taking him, and I gave him in custody of an officer.

The lady screamed out stop thief. I made a violent blow at the prisoner with a stick, and brought him down, and I have not been able to find the lady since, nor have I got the veil.</p>

            . I lost these sheets on the 13th of May. I had been out, and as I was coming in, I met the prisoner going out at the threshold of the door. I asked her where she had been; and she said, to one Mrs. Clarke, to get some washing. I told her no such person took in any washing in the house. By that, I suspected she had been robbing me. She went into the New Inn; I followed her. She ran as hard as she could; and I called stop thief; by that, she was stopped, and I brought her back to my appartment; I missed the things in the indictment then, and I found the things on her. I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge.</p>

I had reason to suspect him, and in consequence of information, I took out a search warrant to search Tulk's premises. That was before any accusation was made against Donald. We found the goods mentioned in the indictment, all except the locks; we found a file and mortice lock my property, and a duplicate for the other locks. Tulk came in while we were executing the warrant. I acquainted him with my business. We found part of the property in question at the pawnbroker's, where he had pawned it. Donald acknowledged his guilt, and fell on his knees, and said, he would never do so again. He acknowledged he sold them at Tulk's. I knew them to be my property.</p>

I asked the prisoner whether I could lodge there, and when I took my watch out to see what o'clock it was the prisoner took it out of my hand, and said she would pawn it. I had no idea that they were going to make away with it; and another woman said, I will shew you where you can lodge, and the moment I went out of the door with her, the door was fastened against me, and the person who went out with me ran away. The prisoner remained in the house, and I waited and watched it until six. I never went into the house after; I found her between three and four o'clock in the afternoon in Fashion street, and gave her in charge to an officer. I have never recovered my watch.</p>

Soon after Hunt went out, and did not return; she gave me no reason to suppose she was going to leave me. After she was gone, I missed my property. I immediately went after her; I heard a noise in the next house; several people talking. I went into the street, and to the next door; and heard some person say, you have made a fine booty.

She said, no person had come in there, and told me to go about my business. I told her I would not go without my property. I called the watch, and we went up stairs and found the prisoner Hunt under the bed, and a gentleman in the room. I accused her of robbing me, and she denied it, or that she had ever seen me before. I told her, she need not say that; but if she would not give me my property, I would charge her with the watch. She then told me not to make a noise, for my property was on the stairs. I found my pocket book on the stairs, with a five pound note missing from it. I then insisted on leaving the other note; and she said, if I would give her a three shilling piece, she would give it me. I gave her the three shilling piece, and she pulled the note out of her bosom. At first, I forgot my watch; I had left it on the table in the room into which I had been with Hunt at first. I left it there, and when I went back, it was gone.</p>

The two prisoners got along with me, and staid with me all day. I got rather forward in liquor, and they called a coach for me, and I requested that I might be driven to the Brown Bear, in Bow street, where I had lodged, and where I owed a score; but instead of being driven there, I was driven to the house of the female prisoner, in Gravel-lane; she represented the other prisoner to be a lodger of her's. I was intoxicated; but had my recollections about me. They twice attempted to take my money away from me by force; but they did not succeed. I wanted to go down into the cellar at about eight o'clock in the evening and the female prisoner lighted me down. While I was down, the man cried out put out the light, and take the money from him; but I walked up stairs, keeping my hand on my money. I then said, I would go home; they then collared me, and insisted that I should not go, and they took me into the <placeName id="t18160529-158-crimeloc852">Red Lion, in Gravel-lane</placeName>

While I was there waiting for something to eat, for which I had sent out one of the party, the female prisoner put her hand into my bosom, and whipped the money out; I immediately caught her hand, and gave her a chuck with my elbow; she dropped the notes, and the other prisoner whipped them up, and went off. He came in again in about half an hour, and on my acousing him, he threw all his clothes off, and insisted on being searched; I never got a note back again.</p>

Cross asked me to call my wife, and have her searched also. M'Uarthy then came into the middle of the room, and pulled off all his clothes.

            . I am a pawnbroker, at 105, Bishopsgate-street. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment, a woman brought a livery coat to my house to pledge; she said, she was sent by a young man. I told her I should detain the coat. Soon after, the prisoner at the bar appeared as the owner of the coat, he said, he bought it of a jew in Rag-fair. I thought I knew something of the livery, as Mr. Windus lived near me. I detained the prisoner, and that coat was afterwards claimed by the prosecutor.</p>

            . Mr. Bird, the prosecutor, has been accomodated with part of my house while his own has been repairing. I saw the prisoner in his room on the day in the indictment; I asked him what he wanted, and he said Mr. Johnson. I told him he did not live with me; it struck me he had taken something out of the room, and I watched him steadfastly until he got some yards from the door. He then threw his right shoulder forward to conceal a bundle, which I observed he had under his coat. On enquiry, the property in question was missed. I pursued the prisoner to the Swan, at Hammersmith, where I found him, with the gown and spoons.</p>

            . On the 2nd of April, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I saw a barge pulling in towards St. Saviour's Dock; I observed she had some timber lashed alongside, both fore and aft. I hailed the barge, and asked them where they were going to take the timber; I was answered by Bracknell, that they were going to take it to Kirkham's, or Kirkman's. I asked them where they got it; and they said, they picked it up; but immediately let it go adrift. I then went on board them, and took them both into custody. Willmott said, he was hired by Bracknell; it is not usual when a piece of timber is picked up, to lash it alongside; it is generally towed astern. I shewed that piece of timber to Mr.

Bradley, catch hold of Brooks's arm, and point to a gentleman's pocket, and push him in, covering him. I saw the lad Brooks, draw the handkerchief out; Williams assisted in covering him. I endeavoured to inform the gentleman of the transaction, but could not get up to him; I did not know his name. We did not attempt to meddle with the prisoners until they got right out of the mob. When they had got from among the booths, they all felt into conversation together, and the little one, Brooks, pulled a handkerchief from under his jacket, and they all three caught hold of the corners, and began examining it. I guesed they were looking if there were any marks; I think it was too dark for them to see any, if they were. When we seized on them, the two smallest dropped the corners, and Bradley threw it away. I seized him, and Woodroffe took the other two. I accused Bradley of picking a gentleman's pocket, but he denied it, and said he had never seen the other two prisoners before. I found another handkerchief between his shirt and skin, and an open pen knife in his pocket, very sharp.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper, The prisoner was brought into the watch-house a little before twelve o'clock. He was brought in by the watchman. First of all, he wanted to give charge of Mr. Hindle, for an assault. Mr. Hindle had the watch safe before he came to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a master grocer, in Guildford-street. Happening to read in the paper that the prisoner was brought before a magistrate for this charge, and having seen the transaction, I thought it my duty as a man to come forward. The theatre had broken up, and the prisoner and three or four men were quarreling with some girls. The watchman came up to disperse them, but they did not go on. Upon that he sprang his rattle. Then the prisoner and two or three girls walked on as far as the confectioners opposite the end of Bow-street. I turned my head for a moment, and in half a minute there was a row again; before I got close up, I saw the prisoner falling. Just as he rose the prosecutor knocked him down again; and while he was on the ground, shook him violently, and asked him if he wanted any thing more; because if he did, he would serve it out to him. I saw no watch in the transaction, nor was a word said about it then. Then the watchman came up; I was quite close to them, and the charge the prosecutor made, was, for ill using the girls, If any thing had been said about a watch, I must have heard it; but nothing about it passed,</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of May, about three o'clock in the morning, I perceived the prisoner coming down Little Compton-street; I was with another watchman. We had a suspicion of the prisoner, and in consequence stopped him; he had a bundle in his right hand, which contained a parcel of boots and shoes, to which the prosecutor swears. He ran away when we took the property from him, but we afterwards secured him.</p>

            . I am a blue-maker. On the 22nd of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoners; they were going in a direction towards the prosecutor's house. When they got up to it, they looked in at the parlour window; the little one shoved the window up, and went in; he did not remain in a minute, before he came out again; he brought nothing out. Then they walked up and down. Then they came back again, and the little one went in again; he brought something to the window, which he gave to Fox, and which he put into his right hand coat, pocket. Then he handed the pictures out. I gave an alarm, and caused them to be stopped; we followed them, and apprehended them in a field, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's house. The pictures were dropped, and the spoons were picked up in a direction in which Fox ran.</p>

On apprehending the prisoners in consequence of a suspicion on the day in the indictment, I searched them at the Camden Head, Islington, and on Bird I found a watch; I asked him if he knew the name of the maker, or the number, and he did not. Consequently I detained them both, as they were in company.</p>

The prosecutor charged the prisoner with assisting to rob him, and we took him to the watchhouse. The prosecutor gave us the same account that he has now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing talking to Smith, another coachman, when Mr. Walter came up to me; I was a great way off from where the robbery was done, and he said, he had been robbed of his watch, and I said, in a joking kind of away he deserved to lose his watch, if he could not take care of it.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and drive for Mr. Duffy, hackneyman, in Black Horse Yard, Tottenham-Court-Road. On the night of the 23rd of May, I was with my coach near the Opera House; I was in conversation with the prisoner at the time the prosecutor charged him with robbing him. We were near our coaches; I believe we had been talking together ten minutes or quarter of an hour; we had been talking concerning the fight that was to take place the next day. At the time the prisoner was conversing with me, he did not strike any man, nor pull any one from another man; nor could he have done so without my seeing him. Lady Dudley's footman came up, and made a piece of work, and the prisoner said what a foolish man he was, not to take care of his watch when he had one, or something to that purpose. The prosecutor then said, you are the fellow, that knocked the flam out of my hand; upon which the prisoner said, you are a liar, and said he was talking to this young man; meaning me. The prisoner then very much abused the prosecutor, and he asked him where his coach was, and he told him it was 226, which it was; he drives for Mr. Miller, in Hanway street, Tottenham-Court-Road. The prosecutor said, you are not the man who robbed me; I had the man by the celler who robbed me, and he was a short man with a brown coat; and I being a short man, and having a brown coat, did not go to the Watch House, for fear of getting into trouble myself.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. He described the man who robbed him, as short, and wearing a brow coat. I answered that description, and kept away.</p>
