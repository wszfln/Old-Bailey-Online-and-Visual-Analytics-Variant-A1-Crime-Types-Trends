I am quite ready to go with you"â€”in Bishopsgate Street he ran across the road, I ran after him, and he was stopped almost directlyâ€”I took him to the station, and as I was about to search him, Lord handed me this packet containing 11 counterfeit coins, which he said he had taken from him, and on further searching him I found a packet con-taining these four bad florins in his coat tail pocket, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silverâ€”I heard Lord on the third remand make a statement about money passing from Adams to Costello.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospitalâ€”I was present when Rosario Bertucco died thereâ€”I was present before his death, when his deposition was taken in the presence of a Magistrate; he was in a dying stateâ€”the prisoner was present, and had an opportunity of asking any questions he pleased. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Rosario Bertucco was read as follows</hi>: "I am an inmate of the hospital. At half-past 7 on Satur<lb/>day last, 26th April, I was in the ice cream shop kept by Marmarosi; I went there to have something to eat; another man, not the prisoner, gave Marmarosi a white shirt to wash. That man asked for his shirt again, and called Marmarosi a whâ€”â€”. I asked Marmarosi what was the matter; the other man who gave the shirt said to Marmarosi, 'You have got another man who talks Italian, call him out to tight.' That man went out and came in again, and said to me, 'Come out and right.' As I went outside I said, 'One to one I will fight English fashion.' There were about 20 Maltese outside. The prisoner said, 'Let that man go, and fight with me.' We fought to<lb/>gether with fists. After we had been fighting about three-quarters of a minute I felt a blow with a knife in my back, and I fell to the ground. I do not know who gave me the blow with the knife. A soldier said, 'That is the man.' The prisoner was running away, and the soldier pointed to him. I had known the prisoner two or three days. I had had no quarrel with him before. I was sober." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. "I had not been drink<lb/>ing with the prisoner; I had drank two glasses of beer with an Australian young manâ€”I did not see the man running awayâ€”just after I felt the stab I fell down and called out 'Help me, Christians!'â€”I had no knife except the little penknife producedâ€”I put my hand in my pocket to take out this knife to frighten themâ€”I do not know whether the prisoner was always in front of me as we were fightingâ€”we were turning round all the timeâ€”I had no quarrel half an hour before with the prisoner or any other Malteseâ€”the police sergeant did not pull me off any one.") The deceased was admitted into the hospital on 26th Aprilâ€”I saw him when he was admittedâ€”he was suffering from a wound in the left buttockâ€”it was more than 5 inches deep, and about 1/2 an inch in breadthâ€”it had entered the pelvisâ€”there was considerable hÃ¦morrhageâ€”I should say a very long slender knife would inflict such a woundâ€”considerable force must have been usedâ€”this knife (<hi rend="italic">found on the prisoner</hi>) could not have produced itâ€”he died on 1st Mayâ€”I made a post-mortem examinationâ€”the knife had penetrated into the bladder; that caused extravasation of urine and peritonitis, of which he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I said before the Magistrate that if the prisoner and deceased were fighting, I should think the prisoner could not have turned round and inflicted the wound in the position in which I found it, not if he was fighting in front of him, he would have to stoop down to do it, and I don't think he would be able to use sufficient force in that position.</p>

I will shoot you"â€”I had not heard her laugh; she was smiling when she went downâ€”she ran back to me into the room, and he followed her immediatelyâ€”she said "Master is coming upstairs with a revolver in his hand"â€”I should say he was near enough to hearâ€”when he came into the room I noticed that his face was very red, and his eyes glaringâ€”he said "I will shoot your mistress, by God I will, I mean it too;" he said that just as he came into the roomâ€”I saw the revolver in his handâ€”this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is itâ€”he came and stood about two yards from my left sideâ€”I was sitting downâ€”he then moved nearly opposite to me, and fired without hesitationâ€”my head was leaning downâ€”I was struck in the left cheek, just below the eye; the bullet passed down inside my cheek and knocked out one of my upper teeth and one of the lower teeth; both teeth came out in the room, one has been found just lately; I was bleedingâ€”I did not see what Mary did, I saw her leave the roomâ€”my husband did not help me at</p>

I have an office at 4, Chapel Street, Mayfairâ€”about midnight on 26th April I was in Long Acre with a friend, Mr. Macgregor, going home towards Piccadilly, when six or seven boys came towards me, some on the pavement and some in the road, so that I could not pass, and one of them struck at my face with his fist, but I kept off the blow with my arm, and at the same moment the prisoner, who was the tallest of them, butted at me with his head and snatched my watch chain, and broke it off at the swivelâ€”I felt the tugâ€”the watch remainedâ€”I then knocked the prisoner down in front of me, but was knocked down myself, so that I could not hold himâ€”he got up and somebody else got between us, and I had to fight my way through themâ€”he ran away and I followedâ€”he ran into a doorway and stood straight up with his back against the doorâ€”I caught hold of his arm, and a policeman came upâ€”I never lost sight of the prisonerâ€”my chain was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or lessâ€”Mr. Macgregor was close behind me, and I broke my stick in the struggle and called to him for his.</p>

Seamer is a silk merchant in Londonâ€”I do not know whether I owed him any more than 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was to settle an account which I owed himâ€”he has never asked me for it since, but I cannot recollect it because we have had other transactions with him sinceâ€”I beg to remark also that the date has nothing at all corresponding to the order in November with the payment in Februaryâ€”this cash order was Novemberâ€”I saw Levy on 24th February when he came and brought the cheque, and asked me to give him the moneyâ€”I said no doubt before the Magistrate "In February, 1877, the defendant called on me in Paris at our office; I do not recollect seeing him again since. I saw him again in May, when he said he did not come on our business, but he had other business to transact; at the interview in February Levy handed me certain sums of money. I have a list of those sums; the figures in the list produced were written from the books by M. Blancherdet in my presence:" but seeing this cheque causes me to make an explanation which I hope the Court will allow me to makeâ€”it is true that I saw him in May; very likely it was a slip of memory when I said that I did notâ€”on 16th February he brought me the five sums which have been mentionedâ€”on the 24th he came again and asked me to take the cheque and give him 1,000 francs for his travelling expenses, consequently that cheque has nothing to do with our accountâ€”he may have left Paris between the 16th and 24th and came back againâ€”I did not see him between those datesâ€”this cheque reminds me of the transaction, it was in exchange for moneyâ€”there is no book here which will show that trans<lb/>actionâ€”Mr. Levy cannot prove the receipt of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.â€”the large book would show the transaction of 16th February, but there is no book in existence which would show a transaction of this kind, which is only an exchange of moneyâ€”M. Blancherdet never received money in the ordinary course of things, but in my absence from Paris payments would be made to him; but he would immediately certify me of it, and hand me the money overâ€”all letters are filed and kept in the archive room.</p>

Worth gave him, and he produced a copy of another account which had been sent him with the questionsâ€”this is what I had to go byâ€”among other entries here is "Nov. 16: Ch.

We went there and sat down for some time, and Fred Andrews went and fetched some beer and bread and meat, and we used prisoner's knife to eat the bread and meat with. I did not use the knife. Lee and Andrews, who were with us, went down, and the prisoner and I stopped up there, and after a time the prisoner Kelly and I went down into the bar and had some beer. We went up again, and on the stairs we met Andrews, and he bid us good nigh. I stood on some steps looking at the performance, and he (prisoner) stood below and kept on saying, 'Why don't you come down here?. I said, 'I am all right here; I 'll come down in a minute. In a little time I went down, and he said, "You are a pretty sort of fellow to stop up there I said, "You need not be so fast. I hardly know what passed, not two or three words, and he said, 'I shall stick a chiv into you,' and I said 'If you did I should hit you.' and I knew no more than that I get it in my leg, and I know no more than that I was carried downstairs. He stuck the knife into my leg twice. It is the knife that is now shown me. They took me to the police-station and then to the hospital here. I did not hit him before he hit me. I had had a drop, but I knew what I was doing till I was struck. He had been drinking a great deal in the afternoon. I gave him no reason that I know of for it.</p>
