                  </hi>. I reside at 4, Lancaster Street, Hyde Park—in 1859 I was residing partly in England, and partly in New York and New Orleans—in 1859, when I was in New York, my daughter, Emily Florence Magee, was living with me—I first became acquainted with the prisoner, I think, in December 1859—he paid his addresses to my daughter—I can't say when they were engaged, I was in England at the time—I remember the 12th December very well; my daughter was married on that day at Calvary Church, New York, by the Rev. Dr. Hawks; the marriage was performed in the ordinary manner—I heard my daughter and the prisoner agree to take each other as husband and wife—I afterwards saw them sign the register—Dr. Hawks handed me the certificate of the marriage, and said it would be good in England as well as anywhere else—I saw my daughter and the prisoner sign that; this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it signed by the clergyman, not by the prisoner and my daughter, I saw them sign the register—after that the prisoner and my daughter lived together as man and wife—my daughter is still alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did the prisoner first meet your daughter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, I was in England—I was absent in England four or five months—when I started for England I knew nothing of any engagement,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270004"/>
               <p>and knew nothing of Mr. Eardley—I started for England about June or July, and returned to America in October—I heard of the engagement from my daughter the day I left Liverpool for New York—I think that was the 25th September—I was requested to keep the matter secret, be<lb/>cause Mr. Eardley was not in America, and therefore I was requested not to talk about it, and it was kept secret for some time—I am quite sure it was the register I saw signed, there were several persons present in the room—I did not ask the cleryman whether it would be good in England—it was a statement made voluntarily by him without any question being raised—since my daughter has ceased to live with Sir Culling Eardley she has lived at my house.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"10, Sackville Street, W., July 29th, 1865. I hardly know whether you will receive my letter, but, as our friend Dr. Pettigrew has communicated with you, I venture to write—he has told you that I am most anxious to be re-united with you, and I come to ask it of you. Florence, I have wronged you terribly; I have wronged you in your self-respect, and have been a selfish, bad husband to you till now; and yet I so believe in your nature that I crave and beg you to take me back. I have sinned grievously, and have no excuse. Will you forgive me? I cannot write you a composed letter; I just pour out my own feelings. My own wife, if you only knew what bitter remorse I have gone through since we parted at the London Bridge, you would at any rate pity me. Oh! by the memory of old days at Gilead Lodge, St. Leonard's, and Liver<lb/>pool, let me be as I was. Reproach me if you will, mistrust me, you are in your right, but take me back. As a child I come to you; lead me. My wife, I love you, indeed I love you. I long, oh! so fully, to be worthy of you. I shall work hard to increase what is left of my ill-spent fortune to make up to you as far as I can. I believe, though my relations would stand aloof from me, that I am young enough, and have enough in me, to earn a good name for you myself, that you may not be ashamed of being my wife. Will you answer me yourself, and not send my note to your lawyers? Don't, I pray, refuse me; think over it, and if you cannot love me enough to receive me again, write to me yourself to say so, but let me see your hand<lb/>writing again, my own, own wife. Your undeserving husband, Eardley G. C. Eardley.")</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270005"/>
               <p>on the 12th December, 1859; it was a perfectly valid marriage according to the law of New York; even if the parties had not signed the register, it would not affect the validity of the marriage at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The laws of marriage in America differ in the different States, do they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do—there is no necessity for the publication of banns in New York, nor for signing the register, nor for witnesses; you can be married anywhere—a couple meeting in the street can go and be married where they like; that is the law of matrimony in New York—it has been long established by custom that the marriage should be performed by a clergyman, of some recognised denomination, or by a Magistrate—as to the actual legal requirements, there is no statute that a marriage should be by a clergyman; a marriage before witnesses is suffi<lb/>cient—a marriage may be by a clergyman himself, and in the absence of a clergyman before witnesses—a marriage in New York in the Scottish form has been held to be valid, but I don't think that any marriage has taken place or been sustained in that form for some years—the only statute on the subject of persons professing different faiths, provides that a marriage solemnised in the Jewish form by a qualified Jewish priest, or in a form of any other religious denomination by a clergyman of that denomination, shall entitle the parties to register their marriage, if they chose to do so, but there is nothing at all affecting the validity—taking the case of a Pro<lb/>testant and a Catholic, they can be married in either faith, or by a Magis<lb/>trate—the marriage need not take place in both faiths.</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Cayley, 43, Pall Mall—I sleep in the basement of the house—on the morning of the 10th January I heard a noise—I went to the front door, and sent a little boy for a con<lb/>stable—I then got another constable—I told one to stand at the front door—I went to the back with the other—I then called a Captain McNeal—we examined the back part of the premises, and found the back window open, but the shutters fastened from the inside—the constable forced an entry into the shop—you can't get in the shop from the house—there is a separate entrance—when we got in I found the prisoner crouched down behind the counter—I heard a blow struck and a cry from the prisoner—I think he said, "I am killed"—I found a screwdriver, a knife, a piece of stone to whet knives upon, a bottle with some oil, and a dark lantern—I also found a twelve-foot ladder in the shop.</p>

They asked me if I would carry a parcel, and told me to wait a minute. I waited, they struck a light, I heard a noise, they got into the house and opened the door for me. I went in, and they told me to stop, they would be back directly. I stayed there half an hour, and the policeman opened the shutters, ran in, and struck me on the head. I have been under the doctor ever since. He pulled me down to the station half dead from loss of blood. I don't think I should have stopped there if I was going to do anything wrong.</p>

I am a meat salesman in Newgate Market, the prisoner was in my service as clerk for twenty or twenty-one months—his duties were to book the meat that was sold, and to receive money for it from various customers, and to pay the money to whoever came for it, and pay it into the bank—he had to make entries in his cash-book and to account to me for the money in the book—this is the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find no entry here of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from George Miller on 6th November, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Samuel Stacey on 5th October, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Bannister on 28th September—the prisoner has not accounted to me for those sums in any way—he left on 6th November without notice, and I never saw him again till he was in custody about a fortnight since.</p>

               <p>in the market, it is not thought necessary to ask who he is or where he comes from, or whether he has paid for them—I have never known the prisoner charged with any criminal offence—he was in the market in December—I did not miss him at all during December—I know of his buying these things; I did not see him buy them—I saw them about an hour after he had bought them—I saw them exposed for sale in the market—I don't know the man that had them—I should know him if I was to see him—they were laid out loosely for any<lb/>body to buy, and about an hour afterwards the prisoner told me he had bought them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Green Hill, Harrow—on January 1st, about 9.30, I was going with a team of horses and a load of manure into a field at Green Hill, and saw something lying on the green sward by the side of the lane, which I thought was a bundle of clothes—I touched it with the butt-end of my whip, turned the wrapper over, and found it was an infant—I picked it up and took it to my master—it was dead—I took it to the station and gave it to a policeman—I afterwards went down the lane again with another load of manure, and at the same place, just where the child's mouth had been, I picked up something like a sugar teat—the lane leads into fields, and this spot was 400 yards from the road—one end of the lane, leads into the road—the child was dressed in a large bedgown with a wrapper over it, a sort of stuff thing something like linsey—I examined nothing—it was a frosty morning, very cold—it was New Year's Day—the child was entirely covered—I could see nothing of it—I had to pull the things back before I could see what it was.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live in the Harrow Road—on 1st January I examined the body of a female infant at the Harrow Station—it was about three weeks old and was quite dead and cold—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day; there were no external marks of violence, but I noticed a discoloration just above the nose, and at the back of the head—with the exception of evidence of thrush in the mouth and throat, the child appeared to be fairly well nourished—there was slight congestion of the lungs and intestines, the remaining organs were apparently healthy, the heart was contracted on the left side, and the right side contained no blood—in my opinion thrush was not sufficiently developed to be the cause of death—the effect of the exposure of an infant on a frosty morning in January would depend upon the time it was exposed, and upon the conditions in which the child had been previously placed as to its having had food some hours before—if it had been there all night with the temperature at a low freezing-point, and without food, I think the effect would be fatal—I came to the conclusion that it had not been fed for some hours, because the stomach was empty—if the child was exposed the whole night in that condition as to food, that would in my judgment be likely to have caused its death—the congestion would be sufficiently accounted for by the exposure—I believe the state of the heart was caused by the exposure—from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation alone I could not say that the child died from exposure, but the appearances were all consistent with death from exposure—I should not be able to come to the conclusion that it died from exposure without knowing how long it had been exposed, but knowing that it had been exposed all night, I came to the conclusion that that was the cause of death—its having thrush would render it more susceptible of the influence of cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the existence of thrush show imperfect nourishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it generally results from manual treatment—I have heard that the mother is subject to fainting fits—if they came on suddenly, going along a road, they would be likely to deprive her altogether of the power to do anything, supposing the faintness was complete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the fact of the child having thrush, render it difficult to be fed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The soreness would render it more difficult for the child to swallow than if it had not got thrush; the very act of sucking would be painful—the mortality is greater among children fed on bread and milk than among those fed on their mothers' milk—children often die from being deprived of their mothers' milk.</p>

When I hit him back again he took the knife up. When I saw the knife I ran out, he after me. As soon as he came out running after me he hit me in the face and shoved me down. I got up; I felt my face and felt blood. I thought he had cut me with the knife. I did not know that the knife had been taken from him before he left the house. When I felt the blood, and saw him coming back to me, I thought he was going to stab me, because I saw the knife open in his hand before we came out of the house; that is all I have to say. I was afraid he was going to stab me. I would not have done what I did if I had not seen the knife first in the house." <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>

               <p>be had to communicate an important matter, and that he wished to speak to an officer of the Embassy, but only one—he spoke in German—I said that we were all officers of the embassy, and that he could say what he knew—I communicated with the Baron von Schmidhals, and he and the prisoner went into, another room-after a short time he came from the room, and went out—on the 9th he came again—I had no conversation with him then—on the 10th he came, and I had some conversation with him—he told me that Mr. Emerich had come from Paris about six months ago, and that he had lived here in very needy circumstances with him at 1, Osborn Place, Whitechapel, on the money that he, the prisoner, had given him—he said that Emerich was a Hanoverian, and a soldier of the Hanoverian army, hut that he had nothing to do then, that he was a very desperate man, and that he had the intention as long as he had known him to kill the King, of Prussia—he said that Emerich was in communication latterly with high persons, and that he had received very much money—I afterwards went with the prisoner to some place where he had said he had been with Emerich-the first was 14, Hinde Street, Manchester Square-that was the house where he said Emerich had been sometimes, and where he had received money—we afterwards went to 20, Eaton Place, where the Baron Blome resided-that was also pointed out to me by the prisoner as a house where Emerich had received money-Baron Blome was the representative in this country of the late kingdom of Hanover.</p>

I am Secretary to the Prussian Embassy-these two documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were written by me on the 8th and 9th of January at the prisoner's ictation-they bear his signature and my own. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"London, 8th January, 1868.) I lodged here in London for upwards of six months with a certain William Emerich, who stated himself to be a Hanoverian officer, and that he had arrived from Paris. At first this person was entirely without means, but after a while he received money from various sources, among others from a certain Hanoverian Baron, who resides in Eaton Place. Ultimately Emerich became continually more mysterious, and talked about a duty he had to fulfil: he must avenge George, his King, on the King of Prussia. I drew his attention to the fact that in reality Count Bismarck was the instigator, but he persisted in his view. Yesterday he suddenly startled for Berlin, and I have just now received this letter. As Emerich is a desperate man, and asserts himself to be in posession of Orsini shell, I felt myself in duty bound to give infor<lb/>mation about his criminal intention. Further interest in the matter I have not, as I am not a Prussian subject. Emerich is a member of the Society of aithful Hanoverians, and lived here without work, and, as I believe, on funds which were placed at his disposal. Signed, Gustave Victor." "London, January 9th, 1868. The Baron of whom I made mention yesterday is, as I have just ascertained, the Baron Blome. I was myself with Emerich at Baron Blome's about three weeks ago, and waited outside the house. I don't know if Emerich has had personal interviews with Baron Blome. The interview that he had three weeks ago lasted about an hour. Emerich has on other occasions, doubtless, received assistance from Baron Blome, as he changed directly after leaving him a sovereign at a public-house. Signed, Gustave Victor." This is the letter referred to in the first of these papers:—"Cannon Street Station. My dear Gustave, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270055"/>
               <p>hurry I write you only these few lines as adieu. I put thee on thy oath to keep the promise that thou gavest me. Farewell, and pray for thy faith<lb/>ful friend, Wilhelm Emerich. If God will give me His blessing I will return to London. Farewell." In consequence of these communications with the prisoner I felt it prudent to communicate with my Government in Prussia by telegram, on the 9th.</p>

He declared that he had no object in what he did but that of relieving his mind of the secret with which he had been entrusted by Emerich; that he compromised no one, and, so far from desiring to obtain money, he had determined upon returning the few shillings that had been given to him, and should have done so but for being taken into custody. In the course of his address he put in letters addressed by him to the Prussian Embassy, of which the following are trans<lb/>lations</hi>:—"London, January, 13th, 1868. Sir, I am sorry I cannot come myself, being busy; if you have need of me, please to give my friend, the bearer of this, a few lines for me. It will be very agreeable to me if you do not trouble me any more, and I am sorry I cannot render you any further assistance in this affair. Please to receive the assurance of my profoundest esteem and devotion. (Signed) Gustav Victor." "London, January 14th, 1868. Sir, It is my duty to address yet a few lines to you. My friend tells me that you will give me a reward if I can to-day discover the residence of Emerich for you. You know that I have run about in rain and storm last week, and that my health was jeopardized in this weather. I have not even recovered the expenses I incurred in riding every time into the City and back. If you are an intelligent man, and on the whole know to appreciate a man who can render you such a service, you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186801270058"/>
               <p>will understand that I cannot lose my time this week about an affair which brings me in nothing, and interests you more than me. Until now I have only done my duty, and now, if you want to have a proof that my in<lb/>formations are correct, I will guarantee to tell you within twenty-four hours that Emerich is in Berlin, &amp;c. You will understand yourself that I cannot present myself to a respectable person in the state in which I find myself at present; if you give me the necessary means to present myself respectable in three houses I am ready to find out the affair in a few hours. If you will do your duty, you will give my friend a cheque for a clothing magazine and a little money to buy necessaries. It is impossible for me to gain the end in view in any other way, as you will understand yourself, and it is the highest time now for that, as my reason tells me, perhaps. Receive the assurance of my profoundest esteem and devotion. (Signed) Gustav Victor."</p>

Vanner and Co., is drawn by my firm on the Union Bank; it is in the prisoner's writing, and signed by Mr. Dixey—we received money for Messrs Vanner and Co., and paid them once a month-this sum was owing to them at that date, and it was the prisoner's duty to pay that cheque to them—he had no right whatever to cash it at our banker's, or cause it to be cashed—it was his duty to cross it, but it is not crossed-in August, 1866, I said to the prisoner that the books were very much behind, and in such a confused state that I had been talking the matter over with my partner, and we were talking of employing an accountant to look thoroughly into them—he afterwards came into my private room, and said that he had been talking the matter over with another clerk, and thought it was an unnecessary expense to employ an accountant, and if I would give him time he would be there late, and another early, and would soon, get the books all square—I said that it was useless, we bad quite made up our minds to employ an ac<lb/>countant to look into matters, and he had better go on regularly with his own work, and the lee way would be gone into by the accountant—we dismissed the prisoner in August, or early in September, 1867, I have not got the exact date, and a day or two afterwards I obtained his address, Marion Villas, Dalston, and addressed a letter to him, which I gave to the junior clerk, Mr. Glynde, to stamp and post—it is his duty to enter the letters in a book and account for the postage.</p>

Q.</hi> Is it a fact that the books were very much behind when the prisoner took them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, seven years ago-Mr. Griffiths managed them-Mr. Dixey never kept the general books, he kept an under<lb/>writing cash-book, which the prisoner took to some years ago-mistakes were not discovered in that book before the prisoner took it-the prisoner had to keep entirely a set of books in double entry by himself, and to check and superintend three other sets of ledgers, and in point of fact to super<lb/>intend the business of a moderate-sized office-account 150, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year would pass through his hands-there is an account with W. H. Porter in the ledger, he would sometimes ask us to exchange a cheque for him, which we did-his salary when he first came was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether it was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was the salary he asked for, and he got it-there were no arrears when Mr. Dixey kept the underwriting account, he is here—an underwriting account ought be kept right, and if it is wrong we check it and put it right-there are trifling errors sometimes in the accounts ren<lb/>dered to us, and we put it right—in the panic of 1866 we gave directions to the prisoner to get rid of all cheques as soon as possible, and not to trust any one more than was necessary-the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was somebody else's promissory note remitted to us by Van Es—we received no portion of that on that day—I can say that the proceeds of that promissory note were not paid in to our account at the bank, but I do not know about any portion of it, as he mystified the accounts—I know that a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note received for this very bill by the Alliance Bank, was paid into our bank-there would not be a hurry to make up the account to 31st August—I must have been absent that day-when I was absent the prisoner had to dis<lb/>charge part of my duties as well as his own.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Lower Chester Street, East Green<lb/>which—on 14th October I resided at the house of Frances Reynolds, at No. 5, in the same street—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—he slept in one bed and I in the other—about ten minutes to six that morning I got up and went to work, leaving him in bed—there was no other man in the room—I left a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers in a bag in the cupboard, and a watch—I was sent for a little after eight, and found the bag on the bed, and the watch and clothes gone—I gave notice of my loss to the police—I did not see the prisoner again till boxing-night, he was then at the station—he said he would make it up to me if I would not go against him, and offered me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Don't you live with the woman you call your land-lady as man and wife? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; she is a married woman—my wife left me through going with other men—when you left my place you had much more hair about your face than you have now—I do not owe you any spite—I did not want you to settle the case—your mother and sister wanted to give me money to make it up.</p>
               <p>Frances Reynolds. I keep the house, 5, Lower Chester Street—the prisoner lodged there in the same room with the prosecutor—I remember the prosecutor going out about six o'clock on the morning of the 14th October—the prisoner came down about ten minutes past six—he went out and washed himself, and went up stairs again, a thing he never did—I said. "How late you are!"—he said, "No; it is only ten minutes past six',—he went out muttering to himself—about half-past eight I went up to make the bed as usual, and found the bag out of the cupboard on the bed, empty—I sent for Jones, and he missed his things.</p>

No, we do not, and you cannot prove it—my sister is married to Mr. Kirton—Jones does not keep me and my child—his clothes were not in my room, unless I took them there to take care of—on my oath he never slept with me—he has no spite towards you—I was never up with you till one o'clock in the morning that I know of—you were one of a party at the Standard one night, and my father was there—I did not ask you to take me to Westbourne Park to see the Foresters—you asked me all these things, but I did not consent to it—I did not like you—you owe me a week's rent—I don't keep fancy men, and fancy men don't keep me—a shoemaker lodged at the house one week; that was before you came—he lodged there twice—he was not able to pay his rent, and I told him I should not expect it.</p>

I stopped with her a fortnight, but I went back to Greenwich the day after I had left to see if a job was going on. I fell in with the shoemaker. He wore a greasy coat, a stitched hat, and no beard; and I suspect him to be the man, because he was a lazy fellow, always at the public-houses.</p>

I am the wife of John Roberts, who keeps a beerhouse at 4, George Street, Deptford—on 21st January, about twenty minutes after twelve in the day, the prisoner and a person named Mann came in—they called for a pint of porter and paid with two penny-pieces—about twenty minutes afterwards they had another pint, and paid with two more penny-pieces—I afterwards went into my kitchen—before going there I counted to see what money I had in the till, and I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a farthing, after taking the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a farthing in copper—my daughter was there when I counted it—we then went into the kitchen together, we had been there between five and ten minutes when I heard a rattling noise at the drawer, the drawer sounds very much—I said, "There is somebody touching the money in the drawer"—my daughter ran out, I ran after her—she said to the prisoner, "Oh! you are robbing my mother"—I said. "Oh! you bad man"—he said, "What's the matter with you?" raving up at me, and Mann moved from one corner of the seat to the corner by the door, and sat down there—I said, "You have been robbing my till"—I counted the money and three shil<lb/>lings and sixpence in halfpence was gone"—I said, "You have robbed me of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the prisoner again said, "What is the matter with you?"—I said, "You have got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if you don't give it me I will send for a con<lb/>stable "—he said, "I have not got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Well, give me what you have got"—he said, "I won't give you any"—I sent my daughter for a policeman—when I came out of the kitchen I saw the prisoner reach<lb/>ing over to the drawer, and he put his hand from the drawer into his side trousers pocket—I can't say which pocket it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were examined before the Magistrate, and told your story before your daughter was heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I mentioned about his putting his hand to his trousers pocket—my deposition was read over to me and I put my cross—I said that he was reaching over with his hand in the till, and that he put his hand in his side-pocket—I was present when my daughter was examined—I had before that told the constable about his putting his hand to his trousers pocket, but not the Magistrate—the till is not here, it is a large drawer with a little iron bowl inside to put the money in—I don't keep other things in the drawer, my husband has some roll papers there, and that like—my daughter and I were both excited at seeing such a thing—I had seen the prisoner twice or three times before in the house—I did not know him about the neighbourhood—I counted the money because I had a purpose, to pay it away—I looked on the floor, and so did my daughter, but could not find anything there.</p>

I was on duty in the Plumstead Road on the morning of 4th January last—I saw three men jump out of the second-floor window of Mr. Bickerstaff's house—I caught the prisoner as he came out of the window—he jumped out first—my attention had been called to the prisoners about half-past two by a light, before I saw the men—I knocked at the door, and obtained no answer—Mr. Bicker<lb/>staff gave the prisoner into custody for breaking and entering his house—he made no reply—I searched him, and found a shilling, three sixpences, and thirteen-pence in copper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I don't deny being in the house, but I did not break into it. I was drunk; two men broke into the house, and let me in. I did not want to go; they said I must; if I did not I should get them <hi rend="italic">nabbed</hi>, and myself as well. I waited at the door of the house, and never moved from there. Afterwards a policeman came to the door and knocked, and I ran up stairs and jumped out of the window. I did not go into the house to steal, and did not take anything. I went quietly with the police<lb/>man. I make my living by hard work, not by burglary.</p>

I am the creditors' assignee in this bankruptcy, and was appointed on the 24th July—I live at Richmond—the prisoner was carrying on the business of an old clothes dealer—a short time before he became bankrupt he brought an action against me and lost it, and conse<lb/>quently was indebted to me to the amount of the costs, 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—on the 24th of July I went to Richmond and saw the defendant, and told him I came to take possession of the premises and relieve the present messenger by putting another man in—he said there was nothing for me to take—I remained there about two hours—there were but a very few things to be seen in the house, and they were in the shop, except one or two articles of furniture—I went again on the following Saturday and commenced to search the house, and discovered a secret room—before that I told them I had an idea there must have been some things concealed, and if he would tell me it would be very much better; but he persisted there was nothing more than was to be seen—I next felt the partition in the top part of the house, which he said separated it from the next house, and that there was nothing there—I cut the paper away with my knife, and, seeing there was something inside, knocked the door down and found the various articles, which appeared to have been hastily thrown in—I took possession of these things—he remarked, "My God! you have ruined me "—he said they belonged to Mr. Nathan previous to my breaking open the door—they were similar things to what he had in his shop, because there were labels on some showing the price—there was some bedding in the house—a bed was in this room, but no mattress—these things were sold by my instructions, and realised about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> What was the 24th July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know, Wednesday or Thursday—the messenger who was to be relieved is ill and could not attend to-day—I understood he has been ill six weeks—I have made no efforts to find out whether he is in a fit state to attend here—the messenger I put in his place is not here either—the defendant gave me every facility for seeing the premises except that room—he said I should have to pay for the wall if I damaged it—he did not say there was nothing there belonging to me—I meant, by telling him it would be better to show me all, that it would save me unnecessary trouble—I don't know if I should have prosecuted him—I did not say I should not—I do not recollect saying before the Magistrate that the prisoner told me the partition belonged to the next house; if I did not I ought to have said so—he told me Nadan, his son-in-law, had a bill of sale over them—he put a document into my hand, but I would not read it—when I asked him to let me go over the house he said, "With pleasure"—my servant and two other men went with me on the 24th July—neither of them are here—the assets under the bank<lb/>ruptcy in the original petition were about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the assets from the sale of these goods are in the hands of the Court—there is no dispute about them—I have not heard that the goods were not his property—I have not heard if there is a civil action pending on the subject.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Taylor, auctioneer, of Richmond<lb/>on Saturday, 27th July, 1867, I went with Mr. Gurney to defendant's house to take an inventory of the goods—I was present when the discovery was made—on the top of the stairs was a comparatively empty room—to the right hand there was what was found to be a room, and which contained nearly the whole of the goods—Mr. Gurney tried the wall, which appeared like the rest of the room, and told Bartram be believed there was a con<lb/>cealed</p>

I live at 4, Commercial Cottages, Rotherhithe, and am a bone collector—on the 14th January Clarke came to mo and asked if I had sold the mare—I said, "No," and he said he knew of a customer who would buy it—I saw Clarke and Smith on the 16th, and Clarke said, "I have brought the young man to look at your horse"—I took him into the stable, and he looked at it and said he thought it would do—Smith asked me what time I went out—I said about twelve, and he told me to stop till half-past twelve, and he would fetch his employer—I said I would wait—I waited till a quarter to one, but he did not come—I put the horse in the cart and went to my business—when I returned home in the even<lb/>ing Smith was waiting for me—he told me his master was at the Victoria public-house, and asked me to take the horse over there to him—I told them to get up in the cart, and we all drove to the public-house—when we got there Smith brought Greenaway to me—he asked me if I was the owner of the horse; I said, "Yes, it is in the cart outside"—he went out with Smith to look at the horse—he got up in the cart, drove it a little way, and then came back to the public-house—he then asked me what I wanted for the horse; I said 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that was too much, and offered me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then asked me if it would carry anybody on its back; I told him I did not know, as I never used it for that purpose—I then told my man to take the horse back to the stable—Greenaway said he should like to see somebody on its back, and Smith went to tell my man to bring it back—Smith got on its back and rode it about—Green<lb/>away again asked me to let him have it for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted it to run in a paper van, and that he was a paper merchant at Peckham—I told him I would not take less than 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said, "If you will come into the parlour and write a receipt I will pay you for it"—I wrote the receipt, and Greenaway said, "Let me look at it"—I gave it to him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he showed it to Smith, and he said he thought it was right, and gave it back to Greenaway, who folded it up and put it in his pocket—he did not pay me the money—he took a sovereign from his pocket, and said, "I will give you this as a deposit, and if you come home with me to Peckham I will give you the remainder of the money"—Smith said, "I shall expect you to give me half a sovereign," and I said if he gave my man one I would—I did not get the deposit of a sovereign; I would not take it—I asked him for the receipt back, and he would not give it to me. (<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>: "January 16th, 1868. Sold to Mr. Greenaway, a bay mare, for the sum of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and J. C. warrants her quiet and a good worker. J.

After that Smith said he would go and send my man in—he came in, and Smith went to mind the horse—when the man came in he saw we were arguing about the horse, and went out again—he came back directly, and said the horse was gone—Greenaway, Clarke, and myself were then in the room; Smith was not there—I told Greenaway he should not go, and we had a struggle—I succeeded in detaining him—he then gave me the receipt, and wanted to go—I said, "You cannot go</p>

               <p>till the horse conies back"—my man came back, and he said he could see nothing of the horse—I told him to stop with me, and not let Greenaway go out—a constable came, and I gave him into custody—I saw the horse at the station about half an hour afterwards—Clarke was in the public-house at the time the receipt was written out—as soon as my man came and said the horse was gone, Clarke followed him out.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Deval, of 6, Tunbridge Place, Peckham—on 13th January I had two shawls and a pair of boots in the kitchen—I saw them as late as nine o'clock at night—we did not go to bed till eleven—I fastened up the doors and windows before going to bed—I was the last up—the door is very easily forced open, as the bolt is a very bad one—I was not disturbed at all in the night—my husband was up first in the morning—my daughter went down at seven—I came down about eight—I did not miss the shawls till twelve in the day—I saw that a great many lucifers had been partly burnt, and then I looked about, and missed the shawls—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the boots have not been found—I found the brickwork and the woodwork of the window broken away—that had been all safe the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 19, Westminster Bridge Road—the witness, Mrs. Hadley, called upon me for a certificate of the child's death; as I had never seen it, and knew nothing about it, I called at the place, and saw the child dead—I then sent her to the Coroner's officer—I afterwards examined the child—I found no marks of external violence—I opened the chest—I found the child had suffered from acute inflammation of both lungs, on the right side first, then on the left—that on the left side had been going on for about eight or ten days, on the right side perhaps for about five; with that exception, the rest of the body was quite healthy—in all probability the child's life would have been saved if proper remedies had been used at the commencement of the disease—the symptons must have been very urgent, from the extent of the inflammation—any ordinary person must have seen that there was great distress, a good deal of fever, difficulty of breathing, and such like; it would be evident to any ordinary observer; it is a very distressing thing to see a child labouring under such a disease—it ought to have been leeched in the first instance, and small doses of antimony administered—I don't think weak brandy and water would do much harm, certainly no good—port wine would not be proper—I should not administer any stimulant to a child with that state of chest—I complain rather of what was not done; the remedies I speak of ought to have been applied—the oil would do neither good nor harm—in my judgment, if a medical man had been called in tolerably early, in all probability the child's life would have been saved—there was nothing the matter with it but the chest—it could not have coughed very much, there might have been a little cough, but latterly it could not have coughed anything to speak of; the lungs being injected with blood, there would not be air enough to draw out the cough, and there was a good deal of effusion in the pleura—I have known many cases where persons have lost one lung and yet have lived on; they have coughed then, that would be a chronic state—there are some differences between medical men as to the use of phlogistic means; there have been the phlogiston and the antichloristic—one of the most distinguished men in the profession in modern times was considered to have gone too far in the phlogistic line—this case would be accompanied with a good deal of fever—the system of the gentleman referred to was in favour of the administration of brandy, largely, I have read the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, and I know it has been supposed by able men that he may have caused a danger to society by making people take more drams than was good—the woman explained that the quantity of brandy she gave was very small, and if that was the case it would not be of much conse<lb/>quence—it would be of no moment—inflammation of the lungs is a very serious thing, and very often under the most successful treatment it kills people, in spite of all that can be done—it may sometimes make secret advances, so that persons without skill might not exactly know that the thing was so serious, but I don't think that would be so in this case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mary Wagstaff's Defence</hi>. Respecting the cough, the child had cut six teeth, and with each tooth it had had a cough, and during this illness it had a very bad cough; at times the <hi rend="italic">phlegm</hi> would rise in its throat. Towards the last it coughed very much, not loudly, but very often. We gave it every kind of nourishment we could think of—arrowroot, sago, and different things that I could get, new milk and eggs, and every<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>I could possibly get. Since I have been with these people, of course I have held the same views, and I have many times proved the Lord in such cases. I believed that He would do the same now. I did not know that I was breaking the law or going contrary to it. If I have done anything wrong it has been through ignorance, but I am not guilty of causing the child's death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas Wagstaff's Defence</hi>. I don't know that I have anything more to say than what my wife has said; I am of the same opinion. I feel sorry if I have done anything contrary to the law. I feel that, as I love the Lord, I must be one to keep the laws of my country, and be a peace-maker instead of a peace-breaker. I should not like to break the law; I want to keep peace with all men. I feel that the Lord has done much for me, if I put my trust in Him, as commanded by His word and teaching—I do not feel that I have done anything wrong. I have been kind to my children, and done all I could for them.</p>
