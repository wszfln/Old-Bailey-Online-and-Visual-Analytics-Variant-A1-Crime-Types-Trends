                  </hi>. I am landlord of the King's Head public-house, Crown-Street, Oxford-street—on 8th September, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner came for a pint of ale, and gave half a crown in payment—I gave her change and put the half-crown in the till; there was no other there—directly after drinking the ale she went out—about five or ten minutes after<lb/>wards I went to the till, took out the half-crown, and thinking it looked bad, tried it in the detector; it bent directly—I put it aside on the top of the spirit cask; I afterwards gave it to the policeman—on the Tuesday follow<lb/>ing, the 16th, the prisoner came again, about 2 o'clock in the morning; the house was closed then, but she begged me to let her have some gin and I did—I knew her again when she came in—what she had came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a five-shilling piece; I tried it in the detector, but could not bend it readily, and thought it was good—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; directly after she was gone I tried it again and found it was bad—I sent for a con<lb/>stable and gave it to him; as I was telling him about it outside the front-door, the prisoner came in sight—I went up to her and said, "You recollect coming for some gin five or ten minutes back?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And you recollect giving me a five-shilling piece; is this the one?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you aware that it is a bad one?"—she said, "No, I knew nothing at all about that"—I said, "Well, it is a bad one, and if you like to give me the difference I will say no more about it"—she said, no, she would be d—d if she would do that, and I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of Bound's-green, Tottenham—on Thursday evening, 28th August, at half-past 10 o'clock, the prisoners came there—Williams called for half a quartern of gin, and gave me a half-crown—I took it into the parlour, put it on the table, and brought back 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which I gave him—he called for another half-quartern five minutes afterwards, and paid me with 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they shared the drink, and Brinckley then said, that as Williams had paid for that, he would stand another half-quartern; he gave me half a crown, which I gave to my grand<lb/>daughter, Mary Ann Papworth, who gave him his change, and they left together—that half-crown was put on the table with the other, and in about five minutes I found them bad—I gave them to a policeman next day.</p>

I found the landlady would not take the coin, as it was bad. I put it in my mouth and said, "It is bad." I saw no more of the other money till the next day at the station-house; that is the only public-house I have been in with him.

I am a harness-maker, of Park Cottages, Old Ford, Hackney-wick—on 12th September, about 6 in the morning, as I was dressing, I heard one of my horses call out as it was coming along the road—I looked out and saw a chestnut gelding being led by the prisoner—it was my gelding—I asked the prisoner where he was going to with it—he said he was going to put it on the Marsh—he was coming from the Marsh—it had been on the Marsh for some weeks past, and I had seen it there two days previous—I asked the prisoner to wait a minute—I ran downstairs half dressed, took him by the collar and said, "What are you going to do with this horse?"—he appeared quite confused—I said, "You had better wait a moment or two and we will have this matter settled respectably; I have lost one before"—I gave him in charge to a constable—I observed that the prisoner's boots were wet as if he had just come out of the grass, and there were short pieces of grass upon them—I valued the horse at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>exactly; it ceased after some time—next morning I went down about half-past 6—I saw the prisoner, and he called me into his room, and said, "Come in; I am afraid my wife is no more; this is the cursed drink"—I felt her face—she was on the sofa when I saw her, undressed—she had an old quilt on her; that was all—I felt her face, and she was getting cold—there was a lot of her hair about the place—I collected it and pat it in the fireplace—the right side of her face was very much bruised, and on that side the hair was all off—there was also a bruise on the other side—I looked at the floor; there were marks as though some one had been lying there.</p>

I live at 1, St. Anne's-court, Wardour-street—I am a boot closer—I was at the Two Ships public-house, at the corner of Compton-street, Wardour-street, on 11th September, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the day, the prisoner, the deceased Radford, a tall man named M'Donald, and several others were there—I heard the deceased ask a tall, strong man, not M'Donald, about wrestling—after he had caught hold of his hand and brought him to the ground nearly, he wrestled for a few minutes in the public-house—I left the public-house in company with Rad<lb/>ford, and went into a urinal there—I, Radford, and a man named Crawford, were there for a minute or two—when I came out the tall man that he had been wrestling with stood outside, and the deceased <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck him—the tall man struck out again, and they went out in the middle of the read; they fought three rounds; both of them fell; Crawford went and separated them, and told them the police were coming, and the tall man ran away, the deceased running after him as hard as he could; he did not catch him—as the deceased went, he fell very heavily against a chemist's window-sill—he got up instantly—instead of running direct after the man he had been running after, he turned a complete half circle back again—the prisoner was then standing in front of the Two Ships public-house, and the deceased up and struck Davis, and Davis struck him; the deceased struck the first blow—he ran to Davis and struck him with his fist about the chest—Davis struck back directly; I should say there were about half a dozen blows exchanged between them when they were both on the ground—they got up again and had another round, in which the deceased make a blow at Davis; Davis immediately let his left hand go as well, and followed it again with his right</p>

                  </hi>. I was a nurse at the prisoner's about seven weeks—Mr. Cole is a cabinet-maker—on 7th August, about half-past 3 in the after<lb/>noon, I saw the prisoner—the child was then with me—the prisoner had been up stairs, and she came down speechless—we asked her if she had broken a blood vessel, but we got no answer—we took her into the kitchen, and sat her down on a chair—she brought the child down—I took it out of her arms and it was playing about—she went up stairs—I do not know whether she took the child up with her—I saw no more of her till she came down stairs—I observed nothing then which attracted my notice—I saw nothing on her hands then, but the last time she came down I saw blood on her hands, and on her throat, and on her dress—it was then that I asked her if she had broken a blood-vessel and she made me no answer—I went up after the girl, went into the back room and found the child dead, and bleeding from a wound in the throat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she in bad health? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and always appeared very fond of her children—after I saw the blood on her hands and dress, I found that her throat was slightly cut, but not for blood to come—she had made a slight attempt on her own throat, but not for blood to come—it was smeared from her hands—during the whole time I was in the house she appeared to be in a very low desponding state, and very fond of reading the Bible—I have observed something peculiar about her eyes and in her manner which attracted my notice—she looked rather strange to us at different times, and used to complain of her head being bad.</p>

I was at Mr. Cole's house on this day—he was out at his work—I saw the prisoner go up stain between 3 and 4 o'clock—I did not go up into the room, or see the child—she had blood on her hands when she came down—a medical man was sent for, and I called for the nurse—after the prisoner came down, the servant girl in her presence said, "Mistress has murdered the child"—the prisoner said nothing to that—I saw a scratch on her throat—there was a little blood from it—I asked her if she had brought up blood again, as she had on a former occasion—she made no answer—she said nothiug at all to me—I said that the child was found—she made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of 117, Old-street, St. Luke's—I was called to Brunswick-place, and saw the child dead, with a wound in the throat, such as would be inflicted by a knife which I saw—the prisoner was walking about the room—I spoke to her, but she seemed quite unconscious—I found three or four superficial wounds on her throat, and dressed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been attending her some weeks or months previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a month previously—I was called to her on 4th July, early in the morning, for spitting of blood—she was then in very bad health physically—I noticed nothing particular in the state of her mind, but once or twice there was a wild expression about her eyes—when I was called in found she had inflicted wounds on her throat, and after I had dressed them she attempted to rush out of the room, saying, "The child is crying, I want to go to if—I had a consultation with Dr. Davis, of Finsbury-square, nearly a month previous to the child's death—she was very low and melan<lb/>choly during my attendance on her—she complained of pains in her head—she was certainly not in a state of consciousness when I was called in to dress her wounds and see the dead child—she remained under my immediate attendance until she had recovered—she was in a very low state mentally, and I believe she was decidedly insane at the time this act was perpetrated—I was in attendance on her previous to this visit, and was attending on her subsequently, and according to my judgment she was not in a sound state of mind—I state that as my opinion from the result of my observations—on the evening of the murder she told me she was full of evil spirits, and asked me to cure them; and on the Saturday following she told me she was haunted by evil spirits, and that she saw the spirits murder the child before her eyes, and the next moment she denied the child's death altogether, and insisted on its being alive—she said that it was crying in the next room, and wanted to go to it—I have not given particular attention to diseases of the brain—it is an undeniable feature in cases of murder that the violence has been done to those nearest and dearest in blood—those acts are sometimes accompanied with attempts on the life of the person themselves—that is known in the profession as a homicidal monomania, and is very frequently produced by religious delusions among other exciting causes, and it is pro<lb/>duced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220030"/>
               <p>frequently by grief—I have been present during the whole of the examination—the state of low desponding melancholy which has been described is decidedly that which would be precedent to the developments of the homicidal impulse—it is also characteristic of homicidal mania, that it is developed suddenly, and exercised on the person most loved, and without any motive—she was, in my opinion, quite unconscious of right or wrong, and incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong at the time of the act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the illness you were attending her for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Consumption and spitting of blood—that would produce a low state of body, which would act upon the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not say that everybody in that state was unconscious of right or wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely express my opinion that Mrs. Cole was in that state—I do not mean to say that everybody affected so would be so, but they might be—I have not seen many cases of homicidal monomania—we are always taught that melancholy is incidental to the development of the homicidal impulse—that is the opinion of our first medical men—I do not speak from experience, but from books—the cases alluded to in the books are, I believe, recent, but I cannot swear that—I gave the prisoner tonics, which would act upon the low state of her mind and body—I never dreamed of her having a tendency to homicidal monomania before this act—I say that she was unconscious because I asked her if she knew me, and after some seconds she said "Yes"—I asked her what my name was, and she could not remember—I believe she said that she could not remember, or that she did not know—she was walking about, supported by her husband, and was throwing her arms about—this was after the child was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 146, Great Portland-street—on Monday, 25th August, Brun came and asked to look at a gold English watch, not any Geneva watches, for he could get plenty of those in Paris—I told him I had not a gold English lever watch, but that I should have in a few days—he then left, saying he would call again—he came again on Wed<lb/>nesday, the 27th, with Torturat, and asked if I had got any English watches—I showed him a gold English lever, a hunter, which he liked very much indeed—he asked me the price of it—I told him—they talked together in French—I could not understand what they said—Brun asked me in English if it was a good watch to go—he could speak tolerably good English—Tor<lb/>torat could not speak a word of English—Brun said it was the custom in France to time the watches before they bought them, and would I keep it one day and time it; so I put it by my regulator at the shop door, which keeps good time—they went away—I kept it till the next day, Thurs<lb/>day, when they both came again—I then informed Brun that I had timed the watch—he asked to see some chains—I showed him four or five, and he selected the best, and wanted to know the price of it and the watch together—I told him the price, but he could not, or would not, understand it, and asked me to write it down—he made signs for me to do so—I wrote it down, the watch and chain meantime lying before me on the counter, just under my eyes—I found something come in my eyes, which hurt them very much, and I heard a scuffle—I could not see—they both rushed out, and closed the door after them—I called to my wife to mind the shop, and rushed after them, without stopping to see whether the watch and chain had been taken away—on the way I saw Brun throw the watch away—I picked it up—they were running as fast as they could—the watch was mine—it was the one Brun selected—I took him back to my shop—I overtook Torturat first, but I did not stop with him, because I guessed that Brun had the watch—I asked Brun when I brought him back if he threw the stuff in my eyes—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what he did it for—he said, "I was very hungry; I have had nothing to eat for three days; I must take something to get food"—I asked him if he had got the chain—he said, no, his companion had got it—Brun wrote this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the station—here is</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Howard, a labourer, and have charge of the house, 25, Cambridge-terrace, Hackney, which belongs to James Pink—I reside there—on Sunday, the 7th inst., I left the house in the morning, about nearly half-past 10, just before Church-time—it was all secured then; no one was in it—I returned at about 20 minutes to 8—when I put the key in the door, I found the door was only single-locked instead of double-locked—I stood a few minutes, and then the prisoner, Johnson, came out—I said, "Oh, you wretch; what do you do in my house?"—I said that twice—he said, "Nothing, nothing"—I then said, "Oh, you wretch; you must do something"—he said, "I have done no harm," and ran past—I then ran across the road, and called, "Stop thief!"—some people from the next door came to my assistance, and ran across the fields, and then another young man pursued him—he was eventually caught—I then went to the door again, and heard footsteps—I said, "Oh, there is some one in my house now; what shall I do?"—then the door went open, and I saw a man going up the stairs—I cannot swear to him—I heard the window go up—I went into the kitchen, but would not have anything touched till the policeman came, and when he came he picked up the things; rings and jewellery—the door had been opened with a key.</p>

I am a bootmaker, of 5, Wellington-street, Shadwell—on the evening of 7th September, I was going along Stanley-road, and heard screams of "Murder" and "Police"—I walked up about twenty yards, as far as the public-house at the corner of the road—I saw Johnson come up, and captured him at the corner—I saw him turn away from Cam<lb/>bridge-terrace, running at full speed; he turned into Stanley-road—three or four persons were following him—he threw away a great many things—Policeman 541 came up with Webb, and ordered me to take my prisoner to the station—I never let go of Johnson—I took him to the station, and gave him up to the inspector—I told the inspector the place where I had seen something thrown—a boy had picked up sixteen keys, a chisel, and a screw<lb/>driver; and a female brought in two keys while I was in the station—I asked the boy to pick the keys up, and I put them all in my pocket, and took them to the station—I did not lose sight of the prisoner at all from the time I first saw him.</p>

I am married, and live at 35, Berners-street, Middlesex Hospital—I was with the last witness, my sister, on the night of 31st August, waiting for an omnibus—we saw the prisoner standing in front of us—he turned round and looked us both in the face—I looked at him, and at the same time my sister said, "This man in front of us is feeling my pocket"—I said, "Oh! be careful"—she said, "Let him alone; he has not got his hand in it;" and then she put her hand in and said, "He has got my purse"—he went across the road and we ran across after him—he was standing there handing something, I could not see what, to another man, who ran off directly we came up—my sister said to the prisoner, "You have got my purse?"—he said, "It's not me"—I said, "No; not now; you have just given it to the other man"—he said, "Why don't you go after the other man?"—I said, "No; it is no use now he is gone; we will keep you"—neither of us had said anything before that about locking him up—be had not got three feet from us before my sister said, "He has got it" and went after him—I had a baby in my arms and was a minute behind her—the policeman was there, and the prisoner said to another man, "Go fetch the purse; you know who has got it."</p>

I have lost my watch"—the ring gave way from this chain, and the watch went—I sung out, "Police, police! stop thief, stop thief!"—I was then within two doors from the fountain, at the corner of Lucas-street—the prisoner turned round the corner—there was another man as well, a shorter man, but he went off—one of the two, I don't know which it was, cut me across the temple—I hate the mark now—I cried out, and fell from the blow I got—I got up as well as I could, and, of coarse, lost some time, but the policeman on duty was coining up another street, and he captured the man—I did not see him taken—I saw the direction in which the prisoner went—he went towards the railroad in Lucas-street—I saw him in custody about two or three minutes afterwards—I am sure the person I then saw in custody was the person who seized my watch; he was as white as possible.</p>

Cording—I questioned the boy as to how he became possessed of it, and from the account that he gave I went to the door to look for the prisoner—I did not see him—I then took the boy to the solicitor's office at the post-office—he there gave a description of the person who had given the order and the note to him—the boy was in my shop about five minutes.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220048"/>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, West-terrace, Penton-street, Newington—the last week in August, Mr. Stephen Cotton was lodging at my house—I recollect the prisoner bringing a registered letter for him, on the afternoon of 20th August, between 4 and 5 o'clock—he had not brought a letter to the house before that day—he produced this slip of paper, which I signed and gave back to him—I put the registered letter that the prisoner delivered to me on the mantel-piece—Mr. Cotton came home about half-past 8, and I told him there was a letter for him—he shortly afterwards made some communication to me about that letter; and a few minutes after that, the prisoner called again to deliver another letter—I called him in, and took him up to Mr. Cotton's room—Mr. Cotton asked him what time he brought the letter—he said, "About half-past 4 or 5"—Mr. Cotton said, "It ought to have come in the morning"—the prisoner said he brought it as soon as he got it—Mr. Cotton then told him that there ought to be two</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morning of 22d August, I saw the last witness at the corner f Baker's-row, which leads into High-street, Whitechapel, opposite the New-road—that is about 150 yards from Princes-street—he was very nearly choked, and could scarcely speak; I could see marks round his throat as if from a grip of a hand—he was sober—in consequence of information that he gave, I went to 20, Princes-street, with another constable, and saw Cooper, West, and Simes there—I did not know that Simes lived there—I did not see any man when I got in—I saw Cooper pawing the money to West—a half-sovereign of it was dropped, and I saw Hall, my brother constable, pick it up—the prose<lb/>cutor charged them with having robbed him, and I took Cooper and West into custody, with the assistance of my brother constable—Cooper said the prosecutor had given her 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to sleep with him—the prosecutor said he did not—West did not say anything to me—next day I was at Worship-street Police-court, and the prosecutor pointed Ring out to me, in Worship-square, near a corner—I told her she was charged with robbing the prosecutor, and she said she had only come to watch the trial.</p>

On the morning of 22d August, about 2 o'clock, I went with Jarvis and the prosecutor to 20, Princes-street, and there found Cooper, West, and Simes—there was no man in the room—when I went in, I saw Cooper passing money to West—I seized West's hand, and took 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it—I picked up a half-sovereign from the floor—the prosecutor charged the two women with robbing him, and I took West into custody—she said that Cooper had given the money to her, and she knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Blanks, a shoemaker, of 19, Princes-street—No. 20, Princes-street belongs to us—Simes was our tenant, and occupied two rooms there—I was at my door on this Friday night, between 12 and 1 o'clock, and saw Cooper come to the shutters, not to the door—I had seen her before—no one was with her—she asked for admit<lb/>tance, and Simes said, "I am a-bed"—I knew Simes' voice—Cooper stood at the shutters for, I dare say, five miuutes before she was let in—she asked her for something at last, and then Simes opened the door and let her in—I</p>

I know it was on 10th October that the prisoner gave me this note, because as soon as I found out I had been deceived I made it my business to go to a friend of mine who I knew moved that very day—I went there and asked them the day they moved, and I found out through that the day—I knew it was the same day they moved—he had it down in his book—it was a little over a quarter of a mile from Scaines' where I met the prisoner—I did not think of Scaines before he mentioned him.</p>

I carry on business in Long-acre—I was in Lothbury on Saturday, 5th September, about half-past 1 o'clock—I went into a urinal at the back of the bank—I felt a slight pull at my coat-pocket—I turned round and saw a man leaving the urinal—I placed my hand on my hip and at once missed my pocket-book—when I turned round, Boyd and another man were at the entrance, and as soon as I adjusted my cloth<lb/>ing, I said to them, "I have lout my pocket-book, and think one of you must have it"—each of them attested their ignorance—I kept hold of Boyd short time and I then let go of him and took hold of the other man—he pulled a small book from his pocket and said, that was the only book he had—I then again took hold of Boyd—the pocket-book contained a cheque payable to order, a five-pound note, and some postage and receipt stamps—I went immediately to the London and Westminster Bank, and received the number of the note at once, and then went to the Bank of England—there was another person in the urinal, whose back was towards me, but he was not near enough to be the one who took the pocket-book from me—I could not tell what movement had taken place before I turned round—the prisoner and the other man appeared to be coming in; they must have given place, in order that the person in there could go out—the cheque was payable to my order, and was not indorsed—I have not seen anything of that since—I received information about the note, which I had stopped at the bank, about 1 o'clock on the Monday, this being on the Saturday—a note was produced and shown to me at Bow-lane police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Davis, a bullion-dealer, of 54, Cornhill—the prisoner came to our shop on Monday, 8th September—I and another clerk were in the shop—the prisoner wished for 460 france, French money, and he produced three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—this is one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes he presented; this is my writing upon it—I did not give him change in francs—I went to the Bank of England with the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and left him waiting at the office—something occurred at the Bank of England—I did not get gold for that note—from what passed there, an officer went back with me—I found the prisoner still waiting in the shop—the officer followed me in, and said that that note was stolen—he mentioned his name, and said he must go back with him to the Bank of England—the prisoner said that he had received it from a party who was stopping in his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City—I was on duty at the Back of England on 8th September, about 1 o'clock in the day, or little after—my attention was called to a Bank of England note, and in consequence of that I accompanied the last witness back to his master's shop—I found the prisoner there—I told him I was an officer, produced the note, and said to him, "From whom did you receive it?"—he said, "I received it from a lodger of mine; I keep a registered lodging-house, and that is my name and address on the back of the note, which I placed on it"—I asked him what he had taken it for; he said, "For two napoleons, one breakfast, and one night's lodging"—I asked again a second time from whom he took it; he said, "A foreigner; his name is Jarvis"—I said, "This note has been stolen, and you must accompany me to the Bank of England"—I then left him in charge of another constable, and from what was said at the Bank, I afterwards took him to the station—I saw Mr. Hayward the same day, and found that what the prisoner had said about the lodgings was false—I went to the lodgings, and when I returned Mr. Hayward was at Bow-lane station—I have had charge of the note since; my initials are on the back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Gloucester constabulary—on the morning of 22d September, the prisoner was given into my custody at Cheltenham—he was wearing this coat when I took him—he told me if I would go to his father's house, 15, Sidney-street, I should find the other articles there—I had told him he was charged with stealing a coat, a pair of trousers, two shirts, two collars, and two silk handkerchiefs—I went and looked in the box, and found these trousers, a shirt, and the two collars; the other things here belong to the prisoner, and have nothing to do with the case—I brought him to London—I heard him, in the prosecutor's pre<lb/>sence, say that he was a ruined man for ever, and he begged Mr. Higgins to forgive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Will you swear you charged me with stealing the things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not hear a man say, "This bloke has been robbing his lodging in London," nor did I hear you say, "It is a lie"—I was not too confused to hear it—Mr. Higgins caught hold of you first—you said you were a ruined man for ever, and would make away with yourself—I cannot say much about you; I have not known you lately—I saw you once before—I have never known you at the police-station at Cheltenham—I know nothing about your character at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left my home in the early part of this year to come up to London, because there were better wages in London. Circumstances made me go to Cheltenham. I bought these things of the witness, and paid him for the coat and two waistcoats; I was to pay him weekly. The reason they have not put those in the indictment was because they acknow<lb/>ledge the money I have paid to be sufficient for those articles, and therefore they say I stole the others. I have always been known in Cheltenham as a respectable young man. My father has been in Cheltenham now about thirty-five years; thirty years in one firm.</p>

Soon after the funeral the prisoner told me that my mother had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her—I was surprised at it—I do not know what I said—I had never heard during my mother's lifetime of her borrowing any money of the prisoner—the prisoner produced a paper to me, either at the time or soon after—she said my mother had written it—I read it—I suppose it must have been thrown away; I have not got it—I do not know what became of it—I received it from the prisoner—it is not above a year and a half I think since I saw it—I do not think it can exist now, for I have looked through all my papers—it was in my mother's hand<lb/>writing; I am quite sure of that—there was on it "I promise to pay the holder or bearer the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on demand," and in my mother's name, "A.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Matthews, of 42, Amwell-street, Pentonville, grocer and oilman—I should have known Mrs. Soames twenty years by this time—at the time of her death I had known her sixteen years—I was on very intimate terms, indeed, with her; her health was particularly good—in consequence of a letter, I went to her house on the Saturday after her death; I saw the prisoner there then, but had no conversation with her—I went again on the Sunday, I saw the prisoner then, and she had a conversation with me respecting my deceased friend, over her body—she took me up to see the deceased, herself; she had the key of her room in her pocket—I was very much surprised at the appearance of my friend; her hands were clenched and her face was dread<lb/>fully distorted—I said to the prisoner, "Her's must have been a bad death"—and she shook her head and said, "Poor dear, poor dear, ah! you don't know all"—I said, "Not know all, not know all; what do you mean?"—she said, "Ah, poor dear, you don't know all, did you know she was going to be married?"—I said, "Married, certainly not"—I said, "Do her daughters know it or her brother, Mr. Barnes," I believe I said—she said, "Oh, no, it is a profound secret from all"—she said, "If it was not for that I think we should have her with us now"—I said, "What do you mean?"—she said, "The day after you were here (which was on the Tuesday), she went out to see the man she was going to be married to, and she found it very different to what he had represented"—I think she told me that she went in an omnibus up by the Angel, somewhere, to see this man, and it was finding out the altered circumstances of this man that had caused her grief and brought on the bile—she said, "She was in the habit of having her letters directed to me, under cover, so that her daughters should not know anything about it"—she said, "The man was always borrowing money, and there will be another letter to-morrow, and you will see it will be the old story, wanting to borrow money; he will be sure to want to borrow more money"—I said, "More money, I don't understand"—she said, "It is very shocking, is it not?"—I asked if she knew whether Mrs. Soames had lent</p>

               <p>the man much—I forget the exact sum she said, but she told me she believed it was very considerable; but the letter would be sure to be to borrow more money, as usual—she said that Mrs. Soames had wanted to borrow money of her, and I think she told me that she had lent Mrs. Soames 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and would have lent her more if she had had it—she said, "Poor dear, I would have lent her anything if I had had it; I had such love for her"—I do not recollect any more of the conversation that we had just then, in the room—she told me she believed Mrs. Soames had made this man's acquaintance in going up to see her brother, somewhere at Islington; that it was a very wretched place that he lived in, and he had got a lot of children—the prisoner told me that she knew the man quite well; that she had seen Mrs. Soames meet him; I think: she said she had been with Mrs. Soames to meet him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear her say anything, during this conversation, about brandy and water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she told me that Mrs. Soames, from meeting this man, and from the upset, had caused her to have the bile, and she was taken ill in her room after drinking a little brandy and water—I then went down to tea with the daughters and some friends there—she afterwards brought in a little bottle and made a great mystery of it, and would not allow it to come near the light, and said there was some conspiracy against the house—I knew Mrs. Soames in her lifetime very intimately—I was there on the Tuesday before she was taken ill; I had never heard her, at any time, say anything about getting married, or about any one writing to her, or borrowing money—a short time before her death she came to my house on her road to her brother's, very much distressed, after there had been a robbery in her house of a lot of silver—she was quite well then.</p>

" <hi rend="italic">Further examina<lb/>tion:</hi> "I knew Mrs. Soames six or seven years, and was very intimate with her—I saw her last alive on the Wednesday morning before her death, between 9 and 10 in the morning; she was cleaning her door—she appeared to be very well then—I never heard of her being ill—she was a strong healthy person—when I saw her dead I noticed that her features were very much distorted, and her fingers partly clenched, and I said to the prisoner that I thought she looked a very dreadful corpse."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). This letter marked "H" is addressed to me; I received it at the latter end of December, 1855, or the beginning of January, 1856; (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear sir, I wish you and your mother a happy new year; hoping you are both well as it leaves me at present; I have been to a loan office to see for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid back again by monthly payments; I have two securities, the landlady and a gentleman in the house; the only thing wanting is a reference to some one, to say I have the property of eight houses I named; he asked me if I could refer him to some one in Boston, as to say if it was so; I told him I was living on my income from houses and money out at use; the only thing I have told wrong is, that I am a widow; every one thinks I am a widow, therefore you must not alter what I have said about that; I dare say you will be <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> to; and if you will have the kindness to say that I am receiving my income that way, and I am capable of paying it, and have always been a punctual payer to every one, when in possession, I shall be very much obliged to you in so doing; of course you will be the best judge what to say, as you will have his letter before you, and I shall not know what he writes; if you will have the kindness to write to me what he asks you, in your answer, I shall then know what to say to him; I told your name, but I really do not think I told him where, so if you would have the kind<lb/>ness to ask the letter-carrier if he has a letter for you, they will say; I cannot remember that I told anything but Mr. J. Sneath; I do not know your private address myself now; I know it would not do to ask Baker, for he would soon say she may do without it, and would say, as leave as look at me, I had a husband; don't say anything to any one; I have not told any one but you about it.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at 61, Guild<lb/>ford-street, Russell-square—I was well acquainted with Mrs. Maria Soames, who died in October, 1856—I had attended her husband—I think he died about a year and a half before that—I had never attended Mrs. Soames herself—I had been in the habit of seeing her occasionally—I always thought her a very healthy person—she was of a very cheerful disposition—on Friday, 17th October, I was, for the first time, called in to attend her—I think it was somewhere about the after part of the day when I first saw her—I found her suffering from great sickness and pains in the stomach and bowels, and a good deal of spasm generally about the limbs, and great rest<lb/>lessness—to the best of my belief, I saw her vomit—I learned that there had been a great deal of vomiting prior to my arrival, and a great deal of purging as well—she looked very dejected—she complained particularly of sickness—in consequence of the state in which I found her, I made inquiries as to what she had taken that would be likely to produce such symptoms—Mrs. Soames told me something—I believe the prisoner was present at the time—I feel confident that she was—Mrs. Soames said that she had taken some pork pie, and that was all that she recollected taking lately, which she supposed might have disagreed with her—I thought the prisoner seemed very kind and very anxious about her condition, as any other friend, as I supposed her to be—she said she was sure the pork pie was very good, and, I believe, she brought it to show me—I feel confident that she did—I administered a mixture of aromatic confection and Batley's sedative, which is a mild preparation of opium—I sent that to Mrs. Soames, I believe, im<lb/>ediately after I saw her—it was a very short distance from my house—it was done immediately, as she was so seriously ill—I saw one of the daughters when I first saw Mrs. Soames—I do not recollect giving any directions, before I left the house, with regard to the administration of the medicine; as to who was to administer it—I do not recollect saying any<lb/>thing to the prisoner about it—I feel sure that I saw Mrs. Soames again before I went to bed on the Friday night—as she was so near my house and suffering so much I am quite convinced I must have seen a person in that state before going to bed—she was no better at all when I next saw her, and I increased the strength of the first medicine, the aromatic confection—during one of my visits to Mrs. Soames, on the Friday, I believe, something was stated to me about a man in an omnibus, and Mrs. Soames—to the best of my belief, that statement was made by the prisoner—I saw one of the daughters, besides the prisoner, when I called on Mrs. Soames—I do not think I saw any one else in her room—to the best of my belief, the state<lb/>ment that the prisoner made to me was this: that Mrs. Soames was in trouble; that she had anxiety and trouble relative to some intimacy that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220094"/>
               <p>she had made with this person in an omnibus—I do not remember that any<lb/>thing more was said—I felt surprised at it—I do not recollect whether, at any time when I was visiting Mrs. Soames, anything was said to me about her having taken anything—I was called to her again on the Saturday morning, the day she died, at an early hour—I believe it must have been before 6 in the morning—she was still alive, but very ill indeed; as ill as she well could be—I think I must have stayed there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, very likely—she was still alive when I left her; but, I thought, near her end—she died very soon after—when I first went there, on the Friday, I found her with certain pains, and there had been vomiting and purging—I believe the purging continued nearly up to her death—there was no cessation of bad symptoms.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was it that she complained of pains about the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> More especially about the stomach and bowels; that was all—that was the particular seat of her pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any application made to you after her death, for a certificate with regard to her death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so; there must have been—to the best of my belief I refused it—I was examined as a witness at the inquest—I made a post mortem examination—I have no note now of the appearances which the body presented—to the best of my recollection, the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels was inflamed—I do not recollect that there was any disease in any organ of the body, the head, or lungs; I attributed the death, at that time, to inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels—the effect of the administration of such medicine as I prescribed, in a case of choleraic diarrhoea, should have been to relieve pain and stop purging—I attributed the death to natural causes, at the time—I had seen the prisoner in the same house, some weeks prior to the death of Mrs. Soames; that was at the time that a person of the name of Dixon was residing in the house—I attended him as a patient; he died there—his illness was in June, and Mrs. Soames' in the October follow<lb/>ing—he died in June—at the time I was attending him I had some conver<lb/>sation with the prisoner, with regard to the administration of some particular medicine—that medicine was colchicum—the prisoner said that he had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatics, and I, in answer to that, said that I considered colchicum a very dangerous remedy, and that it should not be administered except under the direction of proper attendance—she said she was aware of that; she understood that—I do not recollect anything more passing upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say how she understood it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you, as a medical man, know whether colchicum would produce vomiting, retching, purging, and pain in the chest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I feel perfectly convinced that over doses of colchicum would do so—it would produce purging, sickness, pains in the chest and bowels, stomach and bowels, I should say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by the chest, first you say chest, and then bowels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say the stomach and bowels, generally over those parts—such effects would certainly not result from taking the medicine which I sent to Mrs. Soames—if anything unwholesome had been taken in the pork-pie, I should have expected it would produce in many persons purging, diarrhoea, and sickness—in some persons of weak constitution, I should say that would continue for a considerable time—the effect of purging on the unwholesome food in the stomach, would be, that the unwholesome food would be brought away—I do not think the pork-pie would kill—if the illness had arisen from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220095"/>
               <p>unwholesome food, I should have expected that my remedy would have cased her pain and quieted the sickness, and she would have got better—I cer<lb/>tainly thought that the inflammation of the bowels, which I discovered in the body, was produced from something that she had eaten, and I certainly, at the time, thought that perhaps the pork-pie might have disagreed with her; but I was very much surprised that the remedies did not have the effect which is usual in such cases, that they seemed to fail—I did not think that such unwholesome food would have killed my patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you still think that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—assuming poison to be out of the question, I could not suggest any cause of death—I really thought at the time that her illness was brought about perhaps by her taking cold and eating indigestible food; never baring known her ill before, I quite made up my mind she would soom get better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you, as a medical man, know whether a vegetable irritant poison taken into the stomach, would have produced all these appearances which you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should certainly say that a strong dose of a vegetable irritant poison would produce those appearances—I feel quite sure that doses sufficient to cause death might be administered in such a mixture as brandy and water, or brandy and egg, or in a medicine, without being discovered by the patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Such as colohicum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that has not a strong taste, I should say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Batleys sedative some taste? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think a sufficient quantity of colchicum might be administered in that, to be inju<lb/>rious to life, without it being detected by the person taking it—I was present when the body was exhumed in the summer of this year, I think about two months since—Sergeant White was with me—I think it was on 9th June—I removed portions of the body; those portions were placed in jars, and I sent them to Dr. Taylor—they were placed in jars, partly by myself, and partly by my assistant—the body was in a complete state of decomposition—supposing death had happened from an irritant vegetable poison, I should say that there would be no marks discoverable about the body, in that stage of decomposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understood you to say that you attended Mrs. Soames three times on Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the first time was between 11 and 12 o'clock, I believe—it was about the middle of the day—my second visit was, I think, just before I went to bed, I suppose about 10 o'clock; and my third visit was just before her death—to the best of my recollection, it was soon after 4 in the morning that they called me—when I paid my first visit, to the best of my belief, I saw Mrs. Soames' daughters there—I do not know Mrs. Hawkeshead; I do not recollect seeing her after the death; I have no recollection of seeing any one but the daughters and the prisoner, in attend<lb/>ance on Mrs. Soames—I thought the prisoner appeared very anxious indeed in attending to her—I do not recollect that Mrs. Soames, in my presence, objected to anything that the prisoner was doing—I believe I was fetched to attend Mrs. Soames by her daughter, Mrs. Naacke—I found she had suffered from vomiting and purging, and pain in the stomach and bowels—my opinion then was, that it was an attack of choleraic diarrhoea—I have stated that before—it was then that I administered to her a medicine com<lb/>posed of aromatic confection with Batley's sedative—that is the medicine which I generally administer when a person is labouring under this com<lb/>plaint—that medicine was sent immediately; there was no time lost at all—to the best of my belief, I saw her three times that day; I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220096"/>
               <p>say so before; but I have been thinking that it was to, because I was very anxious about her—I think my second visit most have been just before my dinner, at 5 o'clock—After that I increased the strength of the same medicine—I found that she was decidedly getting worse—I ordered embrocations to rub her with, and also mustard plasters—the symptoms which I observed Mrs. Soames to be labouring under, are the ordinary symp<lb/>toms of choleraic diarrhoea—she was a good-sized person, not very much one way or the other; I should call her a middle-sized woman, florid and full, and healthy—I do not know that a person of that description would be more liable than another person to bilious attacks—I could see nothing about her that would have indicated it to me—choleraic diarrhoea is frequently pre<lb/>ceded by common diarrhoea, or by what is termed bilious diarrhoea—chole<lb/>raic diarrhoea is, I think, commonly understood a English cholera; I think you might so denominate it—if a person was attacked in the night morning by bilious diarrhoea, I should say that English cholera might supervene upon it the same day—it is not customary for a person so attacked with English cholera, to die within forty-eight or fifty hours of the attack; I have not known a case of it—it has not come under my observation—I think a weak constitutioned person might die within forty-eight or fifty hours of such an attack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not known as a medical fact that persona of strong constitutions are attacked with English cholera, and die within forty-eight or fifty hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of anything of the sort coming under my obser<lb/>vation—I have not heard of it—I do not recollect reading of it—in the year 1854, I believe there were numerous instances of death from cholera in this City within forty-eight or fifty hours, I mean from Asiatic cholera—I keep a book in which I enter the names of the patients I attend—I have not got it with me—I can produce it within a quarter of an hour—I had it in Court all day yesterday, and it is now locked up, in the neighbourhood—I did not enter the nature of the medicine which I sent to Mrs. Soames—I do not always do that—I enter the visit; but my prescriptions are in a private prescription book, which I have in my pocket now—it is my private book, written for myself—if I chose to make an alteration in the prescription, I can do so—I have not any book in which I entered these special medicines; this is a sort of private pharmacopceia—it is a very ordinary course for gentleman in my profession to keep private formulas, and generally to give that medi<lb/>cine; it saves a great deal of trouble and writing—the aromatic confection and Batley's sedative is not what in ordinary language is called a plain chalk mixture—I should not call it so—I believe it is frequently called a prepared chalk mixture—in chemist's shops, if you ask for chalk mixture, they will give you chalk mixture with some aromatic confection in it—what is called a prepared chalk mixture does not contain Batley's preparation of opium—this was kept mixed; it is what I call my carminative or cordial mixture—it would be understood to be the ordinary chalk mixture, with aromatic con<lb/>fection; it is in everyday use—if you ask for the ordinary chalk mixture, it is the chalk mixture of the pharmacopceia; mine is not that; mine is my own private formula, which is an improved condition of the medicine; an addition to the chalk mixture—I am speaking from recollection when I say that I gave the deceased this particular medicine—I have no note—I have said that I gave her a prepared chalk mixture, because that is what I call my chalk and aromatic confection mixed—when I increased the strength of the medicine, I did it by increasing Batley's sedative and the aromatic con<lb/>fection—Mrs. Soames was in a very weak state when I saw her—when a</p>

               <p>person it suffering from diarrhoea, and gradually gets worse, and does not send for a medical man, at the end of twelve hours she would be much weaker and in a worse state—the deceased was very seriously ill when I first saw her, and she very gradually got weaker—I was informed that she had been ill from the morning before—in causes of severe diarrhea, tincture of opium it sometimes given instead of Batley's sedative; but it is merely given as a more economical remedy; one is very much more expensive than the other—I do not consider that it because, in preparing Batley's solution, the astringent matter of the opium is partially lost—in my practice of some<lb/>thing like thirty years, I have not found it out; I have had large hospital practice, as well as privates and I have found Batley's solution of opium answer my purpose, I may almost say, invariably—tincture of opium is used in parish practice more especially, not in private practice—the medicine which contains this opium staid certainly be administered with great care—all medicines that contain opium should be given with great care—opium is not an irritant poison—the person who takes it, or the person who administers it, must be very cautions that too much it not given in one dose—I label my medicines—although I do so, I sometimes tell my patients, as well how it is to be administered, especially if it be a medicine which requires caution in the administration of it—I may have told some one in the house to be careful how this medicine was administered, but I do not remember doing so—I saw the prisoner there—I believe I saw her at every visit—I do not recollect having any conversation with any of the inmates of the house, after the death, about tho cause of death—I can only recollect my being surprised at her dying so soon.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. OPPENHEIM</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it of your own accord, or at the suggestion of any member of the family, that you made a post mortem examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was my wish to do so—I believe the examination was made the Wednesday, 22d October; that was the day of the inquest—I made the examination with my assistant—he was, a medical gentleman—he is not with me now, I believe he is in India.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time of the post mortem examination did you make any analysis of any parts of the body, to see if it contained poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief (it is now some five or six years since), the contents of the stomach were taken out, and taken to University College Hospital—I ex<lb/>pected, if I found any poison, or anything that would satisfy me of the course of death, to find it in the stomach; and, as I think these things are much better done at an institution of that sort, it was taken there and nothing was found there to give me any satisfaction of poison being administered—I believe it was stated by me that no poison was found, or any trace of poison, more than simply common inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By no trace of poison, do you mean no trace of any drug of any kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; of any irritant poison.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>Hospital—we examined the viscera, and came to the conclusion that there was no poison or trace of poison in those portions—I did not make any notes of the examination—my evidence before the Coroner was given from recol<lb/>lection—it was given immediately after I had made the examination—the inquest took place on the Wednesday—to the best of my belief; the heart was examined—when I was examined before the Coroner, I recollected what I said—I certainly should not now so well recollect, after the lapse of six years, what symptoms were exhibited by the body, as I did then—I speak now of the inflammation of the mucous membrane, from recollection—I do not recollect stating, almost immediately after the post mortem examination, that there was nothing wrong in the mucous membrane; I might have done so—if I did say so, I then deemed myself correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After her death, or at the time you were attending Mrs. Soames, did you imagine that she was labouring under distress of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief, I did not—I had never heard of anything of the kind—I had no reason to think that she was suffering from any distress of mind—I might have stated before the Coroner that I thought there was distress of mind—it is so long ago, I do not recollect—certainly I would not say that I did not—I might have said before the Coroner that there was nothing wrong in the mucous membrane—I presume that I should not have recol<lb/>lected now—I should not deny it, if I was told that I did say so—to the best of my belief, the heart was examined—I really cannot recollect whethere I observed any symptom of diseased heart—I do not recollect giving infor<lb/>mation to any one about certifying the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a person dies of choleraic diarrhoea, would there be imflammation of the peritoneum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not see that there is any necessity for that—I don't see that that should follow—the peritoneum is one of the coverings of the stomach and bowels generally; I believe there are three; you may call it the serous membrane of the outer covering of the bowels, and the inward lining of the abdomen—I call it the third covering—I believe it is generally called the outward lining of the bowels and the inward lining of the abdomen—to the best of my belief, that is the fact; it is a scientific fact.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, and professor of medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital—I have for the last thirty years directed my attention particularly to cases of poisoning—I have studied and written on the subject—after five years' interment, I believe there would be no possibility of discovering a vegetable irritant in the body—supposing the death to have occurred on the Saturday morning, and an examination of</p>

               <p>the stomach to take place on the following Wednesday, if a vegetable poison had been taken in a flned state, and there had been violent vomiting and purging, I should not expect, even if it were easy to discover it, that there would be a trace—I have been in Court and heard the evidence which has been given in this case—violent vomiting and purging, with pain in the bowels and stomach, are symptoms of English cholera—retching is an occa<lb/>sional, but not a very common, symptom—vomiting and purging are common, and pain in the bowels and stomach, which is relieved after the act of vomiting—I have not, in my experience, known of a case of a healthy person dying of English Cholers within fifty-two hours of the commencement of the attack—I cannot call to my mind that I ever heard or read of such a case—if English cholera is induced by taking unwholesome food, then one of two things would happen: either it might, after some days, lead to death by gastritis, in<lb/>flammation of the stomach: or, the noxious matter would be speedily ejected by vomiting and purging, and the person would recover—it would lead to gas<lb/>tritis, and death after several days—the more common case is that the noxious matter in a healthy person is very speedily thrown off by vomiting and purging, and then the person would recover—that has been my experience with regard to unwholesome food—the persons have generally recovered—there has been violent purging and vomiting, and they have got well—in a case of gastritis, terminating fatally, there would not be vomiting or purging—at the moment gastritis is set up there may be slight vomiting, but those symptoms disappear when gastritis or enteritis is set up—constipation is one of the marked symptoms of gastritis, and would certainly occur before death, if death ensued from gastritis or peritonitis—in peritonitis, constipation is a marked symptom, and in gastritis also—I may mention, as a reason, that nature requires repose for recovery, and there is a want of action in all the parts, to allow the restoration of health—violent pain in the chest is not a symptom of English cholera—I have heard mentioned by Dr. Whidborne the medicine which he prescribed in this case—the effect of that medicine in a case of English cholera, if administered simply by itself, would be to act as a kind of sedative to allay the irritability of the stomach, and to lead to a cessation of the violent symptoms, supposing it depended upon natural disease—supposing a person to be suffering from natural diseass, of the character of English cholera, I should not expect to find increased severity in the symptoms, after the administration of such a medicine—I think it was a very proper medicine to administer, to allay the symptoms—an increase in the strength of that medicine would have a tendency to arrest the vomiting and purging—I have not known a case of death taking place, from natural disease, under such circumstances as I have heard described—I am acquainted with the action of colchicum and other vegetable irritants—the effect of the administration of doses of colchicum, is to produce a sense of fullness and heat in the throat, and violent pain in the stomach; bursing pain it is sometimes described—that is the effect of repeated doses, or one dose—I do not mean doses in the degree in which they are medicinally given; I mean larger doses—repeated, or in one large dose, it would produce nausea in the throat, burning sensation, severe griping pain in the stomach, vomit<lb/>ing, with violent retching, and copious purging of a watery liquid—thirst is also a symptom, and great restlessness, with great depression of strength—in most cases of irritant poisoning, there is great anxiety expressed in the countenance—in such a case the symptoms would progress in severity; that is the general course—nothing relieves them—such a medicine as that men<lb/>tioned by Dr. Whidborne would, as a sedative, tend to relieve the progress</p>

               <p>of the symptoms of an irritant poison—I do not think it would suffice to relieve them; but it would have a tendency to do so—the only relief to be experienced in such a case, is by the elimination of the poison from the body—the amount of relief would depend upon the quantity of the poison that had been administered; with a small dose the medicine might do good, with a large dose it would not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You made an examination of the body, or of the viscera, of Mrs. Soames, some few weeks ago, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made an examination of the remains on 29th July last—I then made a written report—I was not instructed in any way to examine for anything—I did examine for arsenio and other poisons—I examined for every poision that I thought likely to be found after so long a period of burial—I did not find any—I can speak more positively as to mineral opinons—there was certainly no arsenic, antimony, or mercury—Asiatic cholera sometimes visits this country—the symptoms in Asiatic cholera, generally speaking, commence with uneasiness of stomach, pain, vomiting, and purging of a bilious matter, and, as the case goes on, there are some times symptoms of fever; if the case progresses in severity, there is an epidemic state, and a person may die after four, five, or six days; but, generally speaking, in ordinary English cholera, there is recovery—Asiatic cholera is so remarkably different, that no medical man could possibly mistake it—in Asiatic cholera the person has icy cold lips and hands, and the fingers and toes are bluish—the breath is cold as it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220102"/>
               <p>issues from the body—there is only a half state of consciousness, and the discharge by vomiting and purging is a sort of whitish fluid, like rice-water—it is impossible to mistake it for English cholera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after a person is attacked by Asiatic cholera, do these symptoms exhibit themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the case of a friend of mine, who died from it, they came on in seven or eight hours; he was dead in about nine hours, from a state of perfect health—the cases of cholera which occurred in this metropolis in 1854 and 1855, were a carious mixture—there was a com<lb/>bination of the Asiatic form of the disease with the ordinary English cholera, in which the English cholera appeared to be rendered much more malignant than usual; in the beginning of the attack the evacuations were paler, and then they gradually became like the evacuations in the malignant Asiatic form—a medical man is at once informed of it, by its being epidemic<lb/>vomiting, purging, retching, thirst, pain in the bowels and stomach, would be the symptoms of English cholera—they would also be the symptoms of the combined form of cholera—it would commence in that form—the disease is epidemic when it is so severe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not instances occurring monthly in the registrar's reports, of such deaths, when the disease was not, by medical men, thought to be epidemic, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I place no confidence in them—many of those cases thus registered, I have found to be cases of poisoning—I know there are such cases registered, but they are not carefully done; they are not carefully recorded—I have in my mind at least six cases which have been registered as death from cholera, which have been from poison—when cholera is not epidemic, and where death is registered as death from cholera, I should immediately suspect poisoning—I would not say that my general belief would be that the death resulted from poison—I should require an analysis before I gave an opinion; but, at least in eight cases which I know have been registered as death from cholera, upon exhuming the bodies they have turned out to be from irritant poison; therefore, I say, I place no confidence in these isolated cases thus reported—when a person is attacked with combined or English cholera, it is not usual for them to suffer pain up to the moment of death—there are long intermissions—if death results from the administration of vegetable poison, the patient generally suffers from pain until the time of death—that is generally the result of vegetable irritant poison, if it is not expelled from the body—if the poison had been absorbed into the blood, it is not probable that the person, although of a healthy constitution, would get better—the poison might enter the blood in from half an hour to an hour, or even a shorter time than that according to the state of the stomach—if poison be eliminated from the body, no traces of it are found in a post mortem examination—if absorbed into the blood, it would depend upon the nature of the poison whether traces of it would be found upon a post mortem examination—the poison suggested to me, colchicum, would not—I believe it never has been found in the blood—I have said that a person suffering from the disease, the symptoms of which would induce a doctor to believe was cholera, and taking the medicine which Dr. Whidborne gave, I should expect to be relieved—there are certainly some cases which are not readily treated by medicine; but the general principle is, that medicine of that kind administered in ordinary cholera gives relief—I have heard of cases of cholera in which, although medicine be administered, relief did not ensue—it is the case in epidemic cholera, that, although persons take the proper remedies, they do not get better, but continue to get worse—that is a fact in all cases of disease—there are some diseases that do not yield to remedies—I have known persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220103"/>
               <p>who have taken irritant poison, complain of pain in the chest—I think it in often referable to the action of the poison on the throat in swallowing—a burning sensation in the gullet has been one of the symptoms—if a person, suffering under cholera, vomits severely, and continues vomiting for two days, that might bring on pain in the chest; but I gather, that pain in the chest was an early symptom in this case—in oases that I have seen, or am ac<lb/>quainted with, I have generally referred it to the action of the poison on the throat—it might be muscular pain, resulting from the constant vomiting—I have not attended many persons for cholera—I have not practised for some years; but I have seen many such cases—for many years I have confined my professional practice to the subject of poisoning, to jurisprudential matters—the experiments I have made have chiefly been on dead bodies—I have, within the last few years, been called in to attend cases of poisoning by arsenic, and opium, and cases of that description—I have not seen many cases of cholera since I have ceased to practice—I have only occasionally practised within the last fifteen years or so—I have within that period been often called in to attend living persons who have been poisoned; I can't say in how many cases, they have been chiefly cases of poisoning by arsenic, and cases of suspected poisoning, chiefly by arsenic, and opium—I have not, within the last fifteen years been called upon to attend a person who had taken colchicum—a person may die from having partaken of diseased food, with all the symptoms exhibited by a person who had taken poison—it may produce the effect of irritant poison; in fact, it is an irritant poison—in such a case, I would not say that all the characteristics of poison would be exhibited—the principal characteristics would be exhibited; vomiting purging, and pain—death has taken place from the administration of one dose of colchicum in as early as seven hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do the symptoms exhibited by a person who has taken poison, show themselves very shortly after the poison has been taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends upon the nature of the poison—colchicum has shown its action in from a few minutes to half an hour, or an hour—if colchicum be eliminated from the body, it might be contained in the early part of the vomiting; that which is first thrown off—it would depend upon whether or not it got into the blood; if it got into the blood none would be found in the vomit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If colchicum had been taken, and all the symptoms were exhibited by the person who took it, which you have heard detailed here, could any tract whatever of the colchicum be found in the body on the Wednesday after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Taking what I have heard of the incessant vomiting, retching, and purging, and assuming that it was taken in a fluid state, if taken at all, I do not believe any trace would have remained, even if the body had been examined at the time of death, or soon after—I believe, from the retching, that the stomach was quite cleared out of everything—colchicum, in destroy<lb/>ing life in the same doses, has, in the case of persons taking it at the same time, left in one case a reddish appearance of the bowels, and in the other case no appearance at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have, in answer to my learned friend, spoken of a combined form of cholera, in which certain symptoms are similar to those of what is commonly called English cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it commences in that Way—before that combined form assumes a fatal character, there is a change in the symptoms; the evacuations, instead of being bilious, become wholly altered in character, and it ultimately assumes the form of malignant cholera—in the case of a person suffering from English cholera, when sedative medicines are administered, there are intermissions of pain—assuming that</p>

               <p>some irritant matter had been swallowed, I should attribute it to an effect upon the throat—supposing diseased food had been eaten, such medicines as those that have been spoken of, would not have effect until the diseased matter had been thrown off—if death resulted from the diseased matter, I should expect to find some of that diseased matter in the subject, in severe gastritis, and inflamation of the stomach and bowels—if the matter is not thrown off from the body, it produces severe inflammation, and death in consequence—if diseased food was such as to act as an irritant poison, and cause death, I should expect to find similar symptoms in the persons who shared that food.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a vegetable irritant poison, such as colchicum, produce the same, and as speedy effect, if administered in solid food, as it would when administered in a fluid state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not more speedily when given in a fluid state, and upon an empty stomach—if there was food in the stomach it might delay its operation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at 40, Sidney-street, Brompton—in April, 1856, I came up from Boston with the prisoner, as her servant—I west with her when she took her lodging at Mrs. Soames'—that was in November—at that time there was a person named James Dixon living with her—before Christmas, 1855, I remember that she was short of money—I took and pawned her watch, and several things for her; some of her dresses and rings—that was before Christmas, and after Christmas I did somethig of the same kind once or twice—she said she had been robbed, and on Christmas-eve she got me to go down and ask Mrs. Soames in the morning if she would lend her a sovereign—she said she could not, she would lend her half-a-sovereign, and she gave the half-sovereign to me, and I gave it to the prisoner—she did not tell me how much she had been robbed of—I remember going to Blakey's, in Argyll-square; it is a private boarding-house—I left the prisoner, and got the situation there as servant—I went there on 18th February, 1856—before that the prisoner sent me to Blakey's about a loan—she told me to ask Mr. Blakey to be security for a loan for her—I did ask him, and he said he would not—she said she would ask Mrs. Soames to be her other security—I called on her before Mr. Dixon died—I went in to see her—that was in May—I saw her, and had my tea there—I stopped there some time—it was rather late in the evening when I left—when I was going out, I said, "You have got your apartments very nicely furnished," and she said, "Yes; I got a loan, and Mrs. Soames was one of the securities"—she told me that as I left the door—I did ob<lb/>serve they were nicely furnished.</p>

I am a contractor, and have works at Plaistow, and also at Harrow—the distance from one place to another is sixteen or seven<lb/>teen miles—the prisoner has been in my employment since January—on Wednesday, 3d September, I was at Harrow, when he arrived with the cart, and two horses, about 2 or half-past—a totally filled nose-bag each horse would be as much as they could consume in the whole journey there and back—the men were invariably told on all occasions to take a day's supply only, so as not to have anything to take home at night—a sufficient supply is one totally filled nose-bag for each hone—I find they cannot consume more with other men—it is impossible that the prisoner's horses could have consumed two nose-bags full, a sack and part of another sack full, and a trust of hay, before they arrived at Harrow—I spoke to him when he arrived; but not on the question of forage—he then had two nose-bags not a third full—on the Friday he arrived at Harrow between 2 and 3 o'clock—I should say each bag was then rather more than half full, and there might have been a double handful in one sack, but not sufficient to call any—I should say that the sack had not been cleanly shook out, there was just a little in the corner—I asked him if he had brought any forage for the horses stationed at Harrow, on Wednesday—he said, "No, I was not told to bring any"—I said, "Well, that is rather stupid; you are sure you did not bring more down on Wed<lb/>nesday than you wanted, and you did not bring any to-day?—he said, "No, I only brought the allowance "—I said, "No, you have none to spare"—he said, "No," and left—after his return, I made special inquiry as to what he had started with—it is simply impossible that the quantity taken on Wednesday could have been consumed by the horses on their journey to Harrow—I then went to Tower-street, and got the assistance of a detective, and gave the prisoner in custody—I repeated the whole of the conversation I have now given, and asked the prisoner whether he had taken any forage back to the stables on the Wednesday evening—he replied "No"—I asked him whether he took any forage back with him on the Friday—he replied, "No"—I asked him again, and he said that he had a little left in the bottom of the bag; it might be a double handful—I said, "Had you any hay, or</p>

               <p>any clover?"—he said, "No"—I called an officer, and gave him in custody—the prisoner said to me, in the presence of the constable, that if I would forgive him it should not occur again—he pleaded hard for forgiveness, and said that it should not occur again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any horsekeeper, or person who has control of the fodder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one specially appointed for the purpose; the carmen take it from the chaff-cutter, and put it in the bin—it is given out to one man who cuts it up, and it is placed in the bin—he is not here—that quantity of corn is calculated to last a certain time—it is accessible to all the men, and they help themselves just as they like—I have told the prisoner expressly that he was to take out a nose-bag full for a day—my standard is a well filled nose-bag—there is a great deal of difference; if a nose-bag is well filled it will hold considerably more—I gave the prisoner no particular orders on this occasion—I told him about the time he came into my employ to take a well filled nose-bag for each horse—I do not remember saying that to him, but it is my invariable practice with a new man—if I said before that each nose-bag was fall when he arrived at Harrow I stated what I did not mean; there was very nearly half as much more on Friday as there was on Wednesday, and on the Friday there was a little in the sack besides—I should think he would feed the horses twice coming, and twice going back—I should allow fifteen hours there and back, but he was much longer than he ought to have been—I did not say so to him, because he had the work to do in the day—I do not know what time he started—I have no foreman during the night, there was one at 6 o'clock or a quarter to 6, but the men have their orders—he simply delivered his load at Harrow, turned round, and went back again; they go back wonderfully quick in proportion to what they come—the horses know the road better, and they have no forage to take—I was within a few yards of the cart wheel when I asked him what he had brought—the two watchmen should both be on duty at Plaistow when he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What proportion does a sack bear to a nose-bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hardly four to one—a sack would not tightly fill four nose-bags—over and above the nose-bags a man might take a double armfull of hay, and that would be consumed—this would not be more than was required, unless they had the note-bags full.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grove-street-hill, Deptford—the prisoner is my father—I recollect a quarrel between my father and mother on Sunday, between 11 and 12 o'clock—while I was in my own room, I heard my mother say that she would rip my father's b—y guts open, and my father said the same—my father said it first—after I heard it, I went into my mother's room—she was bleeding from the back part of the head—the prisoner was there, and my mother repeated the expression that she would rip his b—y guts open—she had only a knife in her hand—she said that my father <hi rend="italic">heft</hi> the shell at her—my father was there then, washing himself—I washed my mother's head; she was bleeding a good bit—I did not send for any medical man—a surgeon was not sent for till the day she was dying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Rotherhithe—on Monday, 11th August, I was called to a house in Grove-street, Deptford—I saw a female there who gave the name of Shirtliffe—she was in bed, and in a dying state—she had several tumours on the head, and one of them, on the top, at the right side, was gathering—she was almost pulseless—she died on the day I saw her—I made a post mortem examination on 14th August, by the Coroner's order—her right leg, knee, and thigh, were very much swollen, and on the inside of that knee was a small contused wound—there was also a contusion on the left side of the chest—I found on the head the suppurating tumour I before alluded to—on removing the soalp, I found, on the part of the head corresponding with the suppurating tumour, a part of the skull, of the since of a broad bean, punctured in, and the membranes of the brain, corresponding to that part, were commencing to inflame—on raising the dura mater, I found a deposit of coagulable lymph—the wound on the head was such a one as might be produced by a shell like this—my opinion is, that she died from a secondary cause, arising from the suppur<lb/>ating wound—the skull was fractured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the proximate cause of death the absorption of pus into the circulation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she had suppurating tumours over various parts of her head—one was suppurating at the time—I have heard the testimony of her daughter—the purilent matter was absorbed into the system, thereby vitiating the quality of the blood, or, in plain English, poisoning it—if I had never heard anything about blows or violence, that alone would have satisfied me of the cause of death—the absorption of purilent matter into the blood was quite sufficient to have killed a down people—I was assisted by another medical gentleman—he is not here—the blood throughout the system was so poisoned that I found evidences of it in the legs, thighs, and joints—I have no knowledge of having seen her before—the skull was depressed, but not sufficient to cause pressure on the brain; the outer table was fractured, and the inner one indented—they were both fractured—it was the right parietal bone—the general result of indentation of the skull is pressure on the brain; the result of which would be a state of coma, and the person would be in a semi-unconscious state—I found her in that state, but not from that cause; coma would have set up at first—I have heard of cases in which indentation of the skull took place without showing symptoms for fifteen days; I do not mean without any consti<lb/>tutional disturbance for fifteen days—if I had not heard of the quarrel, and the shell, I should have said that the violence had been done a week or two, from the appearances—there was a deposit of pus in the leg and knee, but that was probably the result of the absorption of pus from the tumours—I have known the prisoner many years—he is in the employment of one of the public dock companies—I have heard a favourable character of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the skull was fractured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—in my opinion, the fracture of the skull was the primary, but not the sole, cause of death—it was the primary cause of that which produced death, and it pro<lb/>ceeded from the separation of the bone, which caused the absorption of the pus—my opinion is, that the fracture of the skull did contribute to the woman's death.</p>

I am a detective belonging to the Dockyard—on Monday, 1st September, I was on duty about a quarter to 2 o'clock near the gates in plain clothes—it was the day the Queen was embarking"—there was a crowd round the gates—I saw the three prisoners come from the direction of Charlton towards Woolwich—Jones went alongside of a female</p>

               <p>and put his hand by the side of her dress, covered by the other two prisoners—Cain was in front of her, and Shaw was behind Jones—Jones then moved and came down towards Woolwich—when they got to the corner, opposite the' Dockyard, Jones again put his hand in a female's pocket covered by the other two, who were standing behind him—a cart passed, they were obliged to fell back, and I saw Jones' hand distinctly come out of the female's pocket—directly the cart had passed the crowd formed to the right again, and I saw his hand again go into the same pocket—I watched them two hours and three quarters, continually going to and fro—Jones attempted several other pockets, and I believe Cain did too, but I do not know—they were in a position that they must have seen what Jones was doing—just at the time the Queen's carnage was entering the Dockyard I saw Jones go up to the prosecutriz, the other two being behind him—there was then a little rush, and I distinctly saw Jones open hand go into the prosecutrix's pocket, and two seconds afterwards I saw it come out closed—he then immediately left the prosecutrix and went into a public-house opposite the Dockyard, close to where they were standing—I made inquiries of the prosecutrix, and in con<lb/>sequence of what she said I stood at the door of the public-house—Jones came out, pretending to do something to his trowsers—he crossed the road to the other two, and then, seeing me, they separated—he had then got his hand at the side of a lady's pocket—I got assistance and took them in cus<lb/>tody—I took Cain, and told her that it was for picking pockets—she said, "Do not handle me"—I took them into the yard, and they wanted to know what they were charged with—I said "Picking pockets"—I went into the back-yard of the public-house, got a light, and found a purse down the water-closet—the prosecutrix identified it in the prisoners' presence, who denied all knowledge of it, and of one another—I searched Jones, and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a half-crown, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, on Shaw one sovereign, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a duplicate, and a pair of spectacles; and on Cain 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hill-house, Foreat-hill, Lewiabara—on Tuseday morning, 2d September, about half-past 7, I was at my second-floor window, my bedroom, and saw the prisoner in the road loitering about, looking at my windows—he moved out of my sight for a few minutes—about ten minutes afterwards I went down stairs, and found the dining-room door open, which leads from the dining-room into the hall, and the prisoner in the room, very near the window-cill—when he saw me he jumped out of the window into my garden, and from there into a neighbour's garden—I ran after his—by the time I got out he had got into the road—I called out, "Stop thief"—he ran nearly a mile, I should think, altogether—he was stopped—when I came up, I said, "You are the man that has been in my house"—I recognised him at once—he said that I was very ungrateful; that he was running after the fellow that I was running after—he was brought back—he came very reluctantly, and bolted off once, but we caught him again—I met a constable, and gave him in charge—when I got back I missed from my dining-room a plated tea-spoon, two forks, a pair of silver sugar tongs, and a salt-spoon—they had been on the breakfast table—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I can swear positively to them—I next saw them in the police-court, about a week afterwards—they were produced there by the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sebastian Garrard, of Colebrook<lb/>lodge, in the parish of Wandsworth—on Monday, 25th August, there were forty sheep in a field adjoining Mr. Garrard's premises—I saw them correct at 8 o'clock in the evening—I then locked the gate of the field with a pad<lb/>lock, and took away the key in my pocket—there is a lane separating that field from Mr. Garrard's house and grounds, running up from Putney-heath, and joining the main road at the corner of Mr. Garrard's grounds—that main road runs from Kingston, through Wandsworth, in the direction of London—when you get through Wandsworth you turn to the left, and go down to Battersea-bridge; that would be two miles or two and a half—on Tuesday morning I missed eight of the sheep—the padlock had been forced open by an instrument—the sheep were marked with my master's brand; a round black, spot on the left hip—I have since been shown eight skins by Inspector Drake—I identified them—two of them were very plain; they had a portion of the mark left, but six out of the eight were partly gone from decomposi<lb/>tion—I spoke positively to the two—the other six had the mark partly left—the mark was in the same place and apparently of the same description—the wool was the same class of wool, the same shearing, the same length, and corresponded in every respect—I believe them to be the skins of the eight sheep that were lost that night.</p>

On 10th September, I went to the premises occupied by Heath's father, in Radnor-gardens—I had before that been looking about to discover the parties—in the course of that morning I probed the garden with an auger; in the course of my search I turned up eight sheep skins, they were buried about four feet under the ground—those skins were shown to Pepper, Mr. Garrard's servant—the entrails and offal were also buried there—on two of the skins the marks were visible, it was kind of round mark on the left rump; the others were too far gone to distinguish—on 31st August, I apprehended Sandeford—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing eight sheep—I did not say where from—he took an oath, and said, "I was not out of Chelsea during the whole of Monday night"—I had told him when they were stolen—he said he was along with Oliver, the walking man, at Alexander's water<lb/>side public-house, till 8 o'clock—on 31st, about half-past 12 o'clock, I apprehended Withers—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing eight sheep—he said he had not seen any sheep; that he had bought a pig of Mr. Brewer of Radford-gardens; that Heath was with him, and they bought it between them.</p>

I am station-master at the Clapham Station—on Friday evening, 28th August, I received information, took a cab, and went to the bridge—I saw the stones, but had not time to take them off before the train passed—it was a fast train—I heard it pass, but did not see it, as I was then going round—I saw the four prisoners on the bridge—I had a porter with me—I put him on the eastern end of the bridge—I directed the cabman to pull up, stepped out of the cab, and stopped all four of the prisoners—the two boys, who have been examined, were close by—I said "I want to know who put those stones on the rail; I will give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to any<lb/>body that will tell me," putting my hand in my pocket—they each said, "It is not me"—I said, "If it costs 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we will find out who did it"—I</p>

               <p>went down to see whether the rails had been damaged, and when I returned the prisoners were quarrelling among themselves, and Simmonds, turning to Cook, said, "I do not choose to be locked up for you; you put the stones on the rail; I shall not be locked up for you"—Cook immediately denied it—I said, "We will go to the police-station and settle the matter there"—I had them all put into the cab, and charged them at the Wandsworth station—there was a great quantity of broken stones on the rail, which was covered with the dust of the crushed flints, which I directed to be picked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Goswell-road, and am a widow—about 20th August, I put an advertisement in the newspapers, being in want of a situa<lb/>tion as housekeeper—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post, in answer, in consequence of which, I afterwards saw the prisoner at my house; and he gave the name of Thomas Harland—he made a reference to the letter that had been sent. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "London, 21st August, 1862. Madam, in answer to your's of to-day, I beg to say I will call on you to-morrow after<lb/>noon, from 4 to 6 o'clock.

               <p>but I was not at home, and he then called in the evening—he stated that he was keeper of an hotel in the Isle of Wight, which he had taken six weeks before, and that the people who were leaving the house were still keeping it for him till he could go to it, but that he had paid the whole of the money for it—I do not remember what he said as to whereabouts it was in the Isle of Wight—he said he wanted a housekeeper to go down to the hotel in a fortnight's time—I had several interviews with him—it was arranged at the first interview that I was to be his housekeeper—he called on 27th August, and stated that he had wine and spirits in bond at the docks, which he must have out on that day; that he had come away from home with only 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket; that his solicitor was on circuit, it being Assise time, or he could have got plenty from him; and that he wanted 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not so much by me—I got and gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he stated that the wine must be got out that day, or he should have some trouble about it—he said it was to be sent to the hotel, which he had spoken of, in the Isle of Wight—he called again next day, and promised to call again on the following day—I did not see him afterwards, until at the Southwark police-court—I was induced to part with my money to him under the firm conviction that he was what he represented himself to be.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman—about 10th or 11th July last I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> for a situation as useful companion, com<lb/>panion and housekeeper, or housekeeper, to an elderly lady or gentleman—I received several replies by letter, one of which was from the prisoner—he after<lb/>wards called on me, and alluded to the letter which he had sent—he gave the name of James Harding, and said that he had taken an hotel in the Isle of Wight, at Wootton, and had been in possession of it three months previous to that; that he had taken lease, stock, and fixtures, and everything, just as they stood—the writing on this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—that was done some time after the interview—this little memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I made at the time, directly the prisoner left the room—(<hi rend="italic">Reading:</hi> "Wootton, five miles this side of Newport; ten servants; make up eighteen beds, private family hotel")—we had several interviews—he engaged me at the second as housekeeper to the hotel, at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—on 21st July, he called on me in the morning in a very great flurry, and said, "Oh dear, I don't know what I shall do, for my lawyer is gone on circuit, and I forgot to ask him for some money before he went; have you any you can lend me?"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220137"/>
               <p>I said, "Well, I am very short indeed of money; I really have not"—he said, "Oh! well, I will go down to his private residence, and see if he has gone"—about a couple of hours afterwards, he came back to me and said, "O dear, I find I was too late; can you lend me seventeen shillings"—I said, "I have not seventeen shillings," but I put a sovereign down on the table, which he took up and put in his pocket, saying, "I will return it either this evening or in the morning"—the next morning he called on me, and said, "I sent to my wife, but I have not got an answer; can you lend me another seven shillings?"—I said, "I told you yesterday I was very short of money, and I most certainly have it back to night, or in the morning I have not seven shillings;" but I had two five shilling pieces in my pocket; I held them out in my hand and said, "Have you got three shillings?"—he took them out of my hand, and put them in his pocket, saying, "You shall be certain to have this with the sovereign to-night or to<lb/>morrow morning"—the next morning he called on me and said, "I have not brought your money, but you shall certainly have it this evening; I will call about 6 o'clock, and leave it you"—I never saw him again until he was arrested—I gave him in charge—I had two policemen with me at the time—I put another advertisement in the paper, and called at the library where I had them addressed to me; amongst the answers was one from the prisoner; I knew the handwriting—I answered it in a feigned hand, and in another name, addressing it from a friend's house, 46, Dover-road—the prisoner answered it, appointing a time to see me at 2 o'clock on a Thursday—I had two detectives there ready, and they took him in custody—I advanced him the money because he had engaged with me as his servant at Wootton, in the Isle of Wight, and it was on no other conditions that I let him have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he give any name when he came in, before he was taken by the detective? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The letter was signed "James Carter," and he came under that name, at the time the appointment was made in that letter.</p>

I am one of the officers to the Sheriff of Surrey, and have been so for thirty years off and on—I am a servant of Mr. Seal's—I am appointed to my office by the Under Sheriff, by giving a bond of security—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bond by which I was appointed to my place—on 13th September last, I went to the Victoria Tavern, Waterloo-road, next door to the Victoria Theatre—I think it must have been as near 4 o'clock as possible, or a little after, when we got to the house—I went for the purpose of arresting Frank Towers on a warrant of capias—he was the landlord of the public-house, and I believe is now—I had known him some time—he knew me personally—I had arrested him once before, about three weeks prior—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the warrant on which I arrested him—I had it with me on this 13th September—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the writ of capias—George Walter Reeves and George Remnant were with me—they are my assistants, employed by Mr. Seal—I went in first to the front of the bar, and stood there a short time—Reeves followed me—I knocked on the counter, and called for three pennyworth of brandy—nobody came, but I saw Towers in the bar parlour, making his way towards the kitchen stairs—I immediately went round through the folding doors and saw him on the top of the stairs—I said, "Mr. Towers, I want you again"—he made some answer; "What for," I think, were his words—I said, "For a much larger amount than the last"—I took hold of him by the right arm, and he went up the steps into the parlour, and threw himself on to a chair—the female prisoner, Agnes Towers, his wife, immediately came into the room, and he requested her to fetch him a knife to stab himself, or to cut his throat—Reeves and I, and those two, were the only persons in the room then—I served Towers then with the capias and writ of summons—I served him with copies of the two writs of summons, and a copy of the capias—I showed him the two original writs and the warrant—I turned round to the other assistant</p>

               <p>for him to fetch a cab, seeing that Towers was very excited, and the moment I turned round to get to the door I heard a shuffling, and a shriek from Mrs. Towers—that was before I got to the door—I was making my way to the door—I heard a bit of a scuffle, and a shout directly—I turned round then, and saw that he had jumped out of the window—at the moment of the shriek, a regular rush came into the parlour—Mrs. Towers caught hold of my collar when I was in the act of getting to the window—when the parties came into the room, she said, "These two men are come to take Frank away again"—I should say there might have been twelve or more come into the room, but the principal among them were the three male defendants—I was caught hold of by Pierre Le Rois in the first instance, and the other two defendants rushed upon me—my coat collar was torn in two places, but nothing happened to the tails of my coat—Le Rois wrested the staff out of my hands, and asked, in his way, whether I was a policeman—I nodded to him—the door was locked at that time—I cannot say who locked it—I made every attempt to get out of the window—I was knocked down over the table, and Mrs. Towers fell once with me—we were both down together at one time—I was knocked down by the three male defendants—I then fought my way through as well as I possibly could, to get to search the house—Reeves got through out of the crowd and got out, and the door got opened somehow—I tried to force my way from them, and could not do so for two or three minutes; at last I got into the front of the bar, and there I was forcibly shoved out by Allen and Le Rois—I could have had Frank Towers very easily in the yard supposing I had not been interfered with in the manner I was; because when he jumped out he fell and lay there—I was forcibly pushed out of the house by Allen and Le Rois—I afterwards tried to get an entrance again, but could not—Alfred Towers was there with them, pushing and knocking about—he caught hold of me by the collar and held me—I went to the police-station—a young policeman came up, and he did not understand anything about it, and there was a potman as bad as the rest—I have not been able to capture Frank Towers since—he has entirely escaped for the present.</p>

               <p>believe me to be a policeman in order to give it up—I merely nodded to him, thinking he would give it up—he did not pull me off Mrs. Towers—he came and collared me—Mrs. Towers was not out of the room a second before Le Rois came in—I was examined twice before the Magistrate, and my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—there is not a quarter of my evidence in that deposition—I have not read it since; not with the attorney on the other side—I have called to my recollection everything that occurred—if a man made his escape of his own will it would depend on the circumstances at the time, who would be liable—I don't think it would make any difference if we could make out that we were overpowered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Seal, the officer of the sheriff of Surrey—I was in company with Herrick and Reeves on Saturday afternoon, 27th September, at the Victoria Tavern—I received directions from Herrick to get a cab—the first thing I heard was a scream from the female prisoner—that was after I had the direction about the cab—she seemed to be in the back parlour—after that there was a rush, and the folding-doors were closed to prevent me getting in to render assistance—I attempted to render assistance, but was prevented by the door being shut—I tried the doors and found them bolted, I suppose, inside—they were so fastened by some means inside so that I could not get in—I knew Le Rois, the Frenchman—I believe he cannot speak English, from what I heard at the police-station—I have not spoken to him at all.</p>
