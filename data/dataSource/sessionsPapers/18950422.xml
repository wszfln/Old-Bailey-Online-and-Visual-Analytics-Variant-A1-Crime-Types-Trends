                  </hi>. I am a produce broker, of 7, Mincing Lane—on 28th March, about a quarter to eight in the evening, I was in King William Street, going towards London Bridge—I was wearing a gold albert chain—at the corner of the railway arch that goes over Thames Street a man, who I had seen coming towards me for some time, bent down and took my chain and went off—I followed him, and shouted out, "Stop that man; stop thief!" as loud as I could—I was going down King William Street—some person said, "He has not gone there; he has gone down the steps"—I went down the steps—some man said, "He has gone up the other side"—I saw the man ahead of me—there was no one running in front of him—he turned up Arthur Street West—I followed him—when I got halfway up I seemed to lose him—a telegraph boy said something to me, and I followed on into King William Street, where I found the prisoner being held by the witness Murphy, and a crowd—to the best of my belief he is the man that took my chain—I seized him by the collar, as well as Murphy—some persons in the crowd said, "That is not the man you want; he is over there"—the prisoner said, "It is jolly hard lines to be taken like this; I was running after the man you saw; I did not take your watch"—a detective came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I was present when this watch chain was brought into the station; it is mine—it cost fifteen guineas.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 56, Tottenham Road, Kingsland—on the evening of March 28th, about a quarter past eight, I was going over London Bridge, and passing Fishmongers' Hall my attention was attracted by a man jumping on to the bridge from Thames Street—I looked to see what it was, and I saw the prisoner running along, and another man behind him—he ran up to the corner of Arthur Street—there was no one running in front of him, the street was clear—I did not run after him, I ran round to the other corner of the street and I caught the prisoner at the other end, just walking—I caught him by the collar, and said, "You are just the one I want"—he was out of breath—I took him over to the lamp-post in the middle of the road, and held him there for some time—the prosecutor came up afterwards—in the meantime one or two of his friends tried to get him away from me—Seborne was one of his friends, and he was given into custody, but was discharged—the prisoner is the man I saw running up Thames Street.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220009"/>
               <p>Fish Street Hill, and got to the other end of Arthur Street West, where I found the prisoner in Murphy's arms—the prosecutor, who was there, said, "I have had my chain stolen; this is the man who stole it, I believe—the prisoner said, "You have made a mistake; I was running after the man that did steal it. I was running after the thief"—when I saw the prisoner running Thames Street was comparatively empty; he ran in the carriage way—I did not see anyone in front of him, and I do not believe there was anyone in front of him—he was taken to the station; I was in plain clothes on his left and a uniform man on his right; we walked three abreast—when we got to the Police-station gates we could not pass in abreast—the uniform man stepped in front, leaving the prisoner's right hand disengaged—at the station Mr. French seemed not quite certain as to the prisoner, and another man was sent for, who failed to identify the prisoner—Maroney brought in the chain, and then the prisoner was placed in the dock, and charged again—Maroney said he had found it about ten yards north of the station door—that would be on the prisoner's right hand as he went in—it is quite possible that the prisoner could have thrown something without my noticing it as we went in at the gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said he was coming up the steps from the urinal, and that his hat was knocked off by a man who ran down the steps—there is a urinal there—he produced his hat at the station; it had some dirt on it—I did not notice if it had been dented—after French had failed to identify the prisoner, he was taken out of the dock, and then after the chain was found he was put back again—another policeman came in and said he had seen a man who had met the prisoner on the steps and made a grab at him, and that he doubled back and ran down the steps again and along Upper Thames Street followed by this man—I took that man's address, and he was brought to the Police-station—he failed to identify the man who he said knocked against him on the steps—when I first heard cries of "Stop thief!" I was coming along Lower Thames Street from the direction of Billingsgate Market towards the dry arch—I was about fifty yards from the archway—I saw a boy in Thames Street or Monument Square on the way to the station, five or six minutes after the arrest—I did not hear anyone say "You have arrested the wrong man"—there was a crowd—the boy came to the station and made a statement to the inspector on duty—I don't think anyone took down that state<lb/>ment—the boy came of his own accord to the Mansion House—I did not subpoena him to go there—I served a subpoena on him to come here by Mr. Douglas's, the chief clerk, instructions—I have spoken to him since, not with reference to this charge—he is not here as a witness for the prosecution—a number of men walked by our side to the station—the gate will admit two at a time, and I and the prisoner went in together—French and Murphy were behind us, and followed us in—they must have been immediately behind; it may have been a few yards—a large crowd followed us—it was then about 8.30, and was comparatively dark; there was no daylight, but there were electric lights on the right and left in Tower Street, and a small gas lamp at the corner.</p>

I live in Stanhope Street, Westminster—the deceased was my son—on Friday, 12th April, about eight in the evening, there was a noise in the street; there had been a noise all day—I heard a knock at the door; my wife went to the door—I went up the area steps and saw my wife standing on the pavement with a pail of water, which she threw over the boys—there were about forty or fifty of them—they had been annoying us all day; indeed, for the last eighteen months, ever since we had been in the house; it was wilful mischief, nothing more, that I could see—the water did not go near them—my wife pointed to a boy named Bellinder, and said, "He has struck me in the face"—I went and spoke to him, and said I should take proceedings against him—my son went and said to the prisoner, "Go back"—he had just been wakened out of his sleep; he was in his shirt sleeves, and had no boots on—he said, "Who struck my mother?"—the prisoner must have heard him, and he came round and said, "What would you do in it?" and my son said, "I would take the best of you"—the prisoner said, "Then that is you and me," and he pulled off his coat—my son made a rush at him, and another one, a companion of the prisoner, made an attempt to strike my son—the prisoner struck my son in the face, and he fell flat on his back—he did not get up; he was senseless—with the assistance of another man I lifted him up and carried him into the house—next morning he was not fit to get up, and I did his work for him—he was a milk carrier—a little after three he went up to bed—I afterwards went up and found him lying on the floor in a senseless condition, and he expired—he had no doctor—he would not; he said it was not necessary.</p>

               <p>Terrace—I was called to see the deceased lad on the 14th, about half-past four—he was then dead—he had recently died; he was about nineteen—I made a post-mortem—I found large extravasation of veinous blood on the right cover of the right hemisphere, which had evidently proceeded from a rupture of one of the lung veins inside the skull—my opinion was that the bleeding had been arrested for a time, and a clot had formed—there was a contused wound at the back of the head that might have been caused by a fall; that would account for the hemorrhage—the broken vein was about an inch from that part of the head—the cause of death was the hemorrhage on the brain; that might have been caused by a fall, or a severe blow on the head—I was told that he had run upstairs two steps at a time, and then fainted—that might have caused the hemorrhage to recommence—of course he ought to have been kept perfectly quiet; if he had had medical attendance there would have been a chance of recovery.</p>

I live at 4, Chigwell Road, St. George's-in-the-East—the prisoner, her husband, and two children occupied a room there, I being the landlord—they furnished the room—on the early morning of April 9th I was aroused by screams—I put on my trousers and came downstairs with a candle to the prisoner's room—I found children's wear<lb/>ing apparel and bed-clothes burning, some on the bed, and some on the ground—the prisoner's husband was there; he was trying to put it out, and I helped him—there was paraffin on the bed-clothes that were burning—I picked up the clothes on the floor, and put them in the stove, and put water on them—you could smell oil on them, and you could smell paraffin burning—the only paraffin I saw in the room was what was on the clothes—I saw a paraffin oil can on the floor, about a foot from the bed-stead—when I went into the room the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed, dressed in her day clothes; her boots were not on—I saw three chairs, as if they had been put alongside the bedstead to make it wider; they were close against the bed.</p>

On the early morning of April 9th I was called, and I found the prisoner in the room, standing by the bedside, fully dressed; the little girl and a little boy were in the bed at the time—clothing was about the floor, and there were some burnt things on the bed—the sheet the children were lying on, on the bed, was saturated with paraffin oil—the children's clothing and wearing apparel on the floor was saturated with paraffin in the same way as the sheet—the oil can was lying on its side on the floor between the bed on which the children were lying and the bed that had been made on the chairs—there was no cork or anything in it; it was quite open; there was a very small portion of oil at the bottom—there was a little paraffin oil spilt on the floor close by the side of the bed, and close by where the can would lie—I took the prisoner into custody, and told the prisoner the charge—she said, "Take me where I ought to be, and I will explain. I think it is time all my grievances were settled up. It is supposed to be me that did it. Prove that I did it, and I will be satisfied"—I saw no lamp in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred Ryder, residing at 206, Euston Road—on 18th February last I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Required immediately, a capable manageress West-end lodging-house; small security necessary.—Address S. D. Miller and Co., E.C."—I answered that, and on the following day (Tuesday) the prisoner called at my house—she told me that I was the most eligible candidate she had seen, and asked if I would come and see her at her solicitor's office, Mr. Grain—she gave her name then as Mrs. Denny; she said that was for business purposes—I went to Mr. Grain's office, and saw the clerk Collins—I asked to see Miss Denny—he said, "Oh, Miss Spong!" and he appeared to be very much excited about it—the prisoner came in im<lb/>mediately, and said, "Oh, I forgot to tell you that is my business name"—I asked her what deposit she required; she said £50 at first, but she would take £40—I said I thought that was more than requisite, and it would not be convenient for me to let her have it for a day or two—she appeared upset at that, and said she had had some people who would find it—I said I had got £10; I had not got it with me, but I would go and get it, and show that I would be very straightforward—she said she would be very pleased—I asked where the house was—she said at the West-end; that it was a good house, a large business house, and she made from six to nine guineas a week—I asked what security I should have for my money—she said, "You will have the house and furniture and everything; my health</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220028"/>
               <p>has been very bad lately, and I am going away for the benefit of my health, and when I return I intend to take the house next door and furnish it, so you will be able to have the one house, and I the other"—I said, "In case you go away how shall I secure my money?"—she said, "You will have the house and furniture entirely, and you will be able to repay yourself from the money from the lodgers"—I went home and brought the £10 to her, and I said, "I must ask you again, do you require the use of this money?"—she said, "Certainly not, I don't want to use it; but I had a housekeeper before who was dishonest"—I said, "Then you don't require to use it?"—she said, "Certainly not"—Mr. "Collins, the clerk, was there—I then said, "You are sure that the house and furniture are yours?"—she said, "Yes, I have a perfect right to sell the house to-morrow if I wished; is it not so, Mr. Collins?" and he said "Yes," and he asked Mr. Grain what he should do, and Mr. Grain said "Give Mrs. Ryder a receipt for the money"—he said, "Where will Mrs. Ryder pay the rest, here or at the house?"—I said, "Either here or at the house"—he said, "When I go to the house to make the agreement you can pay the remainder of the money then, and let Mrs. Ryder have the receipt"—Mr. Grain drew up the receipt—she said she had four Servants, and that she kept a man to valet the gentlemen, and when I came there my duties would, of course, be light, because she was going to stay with me a short time till I got thoroughly acquainted with the duties, and then she was going away for her health—on Thursday, the 21st February, I went to the house with the money in my pocket, six £5 notes—at first there was no one there but Miss Spong—she left the room and went upstairs—then Mr. Collins came to the door, and then Mr. Grain came in and sat down—I was waiting for him to speak; he looked very strange—I said, "I must ask you once more, does the house belong to Miss Spong?"—she was not there then; she was upstairs—he answered the question, and in consequence of that I had my money back—Miss Spong came down, and I said, "Miss Spong, I am surprised to hear what Mr. Collins has now told me, that the house and furniture are not yours. I think it most disgraceful, therefore I must demand my £10, and have nothing more to do with it, why was not this told me when I was at the solicitor's office? I thought everything was going to be straightforward"—Collins looked stupid; he did not say anything—he looked perfectly guilty—I said to him, "For God's sake go down and see Miss Spong, because she has something to say to you"—she said, "Well, I have got into a hole, and I must get out of it the best way I can"—only the care<lb/>taker and his wife were present, no servants—she called them Mr. and Mrs. Wilson—I would not have parted with my £10 if I had known that the house and furniture were not hers—I did not sign any agree<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am married, and reside in Euston Road with my husband—I have been accustomed to let lodgings—I have a boarding establishment of ray own—I have had one or two, one in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road, and one, a large one, in Grafton Chambers—at this time I was desirous of obtaining a position as manageress, because I had given up my boarding establishment, and I had a good deal of time on my hands; and I had children—Miss Spong called at my house—that was the first interview—she did not give me her address then as 10,</p>

               <p>Cleveland Row; she told it me either at the house or at the office—the plate and linen was not mentioned at the first interview—it was when I was asking for security for my £10—she said, "I will offer you some plate of my own," and I said, "I will take it"—she said, "Shall I offer Mrs. Ryder the plate?" and the clerk said, "Yes"—she did not tell me the plate was her own until after I had paid the £10—at the solicitor's office they said an agreement would have to be drawn up when the money was paid—the £10 was paid on the 21st—the receipt is dated the 21st—I think the money was paid that afternoon—she had told me I was to come to the office about two; then she telegraphed to ask me to come later on—there were two interviews with her that day, both at the office—I was shown the agree<lb/>ment after I had paid the 10—not till then; I am quite sure of that—I had not seen the draft copy before—Collins wan present at the first interview—on the 21st I was told it was not convenient to Mr. Grain to be there, but the clerk, Collins, was to take his place—it was at that interview that the statement was mode with regard to the furniture; I had nothing else particular to be there about—she said the furniture and the house was hers, and she might sell it to-morrow if she wished, "Why do you doubt it?"—I said, "Of course I want to know if the house and furniture belong to you"—she said, "Yes, I could dispose of it to-morrow; is it not so, Mr. Collins?" and he said, "Yes"—he did not say, "Under the right to purchase"—the plate was not mentioned then—he did not say, "I believe the linen is her own property"—I went to the office re-peatedly, and found I could not get my £10 returned, and then I said, "What security can I have?" and she said, "I will give you the plate and linen"—at the interview on the 21st no letter was drawn up, giving a charge over the plate and linen; nothing of the kind—I placed my money honourably in the solicitor's office, and when I applied for it, and could not get it, he said if I did not go out he would send for a policeman, and have me put out, and he kept Miss Spong locked up—I said I should remain there till I saw her, and he locked the door, and he and his clerk went away—I went and saw Mr. Sheridan, the proprietor of the house—I did not ascertain from him that the £10 had been paid to him; they never told me about it—I understood that part of it was to have gone to him—Mr. Grain said he would be there with Miss Spong to give me the £10, and when I went there she had absconded—Mr. Grain did not tell me then that she had gone to Brighton to get the £10—he told me so on one occa<lb/>sion—I was not dissatisfied with the house in Cleveland Row on account of its size; it was not at all suitable as a business house, only for a private office—I said to her, "I don't think you will ever make it pay, it is not suitable for a business house; you told me it was a large house and it is a small one"—she said, "Don't dishearten me"—she told me she could make a great deal of money by it—at Cleveland Row I asked Collins again whether the house and furniture belonged to Miss Spong, and he said "No," and then I said I should not pay any more money—I was shown this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the Mansion House, and I said it was not what I had seen before; it was longer—looking at it now I say it had been added to—I cannot tell what the part is that has been added, but there has been something more put on it—it looks longer—the clause is in it about my depositing the £10, and that Miss spong agrees to pay in<lb/>terest</p>

               <p>on it at 5 per cent, and that the agreement is determinable at one month's notice, and the £40 to be returnable—when I paid the £10 I had fully determined to pay the other £30—I went to the house that morning with the full intention of paying it, because I wished, of course, to accept the situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I should have paid the £30 had it not been for what Collins said at last—I am quite sure I was told that the house and fur<lb/>niture were Miss Spong's before I paid the £10.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Grain, solicitor—I think it was on 20th February that Mrs. Ryder called with Miss Spong—they dis<lb/>cussed the question of preparing an agreement—she told me what she wanted, and I took down the headings of the agreement, and said it would be ready for them by the next morning—I knew that the defendant was asking Mrs. Ryder to part with £10; that was part of my instructions—I knew nothing about the prisoner's position at that time—I believe that she had given Mr. Grain as a reference to her respectability—he told me so, and I believe it was copied into the letter-book—on the morning of the 21st Mrs. Ryder came accompanied by her daughter—Miss Spong was at the office—I was asked to give her a counterpart of the agreement, and I sent over to Shaw's, the law stationers, for the agreement—I gave her one part into her hand, and I read over the other part of it—Mrs. Ryder said it was all right, but she had not brought the money with her—no question was asked about the house and furniture on that occasion, I think that was at the first interview, on the 20th, Mrs. Ryder asked Miss Spong whether the house and furniture did belong to her, and Miss Spong replied that she had the right and the option of disposing of the lease and the furniture, and she turned to me and said, "Is it not so, Mr. Collins?" and I said, "Yes, certainly you have the right of disposing of the lease and the furniture if you like."</p>

That was true, under the option—she would hare to pay £550 first—I said she had the option of purchase—I said, "Under your agreement you have the right of purchasing, the disposal of it"—that was the answer I gave—I thought that was a truthful answer—in answer to the question I thought so—I did not know whether it was worth more than £550—the only knowledge I had was what Miss Spong told me—I had seen the agreement—I knew she could not sell till she had first bought it, and paid £550 for it—Miss Spong told me she could get £700 for it—I thought that very good security for the £40—I did not tell Mrs. Ryder the terms of the agreement—I did not know that Miss Spong had a farthing—I knew she had a small interest in a reversion, that was all I did know.</p>

I think it was on the 23rd that something was said about the plate and linen—I do not know if I saw Mrs. Ryder on three days or two days—so far as I was concerned there was only one interview on the 21st—Mrs. Ryder asked what security she would have for her money, and Miss Spong replied, "I can give you my plate and linen"—I could not say that was on the 21st—Miss Spong said to me, "Can you draw up a memorandum?"—I explained to her and Mrs. Ryder that no valid security could be given on the plate and linen, except by a bill of sale, and that she could not afford to give because of the registration, the publicity—further conversation took place, and I think I said, "Of course, if Mrs. Ryder is going to be there, in possession of the plate and furniture, you can hand them over to her on a memorandum"—I wrote out a memorandum, and read it over, and gave it to Mrs. Ryder—I have not got it; I gave notice by letter to Mrs. Ryder to produce it.</p>

I ought to say this in justice to Mr. Grain, that I asked her if I should act on her behalf as well as on Miss Spong's, and she said "No, I don't require any solicitor."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known Miss Spong about two years, or longer than that since I first knew her; I think it must be eight years ago that I sold a reversion for her—I never knew that she lived in Duke Street, Portland Place—I know she had a house in Great Russell Street, but I was never there—I don't know that she went away without paying her rent—I have not acted professionally for her on and off during that time; I believe Mr. Grain has—I did not know that after she left a cheque was returned dishonoured—I don't know where she was before she went to Great Russell Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 2, Arthur Street West, City—last year I bought the business of another solicitor who asked me to employ the prisoner to tide over the vacation, and he acted as my clerk—John Williamson was one of the clients of the business I took over—I brought an action for Williamson in the Brompton County Court against Mr. Allen for a debt—Allen paid £1 into Court, of which I had notice early in December—on 13th December the prisoner suggested he should go and get it out—he also said he had a dog license summons to attend to for Mr. Williamson, and I assented—the prisoner was to bring the £1 back to me; it was due to me on account of costs—on the 14th December I asked the prisoner for the £1, when he said Williamson was summoned for this dog license; his brother had promised to furnish the money but had failed to do it, and "the man would have been sent to prison if I had not produced your £1 to save Williamson from being arrested"—the amount was £1 8s.—the prisoner said the William<lb/>sons or Mr. Williamson had made up the 8s., and I believe he said that the money was taken at the time—Mr. and Mrs. Williamson were in my office on the 8th January; we talked about money matters, and I referred to this pound—the prisoner was called in—I said, "How is this? Mr. Williamson denies that the £1 was paid on account of his dog license," and Williamson drew from his pocket this receipt for £1 13s. 6d., and said, "I believe Harcourt only paid £1 8s., but he got more than that out of my brother, and he gave me <hi rend="italic">this</hi> receipt for £1 13s. 6d."—I pointed out to Harcourt the figures had been altered—he said he did pay £1 13s. 6d., and it was the warrant officer, Adams' receipt for that amount, and he said, "I did use your £1 towards the payment"—that receipt is dated 13th December—the body of it is in the prisoner's writing: "Paid into Court on account, £1 13s. 6d."—I do not know the writing of the signature, "Charles Adams"—I subsequently found in the prisoner's diary an entry on 13th December: "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Williamson, Gas Light Company, and dog license; see Mr. Williamson at one o'clock sharp, pay dog license, arrange as to further time for payment of gas; paid £1 8s., <hi rend="italic">Williamson v. Allen</hi> attending; obtaining £1 out of Court"—when the prisoner suggested he had given me a receipt for £1 8s. I did not re-collect his having shown it to me—I found this receipt for £1 8s. amongst his papers, which Adams says is his receipt—as this was the first offence I knew of I deducted the £1 from the prisoner's wages—Williamson went away, and the prisoner adhered to his statement that he had paid the £1—he remained in my service—I did not give him into custody till a lot of other things turned up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 59, Rowston Road, Fulham—I was fined for not taking out a dog license, £1 8s. at the West London Police-court, Hammersmith, in June of last year—I was given time to pay it—on 13th December the prisoner said if I did not pay it I should be taken up—that was at my house—the money was paid that morning—the prisoner said that with the expenses it would be rather more than £1 8s.—I gave him this cheque for thirty shillings—he said, "Have you got money?" I said, "No, but if you will come with me to my brother, he will lend me it," and I got the cheque—my brother is dead—the prisoner said, "That is not sufficient"—he wanted another two shillings—I went back to my brother, and he gave me another two shillings—the prisoner said, "Since you have been gone I find it will be £1 13s. 6d.; I want another eighteenpence"—I said, "I cannot keep going backwards and forwards to my brother"—he said, "Never mind, I will pay it myself; I will lend it to you"—he came back later in the day and handed me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">For £1 13s. 6d., purporting to be signed</hi> "Charles Adams, Warrant Officer")—the body of the receipt and the signature appear to be different hands—on the 8th January I went to Mr. Gunnell's office, and the prisoner was called in—I produced the receipt from my pocket—the prisoner said the receipt was a true one, and that he had paid it, and he denied my story that I had got the money from my brother—he said he had paid it out of the money from the County Court—I repeated that I had got the money from my brother.</p>

How do you like that?"—there were a few people about, but nobody at that spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Twining, tea merchants and bankers, 216, Strand—in December, 1893, the prisoner called on me, and said that he had the authority of the Lord Chamberlain to publish a book, showing the names of all persons authorised to serve Her Majesty and the Prince of Wales—he showed me a book similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which gives the address of the Royal and Imperial Publishing Syndicate, in Regent Street and Bucklersbury—I did not give him an order on the first occasion—I spoke to one of my principals, and Mr. Twining saw him afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first part of this book seems to be the same, but there is added matter in which the name of our firm appears—he showed it to me as a specimen, but he had a larger book—the book he showed me did not contain this portion of printed matter which hats the name of our firm printed in it—I cannot say whether a book has ever been published with a correct list of the Royal tradesmen's names—he told me the list was going to be a correct one when he had got the full information; I think he said it would take considerable time—it was to contain a list, not only of the purveyors to Her Majesty, but to the other members of the Royal Family.</p>

I am one of the firm of Twining and Co., of 216, Strand—Mr. Howicson showed me this circular, and in December, 1893, I saw somebody in reference to it who I cannot identify; we gave him a cheque and he gave us this receipt—it was understood that it would be an advertisement of all the Royal warrant holders, which was to be circulated on the Conti<lb/>nent, and in which our name was to appear, but my impression is that the book was to be a larger one—I agreed to insert an advertisement in the book, and gave him a cheque for £2 12s. 6d. made out to the Royal and Imperial Syndicate, or bearer, and he gave me this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi> "W. H.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a German; I have been six years in England—I paid the prisoner the money because I thought an advertisement under the authority of the Lord Chamberlain would do me good—he did not tell me he was engaged in the Lord Chamberlain's office, but that he came from that office—it was not that he would have to verify the information at the Lord Chamberlain's office, or that the information would have to be got from there, and from other offices—I should say that the words, "By consent of the Lord Chamberlain" were printed in this corner of the circular when I saw it—he left it with me, and several other papers—when he came the second time I knew that the book was not published—I wrote to him and asked him to come because I wanted some information about the Duchess of York—he did not tell me that the 1894 book was published; he said that it was not—he did not tell me he could not publish it because the Duke of York's appoint<lb/>ments</p>

                  </hi>. I am colour-sergeant of the 5th Battalion Royal Fusiliers—on March 18th, about 7.30, I was driving with Colour-sergeant Smith in a small pony-trap from Kingston Barrracks to Hounslow Barracks, and when near the New Inn, Ham Common, a collision occurred—two ladies were in front in the trap, and a little boy, and I was thrown out—I did not see anyone thrown out of the colliding trap—it went about 130 yards, and Colour-sergeant Smith ran after it—we exchanged names; Smith gave his name as Colour-sergeant, and, addressing me, said, "This is Colour-sergeant Sullivan"—I was perfectly sober—we went to the New Inn, and a blacksmith named Chamberlain repaired the trap—we waited about an hour and left about nine, and drove to Hounslow in about an hour—we met Hawkes and Bates, who is unwell and is not here—we took the trap home to Mr. Varley, the owner—I saw the prisoner on the Sunday; he said that it was a very sad affair, and could not we come to some arrangement—he said he was very sorry he wrote the letter; he wrote it in the heat of passion, through his wife—I said, "It is a very serious charge, but I am quite willing if you will write to, the commanding officer and apologise and withdraw the letter, and pay for the damage to our trap"—he said he was quite willing to apologise, but not to pay for the trap—he has never written the letter—on the same day Colour-sergeant Smith wrote this letter to the prisoner after I had seen him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that if every imputation was withdrawn, and a letter written to the commanding officer, a personal interview would, no doubt, satisfy all parties concerned.</hi>) I got this reply from the prisoner's wife: "In answer to yours, the matter is quite out of my hands, having written to the family solicitor to claim for injuries received.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the Magistrate said that, his wife got up off her seat, and he spoke to her and said that he would justify—Smith and I were in a small trap with nobody else in it—four people were in the other trap: Mrs. Johnson, a barmaid, Mr. Johnson, and a little boy—I was driving—it was dusk—I am quite sure we were on our right side when the collision happened—I did not see Mrs. Johnson thrown out into the road—I did not notice that the wheels of the trap were on the grass, because they had driven on 130 yards—after the collision a gentleman in the trap took the names; I saw him making an attempt to write—I saw him with a piece of paper in his hand; I cannot say whether this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I was never addressed as Saunders in the regiment; my Christian name in John, but they call me Barry—after that conversation I saw Mrs. Johnson in her own house—I gave evidence before the Magistrate—if Smith and I had put on full speed we could not travel more than five miles an hour; the pony is only registered for that; I did not encourage it—I started from Hounslow Barracks, which is about nine miles from the races—we did not stop once for refreshment going back—we had one glass of beer each at the races—we also went to Kingston Barracks, and had a small glass of sherry and a small bottle of lemonade; after that we called nowhere—I had nothing at the New Inn, but I called for some beer for the men who helped to put the cart together, and I won't swear whether Smith had anything—I know that the name of Cornelius Saunders is put in the libel, but when inquiries were made I was certain it meant me, and I said, "You have got mixed up here altogether"—it was quite a level road, but the night was rather dark, and nobody had any lamps—nobody called out—I did not see the other trap before we came in collision.</p>

I am a surveyor, of 27, Charing Cross—I have known the prisoner a considerable time—I had a portion of my premises to let, and entered into negotiations with the Bovril Company to let the upper portion—the prisoner conducted the negotiations, which culminated in an agreement to let them the premises at £15 a quarter—the prisoner informed me that it was settled, and that conditions were to be exchanged, and I received from him £13 6s. 8d. by postal orders early in December—I had not applied to him for it—that was the right amount that he should pay over to me—the cheque was £14 15s. 2d. with the agreement</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Linton Villa, Leytonstone—I am an officer in the Post Office—on 19th March, about quarter-past seven, I was going back to my house; it is a semi-detached villa—as I went up the garden path I noticed the prisoner hiding behind a tree in the front garden—on seeing me he immediately made a bolt to the garden gate, making an excuse for his being there; it was a very disconnected and contradictory one; that he was hiding away from a woman as a joke—it was a dark, wet night, and not a likely thing to do; he made that as an excuse for his hurry to get away—I said I was not at all satisfied with his excuse, and I should like a little more explanation—we walked together into the rood, he continuing to make excuses—I let him run on in order that I might see a constable or get help—he said if I continued to remain with him he would cut up rough, and then, without any warn<lb/>ing, he gave me two heavy blows, one on the back of my head and one over the right temple—I immediately closed with him, threw him down, and called "Police"—three gentlemen came up and rendered me assist<lb/>ance, and I gave him into the custody of Police-constable Darling—I went with him to the station—he afterwards said that he was guilty of all that I had said—while we were on the ground he called out something; I don't remember very well what he said—it was some name, as if calling for assistance—I went back to the house and inspected it—on the front window I found marks of some tool—there were five marks between the framework and the lower sash, and the sash was raised about an inch—there was a mark of exactly the same kind on the side gate, the tradesmen's gate—the prisoner was about a yard or two from the window when I first saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> The house had been unoccupied from Saturday, the 16th March, to Tuesday, the 19th—it is my father's house—I had a lodging in the neighbourhood, and I visited the house two or three times a day—on this evening I had been to the Police-station to get someone to supervise the house, in consequence of something I had heard—the gas was not alight—I did not stay in the house that night—it was about twenty minutes past nine when I went back and found the marks—it is about six or eight yards from the front gate to the house.</p>

I did not meet either of the prisoners outside before I went in—I paid for some beer, which they all shared—I might have had one or two drinks; but as soon as they got what they wanted they knocked me down, and held me while they robbed me—they kicked me in the stomach—the three prisoners knocked me down and robbed me—I picked them out at the station afterwards—I did not know them by sight before that night—they blacked my eye and took all my money, which was in this pocket-book in my pocket—they took the pocket-book, and afterwards threw it in the fire—somebody picked it out, and gave it to me afterwards—Carney assisted them in kicking and knocking me about—I had no quarrel with Carney or with anybody—I swear I did not fight with him—I could swear to the three prisoners taking my money—they all got me down and held my hands behind my back—I was on the ground on my book—some held me down, and the others rifled my pockets—there might have been nine or ten men in the kitchen at the time—I cannot say whether the deputy was there when they robbed me—I think it was he who gave the men in charge—it was not me—I picked out the prisoners at the station from others at once, and the Inspector said, "You see you have no chance now; you see the man knows you."</p>

I wanted some money, and I was going to sell it"—I said to Best, "What have you to say about it?"—he said, "I only know Frizell said it belonged to his sister, and he was going to sell it, and he asked me to come with him"—I shortly after saw Frizell alone, and I said, "I don't believe what you have told me. I believe it is a lot of lies"—he said, "Yes, it is; I will tell you the truth now. I picked it up at eleven a.m. last Thursday morning in the Overhill Road, East Dulwich"—that, would be 28th March—I said, "How did you find it? Was it in a case or in a parcel?"—he said, "It was wrapped in tissue paper"—I said, "What did you do with the paper?"—he said, "I threw it away"—I said, "Where have you kept the jewellery since?"—he said, "In a biscuit-box in my bedroom at 14, Dorvell Road, East Dulwich"—I said they would be detained while I made inquiries—as the result of my inquiries they were handed over to Fox.</p>

On the morning of April 8th I went with Best to the Queen's Road and New Gross Road—he said to me, "I went with Hinton to the two shops, and Hinton tried to sell some jewellery at No. 1, Queen's Road, a pearl necklet, a coral necklet, a pair of coral earrings, and a coral brooch; at the other shop he asked the value of the necklet and earrings "I am charged with stealing"—he afterwards made this statement, which I took down; he signed it. "On Monday, 1st April, 1895, at 10.30 a.m., I met a man, named Hinton, in Choumert Road; he showed me the necklet and bracelet, which I am charged with stealing, also a coral necklet, and a pearl necklet, and said he was going to sell them. I said, 'I will go with you.' We then went together to No. 1, Queen's Road, where Hinton showed the two necklaces, a coral brooch, two earrings, and something silver to the man in the shop, and stated it was the property of his sister, and asked the man what the coral necklace was worth. The man said about 4s. The property was left there by Hinton, as the man said he would try and find a buyer. Hinton and I then went to a shop at New Cross, and Hinton asked the manager what the beetle bracelet was worth, at the same time producing it. The manager examined it, and said, 'Oh, it's only worth about 10s. for old gold.' Hinton then took the bracelet, and we left the shop. Later on we met Frizell in Blenheim Grove. He and Hinton had a conversation, which I did not hear, and I saw Hinton hand the bracelet and necklet to Frizell. Frizell said to Hinton, 'I called for you this morning.' Hinton then went towards home. Later on Hinton,. Frizell, and myself met outside Hinton's house, and went together to Camberwell Green. There we met a man named Hearn. I then went with Frizell to the City, where we were subsequently arrested as Frizell was trying to dispose of the bracelet. I had previously gone up to a policeman in Broad Street and asked him where we could sell some jewellery, I am sorry to have gone with either Frizell or Hinton; it was done unthinkingly. I had nothing to do with stealing the property, and can call witnesses to prove where I was on the night of the robbery. I also, wish to render every assistance to the police in the matter.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY FELIX BEST.")</hi>—after that statement I arrested Hinton at 6.30 on the evening of 8th, at his address, 65, Chetwynd Road, Peckhara—I said he would be charged with Best and Frizell with stealing jewellery from Melrose,</p>

On 1st April I went to Bishopsgate Street Police-station, where I found Frizell and Best detained—I charged them with stealing from a house in the Overhill Road this necklet and bracelet and a lot of other property on a date and at a time which I told them—Best said, "I can prove I was in Peckham Road with Mr. Milner's son that night"—Frizell said nothing—I put them in a cab and conveyed them to Peckham—on the way Best was asking me if I would inquire for his witnesses and get them to the Court, when Frizell said, "You need not trouble; this is my affair, and if it comes to anything I will clear you, but I shall wait and hear the evidence first"—when I got them to Peckham Police-station I told them I had to go to various places to make inquiries and get the property identified, and I took their names and addresses, and said I should detain them—Best said, referring to Frizell, who was present, "He told me his sister gave them to him"—Frizell said, "Yes, that is what I told him, and he went with me to help me to sell it"—Best gave me the name and address of his witness Milner—I made inquiries, and at 1 p.m. I saw Hinton in bed in the presence of his father and mother, who admitted me into the house—I told him what had happened with regard to the locking up of Best and Frizell, who were found dealing with this necklet and so on, and I told him where it was stolen from; and I said, "Can you tell me anything about it at all? I want to get information with regard to it if I can"—he said, "I saw Henry Best and Fred Frizell at 2 p.m. to-day" (it would be the night of the 1st or the morning of the 2nd that I was speaking to him) "in Camberwell Grove; Frizell pro<lb/>duced this necklet and bracelet, and said What do you think it is worth? Where do you think I can sell it?' I said, 'Spinks, Gracechurch Street.' We then parted"—I told him to be at the Police-court in the morning, and wired Milner to be there as well—I returned to the station, and Best and Hinton were formally charged—Best said, "All I can say is I was never up there"—Frizell said nothing—I said to Frizell, "You bought a pair of boots last Thursday"—he said, "I gave 6s. 6d. for them, they were second-hand, in a pawnbroker's shop in the Borough"—the following week, at the Police-court, he said, "Did you find where I bought the boots?"—I said, "Yes, and you offered an article of jewellery at the shop there"—he said, "Yes, I know, a brooch"—on the morning of the 2nd, at the Police-court, I found Hinton there, waiting in the ante-room—he said a young man standing by his side was Milner—Milner made this state<lb/>ment, which I wrote down: "Best said he was told they were going to do the job; I understood him to mean Hinton and another"—I said to Hinton, "You hear what he says; do you wish to say anything about that?"—he said, "Yes, Frizell asked me to go up a long time ago, in the middle of last summer. Frizell said the woman where his girl lived was</p>

               <p>nearly always drunk; it would be a good thing for anyone to get engaged to the daughter;" and he went on to make further statements, which amounted to pretty much the same—I said, "What did you say and what did he say?"—he said this, which I wrote down: "In the middle of the week before last Frizell and I were on Peckham Rye; he said, 'I know of a place in the Upland Road' (Upland Road is near Overfull Road) 'Where my girl used to work'; he referred to what he had previously said as to knowing a place where he could get money. I said, "Have you heard anything more about that place you spoke about'? He said, 'It is no good now; someone has been up there; some counterpanes have been taken out of the back garden next door where his sister lived; then at the beginning of last summer Frizell said, 'Will you come up to a place I know of at the Upland Road? it is worth anyone's while to go up there; you can get money'"—I said, "You keep on saying pretty much the same thing over and over again; if you can tell me anything do so; write it down yourself;" and I left him with the paper, and Hinton wrote down this: "Frizell said to me last summer that he knew of a job in the Under<lb/>hill Road; I did not give him any definite answer, and did not see him for some months after, and eventually the thing fell through, because he said someone had been there before"—when I came back after fifteen or twenty minutes I read that—I told Milner and Hinton to think it over, and come to my office at Peckham at eight p.m., and I would then take their statements—I had Milner in at that time, and took his statement—I was told he and Hinton had arrived, but when I sent out for Hinton after taking Milner's statement he had gone, and the next I saw of him was when he was brought in by Sergeant Knell, after we had got the additional evidence.</p>

death of your wife; I must take the policy to the office to have it rectified"—I had made a claim under the policy on my wife's life; it had been paid about three days after she died—the prisoner asked me for my policy—I said, "It is a long time for the society to find out the mistake; they ought to have found that out before"; and I fetched four policies down, mine and three of my daughters', and he looked them all over and said, "This is the policy I want," taking mine—he also took the books in which my weekly payments were entered by the collector who comes every Monday—the prisoner asked me when the collector came, and I said Mondays—he said the collector would bring the policy back—he wished me good-morning, and left—I know nothing of the receipt on one of the forms of the Liverpool Society for £10—I never received any such sum; I did not authorise anyone to give a receipt for it—I can write; I always write my name in full—I have only one son, Henry Schroder, who can write perfectly well—I have no son James—on the following Monday the collector called as usual—I asked him whether he brought the policy back—he said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

death of Henry Schroder, from bronchitis, after seven days, and to be signed by Dr. G. W. Brown, M.R.C.S.—I asked Moore what relation he was to the deceased—he said, "Son"—I therefore entered in the register of 
deaths the death of Henry Schroder, as it now appears: "No. 55, 10th January, 1895, at 16, Lancaster Street, Henry Schroder, forty-seven years of age, butcher, journeyman"—I requested Moore to sign the column for the signature, description, and residence of the informant, and he put a mark as that of an illiterate person—he gave me the name of James Schroder, and I entered it, and "Present at the 
death, 16, Lancaster Street"—I signed it—in the usual course I sent to the Registrar-General copies of all these entries—we make a return of the number of deaths in the district, and at the end of the quarter they have details, which are sent to Somerset House and examined—the record is kept at Somerset House, and anyone going there can get a copy by paying 3s. 7d.—they come to Somerset House from all over the United</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector W</hi>). On 14th February I arrested Walters bout two a.m.—I went with Neighbour to 100, Henley Street, Batter<lb/>sea—I saw Walters enter, and directly afterwards we got in at the front door by pulling a string, and I went and knocked at the door of the front room in the house—I heard a voice inside say, "Who is there?" and then I heard Walters' voice: "It is the blooming <hi rend="italic">lecs</hi>, after me; I will give them <hi rend="italic">tecs.</hi> Do you want me?"—we did not answer—he opened the door with his left hand, and he had a hatchet in his right hand—we went in pretty quickly, and fell upon him before he had time to strike, and secured him—there were two of us—I said, "We are going to take you into custody for being concerned, with others in custody now, for com<lb/>mitting frauds on insurance companies"—he said, "Very well, I don't care so long as you have got me straight. Don't take any liberties"—I had a struggle with him outside, and succeeded in getting him as far as Battersea Road Police-station, and there we had to put the handcuffs on him—he was very violent, and we took him on to Clapham—in consequence of a letter which I received afterwards from Smith, who was then in prison, I went on February 16th to Holloway and saw Smith—I told him that I had come in consequence of his letter, and that anything he wished to say would be taken down in writing and be given in evidence against him on his trial—he then made this very short statement, which I took down: "On the way to the prison on the 8th inst., in the police van, the pri<lb/>soner Moore said he reckoned we had been taken for someone else; that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220067"/>
               <p>is all I know"—in addition, he said, "I have been advised by my soli<lb/>citor not to say anything"—that was since he had written the letter—I took it down and asked the prisoner to sign it, and he refused to do so unless I left that out—Mr. Armstrong was his solicitor—he signed the statement" James Smith," written in a back-handled way—after I had seen Smith, Walters was arrested on February 14th—I was told that Sherlock wanted to make a statement, and I saw him at the South<lb/>western Police-court—on March 9th, in consequents of a letter from Walters, I went to Holloway Prison, where Walters made this statement, which I took down in writing—I cautioned him first—he signed the statement: "About four p.m. on February 1st, 1895, I was told that Sally Jones was inquiring for me. I went to the Cricketers public-house, Battersea Park Road, and saw Jones. He said, 'You're just the fellow I've been looking for; will you stand in? I said, 'What is the business?' Jones said, 'I sha'n't tell you the strength of it unless you join in.' I said, 'I'm not going to stand in unless I know the strength of it.' He then took a doctor's certificate from his pocket. I read it; it was the 
death of William Snapes. I said, 'Where does he live, and is he dead?' Jones said, 'No, he is not dead; but you must say he is if you join in with this.' I said, 'How is it you come to me to do this?' He said, 'Because I know it is rough with you, and I thought of putting a pound or two in your way.' I said, 'I can do with a bit, but I want to know more of it.' He then said, 'It is sixteen pounds odd.' I said, 'How much am I to have for my share?' Smith was there, and Sherlock too. Jones spoke to them, and then told me I should have three pounds ten. I said, 'How many to take a corner out of this? If it is sixteen pounds, I ought to have more.' Jones said, 'How's that t I've done a feat to get this to-day,' showing the certificate. 'I've had this old man, Sherlock, with me to-day, and he and me has done some other business, which you will see tomorrow.' Then Jones explained to me what to do. Jones and me left the public-house, and followed Smith and Sherlock to another public-house close to the 
death office in Clapham. We all four went in together, and waited till five o'clock till the registrar's office was opened. Jones said, 'Say you live at 11, White's Square.' Smith then said, 'Is that to be the address?' Jones said, 'Yes.' Smith said, 'Get a pen and write down the stroke.' Jones got a pen and ink from the landlord; put it on the table in front of me. Smith picked up the pen and wrote the address on the certificate, 'No. 11, White's Square, Clapham, S.E.' Smith then handed me the certificate and told me what to do with it. I took it in the registrar's office, and the registrar gave me the undertaker's certi<lb/>ficate. After I had told him the tale, I told him my brother was insured. He said, 'Give me a shilling and I will fill the form in for you.' I told him it was the Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company. He filled in the form, and gave it me. I signed the name of Charles Snapes. I brought it outside. Smith and Jones were waiting for me. Jones came up. I handed him the certificate. He clapped me on the back and said, 'This is no good, the burial one,' and tore it up; 'the other will get the stuff. To tell you the truth, I have been in and had one tumble with the old man, Sherlock.' He then handed the certificate to Smith, who put it in his pocket and said to me, 'The business is done now. All you have got to do in the morning is to get the stuff. It's just</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220068"/>
               <p>like cashing a cheque.' We went back to the same public-house where Sherlock was waiting for us. Jones borrowed 4s. from the landlord, and gave us a shilling apiece. We then left there and went to the Westbury in Wandsworth Road, close to the railway-station. We talked about the business. Jones asked if I knew anyone that was insured. I said 'No.' Smith said, 'If you know anyone that's insured we can play on them if they ain't in the Prudential; they always want to see the corpse.' Jones said in there that the best way to play this game would be to insure a lot of people, then draw their <hi rend="italic">oof</hi> after they're clear. When Jones first in<lb/>troduced me to Smith, Jones said, 'Do you want to go away in the country down to the north?' I asked him what was the good of going away without some money. He said, 'This bit of business will get us the stuff to take us away. Three-handed we'll go; we don't want the old man with us,' meaning Sherlock. We then parted for the night. Jones said, 'Come to my house at nine o'clock in the morning, and then we will go to the Westbury and meet Smith.' I went to Jones's house the next morning and saw Jones. We afterwards went to the Westbury, and Smith came there just afterwards, about half-past nine. Smith then put the insurance cards and two policies into my hand. He took them out of his pocket and said to me, 'We have got to go and draw the stuff at 186, Battersea Park Road.' I said, 'You are sending me to Scotland Yard, or as bad, for I am known down that way too well. I live there; you had better go.' Smith said, 'How can I go? There's your handwriting.' I said, 'What are you taking the biggest corner for; what have you done?' He said, 'You bring me the money, I'll make it all right with you; I'll corner it out.' I said, 'You told me last night that I had done my bit when I went to the 
death office.' He said, 'Yes, but I didn't think of this. You have only got to go in and say you have a claim to make.' We then went to the Prince of Wales public-house, close to the office in Battersea Park Road, and waited till just after ten, and agreed what was best to be done. We went outside the public-house. Me and Smith walked together; Jones was close behind us. Two detectives came across the road and spoke to me. No sooner than they spoke to me Smith and Jones left me. Smith walked on as if he didn't know me; Jones went back somewhere. The detectives asked me what was the matter with my hand, as it was bandaged up. I had poisoned it working at the exhibition. I worked there about five days; a fortnight before I told them that I was working on the roads. They said they had heard so, and left me. I didn't tell the detectives what I was doing there, you can bet. I then went up towards the office, and Smith met me. We went to walk back for Jones, and saw the detectives coming to us again. Smith then went down the Calvert Road. I watched the detectives go away, and came back to look for Smith and Jones, as we had arranged that they should walk up and down outside the office while I went in to get the money. I didn't see them, so I went in on my own <hi rend="italic">up.</hi> I signed for the money; it was £16 14s. 10d. I signed the name of Charles Snapes, for my poor brother William. The clerk paid me the money, and I went outside to look for Jones and Smith. I couldn't see them about. I expect the detectives had frightened them away. I made up my mind then that I would stick to the lot. I then went down to Jones's house and saw Smith and Jones. I said, 'What do you mean by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220069"/>
               <p>running away?' They made no reply to that, but said, 'How did you get on?' I said, 'Well, when I got inside the office there was an old man in there. I told him I had a claim to make, and he said, "I don't do the business, but my friend here does." The young man looked at the cards, and asked me my name, and said that he had a doubt in it, and he called the old man on one side and said something to him which I couldn't hear. The old man went out,' and I said, 'I soon hopped out after him and come away.' Smith and Jones looked at each other when I told them that I hadn't got the money. Jones said, 'This will be wired all over the place, so let us get rid of the books of <hi rend="italic">stiffs'</hi> (meaning the doctors' certificates) 'and the other things we've got.' Jones said to me, 'If I was you I should go away into the Militia, or somewhere away, or else disguise myself.' I said, 'How can I disguise myself? I have got no other clothes but those I have got on;' he said, 'Let me cut that off,' meaning my moustache. I agreed to it, and Jones got his scissors and cut it off. Smith was very fidgety to get away, so was Jones, so we all three went out down to Vauxhall Walk, while Smith said he would go and get me half-a-crown to get away. We waited about half-an-hour, but he didn't come back. I saw Smith no more till I was arrested, and saw him at Holloway. Jones and me then went to Nine Elms Lane, and there we parted. I went about my business. I didn't see Jones again till the day I was arrested, I mean in the morning, and Jones showed me the newspaper with the account of the charge against Smith, and the others. He said, 'Hullo, I didn't think that you would cut me up about the money.' I said, 'I would not have cut you up if you had done your share towards it.' I said, 'Come and have a drink; you've cut me up many a time, so I have only got my own back if I have cut you up.' He said, 'If I was you I should edge away out of it.' He then left me. I was afterwards arrested the same night. I saw Smith at the Police-court. He said, 'Jones has put me here, as I was drinking with him the same night with Sher<lb/>lock.' I have something more to say if I am allowed to speak at the Police-court.—<hi rend="smallCaps">C. WALTERS."</hi>—on March 5th I took this statement in writing from Sherlock—he signed it: "I desire to make a statement regarding this matter, and I do so volun<lb/>tarily to Inspector Sewell. On the 1st of January last I went to the house of 'Sally Jones' (I mean a man called Sally Jones) in some street off the Wands worth Road. He asked me if I would go with him to get some of these policies and cards for some parties that he knew. He said as I was out of work a few shillings would do me good. 'We go and get Mrs. Snapes' first; I think that is in Compton Street' Now he said, 'I and another one we will call to,' and we went. I have seen the woman since, at Court and at the Police-station; both of them, in fact. When we had got them he said, 'Come on to Lambeth, towards your home.' Then after that he came for me, and asked me if I would go up into Endell Street to get them registered. He had a 
death certificate then; he meant to get the death registered. When we got to the office he says to me, 'Old man, it will look better for you to get this registered, as yon will represent his father' (he meant young William Snapes); so I went, and he with me. When the registrar looked at the 'Medical Directory.' he found that there was no such doctor as Freeman at No. 1, Compton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189504220070"/>
               <p>Street, Soho, and said, 'I think there is something wrong in this'; and Jones said to me, 'Father, I always thought there would be a trouble to get money when you were insured.' The registrar said, 'I must keep this certificate, and make inquiries about it.' Jones said, 'When can we callagain?' The Registrar said, 'About this time to-morrow.' Jones then said, 'Come on with me to Lambeth, and I can get someone there to do it properly.' I said, 'I think I have had enough of it; I'll go home.' But on his per<lb/>suasion, we got on the tram at Vauxhall and went to Battersea Park Road, near the steam laundry. Then he said, 'Let's go in here and have a drink.' This was the Cricketers' Arms public-house, and Jones went out and fetched Friday (Walters), and he then proceeded to explain matters to him. I, Jones and Walters then left; I went first, and Jones close behind me, so that I saw them leave. We went towards Clapham, and all to<lb/>gether into a public-house close to the registrar's office. I remained in the house whilst Jones and Walters went out, and returned together. Then we went to the Westbury public-house, in the Wandsworth Road. We remained there a short time and departed. I never saw Jones again till I was arrested. I was with him in Lambeth Walk shortly before Smith introduced Jones to roe the night previous. I have only seen him (Jones) about three times, and that has been in the company of Smith. I have carefully listened to the reading of this statement, and say it is all true.—<hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE THOMAS SHERLOCK."</hi>—on 18th March I again saw Smith at the prison, after he had sent me another note through the gaolor at the Police-court. He made this statement: "March 18th, 1895. Her Majesty's Prison, Holloway. I, James Smith, wish to make a statement to Inspector Sewell, after being cautioned. On January 31st I was in the Jolly Gardeners public-house, Lambeth Walk. I was having a glass of ale with a friend, Mr. Baker, a green<lb/>grocer. I was in there about half an hour when my father-in-law looked in. This man Jones was sitting reading a paper, the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Life.</hi> Whilst in conversation Jones came over to me, and asked me whether I was a bricklayer. I told him that he had the advantage of me, and asked him, 'How do you know I am a bricklayer?' He said that a couple of weeks ago he saw me with my kit in the same bar, and that was how he knew I was a bricklayer. He said, 'Are you going to have a drink, old man?' I said, 'Yes, I don't mind.' He said, 'What are you going to have?' I said, 'A glass of ale.' He paid for a glass of ale with half a sovereign. He then said he would get me a job if I would give him 10s. out of it. I said, 'What sort of a job?' He said, 'To build a copper for £4 10s. 'I said, 'I shall see what sort of a job it is before I give you 10s. 'He said, 'I shall meet you outside here at eight o'clock to-morrow morning.' I was there at eight next morning, but could not see him there. Before I left him that night he asked me where I lived, and my name, as, he said, it was necessary to tell the man who was going to give me the job. I told him my name and where I lived, and asked him his name. He told me his name (Sally Jones). I said, 'All right, if the job suits, I will give you 10s., and give my father-in-law a day's work,' but he disappointed me. He said, 'Is that your father-in-law, that grey-headed old man there?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'I can give him a job to-morrow for five or six shillings.' I said, 'All right; I'll call him over.' I called him over and said to him, 'This man has got a day's work</p>

               <p>for you,' and then I left them. I saw no more of Jones till the 7th of February, when he was outside the Jolly Gardeners public-house, at about eight o'clock—I and my father-in-law had been to Deptford, and this man (Jones) was outside. He ran over to me and my father-in-law, and said, 'I am sorry for making you a fool the other morning; the man who wanted the copper built got someone else to do it.' I said, 'It don't matter, as I am going over to-morrow morning to Mr. Trollope's after a job.' He said, 'Will you have another glass of beer? I hope you will get it,' meaning the job. I went in the Jolly again, had another glass of beer with him and my father-in-law. When we came out he bid us good<lb/>night, and we were arrested.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES SMITH."</hi>

I am a tobacconist, of High Street, Marylebone—on October 14th I went into the Merrick Arms, Battersea, with a man named Pyne, about ten o'clock—there were five men in the compartment—the prisoner and his brother were two of them—I called for half-a-pint of bitter ale, and the man with me had half-a-pint—one of the men wanted me to fight—I said I did not get my living by boxing—they asked me to buy them some beer—I said "I don't know you"—I was struck five or six times over my head and body—the man who has been tried got my purse and £4 5s.—I am not prepared to say that the prisoner struck me—I told the Magistrate that he did—I cannot say where he struck me—I was hustled out of the house—I did not see the prisoner outside—the man who is sentenced to seven years punched my nose and took my purse—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there six weeks.</p>
