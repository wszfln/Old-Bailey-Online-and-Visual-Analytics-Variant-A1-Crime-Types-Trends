               <p>The Symptoms are, cutaneous Eruptions, as red, yellow, or black Spots upon the Arms and Legs, as small as Flea-bites , sometimes as large as a Grown-piece , and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough, scaly Swellings; os there is an itching of the Skin, which is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call'd the Itch.</p>
               <p>The Scurvy perverts the Lymphs, and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System, for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness , Sense of Weight, and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs, the Appetite is either too stimulating or languid, the Gums are liable to Excrescence, Swellings and Ulcers, and when rubb'd void either a saltish Blood, or serous Humour; the Teeth are loose and corroded, the Mouth has a Stench ; the Spittle is very salt and sometimes acid; they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats, difficulty of Breathing, wandering Pains, a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person.</p>
