I live at 45, Upper Park Road, Hampstead, with my mother—on 2nd August, about seven a. m., I came downstairs and saw the back kitchen window was burst open, and the curtains, mincing machine, a few other things, and a great deal of food were gone—the total value of things taken was about 12s.; they belonged to my mother—I saw that the window was fastened the night before; all the premises were fastened and made secure.</p>

About half-past five a. m., on 2nd August, I was on duty in Upper Park Road, Hampstead—I saw the prisoner carrying two bundles in the front garden of the Upper Park Road Studio, which adjoins 45, Upper Park Road—when he saw me he dropped the bundles and ran to the rear of the studio, and got over the fence into the rear of a nursery—I ran along the Upper Park Road and met him running towards Upper Park Road, at the end of which I stopped him and said he would have to come back with me to see what he had been in the garden for—he said he knew nothing about it; he was going to see about some work—he took this table knife from his pocket and threw it behind him—I took him back to 45, Upper Park Road, and got Constable Hall to hold him while I got the parcels from the garden—they contained a pair of curtains, a mincing machine, a quantity of broken food, a cucumber and a looking glass—the prisoner said he was not the man who stole the goods.</p>

W.—I gave instructions to Mr. Lowther, the overseer—about a quarter to eight that evening the female prisoner was brought to me by Constable Towers—I told her who I was, and asked her where she got the orders from—she said she had found them in a letter in Heath Road—(Towers had previously given me the letter and orders)—I asked her who opened the letter—she said she opened it, and was tempted to go to the office and cash the orders—I asked her who signed the orders—she said, "I did not write anything, I Jim no scholar"—I told her the orders were enclosed in a letter by me, in a letter which was handed to her husband for delivery, and it was known that he had not delivered it—she said the letter fell out of her husband's pocket, and he did not know it, and she then opened the letter and got the orders—I subsequently showed her some other orders at the Post Office—about nine o'clock I met the male prisoner in Lambeth Road, and he went back with me to the sorting office—his wife was not present—when we arrived at the office I described the letter to him, and told him it was handed to him for the four o'clock delivery that afternoon, and I asked what he knew about it—he said he did not remember them, meaning the orders, and that he never saw the letter—I asked what he did with any returned letters, or letters not delivered when he completed his delivery—he said he re-posted two and took nothing home—I then told him that his wife had been stopped earlier in the evening with the letter containing the postal orders he denied it altogether, and said he knew nothing about the orders or the letter, and that his wife knew</p>

               <p>nothing about it—he did not appear to realise the fact that we had stopped her—I showed him the letter and the orders—he said, "I know nothing about the orders; I thought she had been connected with some bad clique for some time"—on the following morning I showed his wife these seven postal orders—they are all in a similar andwriting—three of the letters should not have been delivered by Wood, and should not have been taken home by him; two of the letters would be for his delivery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The male prisoner has been about twenty-five years in the service of the Post Office—he has been for some time entitled to a pension—he wears the good conduct stripes—the South Lambeth is a fairly large district—he commenced his round that afternoon at Wandsworth Road Station, about five minutes' walk from the sorting office; it may be ten or twelve minutes—Robertson Street would be the last place on his delivery—there are regulations forbidding postmen to omit the delivery of letters—at the time the male prisoner was taken into custody he had not seen his wife, and did not know she had been detained—he did not apparently credit that statement until his son told him of it—he lived in Nursery Street, close to Robertson Street.</p>

I am a constable in the Post Office—about 7. 30 p. m. on 23rd August I saw Lucy Wood in Queen's Road, Battersea—she entered the Hartington Terrace Post Office, and I saw her take a test letter from her pocket, and from that the postal orders, which she presented for payment—they were already signed; she did not sign them in the office—the clerk paid the amount, 7s. 6d. and 2s. 6d., but Lucy Wood looked round and did not pick up the money—I advanced to her and said, "I identify these orders as having been stolen; how do you account for the possession of them?"—she replied, "I found the letter in the Heath Road"—I took her back to Mr. Stevens, and I was present at the conversation he had with her—I heard his evidence and confirm it—later on I saw Edward Wood with Mr. Stevens at the South Lambeth Post Office; he was not in custody then—he was very much astonished to know that his wife was detained—he said, "I know nothing about it, neither does my wife"—he was then brought into his wife's presence—when the charge was read over at the Police-station he said, "I never stole them; she stole he letter and cashed the orders"—he said about the letters for Robertson Street, "I was too lazy; I had two letters for Robertson Street, and I was too lazy to deliver them"—I had had him under observation in the earlier part of the afternoon, but not at the latter part of his walk—I took up a position to see if the prisoner went to the house to which the letter was addressed; he did not go there—I was there when Mr. Stevens</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Carey and Lewis, auctioneers, 18 and 19, Ironmonger Lane—my partner knew the prisoner before October last year—I did not—I know my partner had some conversation with him before October about a Miss Horsman—on 11th October, 1892, the prisoner called at the office and saw me—he said that his aunt, Miss Emma Horsman, of Cedars Road, Clapham, had recently died, and that he with his sister, Mrs. Abbott, of Oxford, were the executors, and that he was also a legatee, that as executors they had proved the will, and he had in his possession the probate—he said that the property consisted of various stocks and shares in various undertakings, and a house of furniture; and that he intended to sell the same by auction and to instruct us, and that in the meantime he would be glad if we would advance him money from time to time as he wanted it, and that we were to deduct the same from the proceeds of the sale there was stock in the Gas Light and Coke Company, and shares in the Lambeth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110013"/>
               <p>and Vauxhall Water Works Company, and in the Crystal Palace District Gas Company—he said the solicitor acting in the estate was Mr. Chester, of Newington Butts—I advanced him two sums, one of £1 and 13s. on that day, he came in twice—between that date and December we lent him various other sums amounting in all to £11 10s.—during that time we received a number of letters from him referring to this business; these are they—this letter refers to some suggestion that we should see Mr. Chester, the solicitor, but the prisoner put us off from seeing him—this letter of 6th October asks us to fix the date of the sale of this property—he fixed the date of the sale later, and we ultimately prepared a printed bill of the auction for December 15th, and advertised it in all the daily papers, and posted up notices at railway stations and everywhere—he gave me these particulars of the stocks and shares he was to sell as executor; it was headed, "By the order of the executors of Miss Horsman, deceased"—on 12th December I received this letter from him requesting us to postpone the sale, and stating, "Since I last saw you I have done everything in my power to get certificates to draw particulars, and have failed to persuade Mrs. Abbott to withdraw her opposition"—in consequence we postponed the sale—I next received this letter of 14th December (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the only person standing in the way was Mrs. Abbott; and that he wanted afresh advance next day and that they could draw on him at a month if they liked for cash advanced and expenses</hi>)—we drew a bill at a month on him for the advance, and £20 which we agreed on for expenses; the amount of the bill was £32 altogether—the prisoner accepted it—after that we received further letters from him, and made other advances in the same way, up to 26th May, 1893, amounting to £28 5s. more, which made the total advanced then, in cash, £39 15s.—the bill had become due; it was never presented, as it was understood we were only to have it instead of an I. O. U. acknowledging the debt; we were to have the money out of the proceeds of the sale—we made all our advances on the faith of what the prisoner told us about this estate; I believed absolutely what he said, otherwise I should not have advanced him a penny—further dates were fixed for the sale—the prisoner suggested that the property should be included in each of our regular monthly auction sales, and on each occasion he gave some reason for postponing it—once he said he had broken his leg, which was untrue—the last advance we made him was 15s., on 26th May—he never came near us after that day—after the sale was postponed he said there had been some disagreement with Mr. Chester; they had changed their solicitor from him to Mr. Edlin, of Chancery Lane; I could not find Mr. Edlin in Chancery Lane, nor his name in the "Law List"—on May 30th, I received this letter from the prisoner, in which he says:—"I am writing to my solicitors to have things brought to an end"—On June 21st, I went to try and find him at his address, Gelately-road, Nunhead; he was not at home; he was living there—I put the matter in the hands of my solicitors—the prisoner had represented to us that he was seriously ill and could not come to see us—our solicitors gave us some information about the will—I made inquiries to see if I could find any evidence of Miss Emma Horsman having lived at Cedars Road—I could find no evidence of her having lived or died there—the prisoner said the will had been proved in June, 1892—I suggested</p>

               <p>to him that I would go and see both Mr. Chester and Mr. Edlin, but he made some excuses; no good would come of seeing them, and that he had the matter absolutely in his hands, and would deal with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This matter was brought against you at the Mansion House on two occasions—I was cross-examined as to whether I paid you for attending at the auction mart—I said, "Yes," which was true—on the second occasion I said "No," but a very small sum was given to you—there was no agreed charge, you had a few shillings—you have attended sales for me—we have to get people to bid up to a reserve price—we do not pay people to do it—you did not propose that we should draw on you because we were short of cash; my pass-book would prove otherwise—the Lord Mayor dismissed the case against you because it was irregularly put, and then we summoned you—when we did not pay you by cheque we took your I. O. U., but we generally paid you by cheque—we often wrote to you stating that if the matter was not cleared up we should have to take proceedings—we still believed in you then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We received this letter of 1st December, 1892—we wrote this of 10th April—in answer to that we got a further request for money, and we sent him 30s., which we said must be our last advance; that he owed us £60, and that failing other payment he must pay us out of the insurance money—he said his daughter had died, and he had got £60 insurance money—I believe the daughter did not die—on 10th May, 1893, we wrote this letter expressing annoyance at a further request for money, and asking what had become of money required for a specific purpose—that referred to his saying he was going to Oxford to see his sister to get the matter absolutely settled up—I did not know until our solicitors informed us that his statements about the probate of the will were false—they wrote that to us on 23rd June, and next morning we applied for a warrant—when the case was heard at the Mansion House the bill of exchange was proved in cross-examination, and the Lord Mayor then, without hearing me, dismissed the summons, saying that the matter had been treated as a debt by me, and that no jury would convict—on a subsequent occasion, when the case was heard again, it was explained that the case had been dismissed under the supposition that the bill of exchange had been taken by us after we had discovered the falsehood of the statements, but it was not so, and when the matter was properly explained the prisoner was committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London—prior to 1872 they were engaged in a scheme for widening Widegate Street, and in September, 1892, notice was served on the prisoner to treat for his property—I produce a duplicate of it—on December 31st I received these particulars of claim (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) signed by the defendant for £375, in which he states that the six rooms on the upper floor are let to Mrs. Bell at £1 a week—the claim is made up of three items; it went before a committee of the Commissioners, and on April 25th they agreed to pay £200 as a settlement of the claim—an agreement was drawn up and signed by the defendant agreeing to accept the £200—an assignment was prepared, and a warrant for payment was drawn up and signed by the Commissioners, but before it was handed to the prisoner information came to me as to the rent of the rooms let to Mrs. Bell—I made inquiries, and declined to hand over the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The scheme was never abandoned—in 1891 a Bill was submitted by the County Council, whereby part which we had done was made use of—the prisoner's claim was in reference to the whole house; he had a fourteen years' lease at £40 a year—the shop was let to a Mrs. Cohen at £40 a year—the Commissioners were represented by Mr. Haywood and Mr. Ross, his assistant—Mr. Haywood reported to the committee verbally, and it was considered—we know nothing about the prisoner having agreed to lay out some money, but the claim says, "In consideration of an outlay"—Mr. Haywood is not here—he did not make a report in writing—under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act there is no provision for his getting his costs if the case goes to a jury, but they</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had a large experience in valuing property in that district—my firm has existed twenty-six or twenty-seven years; they have property in the street—the prisoner was using part of the house for storage—in my opinion the six rooms were worth £52 a year—I should have no difficulty in letting them for that—if this offer had not been accepted it would have been tried by a jury—the prisoner has lived in the parish many years, and is very much respected by the parishioners as one of the members for the Bishopsgate Foundation; my interview with Mr. Ross was purely to give him information—I explained to him in detail how I arrived at £375—that was based on value.</p>

               <p>expect a tenant to be allowed to put a notice outside and in the window as well—I fixed it at £375, but I advised him to take the £200, because if it had been tried by a jury there would have been taxed costs—in arriving at the £375 I calculated that the rooms on the upper floor were worth £1 a week—if they had been put down at 16s. my claim would have been less.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Offord and Sons.—they had a landau for sale in April, and I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">On a printed heading</hi>): "86, Amhurst Park, Stamford Hill.—Sir,—Seeing by the paper that you have a good landau for sale, I should feel obliged if you would send me on all particulars, and also state if you would take bill for same. I am willing to sign an agreement that it is yours until bill is met. If these terms suit, I should like you to give me a call by appointment—J. S. <hi rend="smallCaps">JEWELL</hi>"—I called and saw the prisoner—it was a private house—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110028"/>
               <p>I next received this letter on plain paper: "Sir,—Sorry that I have been unable to give you a call, owing to the heavy contracts that I have on hand; but if your representative could give me a call I might be able to arrange terms, as I am quite sure he would not falsely describe the landau. I shall be at home any day you name from one till 2. 30 p. m.—J. S. <hi rend="smallCaps">JEWELL</hi>"—that letter came before I went—I then told him to come and see the carriage, and on 19th April he came and saw the landau and a cart and harness, and selected them—he said he was a job master, and was going to let them out on hire—we received this letter the next morning: "April 19th. Sirs,—I will have the cart, harness and landau at the prices, viz., £30, £6, and £85, and will give you a bill for £36, payable in three months, and one for £85, payable in six months, and will sign any agreement you like, as I promised.—J. S. <hi rend="smallCaps">JEWELL</hi>"—that was followed by this letter of the 22nd: "Dear Sirs,—Yours to hand; please to have leather dash put on landau, which I will pay a little extra for, and also take off the bar and put on shafts, etc. You can also supply me with a good whip and one of those waterproof rugs, which please charge for in the bill, etc.—J. S. <hi rend="smallCaps">JEWELL</hi>"—he came on April 27th—I wrote the agreement; he read it, signed it, and asked for a copy of it, which he had. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>"When I have paid you the sum of £125 the carriages and sundries become my property, but not till then")—on June 19th Mr. Offord, one of the partners, spoke to me, and I went to Baker Street Bazaar, where carriages stand for sale, and there saw the Canterbury cart—I then went to the White Horse stables, Clapton, but found no trace of the prisoner or of the landau—I then tried some stables at Bouverie Road, Stoke Newington, which is one of the addresses on the letters, and on June 20th I went to some stables at 1, St. Andrew's Pavement, and saw the prisoner—I asked him for the landau; he said it was at Ascot at the races, but would be back to-morrow at twelve o'clock—I asked him for the cart; he said, "You know I have sold it"—I do not know how he got that information—I asked what right he had to sell it; he said he had made a mistake, he intended to come and see me next morning—I went back and saw my principals—he came next day and was referred to the solicitors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not state at the Police-court that he said my employers knew that he had sold the cart, because I was not asked—I saw no horses at St. Andrew's stables; I did not go to that part—he signed the agreement and the two bills at the same time; it was all one transaction—it was the prisoner's wish that the bills should be given—the amounts £40 and £85 were stated in the letters—I acceded to his suggestion, and he gave bills for these amounts—it was not after the agreement was signed that he was asked to secure the payments by two bills—none of the directors of my company are here—it is not within my knowledge that when the first bill came due the defendant's solicitor came and tendered the money—the prisoner did not tender the money to my knowledge—I have had some experience in the trade; I let these things on a hiring agreement—I do not think I ever had an agreement like this in the course of my experience.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing common law clerk to Messrs. Dyce and Co., solicitors, of Bishopsgate—I have the conduct of this case—I knew before proceedings were taken at the Police-court that the prisoner was not in good circumstances—in July, at the time the prisoner gave the returned cheques, his mother was endeavouring to raise money for him on mortgage through our firm, to be advanced to him—we have not all the cheques—the prisoner mentioned an indebtedness to</p>

               <p>Offords—I did not ascertain that he had given a bill—in consequence of a communication from my principals, I called on Messrs. Offord on July 29th the day before the bill became due—I saw Mr. Offord, I believe, and informed him that I had come for the purpose of taking up the bill of Mr. Jewell's for £40—he said, "I have not the bill, the matter is in the hands of my solicitors; I will send to them for instructions"—he sent, but the gentleman attending to the matter was not in—I tendered him £40 in notes and gold, and said, "You can have this money at any time in exchange for the bill," and I wrote to them the same evening to the same effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the prisoner was charged in the first instance on July 17th at the Police-court in respect to Joyce's matter—I did not attend, nor was my firm represented—I attended on the remand before Mr. De Rutzen on the 25th,. and instructed counsel—I heard you open the charge of larceny of the landau and cart—I knew that the offence of larceny was complete on the conversion, and that if any felony was committed it was complete on May 3rd—after the case was disposed of some of the evidence in this case was taken, and all the documents were read and put in; in fact the case was complete—I believe no other evidence was called—after Offords' charge was gone into, the prisoner was out on the same bail as before, and I went and tendered the money for the bill while he was under charge under the instructions of my principal—the money that was to he raised on mortgage was to be paid about that date—I do not wish to disclose the name of the client it was to come from—the negotiations were very fully gone into at that time—Mrs. Jewell brought the money to our office, though she did not obtain it from that source—the negotiation was to be completed towards the end of July, but it was not completed—I did not inform the prisoner that he was to have money from the mortgage, but I said that his mother was raising money—she has paid off the cheques—Mr. Row was paid about £90 after the prisoner was committed for trial—Rymal cheque for £46 5s. was paid while the remand was going on—application was made under Order 14, and I settled it—that was for a horse, and I believe Mr. Ward's debt was for horses—the cheque to Jackson for £102 was provided for early in August—the prisoner is a jobmaster at Stamford Hill—I believe the address is St. Andrew's Hill; he had eight or ten horses there—I went there first six months ago—I do not know whether he jobs carriages; I have seen horses and carriages there—I saw him with this Canterbury cart, but do not know where he obtained it—I say cannot that he was honestly in possession of carriages, or whether he is licensed as a jobmaster—I heard a man swear that he had not a hackney carriage license; he might let a brougham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The man who said that, said that there were many people doing business in London who had no licenses—Mr. Joyce is prosecuting—in several cases where the money was paid there was no suggestion of civil proceedings—I believe the contract was postponed by the Hackney Board of Works.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Devonshire Chambers, Bishopsgate Without—about 24th July I had a conversation with the prisoner with respect to his financial matters—he said he was indebted to Offord and Sons.—I asked him how much—he said, "I cannot say exactly"—he gave</p>

               <p>me their address, and I went there that day, between four and. five o'clock, and saw some gentleman evidently in authority—I said, "I have come about the affairs of Mr. Jewell, as I understand he is indebted to you, and I have come to know the amount"—he said, "I cannot discuss the matter with you; my solicitors are next door, and the matter is in their hands'—I asked him to go with me, and I then went and saw Mr. Diver, and said, "I have been referred to you by Mr. Offord. I understand they have a claim against Mr. Jewell which I am anxious to arrange, if possible; I understand the amount is not very serious"—he asked a clerk sitting in the office with him to refer to the books—he did so, and said there were two sums of £40 and £85—I said, "Well I am not prepared for so large an amount, but Mrs. Jewell will arrange for the payment if you like to take her security," and I think I added, "I don't think she can find you cash for the whole amount at once, but she will pay half down and the balance in a month."—Mr. Diver said "To accept those terms it would be compounding a felony to take security"—I said,. "I know nothing about any felony; so far as I know it is a debt," and asked him to explain the matter to me—he declined to do so, and told me to go to the Police-court and find out—I pressed him for information, and said, "I did not know you had any charge against him"—he said "I decline to give you any information, my terms are £125 before six o'clock to-night, or it will be made hot for your client in the morning"—I said. "If we were disposed to put the money down; I am in Portland Place, and Mrs. Jewell at Stamford Hill, and it is five o'clock now"—he said, "Well, before six to-night or ten in the morning; it will not be too late at the Police-court"—I again asked him to give me the particulars, and said, "I do not quite understand if taking security is compounding a felony why taking cash is not, and as you decline to give me particulars, will you let me see one of your principals?"—he said, "If you don't get out of my place at once I will put you out"—I repeated my request, and he sent for a constable—two came, and Mr. Diver put his hand on my shoulder, and said, "Now you go"—he did not inform the constables of the facts, but I did—I walked out, and on the following morning the charge was preferred—Mr. Diver is in Court—the solicitors are Kingsbury and Turner, and there is a board with Mr. Diver's name on it, pointing to the Trade Protection Association.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Kingsbury and Turner, solicitors, of George Street, Portman Square—it is not true that I said to the last witness that I would take. £125 if it was paid before six in the evening, or that it would not be too late the next day.</p>

Do they want to make a job of it?"—I had not written the letter to Mr. Joyce at that time—my writing to Mr. Joyce after July 25th, when my case was complete, was not to make a stronger case against the prisoner—I did not write with the intention of hurting the prisoner—I saw that he had no solicitor, and I saw no objection to writing to him—it was not in the hope that the two cases combined would make it a more serious case for the prisoner—there are other cases besides this—there is no hand in my principals' office pointing to my name as having the management of the debt-collecting department, but the words "Debt-collecting department" are on the window blind—I have nothing to do with the debt-collecting, Mr. Cow land attends to that—an action on a couple of bills would come into my hands—I took these criminal proceedings because I was advised—I saw Messrs. Offord myself about the matter—I did not advise them to institute criminal proceedings till after I had seen Mr. Gill—Mr. Smith offered me Mrs. Jewell's security, but I knew nothing of her.</p>

On 13th July I saw Mundy at Hastings Station—I said, "Mundy, you know me"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will be charged with being concerned with Alexander Stewart in stealing a box from Warwick Street, Pall Mall, by means of a forged telegram. That box contained plate and a cheque-book on Glyn, Mills, Curry, and Co. Several cheques in that book have been forged and uttered in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross. The boy who took away the box was wearing a black apron, similar to this one which was found at your lodgings in Hastings"—he said, "Yes, I took away the box, Alexander Stewart gave me the apron to wear; but I only cashed two of the cheques, one at the newspaper shop and one at the milk shop"—I conveyed him to King Street Police Station, London, where he was charged in my presence—Stewart said he had sent the telegram.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mundy was in custody when I saw him at Hastings—he told me that Stewart gave him the letters in which the cheques were contained—I found every statement of his to be correct—I have made inquiries about his character; he bear a good character—he had an impediment in his speech when he made the statement to me, so that I could hardly understand him—he appeared very stupid.</p>

I live at 3, Warwick Street, Pall Mall—the plate spoken of by the last witness is mine; I kept it at Warwick Street—I did not authorise either of the prisoners to come and take it away—on. Friday, 30th June, I discovered that the trunk had gone from my bed-room and I made inquiries, and the servant told me that a boy had called' in the afternoon and taken it away—I sent no telegram that day—I knew Stewart; he used to be a servant at Warwick Street—in my trunk were a lot of plate, and old family papers, and a cash-box, a cheque-book, and old cheques—I had the plate valued at £4 5s. as its market value—I have got all the things back except the papers—I gave no authority for the removal of the box.</p>

Thompson, of the Royal Horse Artillery, directed to Mr. Campbell Bannerman—on receiving that letter I communicated with Mr. Anderson, of Scotland Yard, and conveyed to him the Secretary of State's wishes—no legal proceedings were taken on that letter—I subsequently received this letter of 7th August, also signed J. Thompson, late of the Royal Horse Artillery—on the receipt of that letter the matter was con<lb/>sidered, and a warrant was obtained, mainly because more than one person was threatened in the letter—the case was rather taken out of the hands of the Secretary of State—the prisoner was in the Royal Horse Artillery, according to the records, and was discharged in consequence of wounds in 1857, or thereabouts—he received compensation of 9d. a day, awarded by the Chelsea Commissioners—in 1888 his case was further considered by the Chelsea Commissioners, and his pension was increased to 1s. 2d. a day—since then he has been in receipt of the highest rate of pension.</p>

Sir,—I most respectfully beg to inform you that I have just underwent another operation, it is the 5th for the rupture I received through spite at the time, Royal Small Arms Factory, Sp., B'ham, in May last. Note I told you that my life was a trouble to me, as I am in pain when I ly down, sit, stand, or walk. I am tired of being in the Chamber of Horrors, the Workhouse Infirmary, where I have spent most of my time this last three years through the spite and malice and vilany of War Office Officials. Right Hon. Sir, this is to give you notice that unless you do me justice for all I have suffered, and will have to suffer as long as I live; you have robbed me of fivepence a day of my little pension, my weekly pay, and you have disabled, crippled, ruptured, and paralyzed me; you know that you cruily, brutally, starved and tortured and swindled, robbed and persecuted me; you know that you starved, tortured and murdered my poor wife; you know that I was lying in a Workhouse Infirnary, a poor, miserable, disabled, ruptured, paralyzed cripple, and my poor wife lying dead outside at the same time, and through the same cause, the spite and malice of War Officials; you have robbed me of all that life is worth living for; you drive me in heir to the Chamber of Horrors, and you stop my little pension that I fought and bled for; you persecute me and drive me in heir to die a miserable lingering death, and all for speaking truth; you tell lies to M. P. 's and others to prevent them from helping me; you are slowly and surely crushing me to death. Well, Sir, I may as well die on the scaffold as die heir, and unless you do me justice, I only want justice Right Hon. Sir, I do now swear by my God that I will take the life of some one of them that are now torturing and murdering me. I care not which of you it is, I will stick a knife between his ribs as soon as I get the chance, as I may as well die on the gallows as in the slaughter-house; you as well as the rest, first come, first served; I can't stand your torture any longer, I will have death or justice.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES THOMPSON</hi>, late R. H. A."</p>
               <p>"Workhouse Infirmary, Fulham, W.,7. 8. 93.—Right Hon. Sir,—You was pleased to send a police officer heir, you may just as well send him home for all the good he don, or will do or can do; it is you who can end this corre<lb/>spondence, not the police, you can end it by doing justice to me who you have most disgracefully treated; you have robbed me of my strength, of all means of earning a living; you are slowly but surely murdering me, as you have murdered my poor wife; you have robbed me of fivepence a day of my pension, for which I fought and bled, and left some of my best blood on the plains of Bengal, for you have robbed me of my weekly pay this last three years; you have most cruely and brutally tortured and persecuted me; you are now murdering me thro spite, because I speak the truth; but, Sir, I do not mean to die just to please you. I will not enter into any details now, as you know my case well. I claim and demand my back pay of fivepence a day from date of my discharge, my weekly pay from January, 1891, all the money I have paid into workhouse hospitals to be refunded to me, and some fair compensation for being disabled, crippled, ruptured, and paralyzed for life, and for all the sick<lb/>ness, pain, and torture and hunger I have suffered, and for all I have to suffer up to the day of my death; you know my case, so I will only that I have been robbed by you or those under your command. I have</p>

               <p>been most cruelly and brutally tortured, and you know it, you are murder<lb/>ing me now, you and the set of villains at the War Office. Well, Sir, I will stand no more of your torture and persecution, send me the money that is honestly and justly due to me; if not, I will have this, and I will take the first opportunity I can get of sending a bullet, or knife, or any<lb/>thing I can through you or any of the other villains who are now persecuting and murdering me, and who have murdered my poor wife. There is six of you, and I am sure I would get a front seat in Heaven if I could send the lot of you to Hell together. You have murdered my poor wife, but I will take care you will not murder me, as you are now doing by persecution. I give you fair notice, and that is honourable; my case is well known to hundreds heir, and my case or my statement was read in the Liberal Club not far from heir. My case is in the hands of those that will circulate it, Members of Parliament, priests, parsons, in fact all classes, so that I now swear by Almighty God that unless you do me justice I will take your life and as many as I can of the others who are murdering and persecuting me, and that I will do it how, when and where I can. This I swear to, So Help my God. I am no Coward, and I will stand no more of your Hellish persecution; I have stood it too long, I will stand it no longer. Do me justice, and you will hear no more from me. I will have justice or death.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES THOMPSON</hi>, late R. H. A."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker's man; I live at 47, Neal Street—on Wednesday, 12th July, I was put in possession of 28, Queen Ann's Place Bush-hill Park, Enfield, for the holder of a bill of sale—I did not see the prisoner's wife and family there—there was furniture in the house; there was nothing in the shop—it was a kind of linen-draper's or dressmaker's; there was no business doing there—the prisoner was living there; a man named Rust was in the house—I was placed in a room at the top of the house by the prisoner's order; that was the first night I slept there—about four o'clock the prisoner came home; he said we need not sit up for, him, he should not be home before eleven; he had his tea and went out—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman at 29, Queen Anne's Place—I knew the prisoner as a next-door neighbour—some days before the fire I saw a van-load of things leave the premises directly after six in the morning—it was a four-wheeled van with two men—it contained sundry kitchen utensils, pots and pans—in the early morning of the 15th July my wife awoke me and I heard a cry of "Fire"—I put on some clothes and went to the street door, and heard a noise at the door of No. 28, as if of somebody trying to open it—I saw it opened, and the prisoner and two men came out—I saw flames coming from the basement, as well as light through the glass—the prisoner brought a bag into my house and asked me to take care of it;</p>

               <p>the defendant standing with his back against the doorpost—I went into the shop—there was no stock—I heard a crackling noise in the corner, and called for water—the prisoner brought me one pail—I poured it through the hole in the match-board—the fire engine came—Kirby about that time gave me this short piece of lead pipe—in the basement I saw some charred cardboard boxes and burnt paper in the room, which is about 4 ft. 6 in. in width—I found this box of matches—there was a 3-f t. gas stove, and in the fireplace a kettle—there was no other appearance of tea having been made—the meter was 15 ft. from the gas stove—I lost sight of the defendant for some time, and Kirby and Laws brought water afterwards—the fire was burning behind the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Y</hi>). I am stationed at Enfield—on the early morning of 15th July, when I got to 28, Queen Anne's Place, I found a, number of persons about the premises—I examined the premises, and conversed with Riley and Kitheringham—in the basement I pointed out to the defendant the quantity of cardboard boxes, paper, etc., where the fire appeared to have originated, and that it was clear the fire had been deliberately set alight to, and on my inquiring, so far as he was concerned the case was very suspicious—I told him I must ask him a few questions, and he could answer if he desired, but he need not, but I should make a note of all he said, when he said, "I came home at about ten p. m., boiled some water, had tea, and then went to bed at about eleven p. m., and heard nothing until I was alarmed by the man who was sleeping over me calling out 'Fire!' I then opened the door and put on my trousers and boots, and went downstairs and opened the back door; the house was full of smoke. I do not know if the other two men were downstairs or not, I did not see them; I went through the kitchen to get some water. When I first heard the call of 'Fire!'I opened my room door and heard a crackling noise going on. I think that by the time I got downstairs the men were about the house. I called and asked them if they had a light to light the light in the passage"—I asked him if he saw the men at the front door—he said, "I think when I opened the front door the men were trying to open it"—I went with him then to the bath-room—I then asked him if he had been to the bath-room during the night, and he said, "From the time I came up to bed at eleven o'clock I heard nothing, neither did I leave the room. I did not go up to the top floor after about seven p. m. I then filled the bath, as I usually have a cold bath in the morning, but I did not have a bath after the men had gone to bed"—I asked him what kind of matches he usually used—he produced a small box of safety matches, similar to that handed to me by Riley, saying "These matches are what we generally use"—I then went to the top of the house to the bath-room, and I pointed out that the bath was three-parts filled with water, and that it appeared to have been used, although there appeared to be very little soap used—he said, "I always use soap in the bath to wash. I did not run off the whole of the water, as I think it hardly worth while for one person"—then he explained his practice was when having a bath to run off a portion of the water, let the clean in, but never empty the bath—he then said, "When I opened the front door,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110045"/>
               <p>also the back door, and the kitchen window I found all secure"—that was in answer to my question whether he found all secure when he came down—he said, "I am certain no person came into the house after I went to bed"—I asked him about insurance—he said, "My furniture and stock are insured in the Liverpool, London and Globe for £500, I think, but I am not quite sure as to the amount. My policy is at 17, Lawrence Lane, City, where I go to business. It has been there for a fortnight or three weeks. I took it down there with some other papers which I have here, I do not know the number"—I pointed out to him there was no stock in the shop, and he said, "There is no stock in the shop, neither has there been for three weeks; it was my wife's property, and has nothing to do with me. She disposed of it about three or four weeks ago; my wife and family have been away since Tuesday, 11th; she has two children with her. My eldest son is in Africa"—he said, "I went into the basement when I came in, boiled some water on the gas-stove. I am in the habit of lighting my pipe and walking about the house, and throwing the match down" (that was after I asked him to come with me to the Police-station), "and I might have done so when I lit the gas-stove, and thrown the match carelessly on the paper. The gas was turned out by the man who came into the cellar"—that was in answer to the question whether he saw the witness Hill there, and he said the gas was turned out by him—he accompanied me to the Police-station and I returned to the house, and upon examining the place I found that there was nothing at all in any of the drawers or cupboards, no wearing apparel—there was no stock in the shop—there were large articles of furniture all through the place, it being furnished throughout except the shop; there was nothing in the shop—he was subsequently charged at the Police-station, and when the charge was read over to him he said, "The charge is not a correct one, for I did not wilfully and maliciously set fire to the place, it was on accident"—I searched him at the station—I found a small sum on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember seeing a kettle on a gas jet—I have inquired and heard that he had occupied a good situation in the City between twenty and thirty years, and when he left, about five years ago, it was through the failure of his firm—since he has been carrying on a small drapery business at the house where the fire took place—the stock had been removed about a month before the fire—he had an office for a month or two at 17, Lawrence Land, which I visited, and found there no other furniture than a chair—I know nothing against him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>) From information I received from Detective Hallum as to some indigo being stolen, I watched within the cloak-room at Fenchurch Street Station on September 1st—about six p. m. Potter took these two parcels in his hand to Brandum's oilshop, 99, Whitechapel Road—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour—he came out without the parcels—I followed him a short distance, and then stopped him—I told him I should take him in custody, and then took him back to Brandum's shop, and in Hallum's presence, and another officer, I said, "We are police officers. I have followed this lad (<hi rend="italic">Potter</hi>) from the City with two parcels that contain indigo blue. We followed him into your shop, and saw him leave the parcels. He has told me you have given him £2 10s. for the blue; is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What do you know about this lad?"—he said, "I don't know much about him"—I said, "Where is the blue?"—he said, "There it is," pointing to a corner behind some sacks—I said, "Have you made any inquiry as to where the lad is employed?"—he said, "No"—I said, "About this blue?"—he said, "Oh, I thought it was some sweepings or samples"—I said, "I see you have not examined the parcels," as they were not undone—I then said to Potter, "How many transactions have you had with Brandum, and when was the last?"—he said, "About seven or eight, and the last one was about a week ago"—I said, "How much did he pay you on that occasion?"—he said, "About £1, and that was about 20 lbs. of blue"—I said, "How much money do you think you have had in all?"—he said, "About £7 or £8"—I said to Brandum, "You hear what he says; is that true?"—he said, "I have bought blue of the lad; I thought it was <hi rend="italic">perqs</hi>, or something of that"—I said, "Have you any blue, as I intend to search before I leave?"—I had not made up my mind then whether I should take Brandum into custody—he said he had only about 1 lb., which he showed me in a drawer—he assured me he had no more—I told him I should charge him with feloniously receiving this 25 lbs., well knowing it to be stolen—he previously told me he sold the blue as fast as he got it, and that it was used for dyeing purposes—I took them both to Seething Lane Police-station, and charged them—they made no reply—I found on Potter £2 10s. and these keys—three of them fit four sample rooms at No. 9, Mincing Lane, one fits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Kenyon and Son, indigo merchants—we have been missing indigo two or three years—on September 1st the police communicated with me—these are dock papers in which samples are packed—in this paper there was a 2 lb. sample—these two parcels correspond with the indigo which was on my premises—we got a dock sample with each parcel we bought in January last—our sample room is always kept locked—it is at the top of the house—the sample man has the key, but it is hanging up in the day, and locked up in the wife at night—this indigo is worth over £5—Potter was in the employ of a man named Walton, in Fenchurch Street, who had an office next door to me some years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When we receive indigo from the docks it is always in separate samples—it is not usual to mix indigo, it would deteriorate it, but dyers sometimes mix two kinds together—merchants send the old samples to the docks, and have them bulked there—it does not lose its colour by being kept—we never give away samples which have been on the shelf two or three years, it is too valuable—Potter's father is a carpenter and messenger.</p>

Watt said he had a purchaser for the ticket Watt went with Cutler and me to pledge the machine; we waited outside, and Watt pledged it. The money was afterwards equally divided between us"—I have made inquiries, and find there are no such firms as Dods and Co. or Watt and Co.—Watt only lived at the address; there is no business there.</p>

I live at 1, Cane Street, Chelsea, and am a dealer in pianos—on 22nd January Bovington came and gave the name of Leslie Vernon, and said he wanted a piano—this hiring agreement was prepared, which Bovington signed—before that he gave as a reference his lodger Myers, who had previously obtained an organ from me—we sent the piano to 2, Delvino Road—Bovington paid me 12s. 6d.—I got no more instalments—I went to 2, Delvino Road several times; I only saw a woman there—I never saw the piano there—I next saw it at Hammersmith Police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a sale-room at Clapham Railway Station—in February this year I went to Delvino Road in consequence of a letter I received—I there saw Bovington under the name of Leslie Vernon—he showed me a piano, and told me that it was his own piano that he had bought of a friend who was hard up some time before; that he (Bovington) was a professional singer, and was very ill and could not carry on his business as a singer, and being hard up he was compelled to sell it—finally I agreed to buy it for £9 10s., and I gave him £1 deposit, and sent for the piano next day, and sent him a cheque—next day he came and asked me to cash the cheque for him, as he was very hard up—I gave him a few shillings—next day I sent him £5, and told him to come for the balance—a day or two afterwards he came to my sale-room—another man came with him, but did not come into my sale-room; I saw and recognised him at the Police-court as Myers—I could not identify Bovington at that time because he had grown a beard, and when he first came to me he was a thin, pale-faced fellow—the piano was afterwards identified by Warby as his; it is downstairs—I afterwards bought it from Warby through his agent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector T</hi>). Bovington, in his statement to me, said this with regard to this matter: "About 22nd January, 1893, I obtained a piano from Mr. Warby in the name of Leslie Vernon; it was delivered to 2, Delvino Road. About a fortnight afterwards I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> that A Capes wanted to buy a piano. I sent the telegram produced to him about the advertisement. He called on me at 2, Delvino Road. After trying it he said, 'How much do you want for it?' I said £10. He said he did not want to give more than £9. I agreed to take £9 10s. He asked me if it was my property. The piano was taken away by Vigers, the carman who does his work."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bovington, in his defence, stated that he obtained the piano on the hire system, and disposed of it to Mr. Capes, who was to take over the contract on his behalf and pay for it, and that Warby accepted that arrangement.</hi>

I am cashier to Gerald Hunt and Son, animal charcoal manufacturers—the prisoner was in their employ—it was his duty to go out and buy bones and fat—he had money given him every morning, and a counterfoil book—he would go to our customers' shops purchase bones and fat, enter the weight and price, in this book, give the customer this part, and bring the counterfoil to the office signed by the customer—the storekeeper received the book; I found that it was short in some places—on May 30th the prisoner went out with £4, and returned with 12s. 11d.—on the counterfoil here is £3 0s. 7d. as paid. to Messrs. Johnson—there are also two other cash payments, 2s. 10d. and 3s. 8d.—on June 30th he went out with £4, and returned with 10s. 5d., which is purported to be signed for by Peek—on July 20th he took out £2, and the counterfoil says that he paid Mr. G. Brown, of Homerton, 15s. 3d.—he retained £1 4s. 9d.—he was</p>

               <p>called in in the presence of an officer, and I said, "In your collection of yesterday you have charged Brown 15s. 3d., but you have not paid it; you have kept the money and signed the customer's name"—he said, "I know I did"—I gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a weigh-bridge—the wagon would be weighed as it went out and when it came in—the bones and fat would be weighed—I have found him to bring short weight—on May 30th he went out with £4, and was supposed to have expended £3 7s. 1d.—the weight on the weigh-bridge was 40 cwt. 2 qr.—that was composed of different articles which would be weighed next day on the scale—it is not priced out—the price charged is a fair price—I believe that on May 30th the stuff delivered was a fair value for the amount paid—small men walk about from house to house to buy fat, and I have heard that the prisoner has been in the habit of buying from them—on 30th June 37 lb. 2 oz. is entered in the weigh-book £3 3s. 9d. would be a fair amount for that—I think he was taken in custody on July 2nd, and Brown's affair was the day before—he had £2 on the 15th, and spent 15s. 3d. for 22 cwt. 3 qr., but there are some shops where he gives credit—on May 26th he brought home 34 cwt. 1 qr.—he was given £5 that morning, and he brought back £1 17s. 10d., but we should have had 1/4 cwt. more, value 11d.</p>

I am a carpet salesman in the employ of Maple and Co., Limited, in Tottenham Court Road—I remember Mrs. Arbuthnot coming on Saturday, 8th July, and selecting a carpet—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I saw it at the Police-court, and examined it; the manufacturers' numbers are on it—it was supplied to us by Messrs. Crossley, of Halifax—to my knowledge no such carpets are supplied to any other parties within eight miles of Charing Cross—I have a note of the size of the carpet that Mrs. Arbuthnot bought, 12 ft. by 11 ft.—that is the size of this carpet; the price was £5 2s. for cash only—I have no knowledge of either of the prisoners—the carpet was put aside in the sold fixture; that is a place intended for the keeping of goods sold waiting for delivery—I made out a delivery note, which I have; if it had been delivered I should not have possession of it—no authority has ever been given for its leaving our place—I saw it in the sold fixture about a week after I sold it—I did not know it was gone until the police came and told us of it, about two days before I went before the Magistrate—I looked for it, and it was gone; the sold fixture is in the carpet department; it is a part of a room on the basement—I gave no authority for its removal—a carman was employed to take out goods, when he had a delivery note; he would then go to the fixture and take it out—it would be put on the delivery platform with the delivery note attached—no one but the porter would have a right to take anything out of the fixture.</p>

I was about 200 or 250 yards from Duke's shop, and saw two men (one was Kerslake, he was carrying this carpet, the other was Price, walking by his side); they were coming from Holborn towards Duke's shop, in conversation—having suspicion I watched them for a short time to see what they did with the carpet; it was very large and heavy—I followed them to the corner of Lascelles Place; they placed the carpet on the ground—they had a conversation, and Price picked up the carpet and took it into Duke's shop—Duke was standing at his door—Price went straight through the shop into the back without taking notice of Duke, without speaking to him—he was in there five or ten minutes—I lost sight of him, and thinking to get a better view from my top room I ran up to the staircase window, and I saw Duke and Price examining the carpet, and Duke was measuring it with a 2 ft. rule—it was laid flat out on the leads at the back—the carpet was then rolled up after some conversation, which I could not hear, and carried inside—I then kept observation again from the street; I saw Price come out hurriedly and join Kerslake at the corner of Lascelles Place—after having a short conversation with Kerslake he again went into Duke's shop—he was inside a short time, when Duke came to the door and looked out in all directions, shading his eyes from the sun, and looking everywhere, as though he was looking for a policeman—the first thing he did was to look to the fixed point, where there is generally a policeman in uniform, but he was not there—it is about six houses from Duke's—he then made motions with his finger to Price towards the back premises—Price ran out to the corner of Endell Street and entered the "Oporto Stores public-house—he was there joined by Kerslake—I went into the public-house in the same bar—they called for two glasses of stout—they had a conversation and shared out some money—I saw some money passing between them—Price was leaning over Kerslake and counting money out to him into his hand—I saw half sovereign in Price's hand—I could not say whether that was given to Kerslake or not—I also saw silver—I remained in there till they left; I never lost sight of them—they left together; I followed them—on the way I met Detective Temblett—he was not in uniform—he accompanied me—they went to the corner of Tottenham Court Road, to the Horseshoe Hotel—we did not go in there, we waited for them; they were in there about three minutes, then they came out and shook hands, and bade each other good night, and separated—I stopped Kerslake as he was leaving Price, and Temblett stopped Price—they were only a few yards apart—I asked Kerslake what he had done with the carpet he was carrying—he laughed, as though I was having a joke with him—he said, "You have made a grand mistake, I have seen no carpe"—I said, "Well, we shall have to ascertain something more about it, if you say you know nothing about it"—on the way to the station I think Kerslake said, "Where are you going to take us?"—I said, "I am going to take you where the carpet is"—he still said he knew nothing about it—he said,. "I don't know what you mean; I and my friend have been boozing in the public-house for some time"—we then all four went to Duke's shop—</p>

I have been in the police about five years—I have not stated that Duke changed colour a good deal, only "he hesitated"—I said, "He changed colour—I believe he took Temblett upstairs to see the carpet—I am positive that I said at the Police-court that I saw Duke standing in the doorway—I did not notice that that was omitted from the depositions; if I had I should have insisted on its correction—the depositions were not read over to me at the Police-court—I signed them three weeks afterwards, butt I am sure they were not read over to me—Mr. Saville was the clerk—the prisoners were first charged with unlawful possession, or something similar—there were several remands; ultimately the carpet was identified by Maples—the charge was then made for receiving—I say that my deposition was not read over to me on the 4th August—it is the practice to have the depositions read over after a witness has given his evidence, but it is not always done—if the deposition omits that I saw Price pass Duke at the door, I should say it is an omission on the part of the clerk—I also stated about Duke shading his eyes from the sun and looking round, as if for a policeman; that was not put down; Sir John Bridge did not allow it to be put down—I have never occupied a superior position in the police.</p>

On 2nd August, about a quarter to six, I was in Broad Street—Oxley spoke to me and called my attention to Price and Kerslake, and I followed them—they walked to Tottenham Court Road, and went into the Horseshoe—when they came out they separated—I spoke to Price; I told him I was a police officer, and said, "Where did you get the carpet you were carrying just now?"—he said, "I know nothing about a carpet, you have made a mistake, I have been in the public-house drinking quite an hour with my friend"—he had been there under five minutes—I took him to Duke's shop, and Oxley took Kerslake—we entered the shop—I saw Duke there—I said, "I want to see the carpet you bought of these men a few minutes ago"—he hesitated some moments, and then said, "Come this way"—he took me through the shop, upstairs to a room, unlocked the door, and showed me the carpet, standing up in a corner of the room; it was a bedroom, I imagine; there was a bed in it—I asked</p>

               <p>him what he gave for it—he said, "Thirty shillings"—he was taken down to the shop, and I told him he would be charged with the other two in stealing and receiving the carpet—he said, "I did not know it was stolen"—I said, "Have you any books or receipts to show how you conduct your business?"—he said, "No; I keep no books, and I have no receipts"—he was then taken to the station—Oxley searched the prisoners—I do not know what was found on them—I saw no new stuff in Duke's shop—it is an old curiosity shop—I found six new ivory-handled knives wrapped up, with the stamp of Spiers and Pond on them, and one plated fork, not new, bearing the same name—there were other new knives, five table-knives, six forks, and a carving-knife and fork, stamped "Oetzman"—I showed the Spiers and Pond knives to Duke, and said, "How do you account for these?"—he said, "I bought them of a man in the shop"—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What did you give for them?"—he said, "I don't remember."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 77, Dockhead, Bermondsey—on the early morning of Wednesday, 9th August, I was walking home through Markham Street, Chelsea, and sat down on a doorstep to tie up ray bootlace, when Nolan threw himself upon me; we struggled together, and were clenched for a minute or two—I called for assistance, two constables came, and I gave Nolan into custody, and charged him with stealing my watch, which I missed—as near as I can say, I had last seen it in the Brompton Road an hour and a half or two hours before—I also missed this little purse, with half a sovereign and 3s. in it, from my left trousers pocket, which was nearly torn out—I afterwards saw the purse at the Police-court—just previous to the constable arriving I noticed Brookhouse and Fitzgerald about twelve yards from me—they appeared to be in the middle of the road; I could not say whether they were on the pavement or not—when the second constable came I imagined they were coming towards me, and I gave them in charge—I dont know if they were coming to me, and I should not like to accuse them wrongly—I was sorry for doing so afterwards—I might have been wrong.</p>

               <p>their account—the next account is 29th May; on that account he owed me £969 18s. 5d.—he then gave me a cheque signed by him as secretary to the company—that cheque passed through my hand—I said nothing to him about that; we very often have paid cheques other than cheques of the person paying the money—so far I should assume that Douglass was in funds—up to that time he had always paid by his own cheques—I had no idea that the cheque was drawn, except on Douglass's account—I naturally assumed that he was in funds—I did not put any question to him as to whether he had any authority; he was very respectably introduced to us, and such a thing as the money being misused did not enter into my head—I knew he was with the Swift Beef Company as managing director—on 29th May he owed me £969 18s. 5d., and paid it with this cheque of the company on Hill and Sons, signed "Douglass, Secretary"—the stock was not carried over; it was paid by another broker—just about this time the affairs of the Stock Exchange were in an extremely unsettled, uncertain condition; the amount of stock we had open was very low, and in a conversation which I had Douglass offered, in order that there might be no misgiving on either side, to deposit a sum of £5,000; we on our part to do the same, so that there would be a total of £10,000 with some good bank; the London Joint Stock was mentioned—to that I replied that we on our side were not principals, only agents; therefore there was no need that we should find £5,000; I was glad to know he had money, as it gave me an opportunity to say that the account was larger than I thought—arrangements were consequently made, and the bulk of the stock was made up by Mr. Read, a member of the Stock Exchange—after that he kept a very small account, the total of which was only £15,000—on 29th June he paid me this cheque for £79 15s. 2d., that again being his private cheque on the London Joint Stock Bank—there Mere two other accounts after that, on which he owed us £133 10s. 8d., which has never been paid; it is still owing—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two statements I sent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last settlement was on 26th April—on that day, or immediately after, the prisoner settled with me—the 28th was pay-day; the 26th was carrying-over day—on the 28th he was clear with me—he told me, in the course of conversation, that he had associates in this matter—I cannot fix the date of that; we had a good many conversations, it would be impossible to recollect the dates of particular matters, but it came out in this way: I spoke of the account as a large one, involving heavy sums; it was then he said, "I have associates in this matter"—I should say that was before he began to pay me in cheques of the company—I should say that conversation was before the 23rd of May; I think I ought to explain that when the £5,000 deposit was mentioned, it was suggested that the account should be taken over, but we had conversation before that, and he mentioned that he had associates—he said he was prepared, if necessary, to take the whole of the stock over—I was always prepared to get stock for him if it had been demanded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange—I was formerly managing clerk to J. F. H. Read, 5, Austin Friars, a member of the Stock Exchange—on 18th April, 1893, an account was opened by the prisoner in the name of W. W. Douglass—on the 13th April, settling day, nineteen guineas stood to his credit—I paid that to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110085"/>
               <p>him by this cheque, marked "J"—this is the account; the stock was carried over—on 13th May he lost £515 11s. 2d.—the total amount of the transactions was £18,000—he paid me the amount of, £515 11s. 2d. with this cheque of the Swift Beef Company, signed "W. W. Douglass, Secretary"—this is the account—the next account was on May 29th, the stock being carried over; his loss was £1,061 18s. 3d., the amount of purchase being £52,000—on 15th June, the next settling day, he won, and I gave him a cheque for £258 6s. 3d.—on the account of 29th June he made a loss of £1,111 10s. 6d.—he paid that with this cheque, which is one of the company's cheques, the total amount of the stock being £53,000—on the next account, of 13th July, there was a balance of £584 3s. 8d., which he did not pay; he still owes me that—the stock was always carried over, nothing was taken up, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Read was declared a defaulter on 11th July—July 13th was the account day; in all probability the prisoner would have heard on that day that Mr. Read was declared a defaulter; under these circumstances there would be a difficulty in the account being carried over—the account day in April was the 28th; he settled up with me on that day, and we were perfectly straight—I had a discussion with him as to the advisability of taking up some stock; that was a few days preceding the 31st May; it was decided that it should be carried over if possible—he offered that if there was any difficulty in carrying over the stock with Mr. Cornforth,. he would arrange to have it taken up—I believe there was some mention about a certain bank re-discounting Swift's paper—there was a general uneasiness all round at that time—I do not remember his saying that owing to his bills having been re-discounted he was only able to take up one out of four, which he was desirous of paying before maturity—it was common knowledge that immediately after May set in there was considerable uneasiness among banks and commercial undertakings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Whish and Todd, stockbrokers—in February this year the defendant opened an account with our firm in his own name; I have the ledger here—at the end of March I think his loss was £346 8s.—on 14th April it was £151 7s. 3d.—he paid that with this cheque on his private account, and this is the account—on 28th April he won £36 3s. 6d., which I paid him with this cheque, and this is a copy of the account—on 13th May he won £24 3s. 2d., which I paid him with this cheque, and this is a copy of the account—on 29th May his loss was £32 11s. 4d., which he paid me with this cheque on his private account—on 15th June he paid me this cheque for £89 3s. 7d. on his private account, and this is the account—on 29th June he gave me this cheque for £182 9s. 10d. on his private account; this is the account—on the settling days of 13th July and 28th July there was a loss amounting to £1,714 2s. 7d.; that has not been paid, it is still owing to our firm—he did not at any time pay with a cheque of the Swift Beef Company that I know of.</p>

Id. in his favour—I produce a paying-in slip marked "J," referring to £255 10s. 10d. paid in by him on 29th April, including a cheque for £19 19s. and £56 6s. 6d. from Browning and Todd, and £179 8s. 4d. drawn by Cornforth and Readier—this is a cheque marked "G" for £400, which was paid in on 28th June, 1893; it is drawn by the Swift Beef Company, W. W. Douglass, Secretary, on Hill and Sons, and was paid into the prisoner's private account with this paying-in slip—I produce a paying-in slip, "K," and Mr. Read's cheque, "K," for £258 6s. 3d., dated 14th June, 1893, payable to Douglass—it is placed to the credit of his account.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly deputy-manager at West Smithfield for the Swift Beef Company, from about 1st February, 1892, to 7th August this year, when I was appointed secretary of the company—besides myself 'at the West Smithfield office doing business for the company; there were Mr. Conning, cashier and book-keeper, and Mr. Croger, clerk, and an office boy, and the secretary—all the papers that I have seen here purporting to be signed by the prisoner are in his writing—he was the head of the office—he received the correspondence from Chicago, and was the only person authorised to open it—he would receive the amounts passed at Chicago for the regulation of the business in England; they are pasted or written up into the book that has been produced here—the prisoner was secretary and general manager of its affairs in England; he had to see to the handling of the goods sent here, and was a sort of financier of the company—he had to do with the cash of the company, and the sale and disposing of the goods—he drew cheques and accepted bills—I was not aware that he was speculating on the Stock Exchange with the company's money—I knew he was speculating with his own money; I should think I first knew it in May this year—I think on 3rd August this year I first knew that he had taken any money of the company for the purpose of fulfilling an engagement on the Stock Exchange—I did not know till then that any of the company's money was being used for the purpose of such speculation—we had a purchase and sale account at our bank; it would indicate to anyone looking at it purchases made of goods to be resold—we buy mutton here to sell again, and beef would come from America to be sold here—I left Chicago in November, 1891—Mr. Swift returned from England in July of that year—Mr. G. F. Swift has not, to my knowledge, been here since July, 1891—some of the younger sons have been here since—I was in their business house in Chicago for about seven years—I have never been informed of any speculative transactions on the Stock Exchange by any of the Swifts—I had a conversation with the prisoner about the end of July, 1893, in Charles Pritchard's public-house, 105, Charterhouse—he asked me if I had heard anything regarding him upon the market—I said, "No, only that people have inquired where you have been"—he said, "I have been dealing on the Stock Exchange, and I am now unable to meet my losses, and I tell you this so that you will be prepared if you should hear anything"—shortly after I received a communication, and I subsequently made inquiries into the books and accounts—I think the prisoner was in the City when I did so—I found that these sums of money had been taken for gambling purposes—I communicated with Mr. Swift, and this prosecution followed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was a clerk in Swift's Railway Claims Department, and kept certain books in Chicago relating to that department—their business is carried on at their head office, the Union Stock Yards, and they have also an office connected with the Board of Trade, at 142, La Serle Street—the Board of Trade is where merchants meet, and buy and sell produce in advance—some of that business is speculative—they deal in "futures" for forward delivery—I never knew of Mr. Swift buying railway shares—the Hammond, Morris, and Eastman Meat Companies are well known in Chicago—I have no knowledge of whether there is buying</p>

                  </hi>. I went into the service of the Swift Beef Company in August, 1891, and was book-keeper and cashier—during most of that time the prisoner has been superintendent of the office and business—there has been an account opened between him and the Swift Beef Company—my attention was called to a cheque drawn on 14th April, 1893, for £500—I was not aware of it at the time—I did not part with that cheque, and knew nothing of its contents till it was returned from the bankers, except what was told me—it was our custom to state on the counterfoil for what purpose the cheque was drawn—the prisoner told me to enter the cheque to his own private account temporarily—he said he was about to open a special account, to which this cheque would have to be ultimately entered, but that he would give me the name of that account later—he did not tell me what the £500 was used for—I charged it Accordingly to his account in the cash-book, and then posted it in the ledger on 14th April—at that time there were certain other items to his debit and an item to his credit, but practically the account was balanced with the exception of this £500, which was owing on 14th—on 29th April he said, "How much will be necessary to close my account?"—I. gave him the figures; after giving him credit for his month's salary there would be £431 9s. 7d.—he gave me two cheqnes, one for £200 on Hills' Bank, and one for £231 9s. 7d. on the London Joint Stock Bank—about 13th May the prisoner spoke to me about some more cheques—these two cheques are dated the 12th—I did not see them when they were drawn, and had nothing to do with the parting of them to anyone—I saw the counterfoil entries, which were in the prisoner's writing, "J. H. Read, charge W. W. D. £515 11s. 2d. "; and "W. Cornforth and Co., charge W. W. D. £1,012 13s."—I charged those to the prisoner's private account—the prisoner told me to enter them—he called me into the private office on 12th May, and began by telling me that he had something to tell me in confidence—he said, "In order that there may be somebody in the office, should anything happen to me, who may know the nature of the entries you are about to make," and he then told me he had invested money in stocks; that Mr. G. F. Swift favoured certain stocks (he mentioned Milwaukee, I don't remember the other names), and that as he had not decided upon a name for this new account which would have to be opened, I had better in the meantime put the amounts to his own private account—accordingly on the 13th I debited his private account with £1,528 4s. 2d. out of these two cheques—I certainly was not aware then that this money was going to pay for differences on the Stock Exchange;</p>

               <p>he did not say anything to me about that—at the end of the month I had in the ordinary course of my duties to go through my ledgers, and make out a trial balance-sheet, and I noticed that we had a page headed "Purchase and Sale Account" with only one line used on it; and as he had not decided on the name of the account for the investments I suggested that we should utilise this blank page, headed as it was, "Purchase; and Sale Account"—the prisoner adopted the suggestion and said, "That will do very well"—he told me I must transfer the entries £1,528 4s. 2d., which were placed to his debit in the middle of the month, to that account, and I credited his account with an entry against purchases and sales £1,528 4s. 2d., and then I debited the purchases and sales with the £1,528 48. 2d., so that the prisoner's account was cleared of that £1,528—at the end of May I found, on looking at the cheque-book, a cheque drawn and entered in the counterfoil in the prisoner's writing: "May 29th, 1893, W. Cornforth and Company, charge purchase and sale account £969 18s. 5d."—on May 30th there is another entry: "J. F. K.

F. H. Read, charge purchase and sale account £1,111 10s. 6d."—I never heard from the prisoner that they related to differences or losses on the Stock Exchange; I believed they represented purchases, and that we had scrip for them—at the end of each month I sent to America a trial balance-sheet—the prisoner would sign each sheet; he knew of them being sent—this is the one for 31st May; the debtor and creditor account is sent to show the state of the English company—I find the debit market investment £4,046; that is the price of the purchase of the stall in the market—I find purchases and sales are £3,560 6s. 10d., that is the first four cheques—in the trial sheet of 30th June I find the purchase and sale account £5,071 11s. 4d.—we did not as a rule write a letter with these statements, but simply remitted them—I don't know that the prisoner did not write a private letter and enclose it.

's account in our ledger, which is made up of bills payable upon acceptance, and so on—towards the end or middle of April Messrs. Swift changed the length of time at which they drew their bills from eighteen to sixty days, and the effect of that was we began to carry larger balances at the bank, the meat being sold before the bills were due.</p>

I am a hatter, of 5, Cutler Street, Houndsditch—about November 12th the prisoner called about business—I was very short of money, and he said he would see me in the morning, which he did, and said, "Are you really in want of money?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "£20 or £30?"—I said, "That would be a great help"—he said, "I don't want anything out of it unless you put me on a new hat," which I did—he produced this bill for £20 17s. 10d. at three months; it is now four months—it was not altered by my authority—he called in a few days and said his friend was out of town; could I <hi rend="italic">rub on</hi> till Christmas?—I said "Yes," and on January 2nd he said, "I can't get that d—d bill done; you must give me two smaller ones. Give me one for £9 and one for £13"—he filled them up and I accepted them, and said, "Give me the other bill"—he said, "I threw it on the fire this morning"—if I had believed he had kept it I would not have given him the two smaller bills—George Payne was present—I was sued on the £9 and £13 bills, and execution levied on me—about January 25th I heard that the £20 bill had not been destroyed, and I saw it and pointed out an alteration on it—these bills are in the prisoner's writing—I have no doubt that the alteration from three to four months is his writing; I did not authorise it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher—in June this year I advertised a cart mare for sale, and received a letter signed "Jewell," which I did not keep—it had a printed heading like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), describing him as a horse contractor and cab proprietor—he came and saw the mare, and asked me her price and age; I said £50, and that she was six years old—he offered me £47; I said I could not sell her for that—he offered me £48, which I took, and we went and had a glass of ale—I asked him what he was contractor for—he said for roads, that his father and mother had just died and left him with the business—he came back to the house with me and gave me this cheque, post-dated six days, for a trial of the mare—I allowed him to take her away in the afternoon; he said he had to meet some horses coming up by the Great Western Railway—on July 3rd I received this letter from him: "Dear Sir,—Please do not present cheque, if possible, for two or three days; I have a heavy bill to meet, and if you will do me this favour I shall be very much obliged"—I wrote to him and told him I would keep the cheque back—I paid it in on July 6th, and it was returned on the 10th marked "N. S."—I went to his house, but did not find him at home—I met him in the Seven Sisters Road, but he did not appear to notice me—I followed him to some stables and told him the cheque was not right—he said, "I have just come from the bank and have placed money there which will meet your cheque"—I sent the cheque to my bankers the next day and it was returned on the 14th marked "Account closed"—I had no knowledge that he had sold my mare—I asked him where she was—he said, "At the stable that I have just come from when you saw me drive up the hill"—after the matter was in the hands of the police I saw her at Mr. Clarkson's and identified her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not instituted these proceedings in the hope of recovering my money; I never attempted to get a debt through a Policecourt in my life—I went to his mother's house before these proceedings commenced; that was his address—I did not say that if I did not get the money I would take criminal proceedings—I said I saw Mrs. Jewell, and said if it was not paid by six I would show them what I would do; if she had paid me I should not have come here—I have a very good memory, but you caught me making a mistake—the false pretences which caused me to part with the mare were, first, the letter headed, "Horse contractor and cab proprietor"; second, he said that he had fourteen</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 72, Dean Street, Soho—in 1888 I carried on business there as Welchman and Co., manufacturing goldsmiths—about 8th November, 1888, I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a partner with capital—in answer I received this letter, dated 9th November, 1888, from Mildred and Cousins, 5, John Street, Bedford Row. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they might arrange for financial assistance to the extent of £1,000 on Welchman's acceptances, without partnership, at a moderate rate of interest; that if Welchman would call they could enter into particulars; and that they were not connected with loan offices, and charged no preliminary fees</hi>)—in consequence of that letter I called with my brother-in-law, Mr. Jackson, at No. 5, John Street—I saw Hill, whom I addressed as Cousins; he answered to that name—I said I had called respecting the letter—he said, "I can arrange a loan for £1,000"—I said I wanted £500—he said I had better have £1,000, or words to that effect—he said the money was to be raised by bills, that he had several rich friends abroad who would get them discounted—he first asked me if the business was mine—I said, "Yes"—he asked if I could give a reference to my bankers; I said I could, and I mentioned the City Bank, Bond Street Branch—he told me to call again in a day or so—that interview was about 12th November, 1888—a day or two afterwards I called again with Mr. Jackson—nothing of consequence then took place, except that Hill said he had not heard from his friends abroad—at the third interview I had with Hill, Mr. Jackson being present, I accepted seven bills altogether on the day they bear date, 15th November—these are five of the bills I then accepted, all payable at four months; they are for £98, £58 7s., £183 4s., £97 3s., £192 8s.—with the other two bills it made a total of £1,000—there was no drawer's name on the bills when I accepted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110101"/>
               <p>them—I said I had never been accustomed to bills drawn as these were, with the words "mutual accommodation" on them; he said it was merely a matter of form, and quite right—the words "mutual accommodation" had not been mentioned; he said he had discounted thousands and thousands of pounds worth of bills—he said I was to get the money in less than a week—I believed his statements—on the same day, after accepting the bills, I received this letter from him, dated 15th November. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mildred and Cousins, with Welshman's authority, undertook as principals to draw upon Welchman, either by themselves or nominees, for their mutual accommodation, to the extent of</hi> £1,000, <hi rend="italic">and would endeavour to get the acceptances discounted at a moderate rate, not to exceed, as to interest or renewals</hi>, 6 <hi rend="italic">per cent, and half cost of bill stamps; that of the net proceeds Welchman was to be credited with</hi> 75 <hi rend="italic">per cent., and when the bills were ultimately paid off, Welchman undertook to provide in that proportion, the drawers being responsible for the remainder; and that the bills were to be kept renewed for five years if required. On the back was written</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">In reply to your letter of</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th we agree to fulfil the conditions therein</hi>")—I know something was said about the words, "mutual accommodation before I signed the bills—I objected to it, and Hill said it was only a matter of form—I wrote to Mildred and Cousins, after receiving the letter of 15th, in the terms of the draft on the back—on November 17th I received this letter, purporting to be signed by Frank Goldring. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the acceptance for</hi> £122 12s. <hi rend="italic">of November</hi> 15th, 1888, had <hi rend="italic">been placed before him for discount, and that he was prepared to do so subject to the bank references, and to a letter from Welchman to die effect that Goldring was authorised to draw and endorse the acceptance for</hi> £122 12s., <hi rend="italic">the same being in order and given for value, and that he must be protected in this manner, as the matter had been introduced to him by an agent, and he had to pay the money to them</hi>)—I wrote an answer to Goldring and Co., 7, South Square, in the terms of this endorsement on the back of the letter—I said to Hill, "I have had a communication from a Mr. Goldring"—he replied he knew him very well; he was a most respectable man; and that he had known him for years, I think, he said—I waited for several days before X called again, but my brother in-law went up—I waited for the money, but finding it did not come I called on Hill again in a few days—I asked him why the money had not been sent—he said he had not heard from my banker, which had caused delay—I went to my bank and made inquiries, and then I returned to see Hill, but he had gone—I waited a little longer and the money did not come—I wrote and then called, but Hill was not in—several days afterwards, later in November, I saw him and had a conversation with him—he said the reference at the bank was quite satisfactory, and that I should have the money in a few days—I never had any money—I called several times at 5, John Street, and he offered me some of the money—when I called a young boy answered the door—I saw Hill again before 12th December—I said I was very much annoyed at the delay, and I should like my bills back again—he said, "I am responsible for the bills; if you will only wait a few days you shall have your money"—on 12th December I received this letter, enclosing the bills for £58 7s., £97 3s., and £192 8s.—the drawer's name had been torn off them.

                  <hi rend="italic">in accordance with the desire expressed in Welchman's letter, but without prejudice to their rights under the agreement for mutual accommodation, and that the other bills were not at present in their possession, but that they would communicate with the various holders</hi>)—this is a copy of my reply on 17th December. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that she had received a letter from Messrs, Holt and Son, of Willenhall., stating that Mr. F. Goldring had offered them one of her acceptances, and asking if it was correct, and that she had written to Messrs. Holt stating it was correct, and would be paid by her if discounted; that she was. much annoyed at the delay, and that unless all her bills were returned on Wednesday,19th ins., she should take means to get them</hi>)—I received this letter of 19th December from Mildred and Cousins, enclosing my acceptance for £98 1s.; the drawer's name was torn off—afterwards my acceptance for £183 4s. was returned in another letter—the drawer's name had been torn off that—I wrote this letter of 29th December to Mildred and Cousins. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she should instruct her solicitors to take proceedings if the acceptances for</hi> £248 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> £122 <hi rend="italic">were not returned by Tuesday, January</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>)—I put the matter into the hands of Messrs. Marshall and Haslip, my solicitors—while I was waiting for the money Hill asked me if it would be convenient for me to take £100, as he had not discounted the bills yet—I said, "No, I would have it altogether"—I have never received any money for the bills—I have had to pay my solicitor's costs, amounting to over £80—no proceedings were taken against me upon the two bills that were not returned to me—there were proceedings against Mildred and Cousins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising in partnership as Marshall and Haslip, at 6, Martin Lane, Cannon Street—we were solicitors for Mrs. Welchman in the Chancery action of Welchman against Mildred and Cousins—Messrs. Norris and Son acted as the solicitors for the defendants—an order was obtained, drawn up on 8th March, 1889, in the action—I had an interview with Mr. Norris on 25th February—he said the larger of the two bills had been paid away, and that a sum of £25, I think it was, had been borrowed on the smaller of the two bills, and I think the suggestion was made that we should pay £25 to get the smaller bill back, but that he could do nothing with the larger bill—I declined his offer—on 8th March, 1889, this order was made in the action. (<hi rend="italic">This restrained the defendant or his agent from parting or dealing with the bills mentioned in the summons, and ordered the defendant to pay into Court within four days</hi> £178 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">being three-fourths of the amount received by him on discounting the bill for</hi> £248)—notice of that injunction was served on Goldring—on 12th March, four days after the order, I saw Goldring, who came to my office with another gentleman, who was a solicitor, I believe, and he stated that he had discounted the £122 bill at the Central Bank, and suggested that we should pay something to take it up—I declined to pay anything, and said he must give me the bill back—on 18th March he called again, and said. he had the bill—I told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110103"/>
               <p>him to give the bill to me—he said, "I have not it with me, but I will send it on," or "You will have it," words to that effect—he never sent it to me—I wrote to his address once for it, I think; I never got it—the injunction was all we required at that time, and we discontinued the action in consequence of an arrangement we made with Mr. Norris—in the result Mrs. Welchman had nothing to pay but my costs, which were over £70.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hill.</hi> She never had to meet any of her bills—you were ordered to pay £178 into Court—we applied for an attachment, but failed—it was proved you had not had the money, but your affidavits in the action swore that the bill had been discounted, and it was stated in Court that you had received £175; afterwards it was stated that instead of receiving money you had passed the bill away for another bill, and that was why the motion for attachment failed—it was proved on your affidavit that you never had the £178, because it was ascertained what the real facts were.</p>

We got the order on 8th March—we never went to any statement of claim—I should say the greater part of the £70 costs was over the injunction, because the affidavits were made for that—the motion for attachment was dismissed, and Hill had to pay the costs, because he had stated that he had received £175 for the bill, and it was afterwards ascertained that he had done nothing of the sort—about £20 of the costs were for the application for attachment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the London and Midland Bank, Newgate Street, with which the Central Bank of London was amalgamated two years ago, and of whose books we have possession—I produce discount account of Frank Goldring and Co., taken from books in possession of the bank—I have compared the account with the books, and find it correct—on 26th November, 1888, the account is credited with a bill for £122 12s.—Welchman and do. are the acceptors—also on 11th March, 1889, a bill for £95138. 6d., accepted by E. H. Newby—I also produce a copy of the current account of Frank Goldring and Co.—I have compared it with the books and find it correct—it extends from 29th January, 1887, to 31st December, 1889—on 26th November, 1888, I find the account is credited with Welchman's bill for £122 12s.—the account is still open—at the end of 1889 the amount was 6s. 6d.—on 11th March, 1889, I find the account credited with Newby's bill for £95 13s. 6d.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. The current account was practically closed when Goldring became bankrupt in November, 1889—from January, 1887, to November, 1889, the total discounts by the Central Bank for Goldring amounted to £11,122 7s. 10d.—the 6s. 6d. was in Goldring's favour—the Central Bank did not lose anything by his account—when he became bankrupt the bank held a large number of his bills not due—I cannot say the amount—the bank did not lose by his bills ultimately—Goldring had had a discount account with a Mr. Hazell from February, 1880, to July, 1882—there was a break in the discount account between July, 1882, and January, 1887, the discount account of Hazell and Goldring having stopped in 1882—I think Goldring had a current account running</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The discount account was closed on the dissolution of the partnership in 1882, and the bank realised the bills in their possession—New by paid the £95; we generally expect the acceptor to pay—Newby's bill was not met at maturity—it was paid subsequent to the bankruptcy, within a few days of it becoming due—I now find it had matured on June 29th, and was paid by Newby a few days after the due date—the exact due date was the 4th July—the £122 12s. bill was due March 18th, 1889—it was not met at maturity—it was debited to Goldring's account on May 17th, 1889—it was dishonoured by the acceptor—it was kept in our hands; we keep a bill if there are not sufficient funds to debit it—there was not sufficient—later there was, when we debited it and gave it up to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 8, Bucklersbury, City—in February, 1889, I advertised for a partner with capital—in reply I received a letter which I have lost, in consequence of which I went to 5, John Street, Bedford Row—I saw Hill, who answered to the name of Cousins, about 26th February, 1889—I said who I was, and produced his letter, and said I had called respecting it—he said he would be able to supply any financial assistance I might require, without a partnership, upon certain terms—I asked his terms—he said, so far as my memory serves me, "Six per cent, per annum"—I agreed to his terms, but I simply heard them on the first occasion—this was the second occasion—on the 26th, when I went again, I entered into a written agreement with Hill—I signed the three bills of exchange, and this acceptance of an agreement (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this bill for £96 8s. at four months, from 26th February, 1889, drawn by G. Willington, was not so drawn when I accepted it, but the drawer's name was in blank—on the bill for £57 18s. 6d. for four months, from 26th February, the drawer's name is so obliterated I cannot read it—there are two endorsements in a similar condition—the bill for £95 13s. 6d. is drawn by Frank R. Goldring and Co.—the drawer and endorser had not their name upon it when I endorsed it—I got this receipt for the bills of 26th February, 1889. (<hi rend="italic">Produced receipt for bills amounting to</hi> £250, <hi rend="italic">stating</hi>: "We anticipate to hand your drawer proceeds about Friday next")—I think it must have been about Tuesday when I signed it—I did not get my share of the proceeds—I called upon Hill on several occasions for the money, but never got any—he said they had passed out of his hands for discount when I asked for the bills back, and that he was waiting for the proceeds—this went on for two or three weeks—later I wrote for the return of the bills—my solicitor, Mr. Badcock, got the bill for £57 18s. 6d. back after the proceedings were commenced for the whole of them—I had to pay the acceptance in full on that bill, also my solicitor's costs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of the High Court; I have practiced upwards of twenty years—my office is 23, Rood Lane, City—Mr. Newby consulted me in reference to an action brought by him against Mildred and Cousins, Frank Goldring, and G. Willington—the writ was issued on April 6th, 1889, for the delivery up of the three bills of exchange, for damages, and an injunction—Willington made an appearance, but we. obtained judgment through his default of pleading; he put in no statement of defence, I think, and the matter was referred to the sheriff—I believe the writ was served on all the defendants—Goldring was served on 25th April by my late clerk, and he answered interrogatories—I think issue was joined, but my managing clerk attended to the matter—the notice of trial would be on the record; I have no doubt it wad given—we did not proceed against Goldring further than the notice of trial, as I was informed he was an undischarged bankrupt; therefore I do not think we gave him notice of trial—the end of the matter was: shortly before the action came on for trial I had a conference with Mr. Newby; he thought nothing would be obtained from them if the thing went to trial, and as he did not want the publicity and expense of a trial it was decided to discontinue the action, each party paving his own costs—my managing clerk made those terms—Mr. Newby had to pay one bill in full; that was discounted by Goldring at the Central Bank—with regard to the bill discounted by Willington at the National Bank, an action was brought to recover; we paid, and as we had a balance against Willington we deducted it—; £95 13s. 6d. was paid to the Central Bank, and £71 9s. 6d. in respect to the second bill to the London Provident Bank, I think; and the third, the small bill for £57, we got back—I cannot tell you what the costs were.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This proposed other bills for larger amounts</hi>)—prior to that I had discussed with Hill the likelihood of doing further business—I think the amount of £20,000 had been mentioned—of course I was bound to listen, but my only object was to get my bill back, I had not intended to do other business with him; I found I had got into wrong hands—on my return home I wrote this letter of April 19th.

On Thursday I shall remit you the proceeds. I never heard of Flanagan, and neither I or the drawer ever offered your bill to him"—on 28th April I received this letter enclosing £100 in notes, and two bills of exchange, one for £259 17s. 11d., dated 24th April, at four months, drawn by Oswald and Co., and this bill, accepted by J.

I am a member of the firm of Cumberland and, Sons, auctioneers, Luton—Asa Clark is a friend of mine—I was aware of the negotiations going on with Bowerman (whom I knew as Harrison) about these bills—I assisted Clark in endeavouring to get the bills back, and I both wrote and called on Bowerman with reference to their recovery—on 3rd February, 1892,1 received this letter from Harrison and Co., enclosing the bill for £100; and on 11th February I received another letter from them, enclosing the acceptance for £166 18s. 4d. (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained a postscript</hi>, "We consider we have a good cause of action for breach of agreement")—I knew Goldring, who lived and carried on an architect's business at Dunstable, near Luton—in February, 1892, he called on me; that was before the date on which the bill was sent back by Harrison; I had not communicated with him before he called—about eleven on the morning of the day he called this acceptance had been brought by Frederick Hucklesby, a straw-plait merchant, who asked me if I knew anything about it—the drawer's name on the bill was George Hill—I did not see any endorsement; I only had the bill a few minutes, and then Hucklesby took it away; he said he had been offered £20 to discount it—Goldring came; about four o'clock, and said he had come about the bill that Hucklesby had shown me that morning; that it had come into his (Goldring's) possession from a man who owed him about £80, and had sent him this bill to discount, and sent him the balance after deducting the amount—I told Goldring this bill and others had been obtained by fraud from Mr. Clark, and they must be returned—Goldring then said, "The man must be a d—d scamp to send it to me," referring to the debtor, and he would take care the bill would go back, and not be dealt with—he did not mention, and I did not ask him, the name of the person to whom he owed the £80—he went away—that was the only conversation I had with him with reference to this bill—I have known him ever since he has been at Dunstable, two or three years—I did not know him intimately.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> 56, <hi rend="italic">Parliament Hill Road, Hampstead, and signed George Hill, and stated that if at any time he should be in need of financial assistance the writer would be pleased to arrange for the same upon acceptances only, on favourable terms</hi>)—I kept that by me for twelve or eighteen months, and on the 28th January, 1892, I sent this letter on my memorandum form to George Hill, 56, Parliament Hill Road. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt of Hill's letter of August</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">and stated that having extended his plant, and made a bad debt of</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> £600, <hi rend="italic">if Hill could lend him that amount on reasonable terms lie could use it to great advantage</hi>)—in reply I received this letter of January 29th from George Hill. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the security required would be Midgley's acceptances, which Hill would draw or cause to be drawn, and would negotiate if they were satisfactory; that Midgley would be entitled to</hi> 80 <hi rend="italic">per cent., and Hill to</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the proceeds until the bills were paid off, when Midgley should find the</hi> 80 <hi rend="italic">per cent, and Hill be responsible for the remainder, and that the bills might be kept renewed for two years if required, Midgley paying interest at</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, on his portion</hi>)—shortly afterwards I went to London, and I wrote to Hill from the Salisbury Hotel. (<hi rend="italic">This letter asked Hill to meet him at</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Great Tower.

(<hi rend="italic">These bills were dated 1st February, at four month, and were for</hi> £137 0s. 6d., £187 9s. 6d., <hi rend="italic">and</hi> £96 3s.; <hi rend="italic">the drawer's name was torn off the first two, and was left blank in the third</hi>)—I received this letter from him at the interview. (<hi rend="italic">This was similar to that in previous cases; to the effect that Hill undertook as a principal to enter into the arrangement for their mutual accommodation upon the terms expressed in the previous letter</hi>)—at that time I handed back to Hill this letter headed "Seed Hill, Huddersfield," but written at 56, Parliament Hill Road: "We are in receipt of your letter of this date, and agree to the contents therein named"—I received from Hill this receipt for the four bills on the terms of his letter—the fourth acceptance was for £84 7s.—I believe that there were no drawers' names to the bills at the time I signed them—I went back to Huddersfield—I received these letters of February 3rd and 4th from Hill.

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that it was necessary to conduct the business with great tact and delicacy, in order that his bankers might not have an inkling of what was taking place; that he was using his best exertions compatible with caution, and should remit part at an early date</hi>)—I got the telegram of February 8th.

I was not examined on the trial of Goldring <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Midgley; I was not there; I was not in London at the time—I received a telegram from Goldring asking whether a certain bill was in proper order; I could not toll you the date; I don't know whether it was before the 8th of February; I think it was in March last year—I sent a telegram back to Goldring stating that it was in order—I don't remember getting another telegram from Goldring asking me to write—the signature to this letter is mine—looking at this letter, I can say that the telegram must have been before 9th February—I sent that letter at Midgley's instruction—besides that telegram from Goldring to Hill, he requested me to communicate with Goldring—Goldring did not produce or show me a receipt at the interview at Huddersfield—I was there the whole time—I don't know that I have ever seen the letter of 8th May, 1892, from Goldring to my firm—I think I have seen this letter before; I see it refers to a receipt—I don't remember Goldring showing a receipt; he showed his cheque-book, in which he showed me three counterfoils of cheques payable to Hill, the proceeds of the bill—I don't remember what I saw on the counterfoils—I do not say that he did not produce a receipt; I don't remember it—in his letter he said nothing about bringing the cheque-book—he conversed with me about the consideration for the bill; he told me it was partly in cash, by cheque, and partly in respect of money due and owing from Hill to Goldring; I think he said three cheques; the discount was less than £5 7s.—he also told me there was an old debt as well—I don't remember that he said how much—he said there was £40 or £50 owing to him by Hill—I saw the amount of the cheque—I could not swear to the amount—the cheque and the amount he told me, and the £5 7s., made up the amount of the bill—I do not recollect a letter from Goldring about not making further inquiries at his bank after he had been to Huddersfield.</p>

I have lived at Dunstable nearly five years—Goldring came to live there in November, 1890, and practised as an architect and land agent—he had an office—he was agent for Major Brown—he opened the account in November, 1891, prior to which he tanked at Bassetts', a country bank of long standing—until this charge was made I never knew anything to his discredit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not know when he came to England—the account is not closed now, there is a balance of a few shillings; it has been inoperative since May 27th, 1893, when he was debited with a small cheque for 12s. 6d.—on 25th April, 1893, there was a cheque to Lord for £10 19s.—at Michaelmas, 1892, he had an active account; he paid in £900 2s. 8d., and on that date there was a balance of £2 1s. 6d.—in the previous quarter, June, the account was fluctuating; it was sometimes overdrawn—there was a balance of £4 18s. 11d. in June; we charged him with that—£275 was paid in on September 5th—about that time, I think, he opened an account at the Civil Service Bank, a small bank in London—the balance now is not made up; it is only a few shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting engineer and metal<lb/>lurgist at Totnes, Devonshire—on January 11th, 1892, I had a letter from Hill, and these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) passed between us—on 15th or 16th February, I called on him at 56, Parliament Hill Road, Hampstead—he said he was prepared, upon the terms of his letter, to discount, and that he was accustomed to do a very large business in this direction, and to deal with large sums, from £10,000 to £20,000 in a few days at any time—he said that he had been in the discounting line for some years—nothing definite took place at that interview—afterwards we had some correspondence, and on October 21st, 1892, I saw Hill and asked him whether he was still willing to discount my acceptances—he said, "Yes"—after that I received these letters of 21st October, and 1st and 2nd November—the last letter contained these five bills of the face value together of £600; there was no drawer's name on them—I accepted them and returned them to Hill. (<hi rend="italic">These bills were</hi> £63 8s., <hi rend="italic">drawn by F. Dastis</hi>; £191 11s., <hi rend="italic">drawn by A.

It was similar in terms to the letter in the previous cases, stating that Mr. Chenhall would be entitled to</hi> 80 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the proceeds, which he would have to repay when the bills were presented</hi>)—after accepting the bills further correspondence took place between me and Hill, and on 28th November I received a letter from Hill enclosing a Bank of England note for £50, and a bill of 4th November, 1892, for £48 3s., accepted by James B. Gibbins and Co.—I signed it as drawer—there was in the letter also an acceptance drawn by J. H. Allen and Co., and accepted by Holgate and Co., dated 21st November, for £128 7s. 7d.—I telegraphed and wrote to Hill, repudiating it as not in accordance with the agreement—I presented the two bills for payment when they became due; they were dishonoured—not being able to get any satisfaction, I instituted proceedings to recover such of my bills as had not passed out of his hands—I received from Hill this letter of 3rd December, enclosing the acceptance for £151 11s., and this letter of 7th December, enclosing the acceptance for £98 17s. 6d., and I also received this acceptance for £94 12s.; they were all mutilated—my two other bills for £63 8s. and £191 11s.

Dastis, of 72, Mark Lane, and accepted by J. W. Chenhall, of Totnes, in Devon—when Hill sent that bill he offered to make me an allowance of £30 in consequence of Oates and Runciman's affair; it was not a debt from Hill to me, but I had made loss over the previous transactions in which Hill had watches and jewellery—I supplied him with watches and jewellery for the balance—Chenhall did not meet his bill, and I issued a writ and recovered judgment—I received this letter from Hill, of 7th March, 1893.

               <p>—after he had talked me into it, to my surprise he brought out the bills from his pocket-book, which I accepted—they were already drawn, but without the drawer's and acceptor's names, but with the dates and amounts—the face value of the bills amounted to £1,008, the amounts being £95 17s. 6d., £92 9s., £155 13s., £278 12s., £194 2s., and £191 8s. 6d.—I called his attention to the amount being £1,008—he said, "It does not matter; you will receive 80 per cent, of the value, so it will not make any difference to you"—I said, "Let me distinctly understand you before I enter into this business: if I hand you acceptances for £1,000 you give me £800 in cash, and on the due date you hand me the remaining 20 per cent."—I am sure the word "cash" was used—he said, "That is exactly what I mean, Mr. Buckingham"—then I accepted the six bills—at the time I believed he was a retired East Indian merchant, a person of financial means, credit and reputation, then carrying on a genuine, honest business as a discounter of bills of exchange; that he was able, willing and prepared to give references to honest and reputable people, and that he was prepared to do a large discount business, and had plenty of capital, or I should not have accepted the bills—after I had accepted these six bills I gave them to him—he put them into his pocketbook—I said, "Where is the cheque?"—he said, "I do not pay by cheque, Mr. Buckingham; I pay in bank notes"—I said, ""Where are the bank notes, then?"—he said, "Well, Mr. Buckingham, I cannot give you those for a day or two; I do not lock these bills up in my safe; I discount them"—I asked for, and he gave me this receipt: "Received 10th January, 1893, from Messrs. Buckingham and Co. six acceptances of the face value of £1,008 on the terms of my letter of this date," and he produced this letter from his pocket-book, already written out. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 10th January</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">and stating the terms deposed to</hi>)—I sent the letter to Somerset House, and paid five shillings for stamping it—he asked me, and I gave him this acknowledgment of the letter: "Mr. G.

               <p>regretting payment mentioned in my letter of 23rd January was. not paid when due, that he had placed the matter in the hands of solicitors, and hoped to get the money to-morrow—then I wrote, saying I would not wait any longer; the matter must be settled, or my acceptances returned tomorrow (Wednesday), or the business would be put in other hands—I had an interview on 21st January, and sent a telegram—Hill said then the money was not forthcoming, on account, of Harrison—on 1st February I received this letter, enclosing £110 in bank notes, a postal order for 5s., two acceptances (one for £165 14s. 6d. and another for £140), and a bill for £29 18s. 6d., making £445 18s.—the bill for £165 14s. 6d. was for four months, drawn 18th January, and accepted by Watson and Co.—the £140 bill was dated 13th January, for four months, drawn by Peters and Co., and accepted by Weston and Co.—the £29 18s. 6d. bill was for four months, accepted by Alexander and Co., and was taken up and paid two days after Hill was in custody—in reply I wrote declining to accept drafts, and that I should be in till twelve on the morrow to accept cash—Hill did not come—I then sent another letter refusing to accept any other payment than bank notes, and concluding, "I will have (and the sooner I hear the better) cash, or the whole of the acceptances returned"—at the time I took Lloyd Watson's bill I believed they had an account at the Consolidated Bank—so with regard to the £29 bill—not getting cash or a return of my bills, I called four or five times at Hill's private residence after I had put the matter into the hands of my solicitors, Messrs.

Peters and Co., Queen Victoria Street—I saw the housekeeper, but found no trace of Peters and Co.—the £140 and £165 bills were not met—Hill returned two of my acceptances, and kept four of the value of £622 11s. 6d., which I have had to meet—all I have in return is a bill for £29 18s. 6d., £110 in notes, and a 5s. postal-order, so that I have paid £622 11s. 6d., and received I</p>

H. Allen and Co. upon Lloyd Watson and Co.—on the 16th I went to the address on the face of the bill, 72, Leadenhall Street, to inquire about Lloyd Watson and Co.—I found the name on the lintel of the door—I went nearly to the top of the house—I saw the name in the lobby outside the door—I went into the room—a third of it was partitioned off</p>

H. Allen and Co.," the "drawers" I think he said, but I think he meant "acceptors"—I said, "That is no defence to the bill in my client's hands"—lie said, "I do not know, but I shall not pay it. If you think you can anything out of me you can look round, or you can ask the Sheriff of London," and he waved his hand round—I said, "What about the other gentleman, will he pay?"—he said, "I do not think so but I do not know"—I said, "What, has not he money?"—he said, Well, that depends if he is fortunate," or something to that effect—then I asked him if he knew how the bill had been dealt with, and if he knew the name of Hill in connection with it, and he said, "No" to both questions—seeing that it was accepted payable at the Consolidated Bank, I asked if Allen and Co. had an account there, and he said "I think not"—then ascertaining the address I went to Alien and Co., of 54 and 05, Leadenhall Street, twice that day—on both occasions I found a notice on the door, "Return shortly," and no one in—the same day I went to Weston's, 30,. Finsbury Pavement—the office was closed, and I saw no one—the names, "Weston and Co." and "Tilley and Co." were en the door—then I went to the office of a drawer of one of the other bills shown me by Mr. Buckingham, at 60, Queen Victoria Street—I found no trace of them—a communication came down to me through the pipe.</p>

Midgley"—he said, "Oh, I have just had an action with them about Midgley's bill, and I am now suing them for libel"—I said, "Will you give me all the correspondence you have had from Hill?"—he said, "I have had none"—I said, "Yes, you have; I have seen copies of letters in Hills letter-book to you, and I have found letters from you to Hill"—he said, "There may have been one or two, but their number. is very small; I destroy them as I get them"—I said, "I want to search your room"—he said, "Very well," and he assisted me in doing so—I found a number of cancelled cheques and other things—I found no bill-book—there was a diary, but with very few entries in it; it did not appear to be a business diary; nothing about a bill—there was no ordinary business book with reference to bill discounting—I brought him away at once to Moor Lane Station, where he was charged—Goldring said he thought the matter might be met by summons, and if he had been written to he would have surrendered—on Monday, 26th June, about three In the afternoon, I met Weir in Leadenhall Street—I stopped him and said, 11 Is your name Allen?"—he said, "No, I am the representative"—I said, "But your name is Barclay Wilson?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I know your right name; it is Weir.

C."—I think there are several bills produced upon which this stamp has been used—I produce a list of the impressions used, eleven altogether accepted payable at different banks; one is Hammond and Co.—I searched French's office, 30, Finsbury Pavement; I found no money there—I found twenty-six pawntickets, from 1s. to £2 10s., and dated from 15. 6. 93 to 9. 6. 93—I also found six notices of the dishonour of six bills, most of them foreign bills—there were hundreds of blank bill forms—the same afternoon I found Henry in custody at the Old Jewry—I said to him, "I am a police officer, and your name is Henry, trading as Lloyd Watson and Co., 72, Leadenhall Street, and 11, Miles Lane"—he said, "Yes, that is right, but I am not Lloyd Watson; Norris is Lloyd Watson"—I said, "Well, you are the man that Mr. Webb, a solicitor, had an interview with"—he said, "I don't know Mr. Webb"—the prisoners were then all conveyed to Moor Lane Station and charged; they made no reply—I went to 11, Miles Lane, and found Henry's name on the door on a brass plate—I found 6s. 1 1d. on him, but no money at his office—there was a letter box labelled "Bills for acceptance"—there was only one room—there was a sort of couch, where someone had been evidently recently sleeping—I got into the rooms by a key found on Henry—two pawnbrokers' duplicates for small amounts were found there, his own articles; and a number of bill forms, several score, on some of which were lithographed "L. W. and Co.," and two rubber stamps with "J. Henry "on; all the other stamps were found at 72, Leadenhall Street—on 6th July, about ten, I saw Bowerman at the police-station; nothing material passed there—at his place at 2, Wilson Road, Southend, I found a printer's copy of the Bills of Exchange Act, "Byles on Bills," and this manifold type-written copy of Mr. Poland's opinion, and six bottles of whisky—when I was giving my evidence at the Police-court, French and Weir and Henry each asked me if I found at the different offices any communication either from them to Hill or from Hill to them, and I said, "No, I found only one small document at French's office, making an appointment; it was simply a memorandum left in the letter-box by Weir."</p>

Copthall Avenue—the name on the door there was F. Trail at first—I think no business was done in that name—I think one or two letters was written in answer to inquiries in that name—at the beginning of 1893 the name was altered to Bright and Co.—no business was done in that name that I am aware of—Hill put up the name of F. Trail for the purpose of starting a private "inquiry "agency; he advertised and sent out circulars—I had at Copthall Avenue to address envelopes for circulars like these, and do some of the correspondence and make calls—I took the names of the people to whom I addressed the circulars from the Directory—Hill took out the names of particular trades, one after the other—Hill subscribed to an agency, who sent him cuttings from the country papers—the cuttings went to Hampstead, but I saw them afterwards; they were advertisements for partners—I also made calls—I did not see Goldring at Copthall Avenue at the beginning; I should think it was the latter part of 1891 I saw him—I usually saw him at the Wool Pack Tavern in Gracechurch Street—it has a side entrance from St. Peter's Alley, Cornhill, by the side of the churchyard—I saw him eight or nine times, I should think, in the course of 1892, in the passage at the bottom of the church</p>

Petitioning creditor in your bankruptcy—the debt was on a bill drawn by you, 1 think—you never, to my knowledge, received consideration for the bill; I should say it was taken under an agreement—judgment was given against you, and you were made bankrupt, as the drawer—I usually wrote out the drafts before they were accepted—I always left the space before the word "order "blank, by your direction, because at the time you would not know who was going to draw the bill—sometimes the date was filled in afterwards; the space for it was left blank, so that it could be put in on the day the bill was signed, in order that it should not appear stale—I don't remember that Heath and Co. were constantly exporting goods when I was with them; I cannot say they were not—you and Mr. Heath told me that you had formerly been a member of that firm—I am generally acquainted with the contents of the letter-books—I should say there is not a single letter in which you describe yourself as a retired East India merchant, or say that you have a large amount of capital—you made inquiries about acceptors of bills through <hi rend="italic">Stubbs'</hi> and so on, and as a rule you found the firms were going down; <hi rend="italic">Stubbs'</hi> did not give a glowing account about them—you had many transactions besides those which are the subject of this charge—you had some acceptances of Mr. Pearce, of Hull; in the result he went bankrupt, and you had to pay all the bills, losing about £500—in several cases you returned acceptances to people because you could not get from them what you thought was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189309110142"/>
               <p>fair consideration—you had a bill for £500, which you sent back because you could not get £450 for it—you had two acceptances for £500 back from an eminent Q. C.; I think you could have got £420 for them, but you returned them to him—in consequence of a telegram or communication from Midgley you sent him Johnson's bill—I used to fasten certain letters relating to one case together—when Midgley took proceedings I fastened all the papers relating to his case together, and all the papers would be there—at the Police-court when Midgley was examined, Mr. Collier, his solicitor, handed some of the letters up to him there—you made inquiries about Johnson before sending off this bill, and heard they were in business, and very respectable, or something of that kind—I don't remember anything about Hayford and Sons, or Desporte, the drawer and acceptor—I do not know that you were ever acquainted with either of those firms, or that you had ever done business with them—in returning bills you always mutilated them, so that they should not be used; that was whether they were drawn or not—I think I remember taking the letter of 13th January, 1893, from you to Buckingham by hand; he returned it and said he would not do what you asked—you usually got to the Copthall Avenue office between eleven and twelve; sometimes it was before eleven—I occasionally came to Parliament Hill Road when I was engaged at Copthall Avenue—on one or two occasions I think letters were written there; not more than three times, I should think—I think the letters had been already written—I took them to the office to copy them, by your direction—sometimes I made a copy of a letter by hand on a sheet of paper, instead of taking a press copy—I could not say if this document, No. 174, is a copy so made.</p>

I live at 8, Burnett's Terrace, Colworth Road, Leytonstone—on Sunday night, the 20th July, I was walking alone in Epping Forest—I saw the prisoner kneeling down in a bush about the distance of this room—when he got up I saw the bush where he was kneeling on fire—he walked away about ten yards—he turned his head and looked towards the fire, and went on towards his friends—I spoke to Smith, and we followed—the prisoner was given into custody at the Green Man.</p>

At 7. 20 p. m., on 20th July, I was on duty in the Leytonstone Road—from what Baxter and Smith had told me, I said to the prisoner, "I want you for setting fire to some furze in the forest"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I told him I should take him into custody—on the way to the station he said he remembered stooping down to light his pipe, and the furze got on fire; it was an accident—he was taken to the station and charged—he made no reply—on searching him I found two pipes and a box of matches; one pipe had not been used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable employed by the Post Office—on the 8th April I called at 8, Bull Court, Tooley Street—I told Mrs. Trundle my name, and showed her the money order, and that it was dated eight days after her husband died—I asked her when her husband died, and she told me—I asked her what she knew about it—she said she knew nothing about it; then she said she received the money order by post, but it was stolen from her—I asked "By whom?"—she said she did not know—I asked her the circumstances of the robbery, and if she reported it to the police at the time—she said, "No"—she became confused, and then said it was not true, but she had had the money, she had been put up to it by a pensioner—I wanted to know who it was—she said he was dead, and then said, "I will tell you the truth about it. When my husband died the doctor who attended him told me to bring the pension paper to him and he would get the money, and when I took it to him he wrote something, I am not sure what," and told her to take it to the post-office—the clerk told her it was not complete, and she went back to the doctor's house to say so, and saw either the doctor or his wife, she was not sure which, nor what alteration was made in the order; but she went to the post-office a second time, received the money, and went back and told the doctor's wife she had got it, and she asked how much she had to pay for the certificate—she was told five shillings, and paid it—two days afterwards I went to Fitzrayne's house, 217, Tooley Street, and showed the sick certificate and the money order to him—I told him who I was, and asked if he wrote it—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he remembered under what circumstances he wrote it—he said, "No," he had no recollection—I asked if he remembered attending the late pensioner—he said, "Yes;" and if he could tell me when he died—he said he had no recollection or record of that—then I told him all that Mrs. Trumble had told me about his signing the certificate, and he said, "I do not remember, but I daresay her account is correct"—I said, "This certificate shows that the man is unable, in consequence of bodily illness, to attend at the post-office, and purports to he dated eight days after the man died; can you explain that?—he said, No. but sometimes one is inclined to strain a point for these poor people."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at East Dulwich—in July, 1892, I saw an advertisement in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi> newspaper about an old-established fried fish shop, with no opposition, at 53, Wakely Road, East Dulwich, for £12—I went there, and one of the lodgers sent me on to Bellenden Road, where I saw Ashby—he took me and showed me over</p>

               <p>the shop at 53, Wakely Road—he said there was no opposition in the neighbourhood; that there was no other fried fish shop within a mile; that I could not manage the business alone, I should want someone to help me—I agreed to take it, and to pay him £12, and 11s. a week rent; he said he was the landlord, and he should call every Monday for the rent—I paid him £1 deposit—all the fittings were included in the £12; I bought them of Ashby—I went in on 28th July—he gave me this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">This was for £4, received as part payment of £</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">for fish shop and fittings</hi>)—I commenced on the next Saturday—a week after I had gone into the shop Acock called for the rent—he refused to accept me as tenant unless I paid the week's rent, and I paid it, and showed him my rent-book, and he was satisfied—in consequence of what Acock told me I did not pay the balance of £8 to Ashby—he never asked for that balance—he sent his father-in-law with a note on Monday morning saying he should not require any more money from me—I stopped there about nine months—I worked up a trade (there was none when I went), and afterwards I sold it.</p>

                  </hi>. In August last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> with reference to a fish shop for sale, and giving an address at 49, Bellenden Road—I went there and saw Ashby, who said the shop was in the Crystal Palace Road—he asked £50 for it at first—I went from Bellenden Road to Rye Lane, Knight's shop, as a recommendation of the place, and there Ashby introduced me to Knight—Knight said the Crystal Palace Road shop was doing a good trade, and that the takings varied, but were never less than about £20 a week—I believed those statements, and agreed to give £40 for the shop—I paid this deposit of £5, and received this receipt—Ashby represented himself as the landlord; he said the shop was his own property—I afterwards paid him £35 and took possession of the shop—I took 14s., 15s., or sometimes not 10s.—I tried to carry it on as well as I could for three or four weeks, and then closed it, as I was losing money every week—I found out who was the landlord, and I went and told Knight I had been swindled, and he admitted I had, but he said that he had nothing to do with Ashby, who was the man I had to look to—Knight said he had not benefited by the transaction, and that Ashby had taken a situation in the country somewhere, and that he really did not know where he was—I afterwards met Ashby in Rye Lane, close to Knight's shop—I was with two others, and we went to a public-house, and I said, "Ashby, you have swindled us"—he said, "Yes, I am a b——swindler, and that is how I get my living; I never have worked, and never b——well intend to"—he turned his pockets out and said, "If you think there is any chance of getting anything back, have a try. Now you have been through our mill, it will sharpen you up," or something like that—next time I saw him he was in Court on one of the other charges—I asked Knight again whether he was going to return any of the money; he said he could not entertain it—I said I knew the place was his, and I asked him what he would give me for the fixtures and fittings—eventually it was agreed that he should give me £9, which I accepted, and he took possession—I said I had been over to the Police-station, but they would not take any notice of it.</p>

               <p>Ashby did not say what I have detailed in a charting way, but in a derisive, contemptible way, as much as to say, "I am clever, and you are a d—d fool"—we were drinking together in a public-house at the time—I made a loss over the business; I was out of pocket every week—I daresay Host over £50 in one way and another—I had not been in the business myself before, but I had a man with me who had been in the business for forty years—I made no inquiries beforehand in the neighbourhood; I took the prisoners' word—the appearance of the shop was all right, but there were no customers in the neighbourhood.</p>

I am a carpenter, of 98, St. Leonard's Road, Poplar—in consequence of an advertisement I called at 208, Rye Lane—I saw the prisoner Knight—I subsequently received this letter of June 1st, signed "Ashby "(<hi rend="italic">Asking him to make an appointment to call.</hi>)—on June 2nd I went to 208, Rye Lane, and saw Ashby, who took me to a fish-shop, and then to another, and said, "That woman is robbing me hard and fast. I am sure you will do well here; you have no shop within half a mile"—I agreed to take the shop, and paid a deposit of £3—altogether I parted with £15; the total was to be £25—I went into possession about June</p>

I am a butcher, of 1, High Street, Mortlake—on 9th August I had nine sheep in a paddock—I saw them there myself on the 8th; I sent for them on Thursday, 10th, and only eight were brought to me—the value of the one that was missing was 55s.; I have not seen it since—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 68, West Street, Charlton—I work sometimes on a barge—on Tuesday, 8th August, I was home all day, and I went back to the barge at a quarter to 11 p. m.—I found no one on board, and I went ashore and had a drink and waited, and then the captain, Grucka, came with the other two prisoners—Grucka was drunk and said he wanted to sleep: he went aboard and went to sleep—after he had been there about half an hour O'Brien and Eyndman came and sang out, "Where, is Frankie?"—I said "Asleep"—they woke him and said, "Are you coming to get the meat?"—he said, "What meat?"—they said, "Come along with us, and we will show you," and they all three went away—I stopped aboard and went to sleep-after that I heard them singing out, "Shove the boat ashore," and I shoved the boat across, and they came back in the boat—O'Brien and Eyndman came first, and Grucka came a little behind</p>

               <p>them—they had a live sheep with them, which they put in the water and shoved in the boat, and put it on the barge "Wandsworth," which was next to ours, and then put it on to their own barge, "Arthur"—Grucka then said, "I am going to have a sleep," and he went down to his cabin—the other two prisoners stopped on deck, and I saw one of them hit the sheep on the head with a chopper—I went down into the cabin and laid down on a locker and slept—I woke about four, I should think—the other three were on board—I had some breakfast and went ashore—when I came back they had gone to get a drink—I saw them again, out O'Brien and Eyndman got off the barge before we were towed down that morning; they went early in the morning.</p>
