               <p>Q. How many penny-pieces? - A. I did not count them; the officer has them, they were in his pantaloons, and his jacket pockets; I cannot swear to any of the money, the till was not locked in the morning, I don't know how I left it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in liquor? - A. I might be a little; I missed some halfpence and penny-pieces, I did not know I had any silver in the till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I put him and his wife to-bed drunk that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- LOVEDAY sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 16th of January, about a quarter after four in the morning, passing the house of the prosecutor, I saw a light through the window-shutter, I looked through, saw the prisoner go to the bardoor, open it, and go in; he had a candle and looked on the shelves; he took a silver spoon, and put it in his pocket; he put something in his pocket, opened a drawer by the till, and took a parcel out; he took a knife out of his pocket, and endeavoured to force the lock of the till, but could not effect it the first time; he tried to open it at the side, he could not; he then tried the lock again, and opened it; he took out a parcel of something, and put it in his jacket-pocket; he repeated it again; he took out something, and put in his pantaloons; then he put to the drawer again; he took a candle and looked about the bar; he came out, and went from the bar to the fire, the landlord was asleep in the tap-room at the time; I am sure it was the landlord, for I heard him cough, it was then near five o'clock; I called another watchman, we stopped about the house, expecting he would be coming out; he did not, I then knocked at the window, and told him I wanted something; the prisoner tapped at the window, and said, he was coming; about a quarter of an hour after, I knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it, I found Mr. Haram sleeping, with his head on the table, in the taproom, he was in liquor; I asked the prisoner if we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160004"/>could not have somethink to drink; in order not to alarm the prisoner too much, we had something, and paid for it, and laid the money on the bar; I endeavoured to wake the landlord, which I did, with some difficulty; I took him without the taproom, and asked him if he knew the prisoner, he said, he did; I said, that man has robbed you; I took him into an adjoining room, and took some penny-pieces, and halfpence out of his waistcoat-pocket; I found a seven-shilling piece, and seven shillings in his pantaloons pocket, (produced the money and a knife with blood on it, with which he opened the drawer,) I suppose, he had cut his finger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The two seven-shilling-pieces is what my master King gave me; Mr. Haram changed a seven-shilling-piece, the landlady desired me to take care of the bar, her husband was so drunk; I gave her the money till she fell down in the bar, and they carried her up to-bed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030216-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Did you pull down this old building for yourself, or some other person? - A. For myself, the ground is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say you had seen this timber before? - A. I had seen them many times; I ordered my men to deposit it in a particular place; I superintend all the business myself.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Sunday, the 30th of January, I was with Kennedy, I saw the prisoner and another man, with three pieces of timber each, in Wentworth-street; I crossed the way, it was dark; I asked him what he had got carrying, he answered me, some timber; Kennedy stopped the other man, they put the timber against the wall; I asked the prisoner where he got the timber from, he said, Mr. Barnes's yard, Mr. Barnes was his master; I asked him where Mr. Barnes lived, he said, by Mile-end Turnpike; I said, it was an odd thing to be removing them on a Sunday night, he said, he was taking them by his master's order, and going to carry them to Castle-yard, Whitechapel; I told him, we would go and see that they were deposited there, and then we should be satisfied; they went on with them, and we followed them; they went into a yard, in Castle-street, there the other man threw his load on the ground, and the prisoner put his against a pair of gates; the prisoner said, I will go and get the key, and put it in; I said to Kennedy, go with him, and fetch the key; there was another avenue into the yard, out of which the other man went, and ran away; I then called to Kennedy to take care of the prisoner, for the other man was gone; we told the prisoner we would take him to Mr. Barnes's; he then said, it was of no use to go to Mr. Barnes, for he had given him no orders about it; we moved the timber to the office, and locked it up, (produces one of the pieces;) I put a mark on it that night, with my knife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barnes. I have no doubt it is one of mine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Barnes. I beg to recommend the prisoner, he was at work for me, and was one of the last men I should have suspected.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you given him any orders to remove them? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man on the premises?- A. He came to my house on the Thursday, and had a pint of beer; he said, he had been out of employ, and asked me to give him a bit of bread; then he asked me if I could give him a job, I was unloading some wood; he sat about to help me to get it in; I then got him to wheel some barrows of dung into the orchard, and then desired him to put the spade in the barn, where the things were drying, and I locked the barn, he staid till about nine o'clock, and then went away, this was Thursday night; on Friday morning, I went into the barn to get some coals, and saw two waistcoats of mine, and one of the boys, which had been removed, lying on the coals, it was then scarcely light; they were lying underneath the left-hand window, where he must have got in; on missing the things, I went in search of the man about eight o'clock at night; I heard of his being apprehended at Brentford; I saw the prisoner there in the cage; I enquired of the officer, he said, he had some things in his possession, and most likely they were mine, as I had described the marks.</p>

I gave him into the care of Jackson, an officer of Marlborough-street; I left three loaves with Jackson, and took one up to Mr. Harrison's. The prisoner had described a barrow that he took them out of with two baskets without handles, and I knew it to be Mr. Harrison's. I marked the bottom of the loaf with a cross with a knife.</p>

In the evening I took the watch out of my pocket and laid it on some goods beside the bed. In the morning I went off to my employ, and forgot to take my watch with me; I returned in the evening, and told Mr. Morris I had left my watch, he was then returned home; I took a candle to look for it in the place I left it, when I came there I found the goods had been removed, and the watch gone; I told Mr. Morris; he said, nobody had any thing to do with the goods but his workmen. I returned the next Saturday, and found the prisoner was in custody. I saw my watch at the Mansion-house on Monday; the prisoner confessed, on his examination, he had took the watch, and pawned it; I knew it by the maker's name, Brown, Sheffield, and a notch I made in opening it; it is a silver hunting watch; there was a part of the ribbon I could swear to.</p>

               <p>THOMAS NEWLAND sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: The prisoner pledged a silver hunting watch with me, the 28th of January, for one guinea; I am sure the prisoner is the person; I never saw him before; I gave him a duplicate. It was but the day after or next day I was called upon to speak to the business. (The watch was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

On Friday morning Mr. Morris came down, and said, if any one would confess what was become of the watch, he would say no more about it, but pay us our wages, and discharge us; I told him, the watch was pawned; I meant to return the watch as soon as I could take it out.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you first know any lead was taken from your house? - A. The same evening, I went up with the prisoner's master, and missed the lead, it was over the dressing-room, belonging to the Cold-bath; it is detached from the house, there is a yard between.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall runs from the house to the building? - A. Yes, a party-wall, my yard is surrounded by a wall; the lead was a slushing over the gutter part of it, it was over the sky-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When before that had you seen the lead on the premises? - A. I may venture to say I saw it a month before, it appeared to be part cut, and part torn, it was freth done.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you with the constable when he compared it with the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it cover the place, did the nail-holes correspond? - A. They corresponded with the slushing of the lead, I can swear that was my lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at any time on your premises? - A. No, never saw him before; his master's yard joins the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that lead near Mr. Mills's premises?- A. Yes, close to my roof that joins his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear recently cut? - A. It did, I examined it that night, some was torn, and some was cut; I went immediately to Mr. Mills's, while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160008"/>he was in custody in the yard; he went directly to the spot, and missed the lead; in one of my pails in the yard, there was about half a hundred weight beat up, and nearly filled the pail, it appeared to be the same sort as that found in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the whole of the lead? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear as much as would sit the place the lead had been taken from? - A. Yes; I had no lead in my yard; I left the gate open, and went to the yard when he was taken,</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did he appear to be in liquor? - A. Yes, he was in liquor; I asked him if there was any body with him, he denied it, he said afterwards, another man brought him back.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PALMER sworn. - I am a watchman, I watched the yard; near half an hour after six, I went down to the shed, I looked about, and the prisoner was stopping by one of the posts that supports the shed; I laid hold of him by the collar. I brought him out of the shed, and called to Mr. Goodyer, here is one.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner?- A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he runk or sober? - A. He appeared to me not much in liquor, he trembled, he could stand and walk, I found nothing upon him; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.No knife found upon him? - A. No; I saw some lead in the yard on the ground, five or six yards from the shed; I saw some lead in a pail, behind some wood-work, in the yard; that in the pail was in small pieces, packed very close, I did not examine that, that in the yard appeared recently cut.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the Savoy for a pint of beer, and while I was waiting for it, I saw a soldier under the gateway, and these two girls crying; I asked what was the matter, they told me, the soldier had taken this shawl; I asked him, if he had got the girl's shawl, to give it her, he made no answer, but took to his heels, and ran into the watch-box; I stood about four yards off, and saw him pull the shawl out of his jacket, and give it to the watchman, and he put it in his left hand pocket; I said to the watchman, the soldier has robbed the two girls of their shawl: he cried, blood and hounds, and brought him up to the gateway, and searched him; there was nothing found upon him. The soldier then beat the two girls violently with his jacket, which he had in his hand; I said to the watchman, you have got the shawl in your pocket, remember; and he up with his fist and struck me; I repeated it, and he struck me again; he struck me three times. The woman, who keeps the snuff shop at the corner of the gateway, ordered the watchman to take the soldier to the watch-house, to be properly searched, which he did; I followed, but could not get in till the property was found.</p>
               <p>- LINDSAY sworn. - I am a constable of St. Mary-le-Strand: On the 12th of December, at eleven at night, the two prisoners were brought to the watch-house, and the prosecutrix and her fellow servant came in; the prosecutrix gave charge of Robertson for stealing her shawl. I asked Robertson what he had to say to the change; he said, he knew nothing at all of it; I ordered him to strip, and search him, but found nothing upon him. The beadle said, it would be proper to search the watchman; the watchman said, do you suspect me; then I ordered him to strip; he took off his watchcoat, and threw it on the ground, and put his hands in his waistcoat pockets, and said, now search me; I took up the watch-coat, and found the shawl in the pocket where he keeps his rattle; I then said, I shall take charge of both of you. The watchman said, never fear, I shall get through it.(The shawl was produced, and deposed to by the prosesecutrix).</p>

            : Mr. Hills died on the 21st of October; the executors took the direction of the business: The prisoner had been servant to the deceased four years and an half; we continued him in the business, there was no other servant but a little boy, the prisoner had the management of the shop; after the death of Mr. Hills, we took stock, the goods lay alphabetically; there is an entry of the gold watch, and the six table-spoons; it was made on the 23d of October, it is my own hand-writing; I saw the watch before the Justice's at Bow-street, about the 17th of December; I found the tablespoons at Mrs. Mills's lodgings, in Suffolk-street; on the 15th of December, Mrs. Mills came to the shop in a hackney-coach, the prisoner went over the counter to speak to her; the lady pulled up the glass and was going away; I jumped over the counter, stopped the coach, went into it, and shut the door, after that I found the spoons at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Upon your oath, did you make an entry of that watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew it me, (refers to some papers;) that is no book? - A. I call that a book.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be looking into that book,(a ledger;) you have turned over at least thirty pages of it -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The stock was taken on those bits of paper, and afterwards inserted in a book? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Point out an entry in the book? - A. I can only say from the general stock.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew me an entry of any particular watch in that book? - A.(Points out an entry of a number of gold watches, one of which is 13l.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? - A. No, it is the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you made an entry of it in your hand-writing? - A. Yes; on that paper there is a watch, at the head it is No. 13, which is what it cost the estate, it is afterwards entered into a book, which was made the 23d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say there is an entry of any individual watch? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a book in the hand-writing of the prisoner, a book in his hand-writing cannot be evidence for him, we did not call for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am on the cross-examination, and call for the entry, and he produces this book.</p>
               <p>Salkkld. We take the regular numbers, they go on to 109, and then they are entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an entry of a watch in this book? - A. It is included in that sum.</p>
               <p>Court. They take the stock, there is such a number of watches, they all come to so much, they don't describe every watch, the 13l. with a number of other sums makes up the whole amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.There is no entry of any watch in particular? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That or any other watch may be included under that 13l. - will you swear there was no other watch in the stock, of the price of 13l.? - A. Not one, there is one 12l. 16s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You produce a book in the hand writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; that was the stock at the death of Mr. Hills.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, in that stock, there is an entry of a watch of a particular number? - A. Yes, 1094.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you took the stock, was that number struck out as sold? - A. No, it was unsold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that number when you took stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is there any entry of the name or number of that watch, in your handwriting? - A. No, only that thirteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did that thirteen pounds refer to that watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry of the six table spoons in the stock-book? - A. Yes. (Produces the spoons.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any entry of these spoons in any other way than you have been describing on a bit of paper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to these spoons from your mere recollection of them? - A. I can; when we took stock, there was only one dozen of spoons in the window, tied in two half dozens; I missed one half dozen on the 15th of December, the price and weight of them corresponds with the stockbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accuse the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour?- A. No, one of the executors did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is a crest on them, do you know them by that? - A.No, there is no private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark at all upon them? - A. They are the same spoons according to all the information I have had, I would not swear not swear to them, I would not swear to a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any means of swearing to spoons without marks upon them? - A. I won't swear to them.</p>

When I had been home about a quarter of an hour, a young woman brought the nutmegs, and said, Mrs. Davis had sent them to me to fell; I don't know who the young woman was, I had not seen her before. I went to Mrs. Davis, who keeps a chandler's shop, the corner of Wentworth street, and asked her if the nutmegs would suit her; she said, no, there were too many for her; a young woman in the shop said, if I would go to Mr. Worms, he would buy them; accordingly I went to Mr. Worms, and asked him to buy them; he asked the price, and I told him, six shillings; he said, they were his, he had been robbed of them; I told him, I would fetch the woman I had them of; he said, no, he would send for an officer, and give charge of me; in the mean time, I went away and fetched Mrs. Davis; I told her the man said he had lost some nutmegs, and desired her to go and satisfy him that I had them of her; she went immediately with me, and when we came, there was an officer in the shop.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - I am an officer: On the 28th of January, I apprehended the prisoner and the last witness; just as I got to Mr. Worms, he was leading her by the arm down the street, she was crying; I took her into the back-room, and searched her, and found three handkerchiefs and a nutmeg upon her; she said, she kept that for her own use; she said, the last witness agreed to give her six shillings for the nutmegs, but not having the money, went to get it; she said, a boy gave them to her, but would give no account who the boy was; she was committed for examination; when she came up again, Worms found a nutmeg with a pin in it, he said, he knew that nutmeg.</p>

            : On Saturday the 15th of January, a young man brought the prisoner Haynes to our house, and asked me to give him a night's lodging; the watch was hanging over the mantle-piece; I went out about ten o'clock in the evening, and left nobody in the room but the prisoner; I was not out above two minutes, he was coming out of the door as I came in, I thought he was going into the yard; as soon as I came in, I missed the watch, I am sure it was hanging there when I went out; the prisoner never returned to our house; I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday after, in custody; I never saw the watch; my husband valued it at two guineas; after the second hearing, the prisoner told me, if he got me my watch again, I might clear him at the sessions; I told him, he ought not to have brought it to that, I did not know what I could do.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner sober or in liquor? - A. He had been drinking some liqor, but he told me he was not drunk.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - On the 19th of January, the prisoner was given into my custody, by a Mr. Davis, he was locked up; some little time after, I went to him, and asked him what he had done with the woman's watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you made any promise to him, or threatened him? - A. No; he said the watch was very safe, it was in the hands of a very respectable friend of his, and that he got sixteen shillings on it, and if I would ask Mr. Davis, his solicitor, for sixteen shillings, he would go with me and get the watch out; I agreed to that, and as I was going out, I met him coming in, he gave me a guinea; I then told the prisoner I would go with him, and get the watch out; he said, he would not, unless he had a guinea given to him, and the promise of a free pardon; I told him such a thing could not be done, and I gave the guinea back to Mr. Davis; after he had been before the Magistrate, I heard him tell the prosecutrix, if he had got her the watch, he hoped she would forgive him; she said, he should have mentioned that before, that was all the answer she gave him.</p>

               <p>Q.Had he an opportunity of getting at the spermaceti oil? - A. He could get at it at any time without my knowledge; I have no doubt that it belonged to me and my partners.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you say any thing to him upon calling him back? - A. I sent for a constable; I asked him no questions, but bid him stay till the constable came.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS BOX sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for by Mr. Enderby, to search the prisoner; I found upon him a cann of oil, it was in this pocket, tied round his waist, under two or three aprons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any questions? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You know nothing whose the oil was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Enderby.) Q. Is that a sort of cann that is used in your business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You cannot swear to the oil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not take it to make any property of it, but only for my own use, times are very hard, and I have a family.</p>

            : On Friday, the 14th of January, about half past three, I was in the accompting-house, No. 20, St. Swithin's-lane; I was apprised that a man was detected in the warehouse by one of our porters, William Knight, of having<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160016"/>stolen two bottles of brandy; I went into the warehouse, and saw the prisoner, he had nothing on him then; a constable was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the brandy was delivered to him. The prisoner appeared, as he does now, to be deaf and stupid.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KNIGHT sworn. - I am warehouseman and carman to Mess. Pollard and Company: On the 14th of January, as I was going from the dwelling-house to the accompting-house in St. Swithin's-lane, I saw the prisoner take two bottles of brandy out of a basket containing nine bottles; they were standing by the vault door, waiting for the permit to carry them out; I saw him putting them in his pocket, I taxed him with it as he was coming across the yard, I asked him what business he had there, or who he wanted; he could not give me any answer, he said, he wanted some liquor; I made him pull them out of his pocket, and replace them; I marked them immediately, and they were marked before the bottles were full, they don't hold quite two quarts; they are the property of Messrs. Pollard and Company. (They were produced).</p>
               <p>EDWARD RICHARDSON sworn. - I am a constable: The prisoner was delivered to me; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in liquor, coming by I saw the bottles standing, I tried to pull the cork out of one of them, I could not; then I tried another, and while I had hold of it, he came in. I could have gone away before the man came in if I had had a mind to it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Constable). Did he appear drunk? - A. Yes, I think he was.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BUNN sworn. - I am servant to the last witness: On Friday the 4th of February, a little after ten o'clock, a man gave an alarm, that a man had taken a bundle of shovels from the door; I went after him, the man said, he was gone over the bridge; I went over the bridge, and came in sight of him, he was running; he turned round to see if any body was after him; I said, I'll have you, and immediately he let the shovels drop; I did not stay to pick them up, but went after him; I was told that he had run up a yard, into a wheelwright's shop; my master came after me, and bid me go back, a man had picked up the shovels and gave them to me as I came back; they were tied up as they are now, when he dropped them; they were taken from the outside of the door, in the street; there were a great many more at the door, but none so black as these; I can say, with certainly, that these are the shovels that were taken away; my master's name is upon them, and I marked them when I brought them back; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160017"/>his face when he looked back, he had a smockfrock on; I am perfectly sure that the prisoner is the man that dropped the shovels.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lesley.) Were these articles at your door? - A. Yes; I did not miss them at that time, the shovels were brought to me, and I knew them directly.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; on the prisoner Jonqua's being apprehended, I went to his house, No. 2, Pelham-street, and found in his apartment, part of a bed furniture, there was a window-curtain of the same quality, which the prosecutor said, was his property, as such, we brought it away; Jonqua's wife was in the apartment, he was apprehended the day before.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - In consequence of an information, I went to Jonqua's house, on the 21st of January, with the other officers, and took him into custody, Gale was then in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Gale lodge there? - A. No, but they were both in the same room with another man, Jellison and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Jellison and his wife lodge there? - A. No, only Jonqua; on the Saturday, I received information that Fich had lost some property; I took him to Jonqua's house, that he might see some bed-furniture there, he described the pattern, and I took a piece with me; as soon as he saw it, he said, it was his property; it was hung on the bedstead as the furniture of the bed; I took it to the Magistrate and he was committed; Jonqua was asked, how long he had had it, he said, some months; that he bought it in a shop, but did not mention where; this is the furniture, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.There was no concealment of this property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went the day before, and saw it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fich. I can swear with certainty to this being my property, this is what I saw in Jonqua's house, the lining is of two different qualities, the one is finer than the other, it corresponds with what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it comprehend all you lost? - A. It does, there were four curtains.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no particular mark? - A. No, only the pattern of the binding corresponds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The lining is of two different sorts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is exactly like what it would be if bought at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Examine the binding, is that all alike? - A.One is wider than the other; one is hemmed, the other bound over.</p>
               <p>Jonqua's defence. I have some witnesses to call; the prosecutor said, before the Magistrate, it was of one quality; I can produce a person to prove I bought a part of the lining to finish them.</p>

               <p>For Jonqua.</p>
               <p>MARGARET SHORELEG sworn. - I am a weaver, I know Jonqua by working for her, I made her a set of bed-furniture, yellow and red stripes; there was only a part of the lining, and no binding; I sent a little girl to buy the lining, 10s. 6d. for twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.How much of the calico lining was afterwards bought? - A. Four yards; this is the piece put on each side, I split it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who brought you the calico? - A. Mrs. Jonqua.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Look at the calico, is it all alike in quality? - A. I believe it is, there is one breadth looks a little coarser than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you made that furniture up? - A. Yes, I sent it home, and was paid five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Fich.) How much was there of the coarse calico? - A.About ten or twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.See if you can find so much, or more, or less? - A.This is the coarse.</p>
               <p>Q. It amounts to ten or twelve yards? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the officers of Worship-street; I apprehended both the prisoners, on the 21st of January, at the house of Jonqua, in Pelham-street, with Jellison and his wife; I was in company with Armstrong; we had been at Gale's house before, and left Ray there. When we went into the house, Jellison and his wife were sitting by the fire-side, Jonqua, and his wife, and Gale, were in the room; they knew Armstrong, he was addressed by several of them with how do you do, Armstrong? he said, he had an information for stolen goods; we found an old black cloak, a man's shirt and a boy's shirt; Gale turned his back to the fire, and put a silver spoon into the fire; we took them all into custody; there was nothing found at that time that relates to this robbery. The same day, in the evening, we went again to the house, with Mrs. Thomas, and in a bag we found a piece of silk, which she said was her's; the bag was tucked behind the bed's head. When we took Gale, we asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Compton-street, St. Giles's; we knew where he lived, and took him to his house, with Jonqua and his wife; he took us up into a one-pair of stairs room, and said that was his apartment; we searched the place, and turning over some things at the bottom of a chest, we found a piece of cotton of the pattern of a piece the prosecutor had given me, it was about half a yard; I said to Gale, I have a piece of cotton in my hand from the person robbed, with which this seems to correspond, is that your's? he said, yes, all that is in that chest belongs to me; from thence we took them all to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160020"/>the Office. We then went to the apartment of Jellison and his wife, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street: Jellison's wife at first went with us; we found the bed-furniture, which the prosecutrix afterwards spoke to. We went to the house again with Jellison and Mrs. Thomas; Mrs. Thomas picked out a part of a muslin apron, and some other things, which she said were her property; I have had the custody of the things ever since. The cotton found at Jonqua's house, Ray has the possession of. The prisoners were committed, and brought up the following day, and re-committed. Then Jellison and his wife said, they wanted to speak to the Magistrate. They had been up once before.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what they said to the Magistrate, they were admitted Evidences for the Crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it at their own desire they communicated what they did to the Magistrate? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.When you were at Jellison's house, neither of the prisoners were with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.There was nothing found at Jonqua's till you found the bit of silk in the evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you see the bag when you were there before? - A. Yes, but we did not examine it; it stood then by the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Did you see what the bag contained in the morning? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know whether Armstrong examined it? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Gale's with a pattern, and found a piece of patch-work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came to Jellison's house, did you find the things concealed? - A. No; they were in a box with wearing apparel of their own.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I was with Vickery and Mrs. Thomas at Jonqua's house; I know no more than Vickery has stated. This is the piece of silk found in the work bag at Jonqua's, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were apprehended, did you hear any thing pass between them? - A. I happened to be in the necessary when they were locked up; one was in one lock-up room, and the other in another; I heard Gale call to Jonqua, says he, this is turned out a pretty business; what a bl-d rogue Jellison has turned out; and Jonqua asked him, whether they should ask to go to Newgate at once; John Gale made answer, no, it is of no use, there are so many things against us, we must come up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This was after they had been examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And knew there were many charges against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body hear this conversation but yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they separated? - A. By a thick partition, that they were obliged to holloa to make one another hear.</p>

               <p>Q. You know there is forty pounds reward if they are convicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went with the other officers to Jonqua's house, I was present at the first search, none of this property was found.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the patch-work? - A. It is mine; I am quite sure of it; the muslin apron is mine, and the pieces of the white gown, and a little skirt; they are all my property, and were all in the box, except the bed-furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The patch-work is only pieces not put together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Gale's defence. Since I was in trouble, Jellison said she bought the things in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Jonqua's defence. At the time I was apprehended the things were lying about; Mrs. Jellison came in and said, I am come to sell you some children's caps; she had a heap of things in her apron, and when Armstrong came in, she let them down, and went to the window; she must certainly have dropped the things in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop? - A. No, not at that time; on hearing the scuffle, Mrs. Whitworth ran to the door, and refused to open it, supposing there was a sight; I went into the shop, and told her to open it; a young man held up a handkerchief, and said, the shop had been robbed, and Glee brought in the handkerchiefs and the prisoner; we then went off to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose handkerchief was it? - A.Mine; it was missing from the window, and another with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it before? - A. In the window; we keep a hosier's shop, and sell these things; I saw it there myself just before dark, and the other;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160022"/>the window was whole when I took the shutters down in the morning, and all day long for any thing we observed.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say, after the morning, whether it was whole or not? - A. Nor particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the boy? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.What time did you open the shutters? - A.Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was not called to the window through the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p> - GLEE sworn. - I am a patrol; I belong to the Office, in Worship-street; On the 20th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going up Shoreditch; I saw the prisoner and two others with him, about eighteen or nineteen years of age; I saw them looking at this gentleman's window; I passed them, and looked at them; I came back again, and looked at the window; the window was then safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was safe? - A. I am confident of it. I went about two or three doors forwards, and stopped about ten minutes; they were walking backwards and forwards; while I was waiting there, Mr. Whitworth came home, and went in doors; soon after he went in, they called one another together, whistling, and calling Joe, for they had separated; the prisoner had his coat off his right arm, and his shirt tucked up; I saw the prisoner push his arm through the window, and take the handkerchief, and put it under his coat on the left-side.</p>
               <p>Q. He put his naked arm through the wondow?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut his arm? - A. No, he pushed the glass right through.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of glass was it? - A. A very large pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. The glass made a considerable noise I suppose? - A. No, it came out whole, and fell on the stockings in the inside; the other boys ran away; I caught the prisoner immediately; I was within three or four yards of him. Here is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He pushed it in whole, and made no noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in Court when the prosecutor gave his evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And heard him say the window was whole in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard there is 40l. reward? - A. Yes, if the Court please to allow it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I went to the prosecutor's on being acquainted with it, and found this glass on the stockings in the shop. - (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - Glee delivered the handkerchief to me, and gave me charge of the prisoner. - (The handkerchief produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitworth. I can swear to the pattern and the quality, and that I had such a handkerchief missing; I cut the handkerchief off the day before; I had four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of that pattern in the window? - A.There was another in the window, but not of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe you swear cautiously; do you mean to swear positively to it? - A. I cannot swear positively; other persons may have the same pattern; I won't swear to it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. That was at the Seven Stairs? - A. Yes; he shewed me some white linen cloth, which he said was cambric; he said it was worth 18s. a yard; he would sell it for any thing; he was distressed for money; I bought two pieces of him, five yards each, at 4s. 6d. a yard, which amounted to 45s. he shewed me some waistcoat pieces afterwards; he wanted 12s. 6d. a piece; I bought five at 10s. each, which was 50s. I gave him two two-pound notes and a one-pound, and a seven-shilling piece; he said the things were worth four times the money; if I was dissatisfied, I might come the next day, and he would take the things back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160023"/>again; I I went and left him, and carried the things to a public-house I use in Catherine-street, when I came there, I found the things were not worth thirty shillings:</p>

Yes; I found I had miscounted, the goods came to four pounds sixteen shillings, I gave him five pounds and a seven-shilling-piece; the next day, I went up Cheapside, and bought twenty yards of lace, at six shillings a yard, and twenty-two yards, at five and sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lace with you when you were with the prisoner the day before? - A. Yes, he looked at it, it was in a handkerchief, not this lace; I bought six pair of silk stockings, ten shillings a pair, in the same shop, four pair of white, and four pair of black; as I was going home, I went to see if I could find the prisoner, to ask him if he would take his things back again; when I came into Whitechapel, I saw the prisoner go into the Seven-Stars, and another man in a brown coat stopped me in the street, exactly the same as the prisoner did the day before; he said, he had some goods to dispose of; I told him I would not buy any thing of them, I was cheated the day before by another such; he wanted to take me into the same dark room, I would not go in there, but went into the parlour, and sat down; when I had been in about two minutes, the prisoner came into the parlour to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had seen your before you went in? - A. I think he did; I had seen him; the prisoner came in, and said, that man is my boatswain, he has failed with me six years; they both asked me several questions, if I would buy any of their articles; I said, I would not buy any; they asked me, if I had any thing to sell, I said, I had nothing to sell, but what I bought to day; I asked the prisoner if he would take his things back, and offered him half-a-guinea, at last I offered him a guinea to take them back; I told him I had not them with me, but I would go and fetch them; he did not agree to take them back, but his boatswain went and fetched a glass of grog, and asked me five or six times to drink with him, I would not at first, but at last I did; they took my handkerchief on the table, and would look at the lace.</p>
               <p>Q.Which of them? - A.Both; the things were on the table; they asked me to let them look at them; I told them they were welcome to look at it, but I would not sell it; they took one piece out of the handkerchief, to see how many yards there were of it, and asked me how much I had paid for it; I told them, one piece cost six shillings a yard, the other six shillings and sixpence; have you any receipts to shew for it, says the boatswain; I took my pocket-book out to shew the receipts, they said it was a cheap bargain; they said, they would give me sixteen pounds for it; I said, the amount was fifteen pounds one shilling; I told them, I would not fell it; the prisoner had a false check of twenty-one pounds seventeen shillings, and wanted me to give him the difference; he asked, if I would give him four or five pounds difference; I said, I had not so much money about me, I would not agree to any thing; they took me to the bar to drink grog; the prisoner took the handkerchief off the table, and carried it to the bar; we drank a glass at the bar between three of us; I took my handkerchief from the prisoner, and walked away into the street, and the boatswain followed me; they walked both behind me, and talked French between them; I did not know what they said; the prisoner then spoke to the boatswain in English, and desired him to go on board, and tell the boys to take care of every thing on board till he came; the prisoner walked close to me about five or six houses further, and his boatswain behind him; the prisoner snatched the handkerchief out of my hand, and gave it to the boatswain, who ran away with it towards Whitechapel-road; the prisoner held me by my arm, and stopped me from going after the boatswain, there was a thick crowd of people, and I soon lost sight of him; I told the prisoner, you are a pretty captain of a ship, when you could not buy the goods you want to rob me; he said, he was a gentleman, and desired me to go over to Mr. Jones, and enquire his character; I went and enquired, but nobody knew him; he then said, when he got change for his draft, he would pay me; we went into five or six public-houses; he then said, have you any demand upon me, I want to be rid of your company; he went afterwards into the George, in Shoreditch, where he had several acquaintances, and I sent for a constable, but the people pushed and dragged me about, and he got out into the street before the constable came; he was taken four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was taken up? - A. Yes, at his own house, No. 29, Huntingdon-street, Kingsland-road; when he was apprehended, he said, I know nothing of the man, but when he was in prison, he produced the duplicate of the things, they were found in pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him produce it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the things were found? - A. Yes; the officer and I went together to Mr. Barber's, in the Borough, and found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You agreed for the sale of this lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink together? - A. Two sixpenny worths.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more? - A. No more in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any where else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160024"/>Q.Upon your oath, did not you bargain with him for the lace? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You stairdown, and let him look at the lace?- A. Yes, I thought him an honest man.</p>
               <p>Q.You are quite sure you never offered to sell, him the lace? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 16th of January, I went, in company with the prosecutor, to the prisoner's; I told him, I had an information that he had robbed the prosecutor of some lace and stockings; he told me, he knew nothing at all about it; I told him, he must go along with me to Lambeth-street office. In the course of the day, he said the things were pawned, and he thought he could find where the duplicate was; he sent his little boy over into the Borough, as he said, to see if he could find the person that bought the duplicate.</p>

No. He sent the boy to the Borough; he came back, and said, he could not find the person; he said, he would see for him in the morning. The next morning, a letter was delivered to him in the Office; I had the duplicate before, given to me by a friend of his at the Flying Horse; the prisoner was not present when he gave it me; but he saw it afterwards at the Office; he gave me a letter to give to the Magistrate on his examination. (The letter and duplicate produced).</p>

On the Wednesday, I went into the parlour at the Seven Stars, he was shewing some things to a person, and asked me to measure them: I went home with him, after he had lost his property; we were together four hours; he went home with me, and I invited him to dine with me on Sunday; he came, and I tried to find the man that pawned them; he acquitted me; if I deserve punishment, I hope I shall receive it, before God, the Jury, and the Court; if I do not deserve it, I hope I shall be liberated; I am an innocent man, he was dealing with a man of a foreign language, which he did not understand, and asked me to measure it.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you ever seen him before? - A. Yes; he came into the yard, I asked his address, he gave it me, Captain Thomas, 16, in the Minories; he said, he wanted a mare, to go and see a friend some where about Somers Town; I asked how long he should want the mare; he said, about one hour, that he should not be more than an hour gone; he asked me what I should charge him for the ride; I said, five shillings; I let him have the mare, and he was to pay five shillings, on his return in one hour; that was the agreement between us. Not returning that hour nor that evening, I began to be a little alarmed about my horse, I thought it was likely I should not see it any more; the next day I went to where he gave me his address, 16, in the Minories, and enquired for such a person, and no such person was known. The next morning I went about to all the other stables, thinking he might have put it up somewhere else by mistake; that he might, perhaps be intoxicated with liquor; after making this enquiry, I could not hear any thing about the mare. On the 10th of February, I went to the Office in Worship-street, and had some bills printed. On the 12th, an officer from Westminster, of the name of Bly, came to me in the morning, and gave me information that my mare was at the Red Lion, Cockspur-street, where I saw the mare; and from thence I went to Westminster, where I saw the prisoner, at a little house where the officer took me to, in a little room. I swore to the mare, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the mare you saw at the Red Lion was your mare? - A. Yes, she was a bay mare, fifteen hands and three inches high, some white in her face, some saddle marks, with two black spavins; I have had her about five months; I am perfectly satisfied it was my mare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.On the 8th of February, a Captain Thompson came to your yard to have a horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen Captain Thompson before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And you let Captain 
               <persName id="t18030216-31-person193">Thompson</persName>
             this mare for an hour? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You agreed with him for five shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let horses to any stranger? - A. Yes, if they give me a good address. I would let you one.</p>
               <p>JAMES GOADBY sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Morley, at the Red Lion, Cockspur-street, Charing-cross: On Tuesday, the 8th of February, the prisoner came into our yard, and said, he had got a mare to sell -</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day? - A.About four o'clock, or it might be a quarter past; I asked him what he would take for her; he asked me what I thought she might be worth; I said, I knew what she was worth to me, what do you set upon her; how long have you had her; he said, he had had her three years and upwards; I asked whether he drove her in reins, or rode her; he said, he had her frequently in his cart, that he was a cheesemonger; he said, he used her to go in a one-horse chaise and a cart, and drove her fifty or sixty miles a day, frequently; he said, he had sold two the same day before; he said, his brother and he were cheesemongers, and came out of the lower part of Scotland, and wanted to make up their debts, as far as possible, and that they had a warehouse in the Minories; they wanted to get as much money as they could, for he thought they should be bankrupts; says I, I will give you five guineas for the mare; he said, O no, he could not take that; I said she was not worth more, she has two black spavins, and has been worked a great deal; I said, however, I would give him six pounds, and no more, and we went over to the public-house, and had something to drink, and I paid him six pounds, and the prisoner went away; I had three friends with me at the time. I suspected, some how, after that, that the mare was not come honestly by, and my friends and I went in pursuit of the prisoner, but could not find him that night. On the Friday in the next week, the prisoner came into the yard again, and brought a brown gelding for sale; I asked him what that had been used to; he said, it had been used to work along with the mare in the cart, at times; I said, it is very lame, what do you expect for him; says he, you must give me more for this than you did for the other; I said, no, I cannot give you any such thing, I would give him three guineas; and desired him to go over the way with a friend of mine; and in the mean time I went to Mr. Bly, the constable; I told my friend to keep him in tow while I went; I told him what I was going upon. I found Mr. Bly at home, and he came immediately with me; we did not find him in the house where I expected to meet him, we went into the yard, and saw him standing; Mr. Bly followed me; I asked where my friend was; he said, in a house near the King's-mews. We went into the Hope, in Cockspur-street, and there my friend was; I went into the back parlour, and called for a shilling's worth of brandy and water, and asked the prisoner if he had a receipt for the horse; in the mean time, I said, I would go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160026"/>get a stamp; I got one at the stationer's, and went into the room again where the prisoner and my friend was; the officer was then in the room; the prisoner said, will you write it; I said, no, write it yourself; and he wrote a receipt for the money; I said, can you give me change for a ten poundnote? and Mr. Bly came up, and said, I have a detainer against you, to know how you came by these horses; the prisoner said, do you accuse me as a thief, I have always lived in credit; he said, let me go, and I will give you my address; the officer said, I must do my duty, you must go before a Magistrate; he went with us very well a little way, and then he swore he would go no further; he swore he would shoot himself; then Mr. Bly said to me, take hold of his am, I insist upon your assisting me; we called a coach, and with difficulty got him into it, and took him to Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positively sure the prisoner is the man you bought the mare of? - A. Yes. He was committed; the Magistrate read the hand-bill he had received of the mare; I said, that is the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the mare to Mr. Keates? - A. Yes, the morning after he was committed, he claimed her as his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.On the 8th, about four o'clock, the prisoner came to you, and offered a mare to sell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And said he was a cheesemonger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mare appear as if she had gone in harness? - A. Yes; she was marked with a blaze down her face, two blood spavins behind, white saddle marks on her back, and a little tender before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she very lame behind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was she? - A.About fourteen hands three inches high.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. I thought afterwards, I had, with Captain Gray.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLY sworn. - I am a constable; I took up the prisoner on the 11th, at the sign of the Hope public-house, Charing-cross, upon the information of

            , who thought he had got horses improperly; I got him to write a receipt, and then took him to the Office; when he had got part of the way, he resisted, and with difficulty we got him into a coach; I asked him how he got the horses; he said, honestly, they were his own; I said, if he would bring some respectable housekeeper, in the neighbourhood, I would not take him before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I hired the mare, to go to Nottingham-place, about some money; I did not find the person, I came to London, and being intoxicated, I put the mare in a stable, and as I was in want of money, I thought I would sell the mare, and I might go a voyage, and then I should be able to pay the prosecutor for the mare; I sold her for six pounds. As to my saying I was a cheesemonger, and drove her in a cart, I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Goadby). Q.Was the prisoner intoxicated when he sold the mare? - A.No; he conducted himself so that I could not suppose he stole it.</p>

               <p>Nelson. Mrs. Drisdale came to me, and asked me if her gown was pledged with Mr. Clement; I said I would send the boy up to see; she said she had sent this woman with it, and had received 8s. but not the duplicate of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure she said that? - A. Yes; she asked for it as pledged for 8s. I searched the day-book, and found it was pledged for 10s. the boy went up, and brought it down, and delivered it to her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Drisdale.) You said you learned by information where this gown was pawned? - A. Yes, Mrs. Shirley told me she supposed it was pawned at Mr. Clement's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the pawnbroker that you sent the prisoner with the gown? - A. I did, because Mrs. Shirley said, I had better say I sent it, or else they would not produce the gown, being a stolen article.</p>
               <p>Q. You insist upon all you have originally sworn, that you lost it in the way described. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How came she to sleep with you?- A. There was but one bed in the room; she came on a visit to the woman I lodge with; we all three slept together; she rented the room I slept in; I had lodged with her only from the Sunday night.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Is Mrs. Shirley here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any other pawnbroker's to enquire after the gown? - A. I went to a great many besides, and did not find it.</p>

Locke and Knight, wine and brandy merchants, Hammersmith: On the 27th of Jan. in the evening, I went with my fellow servant to the White-hart, to have a pint of beer; Brookes, the headborough, and two or three more, were there; when I had been there two or three minutes, the lad that drives the errand cart came and called, Brookes, Brookes, come out directly, there are three men have got a box from the errand cart, and are in Black-lion-lane. Brookes and another man, I believe Sharpe, went out; I did not go out immediately, but thinking it unmanly not to go when an errand cart had been robbed, I went to Blacklion-lane, and met a man coming out of the lane, and calling, Peter, Peter; then the boy came out and said, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy's name is Smith? - A. Yes; Thomas-Abraham Smith. I asked the boy which way they were gone; he said, towards Hammersmith; then I ran as fast as I could run, and came up with a man, the shortest of the prisoners, Price, that was in the road; I immediately looked to see if he had got any property, and could not see any thing; I looked to the right and the left to see if there were any of his accomplices; I looked forward and thought I saw the head of some person; Price looked at me, and said, why do you jostle me; I said, I did not jostle him, but I thought he was one of the thieves that had robbed the errand cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. I think a little after eight at night, the moon was not then two hours and an half high; then Brookes came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see any body else there? - A. No; I looked to see if I could see any other person; Brookes laid hold of Price, and all of a sudden I lost him. Price calls, d-n you, Jack, come here; then Brookes called to me, I suppose, and said, I order you to aid and assist in the King's name; then a man I had never seen before, jumped from the foot-path.</p>

               <p>Q. You had done nothing then? - A. No; Price, when he said, come here, said, we will do them both.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Nowland that jumped off the foot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160031"/>path? - A. Yes; Nowland jumped at me, and with a dreadful oath said, what do you do with that man, I will cut your b-y head off; then he struck me in the left eye with his fist, and I think at the same time, but I am not certain, he struck me with a knife, I felt something on my breast, and my coat is cut in the same place; I then struck him in the face; he then clapped his hand up to his face and said, you have done me; I then fastened both my hands to his collar, intending to drag him away towards Hammersmith after the others; as I had fast hold of him by the collar, he put up his right hand, and cut me across both the backs of my hands, as hard as he could press with his knife; I felt it very severely; I held him fast with my left hand, and let go with the right, with an intention to hit him; I hit at him two or three times; when I hit at him, I found I could make no impression, it was open handed, I could not clench my fist, I did not know the reason of it at the time; I hit at him and felt him cut me severely about the head; the first cut I think was about the lip, the next I think was in the temple, a stroke right down. I said to him, you villain, you have got a knife, you want to murder me; then said he, I will cut your b-y liver out. I thought then the case was dangerous, and I would put my hand to his collar and throw him down; in the mean time the blood flowed into my mouth, that I was almost smothered; I found myself weak, and called out murder, I was afraid I should not hold out. I heard a person spring his rattle, and then I found the knife stabbed into my mouth as far as it would go, for his hand came against my lips; I had still hold of him, I never let him go with my left hand till I had him down; he used a word too bad to express, and said, you b-r, let me go, or I will cut your b-y liver out. I caught hold of the knife with my two fingers and thumb, and snapped it two; I then pushed him back on the foot-path, and dragged him down on his back; he being higher then me he was like to get up, I took him by the legs, and dragged him beside the foot-path, and held him a short space to get a little breath, and get the blood out of my mouth, then a man of the name of Haynes came up, he did not know which part to take at first; I said I am Mr. Locke's man, this is the thief that has robbed the cart, and endeavoured to murder me; then Haynes dashed down upon him with his knee to keep him down, and he held him down; the other begged to let him get up, but Haynes refused, and said he should not till more assistance came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was secured? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the wounds you received where the cuts were? - A. I received two cuts across my nose, one the right side of the tip of the nose, I had a cut across the gristle of the nose, towards the right eye; I had across the upper part of the cheek, from the eye to the nose, a cut across the upper part of the jaw, and a cut down the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the use of your fingers? - A. The right hand is weak; two of the fingers of the left hand are quite dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q.Price went away after the first blow was given; he did not assist in the cutting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKES sworn. - I am headboborough of the parish of Fulham: I was at the White-hart public-house, on the 27th of January, a little after eight in the evening, there was an alarm; the boy of the errand cart came in and said, that three men had cut a box from the errand cart, and that they were in Black-lion-lane. I went down the lane and saw two men in possession of a box, they had hold of it, it was bottom upwards; I asked how they came by the box, they said they found it, they supposed it was cut from some cart. I looked at the box, and turned round to the boy and said, is this your box? he said it was; seeing it broke in, I looked to see if there was any property in it; in the mean time the two men ran up the lane.</p>
               <p>Q.The two men you saw with the box were the two prisoners? - A. Yes; the little boy set off after them, while I was looking at the box; as he got to the end of the lane, he holloaed out, stop thief. I immediately pursued them, they went towards Hammersmith; just opposite the four-mile stone I came up alongside Price; I saw a man whom I charged to aid and assist in the King's name, that turned out to be Pigeon. I immediately caught hold of Price with my left hand, and he struck me immediately; then he said, d-n - your eyes, come along, Jack; I turned my eye round, and saw a man spring out of the path to me, which proved to be Nowland.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - A. Not from the time I saw him in Black-lion-lane; he immediately, as he sprang off the path, said, d-n your b-y eyes, we will do you both.</p>
               <p>Q.That Nowland said? - A. Yes; Nowland and Price encountered me, and got me down under Price; then he sprang from me over to Pigeon, what passed after I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it light enough to see them? - A. Yes; the moon was not gone down, and there was snow on the ground, I could see fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him before he sprang on you? - A.No; there is a deep ditch behind the path; the path was not above three yards from me; I did not see him till charge was given to aid assist.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see Pigeon again till it was over?- A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. When you saw the men first, they were running away? - A. Yes, while I was looking at the box, I turned Price<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160032"/>over, and got him up, and was going to secure him to take him to the watch-house; he bit my hand, and got away from me; the boy and I pursued him, crying, stop thief; Millward, the bricklayer, stopped him by the Cock and Pye.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon, and live at Hammersmith; I was sent to Pigeon at the White Hart; I found him having received a large cut on the right-hand and on the left-hand, across each hand; she cut on the right-hand had gone through the sinews of the little and ring fingers, in consequence of which he will probably never have the use of those fingers; the cut on the left-hand had cut one of the sinews, but not through it; there was a cut through the upper lip, which I was obliged to sew up; there was a cut on the top of the nose, and a cut on the bridge of the nose; it went slanting down by the side; there was a long and very deep cut on the left-side of the face, near the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cut on the bridge of the nose fever it? - A.No; it was down the side, from the top along the gristle, and another cut across the cheek, from that these two joined in one; there was a cut over the left-eye, and under the left-eye there was a cut from the fore part to the back part of the head, and one across that. In that state I found him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The wounds on the fingers and hand and on the head were dreadful cuts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That on the nose was a small cut? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - There was an alarm given of a box being cut away by some people, and that they were in the lane with the box; I went down the lane, and as I was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160033"/>down one man passed me; I went a little further, and there was a box and two men with it; they said they had found the box, and supposed it had been cut from some cart; I made a reply, I dare say it is; I asked the boy if he knew it to be his; he said it was. I turned round to look at the box, and it was turned bottom upwards, and the middle broke in; while I was looking at the box, they both ran up the lane; the little boy was before me; he holloaed out, stop thief; at the top of the lane I came up with the boy, and we ran together; just as I came opposite the four mile stone, I came along-side Price; I was sure he was one of the men I saw in the lane; it was moon-light and starlight, and snow on the ground; I caught hold of him, and said, you are one of the thieves that cut the box off, and I immediately saw a man on the right-hand side, and charged him to aid and assist in the King's name, which proved to be Pigeon; as soon as I had got hold of him, he said, d-n your eyes, come along, Jack, and immediately a bit of tussle ensued, and I saw a man jump off the path, and he came to me and said, d-n your b-y eyes, we'll do you both; he came to Price's assistance, and fell upon me; and got me down; then immediately he flew over to Pigeon, and made a blow at him.</p>

               <p>Q.When the other came to join him, did you know him again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You can swear to him? - A. Yes; Francis has had the box, but I marked my name on it, and can swear to it. - (The box produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.Is that the box you found in possession of these two men? - A. Yes, I can swear to it; I marked my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You don't mean to say Price was the other man you saw with the box; was it not Peter? - A. No, it was Price; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pearce.) Is that the box you delivered to Francis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Francis.) Is that the box delivered to you by Pearce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Price's defence. I was going to Hammersmith; I know nothing of the box.</p>
               <p>Nowland did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Price called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>THOMAS GIDDINS sworn. - I am a wheelwright at South Mims; I rent a little land besides; I had a ewe lamb that I kept down in the field; I missed it on the 27th or 28th of January; I had seven or eight lambs in the whole; they were marked on the side with

            my name; I found the skin on Mims Common, adjoining to my ground, about a mile off; I knew it be my skin; I have sold it since to a neighbour, Thomas Stanley, a butcher, in the place; I found the skin on the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Can you tell from the skin whether it was an ewe or wether lamb? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know whether it was a ewe or wether? - A.No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHESTER sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's house, and found a fore quarter of lamb, a leg, a blade-bone, and windpipe; I knew it belonged to an ewe lamb by the leg; the leg and quarter were behind an old bedstead up stairs; I asked him where he got it; he said, he found the leg, loin, and fore quarter; afterwards he said he found the whole sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to induce him to tell you about it? - A.No; he said the windpipe belonged to a sheep's head he bought at Barnet; by the size I knew it to be a lamb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You call them lambs under two years old? - A. No, under one year old.</p>
               <p>Q. You have knowledge enough to distinguish whether it was a ewe or wether? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ALLEN sworn. - I searched the prisoner's house with the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell whether the joints belonged to a ewe lamb? - A. Yes, they did; he told us he had found the sheep, or a part of the sheep, in a sack, about two hundred yards from his own house; he first said he found a part of it, then the whole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found this about six o'clock going to my work; they asked if it was a whole sheep; I said, no; besides, it had not the head on.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure, that that which you describe to be a counterfeit, had not been in your pocket before they came into the shop? - A. I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many seven-shilling-pieces had you, besides this? - A.Five good ones; I cried out to my man, Thomas, pursue them, they have done me; I put them all in my pocket, and went in pursuit of the prisoner; from some information I received, we found them in a gin-shop in the neighbourhood; I got there first, then my man,

               <p>Q. Did you weigh the others? - A. I did, they were all good, I gave the bad one to Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, all you had in your pocket, when he came into the shop, were good?- A. Yes, I weighed them five minutes before; I attended before the Alderman, on Monday, he was committed for re-examination on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You are a butcher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Saturday is the busiest day you have? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it customary, when you receive a seven-shilling-piece to weigh it? - A. I always weigh them as soon as I take them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to weigh six seven-shilling-pieces together? - A. On Saturday afternoon, I put the money out of my pocket, at tea, and then I weighed the seven-shilling-pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You weighed these seven-shilling-pieces twice? - A. Yes, when I took them, and when I took them out of the till, and put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How came you to weigh them?- A. I had nothing else to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you weigh them? - A. At my desk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160035"/>Q. You weighed them at the desk the first time?- A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dean in the shop when you weighed them the second time? - A. I believe he was, he was hanging up the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he observe your weighing the seven-shilling-pieces? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what a seven-shilling-piece ought to weigh? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear then that it was not weight? - A. It was not weight by the balance we weigh seven-shilling-pieces with.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did they come into your shop?- A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other customers in the shop before? - A. Yes, they went out just as they came in, they gave me a seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh the seven-shilling-piece those persons gave you, before you weighed the seven-shilling-piece you took of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear that it was five minutes before, that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say a while ago, that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces five minutes before, because you had nothing else to do? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me you weighed the six, and this was the second time you weighed them?- A. I weighed the five I took out of the till, and then weighed the sixth.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the constable that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you charge him, before the constable, with having stole two seven-shilling-pieces? - A. No; I said, I did not know till I weighed them, but there might be two; I cannot recollect what I told the constable, he took them and weighed them, and there was only one.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon the oath you have taken, did not you charge the man with having stolen two seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I cannot recollect what I said to the constable, may be I might say two seven-shilling-pieces; I did not know till I weighed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you to say, you only weighed one, and therefore you did not know? - A. After the prisoner went out, I only weighed one in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you weigh the rest? - A. At the watch-house; the constable sent to my house for the weights.</p>
               <p>Q. You said awhile ago, that a seven-shilling-piece was given you by the customer, just as the prisoner came in, had your servant gone out of the shop then? - A. No, he was there all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about that seven-shilling-piece? - A. No, the woman that was with the prisoner, when I weighed the seven-shilling-piece I took of the other people, said, that was a good one.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said, at any time, that you never weighed the money after the time that you weighed the six seven-shilling-pieces? - A. I weighed the five.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not you said, that after you weighed all the seven-shilling-pieces in your pocket, no person came in before the prisoner? - A. No one came into the shop after the prisoner gave the seven-shilling-piece back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that no person came into your shop in the intrim, between your weighing the seven-shilling-pieces, till the prisoner came in? - A. Not after I took the seven-shilling-piece, there were two persons in the shop, when the prisoner and his wife came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you marked the seven-shilling-pieces before you put them in your pocket? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the dates? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no way of distinguishing them, but by the weight? - A. No, I always weigh every one I take.</p>
               <p>Q. Your observation was drawn to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were attending to him, did you see him change either of the seven-shilling-pieces?- A. I saw him take up the seven-shilling-pieces, and throw them down again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see him change either of them? - A. I did not know but they were my own two, when he slung them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him change them? - A. I saw him take them up, and throw them down.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you see him change them or not? - A. I saw him take my two up, and saw him sling them down again.</p>
               <p>Q. I must have an answer - did you or not see him change the money? - A. I did not know that he changed them, I certainly saw him change them; I did not see the change take place; I did not know what you meant by the question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Did not you say you saw him change them? - A. I saw him take them up, and sling them down.</p>

On the 20th of January I found one of the boxes standing upright, and one was turned down on one side; I left both standing upright; there were fourteen pieces missing, and some broke; I made a memorandum at the time of what was remaining.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you found these things, was there any conversation between you and the prisoner? - A. I told him, I came to seek for china; he said, he had got none, he had some Staffordshire ware, which he shewed me, in a corner cupboard; I desired Harding, the constable, who was with me, to get on a chair, and reach me a cup which I saw on the top of the cupboard; he gave it me down, and I said, search for more, this is the china I want; and he gave me down the different pieces; I had a pattern from the Custom-house warehouse, it matched that pattern; I told him, he must go along with me to the Custom-house; he said, with all his heart; he said, he had bought the china of Parsons, and gave him half a pint of gin for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This china was on the top of the cupboard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body going into the room might see it?- A. Yes, if they went to that corner; the cupboard is in a corner behind a bed.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Excise watchman; the prisoner was an Excise watchman; I was on the watch with the prisoner in Sam's-passage, in the latter end of November, I was at the upper end, and the prisoner at the lower end; I cannot recollect the day of the month or the day of the week, it was between the 25th of November and the 1st of December; Abijan Penny came to me between two and three o'clock in the morning, and asked me to lend him my stick, it is a stick with a hook; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he told me, he would tell me presently; I lent him my stick, and a short time after, he shewed me some china.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he do with the stick? - A. He stooped down towards the warehouse window where the china was, he tied my stick to another stick which he had, it was a cellar window, I saw him put the sticks between the bars, I did not see him take any china out; I heard some china rattle, and heard some make a noise, as if breaking. A few minutes after, the prisoner shewed me some china cups and saucers, the cups had handles, they appeared like coffee cups, being dark, I could not observe the pattern; he told me, he had got it out of the warehouse, and pointed towards the cellar. I had a heavy charge of wine; he was relieved in the morning before me; when he was relieved, he told me he had got the china in his great-coat pocket, and pointed to his left side; he told me, he was going to Billingsgate, there was a fish cart going his way home, to Holborn, and he would take it home in that cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you come here in custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give any account of this? - A. A few days after, when Grigg came into the passage, he belongs to the Excise watch; we got into conversation, and I mentioned about the china.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you forbear to mention it, because you expected yourself to be taken up, if it was known, and tried for it? - A. Yes, that was the reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any intelligence of it till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160037"/>you thought he would be taken up, and then you would be taken up, and tried for it? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On Tuesday, the 15th, I observed this man in Cornhill; I followed him, about twenty minutes, in Cornhill, Bishopsgate-street, and Gracechurch-street; I saw him attempt several gentleman's pockets in Gracechurch-street, between Fenchurch-street and Eastcheap; I saw him very closely pursue this gentleman, who was walking arm in arm with another gentleman; I was on the right hand side of the way, and he on the left, going towards London-bridge; a post-chaise passed between him and me, the moment the post-chaise passed me, I saw the prisoner go by the gentleman as quick as he could; I thought the gentleman had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the prosecutor? - A. Yes. I ran, across the way, and took him by the collar, and said, stop! I said to Mr. Greace, I believe you have lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing? - A. I saw him do nothing but draw his hand out of his bosom, and run by the gentleman as fast as he could run; I thought he had picked the gentleman's pocket of something, because he passed him so quick. Mr. Greace felt in his pocket, and said, he had lost his handkerchief; I said to the prisoner, what you have got, give to me; he immediately put his right hand in his bosom under his arm, and brought out this handkerchief, it is a figured cotton handkerchief, I have kept it from that time to this. (Producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Greace. This is my handkerchief, there is I.G. and No. 2; I have one of the same pattern in my pocket, I have had it about five weeks; I bought a dozen of them, they cost me at the rate of two shillings and seven pence each; I don't think it is diminished in it's value; I am certain I had it in my pocket at Lloyd's Coffee-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to work, going by this gentleman I picked up this handkerchief; I kept it in my left hand till I delivered it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give it up on the 12th? - A. I did not give it up, I left it; my portmanteau was there till after the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. What property was in the portmanteau that was missing afterwards? - A. One hundred and ten pounds, all in Bank-notes of different descriptions; I don't say certainly that the five-pound Bank-note was stole from me, because I passed some of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there any other of the value of ten pounds? - A. Yes, two ten-pound Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen them in your portmanteau last? - A. On Sunday, the 12th, they were in my portmanteau; I took out a five-pound note; the five-pound notes were in one bundle, and the others in another bundle; I did not open the bun<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160038"/>dle with the ten-pound notes, they were just as I had left them.</p>
               <p>Q.When can you speak certainly that they were there? - A. I cannot say, they were just as I had folded them up, the portmanteau was locked. On the 12th, I took a five-pound note out, and locked it again.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you examine the portmanteau again? - A. On Friday, the 17th, I went up to my room; it is a soft leather portmanteau. I went to unbuckle it, and found the chain run but half through, and the lock hanging to the staple, but not locked; it alarmed me a little, I knew somebody must have been at it; I put my hand in, and took out my pocket-book, the paper the notes were in was thrust into my pocket-book, and all the notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of the notes since? - A. Yes, they passed through the Bank; the Clerk of the Bank is here with them.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner? - A. I never spoke to him; I understand he lodged in the next room, I don't know whether I have ever seen him in the house, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.What happened between the 12th and 17th, you know nothing about? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not unroll them to see if any of them were there? - A. No; they were folded up in the state I left them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you know the numbers of them when they were in your portmanteau? - A. No, I did not know the numbers; I had a ten-pound Post-bill.</p>

I was down in Scotland; I was apprehended there, and kept in Edinburgh jail three months; I petitioned, and by the assistance of Mr. Erskine got removed to London.</p>

                        targets="t18030216-47-defend301 t18030216-47-deflabel259"/>; I saw him and the rest of the lockers approach the top of the avenue leading from the warehouse to Bear-lane;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160041"/>I desired them to return, for I wanted to go into the warehouse; they did return with apparent reluctance.</p>
               <p>Q.How far was the prisoner from the warehouse? - A.About forty or fifty feet; they were retiring to dinner; the prisoner was coming in the direction from the warehouse; he had not reached the street; it is part of the premises, and at time considered as part of the warehouse; sugars are lodged there. One of the lockers opened the door, and I went in; the prisoner did not go in at that time; he ran up stairs into an higher story; I followed him, and brought him back, and after I had got them in the warehouse, I felt their cloaths, and discovered the prisoner and another had coffee about them; the prisoner had 4lb. two ounces secreted between the back and lining of his waistcoat, which communicated with his pockets; I took it from him; he assisted me; he listed it up, and it ran down into his pocket, which was the way he took it out; I asked him to inform me who were the receivers, but he did not; he said he had taken it out of the warehouse; that he had done it before, but that what he had taken was only for his family's use.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coffee found upon him of the same description as the coffee in Mr. Lingham's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to miss so small a quantity?- A. Yes, it was clean raw coffee.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were very anxious to discover the depredators to get at the receivers, did you tell him it would be the better for him to tell who were the receivers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether your object was to get at the receivers, and to admit this man an evidence against the receivers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not these men little perquisites? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that it was the prisoner that said, what you have stated, or a person of the name of Evans? - A.Evans said, he had never taken any before; the prisoner said, it is common for people to say, it is the first time, but I will not deny it, I have taken some before.</p>

             sworn. - I am a locker belonging to the Customs, and have been so seventeen years: I was on duty on the watch, on Saturday the 15th of January, attending the sugar-coopers, drawing some sugar; coming down from the half-story, behind the door, I observed some coffee concealed under some clover hay, I was going to the other side of the yard, I saw Batchelor, I told him there was some coffee concealed behind the door, and desired him to go and seize it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he do so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that be the duty of a coffee-locker to do, if there was coffee concealed? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon a seizure made by a locker, he is entitled to a part of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was upon sugar, therefore it was not your duty to seize it? - A. Yes, I had a right as much as he, but I had not time to seize it, and referred it to Batchelor; I had three warehouses open at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the quantity behind the door?- A. No, it was laid open and covered with clover; I went to look for a piece of chalk, and put my hand upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Would it not have been a part of your duty to seize it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not seize it? - A. I had not time, I had to look after the sugar.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it customary for an officer, when he makes a seizure, to conceal it in his waistcoat? - A. That I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - A. I cannot say, I believe about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see him first, after he was charged with this? - A. I saw them when they came back, they called me up, they searched my pockets, and bid me go about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been searched before you went away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information to Mr. Clarke of the coffee behind the door? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. If you had not seen Batchelor, the coffee-locker, should not you have seized it yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Clarke.) Q.Duff was not the other that coffee was found on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there while the prisoner was searched? - A. Yes, we called him up.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160042"/>Q.Whether the prisoner, at the time, said any thing of this being a seizure, or did Duff say any thing of its being a seizure? - A. Not a word.</p>

               <p>Q.Who? - A.Messrs. Crowe and Company, of the Suffolk and Essex Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he was? - A. I cannot recollect what he said; in the course of conversation, he said, his brother was exceeding fond of prints, I suppose he meant Mr. Brown; I shewed him a work I was about to publish, Views of Paris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more? - A.This little order I could not make out, this is the order he produced to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you that paper? - A. Yes, and told me to make an engraving from it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many impressions did he order? - A. I did not print it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plates? - A. One plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate to correspond with that paper?- A. Yes; there was a little part of the ornament I could not make out, he said, he would furnish me with one of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you to get the plate ready by? - A. In a few days.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you perform the order by getting the plate ready? - A. I said, I could do it in the course of a week; I got it ready in a week; he came in three or four days after, and said, they should not change their banker, and therefore I was to fill it up as the note was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more conversation then? - A. No; the prisoner went away, he gave me the note the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came the second time, did he give any direction about filling up the note? - A. Yes, as the old note, Barclay, Triton and Company; in about three days he called again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you compleated the plate then? - A. No; he called again in an hour, and it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate performed according to the order he had given you? - A. Yes, in every respect; I made him out a bill of parcels for the plate, in the name of Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plate? - A. He took it away with him; he gave me, I think, 2l. 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the plate again? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in January; on Monday, the 10th of January, he came into my shop, he appeared as if he had just come from the country, he had a couple of sporting dogs with him; he produced the plate, and told me, he wanted one hundred impressions taken from it as quick as possible; he told me, he must have them early the next morning, to take some of them to the Stamp-office, to get them stamped; he said, he wanted to send some of them out of town the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160043"/>day; he delivered the plate to me, to have the order executed.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of this order, what did you do? - A. I cut the paper, and sent the paper and the plate to a man of the name of Prosser, that does piece work for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the order executed by Prosser according to your direction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you next see the prisoner? - A. The next morning, about eleven o'clock; he came into my shop, he looked at the notes, they were all spread upon my counters to dry, he found fault with them, and said, the paper was too thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the same plate back from Prosser?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see it? - A. Yes; he complained the paper was too thick; he said, they were not worth a d - n, it had not the appearance of Bank-paper, that the people in the country would not look at it; he then told me I must print him another hundred from the same plate, and gave me directions where to go and buy proper sort of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy the paper according to his direction? - A. Yes, and sent them to Prosser to print, as I had done the former hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order executed by Prosser? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A.The same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the second impression and the plate then? - A. Yes, they were spread out on the counter; he said, they would do very well; I made a parcel of them together with the plate, and gave them to him; he put them into his pocket, and paid me for them.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the first hundred? - A. He put them in his pocket when he ordered the second hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the engraved plate you received from him, was the same you delivered back? - A. It is impossible for me to swear it, it had every appearance of being the same, it was out of my house in the hands of Prosser.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the prisoner before?- A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you confident he is the person? - A. I am confident of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Bow-street officer; I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday afternoon, the 19th of January, at No. 26, in Mercer's-street, Long-acre; he was at home at dinner; Mr. Brown, the prosecutor, accompanied me to the lodgings; Mr. Brown opened the door, and looked in, and said, there he is; I went into the room, and told him he was my prisoner; he then got up, and I began to search him, and in one of his waistcoat pockets I found a key that belonged to a black leather portmanteau trunk; when I opened it, I found these notes and this plate; I brought the trunk and the prisoner to the Office, and opened the trunk at the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. With the key you took from the prisoner? - A. Yes, in the presence of the Magistrate; I went back, and brought away all his property; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing the prisoner said at any time that you recollect? - A. No, that I remember, he said nothing to me. - (The plate and notes produced.) - These seven are stamped and filled up, with the dates and the name; these are not; one parcel of them is thick, and the other thin paper; there are one hundred and fifty in the whole, including the seven.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it a fact that some of them are thicker paper than the others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You took him away the first time you went? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were first there you searched his pocket, and found a key; did you see the trunk then? - A.There was a great deal of rubbish; I did not observe the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go after he was at the Officer? - A. In about half an hour; there was a woman in the room; I believe he cohabited with her; she pointed out all the articles to me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Girton.) Look at the plate, is that the plate you furnished the prisoner with? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the note? - A. This is an impression made from that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that plate made according to the direction in the order - do the plate and directions correspond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hammond.) Look at that plate? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any direction for any thing to be struck off from that plate? - A. Yes two separate hundreds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other plate from the Suffolk bank from which you had any orders to strike off any impressions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosser.) Look at the plate, is that the plate you received from Hammond to strike off any impressions? - A. I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those seven notes, do they appear to be struck off from that? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them - one of the parcels? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160045"/>These appear to be the impressions first taken; they are the thick.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other parcel? - A. I believe these were struck off that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, the bill in question? - A. I don't perceive any difference.</p>
               <p>Q.Does that appear to be taken off the same plate? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike off any notes for that bank before? - A.Never; I have for other banks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Can you take upon you to swear that was taken from that plate? - A. I cannot take upon me to swear it was; it has every appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference between that and the others? - A. I cannot perceive any difference, only the impression is rather fainter; those done on a thicker paper appear stronger.</p>

I am a journeyman shoemaker; I had five guineas and three seven-shilling-pieces when I went to bed, I had not been at work, I had been at Norfolk, and had returned but four or five days before, I had not done any work; I got up in the morning and had my breakfast, with Griffiths and a sailor that was in the house, I paid one shilling and sixpence for the three breakfasts, I had my money then; I had a pint or two of porter, and some ale, between breakfast and dinner, the landlady dressed me some pork chops, which Griffiths took part of; after dinner Berks came in, and he partook of two or three pots of beer with Griffiths and me, then I left the room, this was about three o'clock; I happened to meet with a friend in the tap-room, he said he had no money, or we would have a pint together; I said, if he had no money I had, and would treat him; we had three pints together; I pulled out my pocketbook, with two seven-shilling-pieces and five guineas in gold; the two prisoners both came out of the room where I left them, and came into the tap-room, just as I pulled my money out, I took out a seven-shilling-piece to pay for what we had had, and Berks hit me a violent stroke on the wrist, and beat the two seven-shilling-pieces, and the five guineas, out of my hand; they fell upon the floor, and Berks stooped and took up a guinea, Griffiths gathered up four guineas, and one seven-shilling-piece, Griffiths gave it me into my hand; I laid it on the edge of the table, and said I had lost another seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this money knocked out of your hand in play? - A. The blow was so violent I could not think it in play, I felt the blow the next day; I told Berks he had got a guinea of my money, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160046"/>disowned having it; I desired him to strip, and be searched.</p>
               <p>Q.Your friend was by at the time? - A. Yes; when he saw what they were about, he left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the room when Berks struck your hand? - A. Yes; Berks pulled off some of his clothes, and said, when he was stripped he would give me a d-'d good basting; the landlord's maid, or daughter, brought me a candle to look for the seven-shilling-piece; it was a close box, I could not see well without a candle; I saw Griffiths take the four guineas and seven-shilling-piece off the table, I thought he was going to keep it safe for me, as he gave it me before, but he put it in his pocket; at that time Berks had got his clothes on again; Berks said to Griffiths let us brush, and they ran away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Griffiths that he had got your money? - A. Yes; I asked them both for my money, and they set off, they made me very little answer at all; I went to see for a constable, but did not find one immediately; I thought, as I knew Berks, and where he lodged, he would give me my money without a constable; I went to the house where they lodged, the Prince's-Head, Prince's-street; when I went they had changed their clothes, one had got on the other's great coat, and the other had got another great coat on; I asked them for my money, they had left me without a shilling to pay my reckoning or lodging; they went out of the house, I followed them, and asked them to give me my money, or some of it; they said if I followed them they would knock me down; I went and got an officer, Jones, and they were taken. I saw one of them at Marlborough-street on the Wednesday, and the other on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your money again? - A. I never got a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you had been drinking several pints of beer that day - were you sober? - A. The day before I was intoxicated, but the day I lost my money I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure these are the two men?- A.These are the two men, and these only.</p>

I knew Griffiths was at the Westminster-arms; I went to him, and found Gafford in the tap-room, he desired me to wait a little, he said a pot of beer was coming, and drink before you go; by accident I hit his elbow, and knocked the money out of his hand; I begged his pardon, and said, let Griffiths pick it up; I did not stoop myself at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear one voice, or more? - A. One voice; he said, pull up; the boy did not immedidiately stop, and one of them fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him fire? - A. I did not see him fire, but I heard the report; I did not see the flash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person that fired? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say which way his hand was directed? - A. No; one came up to the chaise-door, and demanded my money, the other stood on the side of the horses; I threw out my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man that demanded your money do any thing? - A. No; the one at the chaise-door held a pistol near me, they had each a brace of pistols; I threw my purse out at the window upon the ground, the one near the chaise dismounted, and picked up the purse; he mounted again, and wished us a good morning, and both went away together; it was near a cross-road, they went towards London.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BISHOP sworn. - On the 6th of January, I was driving Mr. Millwood, and two ladies, in a post-chaise; I saw two men riding immoderately fast towards me, with black crapes over their faces, one was a stout man, the other thinner, much of a height, apparently to me as they were on horseback; when they came up to me, the thinnest said, pull up, young man, I was going at the rate of seven miles an hour, and could not pull up so soon as they wished; the thinnest presented a short pistol to me, turned it to a different direction and discharged it; he turned it away from doing any mischief to the company or myself, or the horses, or the chaise; after that, the thinnest rode up to the off-side of the chaise, and said, your money, your money; the gentleman made answer, and said, I have thrown my purse out of the window, in the road, that was the right-side; the thinnest alighted and looked for the purse, and not finding it readily, he got warm in his temper; I looked round, and saw the purse at the toe of his right-foot, I pointed it out to him; he put his finger and thumb to the crape, listed it up, and took up the purse, and mounted his horse, and said, farewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man all the time? - A. Close by the side of me, he said, where is it, where is it, meaning the purse.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take any notice of the men or the horses? - A. I inspected minutely into the stoutest of the men, and imagined, if I saw him again, I should know him; the prisoner at the bar does not appear to be the man that stood at the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What horse was the man on that stood next to you? - A. A dark chesnut horse; the thinnest was mounted on a bright bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take much notice of the thinnest, who came up to the chaise? - A. I saw no part of his face or flesh; I cannot take upon me to know him if I saw him.</p>

On Wednesday evening, I looked at my notes, there were five, four Bank-notes, one country note, and a five-pound Bank-note; when I went to put my coat on, on Thursday morning, I looked at my pocket-book the first thing I did when I went up after having my hair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160050"/>dressed, which was about ten o'clock, I then missed another note; I came down, the prisoner was at breakfast in the kitchen; I said to Mrs. Adams, who was in the kitchen, you have not touched my pocket-book this morning; she said, no; I said, there is another note gone this morning, that makes two; the prisoner immediately said, if you have any suspicion of me, I have no objection to stand search; I told her I had very great reason to suspect her, and that confirmed my suspicion; I went for an officer; when he came, she said, she had no objection to his searching her, and if he thought fit, he might search her box; I desired the officer to search her box; he went up and searched it, and came down again; he said he had found no notes, but he had found five guineas in gold; he produced the guineas rolled up in an old pair of gloves; I asked her how she came by that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Had not you made some promise that you would be lenient to her? - A. None, at all; she said she had received them from her sister on Sunday night, to send into the country to her father to pay for nursing her sister's child; the sister living in the neighbourhood, I sent the officer for her, and asked her if she had given any money to her sister, and to what amount, on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of the prisoner? - A. No; I said I was not satisfied with the account of the five guineas, I would have her before a Magistrate; she then went down on her knees, and said, if I would forgive her, she would fetch me the notes; I asked her where they where; she said she would fetch them; she ran up stairs, and I followed her into my daughter's bed-room, and from between the two mattresses, the straw and wool mattress under the bed, she took out a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you were in the room? - A. Yes, and the constable with me; she took out the handkerchief, which contained several other articles, among the rest, a small purse, which contained two notes; the constable has the notes in his possession, with some other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. As a gentleman, you would not have taken a girl without a character? - A.Certainly not.</p>

            ; the prisoner lived in my service a year and a quarter, in consequence of some suspicion of the prisoner, on the 26th of January, I went for Alderman, the constable, and took him into the dining-room, and rang for the prisoner to come up; I said, Rebecca, I have strong reasons for believing you have been robbing me and my partner; she said, what me, sir, and coloured very much; I had missed some property, in consequence of taking stock that morning; the constable searched her pockets in my presence, and found the key of her box, and some money; the officer then desired to open her box, she went up stairs with him, with some reluctance; the box was opened in her presence, and there were found in it two different remnants of calico, a yard each, and a remnant of dimity, two yards, and one remnant of cambric muslin, about six yards afterwards, in a closet, in her bed-room; there was a bag belong ing to her, in which there was another remnant of calico, about a yard, and another remnant of cambric muslin, about three or four yards; I asked her how she came by them, she said, she had some long before she came to me, that she bought them in Yorkshire, and elsewhere; I can speak to the cambric muslin, when we took stock, we missed a piece of that kind, twelve yards, it is a very particular piece, we never had but four pieces of that sort, it has our own private mark, they are in the constable's possession; in a housewife of the prisoner's, we found a key which fitted the lock of the box, in which we kept the keys of the warehouse; when we found the key of her box, she said, she had no other key; I told her, I was certain she had; she went down stairs, the officer and myself followed her into the kitchen, she found this housewife, and took out the key; that box which held the keys was taken up stairs every night in case of fire, and put in a closet; the officer then took her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ALDERMAN sworn. - I am a constable: On the 26th of January, I was sent for to Mr. Hartwell's, I searched the prisoner, and found a key which opened her box; I opened the box in her presence, and found a piece of muslin, and the other articles I have with me; she was asked by Mr. Beaman, who was present, if she had any other key, she said, she had no other key; in consequence of which, when we came into the kitchen, I said, it would give me less trouble, if she would produce the key that Mr. Hartwell said she had; she then opened a drawer, and took out a housewife, and took a key out of it, which opened Mr. Hartwell's box, Mr. Hartwell said, that is the key, I tried it, it opened the box very easily. (The key and the things mentioned in the indictment were produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hartwell.) As this is a common key, how came you to hunt after such a key? - A. In consequence of some information I had received,(looks at the things;) this is a part of the 9-8ths<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160052"/>muslin we missed, on taking our stock; it has the No. 12 on it in a kind of buff-coloured thread, and No. 13 in a pencil mark, with our private mark, LIW, in my partner's hand-writing, it is a plain cambric muslin; the remnant of dimity was torn off a piece which I have in Court, I have no doubt of its being our property; we never sell any retail; we never cut any thing.</p>
               <p>Q.She could not have bought this of you? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEAMAN sworn. - That is my handwriting on the muslin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What I had in my box, I bought and paid honestly for; if there was any thing in my box not mine, I did not put it there.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you first see it upon him? - A. I saw him come from the door with it, it was given out to him by the apprentice, who has since absconded; I told him, that he had not got the cork at Westminster, that he should go back with me; coming along, I asked him if he knew Mr. Bidgood and Browns, he said, he did; I said, he had got it from there, he acknowledged he had; I took him into the shop of Bidgood and Brown, and he was given in charge to the watch.</p>

             sworn. - John Bidgood is my partner: On the 31st of January, a little after nine in the evening, the prisoner was brought into our house by the last witness, with the cork, he informed me he had caught the prisoner, taking cork away from our door, that he followed him into King's-street, took him into custody, and brought him to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this in the hearing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I ordered the watchman to take him away to the watch-house; we had an apprentice in the house, James Withy, brother-in-law of the prisoner; James Withy shut up the shop, and was the last person in the shop, after the men were gone, my suspicions fell upon him, I asked him, if he knew any thing of that cork.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160053"/>Q.Was that in the presence of the prisoner?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I can't hear it.</p>
               <p>Brown. I then sent the apprentice likewise to the watch-house, and went to the watch-house, and gave charge of the prisoner and the apprentice; the apprentice has since run away from our house, he was examined by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONWAY sworn. - I attended the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what passed taken down in writing? - A. Yes, the last day; I don't know, whether it was taken down at the first examination or not.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Brown.) What passed at the first examination? - A. Mr. Brody ordered me to take back the apprentice, that he might be brought forward as an evidence against the prisoner; accordingly I did, and about two days after, he ran away, and took his clothes; we have advertised him, but have heard nothing of him since; Lowther has had the cork in his custody ever since. (Lowther produced the cork.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brown.) Can you swear that to be your cork? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any cork at that time? - A. Yes, about that quantity, the man informed me what state he left the cork in.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONWAY sworn. - I am journeyman in the house of Bidgood and Brown; I cannot swear to the cork further than missing about this quantity; when I came to work in the morning, my master asked me if I knew how I left the cork, I told him, yes, I left it piled up behind me; when I came up stairs the cork was scattered about the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the cork in the street, there was no person near, it was twenty yards from the door.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Johnson, I live opposite the gates; coming out of my house, I heard chains, and the backbands rattle in the yard, it was as dark as it could be, I had a lantern; going to the stable about five o'clock, as near as could be, I asked who was there, two or three times, and received no answer; I was going to Stratford, for my master, and thought he had sent somebody else; I went round to the stable, and saw the accompting-house broke open; going into the stable, I found the back stable door broke open, I went into the yard, and heard the chains gingle still; I followed the found of the chains, and by the lantern, I had a glimpse of two men; I asked Davis what he wanted there, he asked who I was, and what I wanted, and said, if I came any further, I was a dead man, he would run me through; I took up a stone, and threw it at him, and hit him on his bank; I believe I took him with the iron back bands, the other got away; I called my master up, and he desired I would take him away to the watch-house, when I came to the watch-house, the watchman was gone; I called Griffiths the officer up, and delivered him to him; they had undone the gates to get at the wicket, which was latched, they came over the wall, or some place to unbolt the gates; Davis said, they were going to sell the things to a lusty woman in Cabell-street; Griffiths and I went there, and took the other prisoner with the fowls and other things upon him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Johnson.) How was your place broke open? - A. I don't know, only undoing the latches.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they get into the yard? - A.Through the gates, they were all open, as my man told me; the desk in the accompting-house, which was locked, was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was last in the yard that night? - A. I cannot tell, sometimes one, and sometimes another of the men are last.</p>
               <p>Kingsland. I was the last that fastened the gates; I went with the team, I fastened the stable, I bolted the gates, and went out at the little front gate, about eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure no one went in afterwards? - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.How could they unbolt the gates? - A. They They got over the wall, I suppose; the back gates come to the back part, and the front gates into the fore part.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your fellow-servants here? - A.No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160054"/>Q.Might not they come in after that? - A. No, I always see them out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Johnson.) Suppose I was to come to your house, I could come in at that gate? - A. Not without ringing, unless you know how to open the gate.</p>

            , whom I took to be the landlord, was in the bar with a woman;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160055"/>I desired him to take care of my chest; the prisoner came along-side me, and said, take care not to let any body have the chest but me or him; I said, what do you mean by that, the chest does not belong to you, and I said to Carter, take care of the chest, what is in it belongs to me, it was all my property, and if he lost it I would make him he answerable for it; I said I hoped the chest would be safe; the prisoner said, if there was gold in it it would be safe; I had got the bag in my hand at the bar; I kept it in my hand; my wife tied her pattens round it as a token; it was our bag, and it was put in the store-room; I went into the parlour, and had some porter; I put my coat under my head, and fell asleep; my wife waked me, and recommended me to have some tea to refresh me.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you see the chest again? - A. About an hour after I awoke; there was a card with a direction nailed on the side, that was torn off; it was directed, John Smith, to be left till called for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You came to town on the 24th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest was marked that you could know it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about the prisoner, he was a stranger to you? - A. Yes; he was very officious.</p>
               <p>Q.Because he assisted you, you call him officious? - A. He was very officious.</p>
               <p>Q. All the things that were in the box when it was brought to the Queen's Head, Darkhouse-lane, are in it now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your box is safe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the master of the Dark-house here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not up I suppose? - A. No, I believe not; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say you wanted to go to Deptford? - A. No; I said I wanted to go to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say he had a boat, and could carry you across the River? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the chest taken to a Custom-house officer? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you see a watch-box at the bottom of the stairs? - A. I heard there was a box left in the care of the watchman at Temple-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know that the box was left with the watchman to be examined? - A. Only what I heard.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WRIGHT sworn. - I am in the Company's service; I am employed occasionally as a porter to carry any thing at Mr. Hoddy's, the Queen's Head, in Darkhouse-lane; I was there between three and four in the morning of the 25th of January; I saw Climer there; he employed me to carry a chest to a boat; when I had got the chest he ordered me to carry the chest to Temple-stairs; he told me it was his own property, and that he was going to Deptford; he went with me to Temple-stairs; when we came there, there was no boat; there was a King's watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is Temple-stairs? - A. The next plying-place below Billingsgate, between the Custom-house and Billingsgate; I set down the chest on some casks standing on end; we left it in the charge of the watchman till called for; he said a Captain was coming down with some more things in a boat, and then I should be paid for it; he told me not to make any charge to the gentleman, but leave it to his generosity, and he supposed it would be 2 or 3s. or more, in my way; Climer and I returned to the Queen's Head; Carter came down, and enquired who had taken the chest; I told him I had; he said, I think you have taken a wrong chest; he said, go down with the man, and see whether he has got a key that fits the chest; Climer went down with me to Temple-stairs, and pulled out something he pretended was the key, and applied it to the keyhole; being satisfied I came back with Climer; I had no suspicion of him; the chest was lashed as it is now; coming back he parted with me before we got to the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go? - A. No, I missed him suddenly coming towards Billingsgate; I went to the Queen's Head, and Carter told me to go with another man, and bring back the chest, which I did; between six and seven I saw the prisoner at the Dark-house, (that is another house) in the custody of

               <p>Kerr. There is no mark on it; I have no doubt of its being mine; I cannot swear to it; we have the pattern of it at home; we bought a great quantity; I have seen the same pattern in other shops; we missed one furniture exactly of this description after we had been before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took them with no intention of defrauding my employers; I owed some money, and was afraid of being arrested; I meant to take them out and replace them; I did it more through foolishness than a roguish intent; I had some money due to me; I thought I should get that money, and take them out.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH WENTWORTH sworn. - I am a coaldealer; I live at No. 15, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross; I was called on the 28th of January, between eight and nine in the evening, to go to Mr. Shaw's warehouses, by Thomas Davis; he told me there were two men had broke open the door of Mr. Shaw's warehouse at the bottom of Cow-cross; I went down; before I got to the place, about thirty yards from it, I discovered two men going away from the door of the warehouse; I went down immediately to the warehouse, and put my hand to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160059"/>feel whether or no the doors had been broken; I found the door had been pinched open, so far as I could get my hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean forced open? - A. Yes, I saw no more of the men: I went to a public-house, the corner of Jacob's-court; I called the next witness, another officer, and gave him a description of what had passed, and information what to do; he sent a little boy to go into a public-house; I saw him repulsed twice, they would not let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house? - A. I cannot tell, I am not acquainted with it; upon that I waited to watch the warehouse, till twelve o'clock; I saw a man lurking about, not one of these; I went up to our watch-house, where the two witnesses that are to be called were, and informed them there were persons lurking about; upon that I was sent out again, it was nigh twelve o'clock; some people were coming from the play, and I followed them close down to the warehouse side, where I saw a short man coming up Sharpe's-alley, from the back part of the warehouse; I took no notice, but went back again to the watch-house, and informed White what I saw; White went out upon that, and I staid in the watch-house, and he brought up a young lad, neither of these three, he delivered him into my custody, and went out again and brought in the prisoner Holmes; when he brought him into the watch-house, I observed something white on his back; I said to him, has the constable White been rolling you in the snow, there was snow on the ground; upon that he took off his coat and shook it, and said, he had fell down; upon that I put him back in the place for security; White, and Lammas, another officer, went out again from the watch-house; they next brought in the prisoner, Butler, we put them both back into our place for security; White and I went down to the warehouses, and went into Sharpe's-alley; the warehouse goes through from Cow-cross into Sharpe's-alley, into Mr. Lee's, a carcase-butcher's yard; there were two gates of Mr. Lee's to open, before we could get into the warehouse; when we got to the warehouse, I found a pair of large doors broke open by violence, they were the outer doors of the warehouse; we found one slitch of bacon out of the warehouse, lying under the wall, and in the warehouse two more taken out of a pack, and brought forward from where the pack of bacon lay, towards the door, the pack was cut open, it had contained four flitches, three were removed; upon that we called Mr. Shaw, but he did not come till we had brought the bacon to the watch-house; we left the bacon at the watch-house, and Lammas, White, and myself, went out to look about to see if we could see any more on the spot; as we were coming out of Sharpe's-alley, we heard a cart coming down Turnmill-street, leading to Cow-cross, he came up as far as the warehouse door, and there he made a kind of a stop; I followed the cart down to the alley, White was the first that followed it; when I came down, I asked Bishop, who brought the horse and cart down to the warehouse, down Sharpe's-alley, whether there was neither name or number on the cart, and where he was going, he said, he had had some words with his wife, and he was going to take his horse and cart down to his wife's mother, who lived in Sharpe's-alley; we got a watchman's lantern, and looked round the cart, and found neither name nor number on it; with that we took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house, and secured the cart.</p>

               <p>Q. That is all that passed between you and Bishop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe any thing about Holmes's coat? - A. I forgot to tell about that; when we got back into the warehouse, I told Lammas and White, that Holmes had something white on his coat, it was salt, I rasted it, and so did the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So you tasted salt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there are three forty pounds to be rasted? - A. I come on no such account.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never heard there is a reward of forty pounds on each head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE sworn. - I am a constable: On the 28th of last month, I had information from these two boys, and Wentworth, that the warehouse of Mr. Shaw, in Cow-cross, was broke open; I asked the boys, if they knew where the men were; one of the boys said, they were in the adjoining public-house; I sent the boy to go in before me, he was sent back, he could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. What house is that? - A. I believe, the White-horse; I went in with the boy, and he said, there was none of them there, I came out, and agreed with Wentworth to watch the place, we did so, till twelve o'clock; a little after twelve, I saw Holmes come up from under the gateway, it was broke open in two places, one that comes into Sharpe's-alley, the other into Cow-cross; I saw Holmes coming under the gateway from Sharpe's-alley, I thought he had been in the snow, his coat appeared so white.</p>
               <p>Q.What did that white turn out to be afterwards? - A. I did not examine his coat, I put him in the watch-house; I came again, and found Butler at some distance from the place broke open; I brought him to the watch-house, and left him there; Wentworth asked me to taste what was on Butler's coat, I did, and found it to be salt.</p>
               <p>Q.Was his coat white too? - A. Yes, a little on the shoulder; I went down again, and saw Bishop come with his cart, I was waiting just by my own door, opposite the warehouse broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. A cart with one horse? - A. Yes; he got out of the cart there, took the horse by the head,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160060"/>and led him down Sharpe's-alley; he was stopped when he got about half-way down to the back-door that was broke open; I went to him, and got hold of the horse, and knew him, I had known him before; I asked him what he came there for, he said, to leave his cart for the night, and take his horse home.</p>
               <p>Q.What time of night was this? - A. Very near one o'clock; I looked round the cart, and found neither name nor number; I took the man into custody, and the cart likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure he stopped close to the warehouse door? - A. Yes, there are two large pair of gates, a cart might back into the warehouse that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how the warehouse had been broke open? - A. There was some wooden rails, some of the rails were broke, that a man might get through into the warehouse, and open the gates; the lock of the front door was wrenched off; the wooden railing was to let air into the cellar, the railing of the first door was broke, the wood was lying about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose cart this was? - A. No, Bishop owned it; he is a higler, and goes about the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Which of the boys was it you sent to the public-house? - A. I believe, the eldest.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was repulsed, and you afterwards went in with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of the prisoners were in the house? No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Bishop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him, was, with the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the warehouse was broke open before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Bishop's mother lives?- A. I believe lower down in Sharpe's-alley.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Has she any stable or coach-house? I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Any conveniency to stow a cart? - A. I believe not, she has only a one pair of stairs room to herself, she is a very poor woman.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAMMAS sworn. - I am an officer; about twelve o'clock at night, on the 28th of January, I saw Holmes after he was brought to the watch-house; I was present with White when Butler was taken; I was present when Bishop was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To John Shaw.) Does this warehouse belong to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody lives there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no dwelling-house at all? - A. No; I took it of a man that keeps a public-house next door.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got your bacon again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is in the hands of the constable, he'll save it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.How do you know the bacon? - A. There is the name of the factors upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body else that deals with them, would have their name on the bacon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Holmes's defence. I have witnesses to prove where I was; when we were at Hatton-garden, the side was cut in pieces, now they have brought the whole side.</p>
               <p>Butler's defence. I have witnesses to speak where I was.</p>
               <p>Bishop. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he live with Mr. Simpson at that time?- A. I thought he did; he returned in about twenty minutes, and said he had been to Mr. Bennett's for some knives for Mr. Simpson; Mr. Bennett lives opposite to us; he said Mr. Bennett had not such knives as Mr. Simpson wanted, and therefore he came back to me, thinking we might have them; he then presented a written order for the knives, I took it from him, and observed it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Simpson, he said, it was not, it was wrote by his shopman, Mr. Mackey, I asked him, if he was apprentice to Mr. Simpson, he said, he was not, but expected to be taken apprentice; I observed to him, that it was very late to send out knives that evening, and asked him, if morning would not do, it was about half after eight, or ten minutes to nine o'clock, he observed, that morning would not do, that there was a lady wait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160061"/>ing at Mr. Simpson's to see the knives, and wished to look at different patterns; about that time, one of one men, Humfrival, came in, and I told him I should want him to go with the prisoner to Mr. Simpson's, with some knives; I looked out seven parcels of knives, containing seventy-four knives and seventy-four forks, amounting to eleven pounds seven shillings; I took a baize cover and rolled them up carefully, and gave them to our man, and desired him to go along with him to Mr. Simpson's; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. How came you not to take them to Mr. Simpson's house? - A. I had a long way to go, it was late, I thought it perfectly safe.(Mr. Moffatt produced the order the prisoner brought.)</p>

             came with Lucas and Sharpe's dray to my house; he laid down a cask of amber; he said to me, I have a cask of the best table beer on my dray; you shall have it for three shillings and sixpence rather than take it home; I said, I had never taken table beer into the house, and should not begin then; this was whilst he was putting down the cask of beer; when he had done he began to press me, and said, it was as good as twopenny, and would draw for twopenny; he said, if I rubbed the chalk-mark off it, if the cooper came he would think it fine; he likewise said, when the coopers got drunk at home, he could bring beer out almost at any time; as soon as I conceived he had come unfairly by it, it struck me it would be better to inform Mess. Sharpe and Lucas of it, which I did, by letter, within an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the man for it? - A. Yes, three shillings and sixpence; we never purchase the cask; I shewed the cask to Mr. Sharpe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The cask was to go back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were to pay Sharpe and Lucas for the beer? - A. No, we only pay the collecting-clerk.</p>
               <p>Lucas. That cask was my cask, and I believe the beer is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you serve Mr. Hyde with any table beer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It was the bottoms I drained out of gentlemen's casks, and sold Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030216-72-verdict389" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I leave it to the mercy of the Court; he did not see me take them.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoner at a breeches-maker's, in Swallow-street; he was sitting on a pair of breeches, and these breeches were lying by him; he said they were his; we took him to the Office.</p>
               <p>JOHN COZENS sworn. - I am a shoemaker; I live at No. 4, Ogle-street; I have a coat and waistcoat I bought of the prisoner; I cannot justly say whether it was on Christmas-eve, or the day before; I sold him a pair of boots for 10s. I gave him the boots and 4s. for them.</p>
               <p>Crichton. These are my property; the breeches I cannot so positively swear to as the coat and waistcoat; he had not wore them, I suppose, more than five or six times; there was also a laced hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other cloaths? - A.Very few; I believe there was a jacket and waistcoat he left behind, very old; he went off in such great haste, he had not time to arrange his matters.</p>

               <p>Q. Who does the cellar belong to? - A.It is No. 3, in Well-street; the cellar is open, only a board over it, it is a place that people sift dust in; I made application to my master, that people were up and down in the cellar, and I expected there were some things there they would come for; I watched, and about six in the evening, Bellman and Evans came and went down, and Price stood at the end of the street; I had sent for an officer to be in readiness, to take them; seeing them go down, I gave information to the officer, and he came and took them immediately.</p>

               <p>Q.When you went out about five, where was your wife? - A. She went out with me, no person was left in the house, and nobody could get in without breaking the button.</p>

Not without getting over; I returned about nine o'clock, and missed the silver milk-pot, six silver tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs; I went up stairs, and looked under my bed, where I put my money, that was gone, forty-one pounds in Bank-notes, that was up two pair of stairs, there was one 15l. one 10l. two 5l. and one 2l. and the rest in one pounds; I looked in my chest, and missed one blue coat, four waistcoats, thirteen shirts, and thirty handkerchiefs, then I went and gave information to Mr. Dalton, the officer of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q.Why do you accuse the prisoner? - A. He had been a servant to me six weeks; I found a key on the chopping-block, which I had lost about ten days; on the Monday morning, we went to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160070"/>after him; we got information, that he was gone on board a Dutch vessel; we found him there; we found a ten pound note on the prisoner, and a guinea; we asked him where his chest was, he told us it was ast; we looked into the chest, and there I found a blue coat, four waistcoats, four shirts, a silver milk-pot, six silver tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and four watches.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose the things are here? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the night of the 9th of February? - A.About two o'clock, as near as I can recollect, I had occasion to get out of bed; when I looked at the window, I saw a great smother come out of the back part of the house, at the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Smoke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What house? - A.Hillingworth's house; I thought it was fire; I threw up the window, and then I saw the flame come out; upon which I called, fire! as loud as I could holla; after calling about ten minutes, the neighbours asked me where it was; after I had given the alarm, I came down stairs, and alarmed my brother, and then I went into the court, where I saw this woman walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see her? - A.When I first threw up the window, I saw the prisoner walking in the yard, and putting her hands up against the shutters, and putting them to.</p>
               <p>Q. The same window where the smother and smoke came out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed? - A. She had a kind of bed-gown on; with that I went into the court, to the front of the house, and saw her in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe her dress more particularly? - A. She was dressed, as she usually was, as I had seen her some days before; I went round into the court, and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say any thing to you, nor you to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her putting the shutters to, had she given an alarm? - A. No, none at all; I called, fire! as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hear you? - A. I don't know; I suppose she must.</p>
               <p>Q. How high were you? - A.Two-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the yard from you? - A.There were two yards from me, about two hundred yards, as far as that window (the window of the Sessions-House.)</p>
               <p>Q. By what light did you distinguish her? - A. It was moon-light, and snow upon the houses; it was very light; I thought at first it was day-light, and that I had slept too long.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her shutting the shutters, was that before you saw the flame? - A.As she shut them, the flame came towards her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are a pencil-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The room you saw the fire out of was the two-pair-of-stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was two o'clock in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The smoke came out of the back parlour?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You being two story high, at two o'clock in the morning, speaking to nobody, saw a woman in a bed-gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her shutting the shutters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the means of seeing her was the moonlight from a two-pair-of-stairs window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that she appeared to be dressed as usual, having a bed-gown on, or loosely thrown on? - A. She had a bed-gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear she was completely dressed; that the bed-gown was put on in the regular way? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Your attention was drawn to the fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, under the alarm your mind was in, positively to swear this was the woman, and dressed in that particular way? - A. Yes, I will take upon me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had she called out, fire! or given any alarm? - A. Not in my hearing; I believe I was the first that gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you give the alarm in the bed-room window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you got round to the court? - A.About twenty minutes; I had my clothes to put on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You observed a woman shutting the shutters, might it not be to prevent the air from getting in, and encrease the flames? - A. I apprehend it was to prevent the fire being discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. The flames, if not prevented by shutting the shutters, would have burnt any body standing so near? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. The flames were rushing out? - A. The smoke and flame were coming out, and she went to shut the shutters.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You have no doubt that the prisoner is the person you first saw? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the front door kept open or shut, latterly, of a night? - A. It was generally shut about eleven o'clock; they would open it to any body that knocked. About three or four days after he was arrested, I heard her say, she would go to an attorney, and enter an action against Mr. Dickinson, and have her revenge of him, for the man he had sent there, had broken two locks, and taken the key of the two-pair-of-stairs with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You came when Murray was making an alarm, what did you do? - A. I knocked at the door with a great stick, four or five times, and cried out, fire!</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door opened? - A. No. I then sprung my rattle, and alarmed the neighbours; I then went for the engine, and came back with it, and then the door was open; the soldier came out with the bar of the door in his hand; I went to work the engine, and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You knocked some time at the door? A. Four or five different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand long enough for the door to have been opened? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a fireman of the British Fire-office; I was one of the first that got to this house; when I first came there it was a little after two o'clock in the morning, on the 9th of January, I went into the house, and went into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q.You found the door open? - A. Yes; I went into the back room, where the fire was burning all round it.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe the situation of it? - A. The fire was all round it, burning very rapidly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire in the grate? - A. I did not observe any in the grate at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the grate? - A. Yes; I went and put the Parish engine to work, and got the fire under as quick as we could; it burnt through the back parlour into the one-pair-of-stairs back room; after that, when we had got the fire under, we went up stairs, and did the rest with buckets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the stairs? - A. Yes; the stairs go out of the tap-room into a beer-cellar, all on the ground-floor; the stair-case that comes over the cellar stairs were all on fire underneath them; that is the stairs that go up to the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the stairs was burnt? - A. It had burnt right through the second stair.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was this fire under the stairs from that in the back-room? - A.Five feet distance.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the fire in the room could have caught from the stairs, or the fire on the stairs from the room? - A.There could not be any communication from the one to the other, there is large brick wall between the stairs and the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any fire made its way through the brick wall? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q.It remained entire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any joist burnt? - A. It had burnt through the joist into the room over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice whether there was a good deal of furniture in the house? - A. I did not take much notice, there appeared to be very little in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman there? - A. Yes, in the court, after the fire was over; I had no conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. It seems the parlour was on fire before the room above it? - A. I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It had not burnt from the room to the parlour? - A. No; I suppose from the parlour to the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.There was a brick wall between the two fires? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible the fire could get through that wall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be the effect of accident? - A. No.</p>
               <p>PETER FISH sworn. - I belong to the Phoenix Fire office; I was at the fire, they appeared to be two distinct and separate fires; there was not the appearance of accident, the one was distinct from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it be accidentally set on fire? - A. I have every reason to think it could not.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HAMILTON sworn. - I am an officer of Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoner on the Wednesday; I told her the charge on which she was taken up; her answer was, she made her escape as well as she could, and when she did so,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160075"/>she was nearly naked; and she always continued in the same story.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This fire happened at two in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you find the prisoner there? - A. The day but one after; she remained in the house, and did not make her escape.</p>

               <p>Q. And that you are liable to be punished if you tell a lie, not only in the next world, but in this, and that very severely? - A. Yes. (He is sworn.) I saw two hands up to the shoulder in the window; my master ran after the man, and I picked up three pair of shoes under the window.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE LUMLEY sworn. - I am a constable: I have a pair of shoes; the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house; I asked him if there was any mark on the shoes; he said, yes, J. B. there is J. B. on them. (The shoes produced).</p>
               <p>King. I can swear to these shoes, (looks at the three pair); I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.What is the mark you swear to them by? - A. I don't believe there is any mark upon them, I believe them to be my property; I should know them if I were to see them in France, by the work of the shoes; these two pair of shoes are very remarkable shoes, with a long side seam, which is not common now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along the street, and being in liquor, I fell down, this man came and took me, I know nothing what for.</p>
