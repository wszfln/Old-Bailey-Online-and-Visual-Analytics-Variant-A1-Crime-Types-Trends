On Monday, 9th November, about half-past 10, I executed a warrant at 6, Boyle-street, Saville-row—I found Martha and Maria Perry there—Martha was sitting in the kitchen, and the mother came in shortly afterwards—I took them both—a statement was made by them—next morning I went to Sloane-street, the residence of Palmer—he was not at home, and I left a constable there—about 1 o'clock on that day, the constable brought Palmer to the Bow-street station—I told him he was charged with uttering a forged bill of sale, and a promissory note in the name of Emily Perry—Martha was sitting in the station when he was brought in—he said nothing to me—I called Martha up and asked her to repeat the statement that she made to me last night—she then said, "I was induced to sign the bill of sale by Palmer; he said, 'They won't know you from your sister Emily, or know about my going to Australia'"—I said, "Do you hear that?"—he said "Yes, I do, but it is false."</p>

               <p>have you taken this half-sovereign," showing me one—I examined it, and said, "Well; I don't think this is the one I took; I am sure the half-sovereign I took was a good one"—the one he showed me was a bad one—I said instantly that it was not the one I had taken—I took it in my hand—it appeared light—it was not the one I had taken of Cramer's man—I swear that—there was no other half-sovereign in the till when I put the one in that I took from Cramer's man—the bad one had a white appearance round the edge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Tegg, a publisher, in Pan<lb/>crass-lane—on Wednesday morning, 18th December, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner came there and asked for a copy of "Chesterfield's advice to his Son"—I gave her one—the price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign, and asked if I could give her change—I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-sovereign—I had half turned round, and she rung the half-sovereign on the counter and said, "Dear me, this does not sound very well, I think your board if very hollow"—I immediately picked it up and found it was bad; and not the one I gave her—I am certain of that—I then sent for an officer and gave her in custody—Mr. Lindrum, another clerk, was in the shop at the time when I gave the woman change—I asked him for two half-sovereigns for a sovereign, and he gave them to me—he rung them both on the counter very carefully before he gave them to me, and I gave the prisoner one of them—I had seen her two years previously—it was in consequence of having known her that I asked Lindrum for the half-sovereigns.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you no half-sovereigns in the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Lindrum is a fellow clerk of mine—my asking him for two half-sovereigns was all that passed between us—that was the only communica<lb/>tion I made to him—I looked carefully at the money I received from him, and saw it was good—I did not look at the date of the coinage, nor did I sound it—I could have got change from the counting-house, and should have done so, but it was to ascertain for a certainty that the money was good that I asked Mr. Lindrum for it—the reason was not because I had no money in the till—1 had half turned round before she sounded it—I gave her the opportunity of keeping that or substituting one for another—I never said that she could not have had time to do it—I did not say it in answer to the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion House—I never said that in consequence of her movements being so closely watched she could not have got rid of the money; I swear that—when she returned, the money I put it in the crack of the counter and tested it—Collins, the warehouseman, called out to me, "Don't do that, for good gold will break"—Lindrum was engaged at the counter with some books—I will swear he was not reading the newspaper—besides Collins there was, in the warehouse, a clerk, named Jay, at the desk—there were several others there besides me and Lindrum—Mr. Tegg was not there—I do not know that the man said, "Good gold will break;" but he objected to my putting it in the counter to try it—I</p>

               <p>went with the prisoner to the station, watching her all the time—it was not the half-sovereign I bad given her, but the one I had back from her, that I was going to test—before that I said, "This is a bad one; I know you, you have been here before"—she did not say it was a bad one, but thought it sounded bad, and then I tested it—it was 24th January, 1860, that I had seen her before—I was examined alone on the first examination—Lindrum was present, but was not called—I do not know why—I have no recollection of saying to Lindrum either on the first or second examination, "You will swear that the two half-sovereigns were good that you gave me, as no bad money was found on her;" nothing of the kind—I did not see the prisoner get rid of any more, or substitute one coin for another—the sovereign she gave me was perfectly good.</p>

I am the wife of Alexander Locke, a confectioner, living at 106, High-street, Shoreditch—on Friday night, 13th December, the prisoner came about 10 o'clock, and asked for some baking-powder—I told her I had none—she then asked for some tope and bottoms—I said I had not any; she went away—a little time after she tame again and asked for a peany<lb/>worth of biscuits for a baby—I gave her thorn and she gave me a shilling—I gave her a sixpence and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she went away—I put the shilling aside in the till till my husband came home—there was a sixpence or two there, but no shillings—a little time afterwards I took that shilling out of the till, and discovered that it was bad—I showed it to my husband when he came home—no one had been to the till meanwhile—I marked it, and my husband, in my presence, wrapped it in paper and put it at the back of the till—on Saturday, 14th December, the prisoner came again, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a pennyworth of biscuits—she said they agreed with the baby—I served her, and she put down a sixpence—I tried it in my teeth; it was bad—it was soft, and bent—I gave it to my husband—I recognised her when she came in—I said, "You came yesterday and gave me a shilling; it was bad"—she said she had not been in the shop before—my husband was placing some goods in the window when she came in—he was near—he tried the sixpence and told the prisoner he should give her in charge—he then handed back the sixpence to me, and she snatched it out of my hand and put it to her mouth—my husband then called a con<lb/>stable; and I told the constable in the prisoner's presence that the sixpence was</p>

I asked him what he was, and going along to the station-house, he still tried to get the money out of my hand, and in the struggle he fell, and I fell atop of him, and another gentleman on the top of me, and I was pulled off and thrown on my back; and I asked them to let me get up and walk, as I was choking, and I went to the station."</p>

Lister and Biggs, but they thought it would be advisable, instead of going into litigation, to settle the matter with them, because the casks at Bristol were sent up full of rubbish, sent as alkali—they form no portion of the subject matter of the figures—I can tell by the book what number of casks I signed for which I did not receive—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) I have signed bills of lading for 189 casks between 15th December and 23rd March—those were the casks that were shipped—in point of fact I only received 186—that includes all the casks that have been mentioned to-day, in the altered bills of lading—I cannot tell you how many casks I signed for previous to 15th December, because it ran over a long time—up to the 23rd of March I signed for 178; up to the 6th of April I signed for 189; from 15th December to 23rd of March, I signed for 171.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Pockett at Swansea—this bill of lading bears my signature, for Mr. Pockett—I first saw that document on 15th December, before I put my name to it; the elder Gray handed it to me—I cannot say whether Mr. Pockett was present, he was at home—I saw Mr. Gray upon the 15th December—he brought the bill of lading to the office—I occasionally sign documents for Mr. Pockett in the course of business—I signed this document which is in my hand now, from Mr. Pockett's instruc<lb/>tions—that was on 15th December, in the morning—the elder Gray came to the office to me rather early in the morning—it was on the Saturday, before dinner, that Mr. Pockett gave me directions to sign this bill of lading—we dine about 1 o'clock—I looked at it previously to signing it—it was then for twenty casks—the word "six" was not there—I cannot say whether these numbers were there or not; I would not swear positively—I do not believe there was any weight filled in the bill at that time—I read from the the margin twenty-six casks—those words were not on the margin when I signed it—I know the elder Gray's handwriting—this bill of lading, dated 5th February, is signed by me—I cannot say whether it was in the same state when I signed it as it is now—it purports to be for fourteen casks—I cannot recollect whether I read it previously to signing it—I signed it by Mr. Pockett's direction—how I recollect the twenty casks so well is, Mr. Pockett was about leaving home on Saturday, 15th December, but I did not take much notice—on 15th De<lb/>cember I asked the elder Gray for the duplicate bill of lading, and he said he would bring it—I did not receive this duplicate—I saw it in Mr. Pockett's office on 15th December—there were fifteen casks brought down or were on the wharf at the time that was signed—there were five more casks brought a week or nine days after—the bill of lading was originally for twenty and</p>

I carry on business in Lawrence Pountney-hill, London, in partnership with Isaac Solly Lister—I know the two prisoners—the younger prisoner was carrying on business with his brother under the firm of "Gray Brothers," at Llandoer—the elder prisoner was taking an active part in managing that business, and sometimes represented himself as a partner—we made arrangements as to making advances upon alkali, manufactured by them, and we arranged with the two banking houses at Swansea, to make advances to them—they were to take the alkali down to the wharf, and take the bills of lading to the bank, if they wanted an advance—the alkali came to Bristol by boat, and then by rail on to London to us—on 16th December, I received this bill of lading, dated 15th, from Mr. Dester, and on 17th I received this letter in the handwriting of the elder prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "December 16th, 1860.

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Turrett-grove, Clapham-common, and am a commercial traveller—on Friday, 20th November, about 11 o'clock in the morning I was in Parliament-street, standing at a shop door—I saw a cart coming towards where I was looking from, towards Charing<lb/>cross, from Westminster-bridge way—there was a man driving, walking by the side of his horse, with his whip over his shoulder—it was immediately opposite Trollope and Sons, the upholsterers, just before you come to the corner of Charles-street—the man was walking on the proper side of his horse and cart, on the near side of his horse—he was an old man; he appeared to me about sixty—at that time I saw another cart, it looked like a tradesman's cart; a lad was driving it—I have every reason to believe it was the prisoner—when he came to where this other cart was, he passed it on the near side, that was the side between Trollope's and the wagon, the wrong side—at the time he so passed there was just sufficient room for him to be enabled to pass any vehicle that might be drawn up at the side of the road, just the breadth of the cart—whilst it was passing I saw either the shaft, or some part of the light cart strike the deceased on the shoulder—he staggered and fell down on his face immediately before the wheel of his own cart—the horse was walking, and I saw the wheel pass up his body, and rest on the pole of his neck—the horse then stood still, and he was pinned to the ground in that way—the light cart had, by this time, passed on—immediately after that I saw a policeman come across the road and take the head of the horse that was standing still, and back it off, and I was surprised to see the de<lb/>ceased roll towards the kerb-stone; he was not killed on the spot—the policeman followed the light cart and called the boy back, and he returned—I saw the man in proper hands and went on my way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of Sarah Green was then read as follows:</hi>—"On the 24th of October, in the evening, I was sitting in this room in an arm chair; Elizabeth Askew was with me. I had a fire and a light in the room. I sent Elizabeth Askew as usual for my supper; I can't say exactly the time. After she left I was dozing in my chair, waiting for her coming up; some<lb/>one came to me right across from the door; I looked up and saw a tall man with a black mask on. My eye caught the shade of another man; he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060039"/>
               <p>round the foot of the bed, behind the tall man, and came between the bed, and the window; he was shorter than the other man, and netted to be stouter. The tall man began to hit me on the head four or five severe blows with something with a large knob; I think I should know the ball again. I prayed and begged of him to let me be quiet, and if he would take his hand away I would tell or do anything. When I said this he took hold of me by the throat, and pinched me till I lost my senses—I remained so for a minute or so, and then recovered. He came at me again and gave me some more blows on the head, and he caught hold of my throat, and I received a most severe blow in the left cheek, but I can't say from what. He clutched my throat again, and tighter much; I was then insensible, and I don't know any more. I could hear the other man up by the side of the bed, and heard something rattling. My desk was looked, and afterwards I found it broken open; I missed nothing from there. I saw the short man turn his arm and clutch my watch from my watch-pocket, at the head of the bed. My plate was in a basket under the table; I can't tell the quantity missing. One of the men seemed tall aud the other short, and the short one had a loose coat on; this must have made him look stouter. The prisoner Puzey seems to be about the height of the tall one, but I am not certain; the hands are like the man's; they were thin, long fingers. The life-preserver produced is like the thing I was struck with. When I recovered I found the room vacant, and nobody in it. I know the prisoner Collett well; she was employed by me as my nurse last winter; she sat up with me at night; it is seven or eight months ago, or more. She was with me twice; she left and came again. In consequence of my suspicion I discharged her, and gave notice for her not to come to my house. I heard about a fortnight before the robbery that she had been to my house. When Mrs. Collett was here I used to keep the plate in the bedroom, near the window, and my watch was always kept in the watch-pocket, at the head of the bed; she knew that well. I did not hear the men speak one syllable, that I could hear. Sarah Green."</p>

               <p>Fulham-place—on the night of 24th October I was coming down Fulham-place in the direction of the Warwick Arms, which is fifteen yards from Mrs. Green's—I crossed the street near Mrs. Green's, in a slanting direction, when I was about four doors off, as I was going to No. 27—as I was crossing I saw two men in conversation opposite Mrs. Green's and near No. 27—they were not the same size; one was of a short stature, and the other was taller—the tall one crossed the road and went into a garden gate, which I imagined to be Mrs. Green's—it was in that direction—I stood there three or four minutes waiting to serve some beer—the shorter man walked to and fro—when I had served my beer I went away, and met the shorter man about half a dozen doors off—I did not go to the hotel, I went to Park-place—I came back into Fulham-place in about five minutes—there was then nobody in the street, and I went to the hotel—a quarter of an hour afterwards, while I was in the hotel, I heard a cry of "Thieves" or "Murder"—I went direct to Mrs. Green's house—I took no further notice of the man who was walking up and down than I should of any other person—I have seen him since—Reeves is the man—I came full to his face after I had served my customer—his face was the same as it is now, with the exception of a moustache and a little hair under his chin—he had on a loose coat—I did not see the tall man's face.</p>

I have seen Mrs. Carr, of Eastbourne-terrace, and she states that she has done nothing of the kind"—she said, "Oh, she will say anything"—I asked her whether she went out during the time she was at 5, Fulham-place—she hesitated, and said, "No"—I said, "I hope you will remember and he cautious; I have seen the servants; are you sure you did not go out?"—after some hesitation she admitted that she went out and fetched some gin—I asked her whether she was there last night, Thursday night—she said,</p>

Inspector Dartrell stated that Puzey had been tried, with five others, for a robbery at Lord Foley's and sentenced to three years' penal servitude, from which he returned in March or April last, and immediately became the associate of the worst of thieves; and that Reeves had also been sentenced to penal servitude, the certificate of which was produced, and three months imprisonment since. Sergeant Potter stated that he had had Puzey in custody for a robbery and knocking a man down with a life-preserver, that he was acquitted of the robbery, but found guilty of the assault; and that Collett had been concerned in two or three similar robberies, but had not been convicted.</hi>

               <p>Stafford for a short time—I also had another female lodger there—it was not a house in which females were in the habit of lodging for a short time—I was examined before the Magistrate—my deposition was taken down and read over to me—I was told if there was any error in it to correct it, and I then signed it—I cannot write—this is my mark—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, contained the conversation with the prisoner just referred to about his name being on the note</hi>)—I recalled that in Court about the 20th, only I was not listened to—I say that conversation did not take place—I said it was not a right statement that I gave about the 20th, until I had my rent book to go by—I put my mark to it certainly, but I was not to know what I was doing, I could not read it—I have told the truth now, and then also, only I made a mistake about the 20th—I had no conversation with the prisoner about his name being on the note, nothing at all respecting it—it is an error—I con<lb/>tradicted it in Court—I don't know that I heard the words distinctly read out to me—I don't suppose the gentleman that took it down dreamt it—perhaps the solicitor took it down, without my saying it at all—I had no conversation at all with the prisoner, about his name being on the note, nor about anybody's name being on the note—I never took the first note out of my desk until I took it out to give it to Mrs. Brooks to send to pay my rent—I took it out while she stood there, and handed it to her—I kept the second note in the same desk, it was there from 29th November till 5th December—I took it myself to Mr. Bradford—it was in the same desk all the while—I have not brought the keys of the desk here—some times I leave them at home when I go out, but I very seldom go out except on particular occasions—I did not give anybody into custody on a charge of stealing something from my house in October—I charged Mrs. Pearce with it—she is the lodger I have spoken of—she is now living in Ebury-street, I believe—I was obliged to get rid of her, for she pledged my things—she brought them back again that I might not look her up—she was not lodging with me on 26th October—she was in the house—I can't say exactly what day she left, unless I had her rent-book here—she left before December, I cannot tell you the day—she went just as the prisoner was taken up—I got rid of her by reason of her dishonest practices—she came to me as a respectable married woman, and her husband was there with her till he went into the country—a person who is known by the name of "Oxford Emma," did not lodge with me in Sloane-street, she did in Draycot-place—she only came and stopped a day with me occasionally, when she came from Oxford—I know her up to this time—I don't know where she lives, somewhere in Chelsea, I believe—she is not in the habit of visiting at my place up to the present time—I don't know when I last saw her at my place, perhaps it might be a week or a fortnight—I do not know whether she is a person who might live a better life—I don't know that she it known by the same of "Oxford Emma"—I never heard her called it—I don't know any<lb/>thing about her being at the Westminster police-court, charged with various things—she was not charged for anything bad, only for being tipsy, not doing anything wrong—she was not taken from my house, and was not with me—no other female has left my house suddenly, since the prisoner has lodged with me, and before he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a slight impediment in my speech—I live at 38, Manchester-street, and am a pupil to an archi<lb/>tect—in the beginning of October last, I had occasion to go from Manchester-street to Brompton—for that purpose I went across the park—it was between 8 and 9 in the evening—I went into the park through the Marble Arch—after I had got into the park, I saw a young man; he came up and said something to me that I could not catch—I saw his face, there being a lamp near—I then went down the road in the path-way, inside the park rails, running parallel with the Bayswater-road, a very considerable distance, intending to go to Brompton by way of Rutland-gate—I thought the bridge gate, dividing the long walk from the Serpentine, would be locked, so I returned part of the way back, and made for the Albert-gate—I went up a path there, and when I had got a short distance up the path, the same young man, who had spoken to me before, came up to me again and said something—I thought he was begging—I said I had nothing for him, and turned off the path to avoid him—I then walked across the park, making for the nearest cut towards the Albert-gate bridge of the Serpentine, the bridge at this end of the Serpentine—when I had got a considerable distance I came to a clump of trees, where I stayed to make water—when I had nearly finished, the young man who had first spoken to me, came up again and said something I could not make out—at that instant the prisoner came from behind a tree, near, and said, "I have caught you b—g"—I said I was only making water—he said I was doing the offence he alleged, and he would take me to the station; he also said that the young man, who was standing near us at the time, would prove it—I was very much alarmed indeed; very much frightened; and he then said, "If you have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give me, you can go"—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I offered him my watch, which he would not take—he asked me if I had any rings—I had two rings which I gave him, with the watch, and some small change that I had, two or three shillings—he then said he would take my umbrella—he did so, and then made off—the other man was standing near us all the time the prisoner had been talking—he followed me for a short distance, and then he made off too, the prisoner making towards the Albert-gate, and the other making towards the Wellington-arch, Hyde Park—I have not seen the rings since, with one exception, or the umbrella—they have not been found—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is considerably damaged and altered, but it is mine—there was not the slightest foundation for this charge—I did not tell my friends, or anybody, about this when I got home—I do not exactly remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060070"/>
               <p>the day of the month that this occurred; it was the beginning of October—I saw nothing more of the parties until 28th November, I then saw the younger man, who had first accosted me, in Manchester-square, and he said to me that he either had my rings, or he could get them for me; I do not recollect which—he was alone at that time, but I saw the prisoner in about a minute afterwards, not in Manchester-square; the younger man walked along Manchester-street, and turned up Edward-street by Anderson's, the chemist's, and the instant we reached Anderson's, the prisoner came, up, in Edward-street—he joined the other man—the prisoner said to me "I have your watch and rings," to which I replied, "Have you"—he then said he would give them me if I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for my address, and said if I would give him my address he would bring them to me, on condition that I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch and two rings—he did not name either the umbrella or the two or three shillings—I then agreed to give him only my address, not the other man, on condition that the other man went away—the other man then went away, and I gave the prisoner my address, and he walked with me to see that I had given him the right on—when I got to the door the servant, Mary Valentine, opened it, and the prisoner followed me upstairs without my asking him—I did not give any name then—I eventually gave him the name of Hawkin—the prisoner followed me upstairs to my room—I then said to him, "Then you will bring me my watch and rings to-night if you receive the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would, and he then asked me for my name, which I gave him in writing on a piece of paper, as "Hawkin"—he then left, saying he would come again the next night, and bring my watch and rings—the next night about 6 o'clock he came—he came up to my room—I asked him if he had my watch and rings—he said, without replying to my question, that I had given him the rings—he then went into my bedroom, which communicates with the sitting-room by a door, he looked under the bed, returned into the room, and produced the rings only—he laid them down on the table; I asked him to do so—I said he had agreed to bring my watch also—he said he had not—when he laid the rings on the table, I put five sovereigns into his hand—before I gave him the money be said that he had men waiting outside, and if I did not give him the money he would call the men in and have me taken up—directly I gave him the five sovereigns he seized the rings; he snatched them up off the table immediately, and then he said he would let me have them again if I would give him another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house, but if he came at half-past 5, I would have the rings then and give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he then left—about five minutes after he had left the other young man who I had first seen, came up to my room—he said that he had my watch, and if I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it I could have it—he showed me the watch—he had it in his hand—I had not the money and I told him so—he said he would have it before he left—I had only 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the house of my own—I rang the bell to see if the landlady had the extra 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the servant came up on to the landing, and I went out of the room to speak to her—I sent her to see if she could get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she came back without it—when the servant had gone down to see if she could get the landlady to lend me the money, the man went to the window, sat down in a chair, threw up the window, and leaned out, so that he could see into the street—he left the house before the servant returned—I went down with him—I looked out when he left, and saw him speaking to the prisoner—I saw them join together and speaking together—I went out, and went over the street to tell him that the servant could not get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but if he chose to meet me at the Vere-street post-office the following morning he</p>

               <p>could have it, if he gave me up the watch—on the following morning, Saturday, I left my lodging about half-past 8, and went to a tobacconists shop in Oxford-street, so that I could see the Vere-street post-office—while there I saw the prisoner pass the window, and in a minute or two afterwards I saw the other one—I went and spoke to the younger man whom I had first seen—I told him I had not the money, and made an appointment for half-past 6 on the Monday night—after I got home from Vere-street on Saturday, the prisoner came; he came up into my room—he was exceedingly rough in his manner, and said he would have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he left the room—he locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, and walked about the room in a very rough manner indeed—I ran into my bed-room; there is a door into the passage from that, and I went out of that and met the prisoner on the landing—I seized him by the coat, and shook him, and said he should go to the police-station, and I would go with him—he said he would go to the police-station, he should only be too happy, his character would bear him out through everything—we went out at the street door and shortly met the younger man; he joined us—we all three went together down George-street and Marylebone-lane, nearly as far as Hinde-street, that is on the way to the police-station—the younger man then said he would not go to the police-station—the prisoner said to him, "I will make you go, you shall go"—the young man, after walking a short way down Marylebone-lane, left us, saying he would return and take away my character—I continued walking with the prisoner till we got to Wigmore-street—he then said that if I would promise to give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday night he would not go any further, and would leave me there and then—we did not go on to the police-station—he was to bring the rings on Monday—after he had left me I turned to go down Marylebone-lane, and when I had got a short distance I again met the younger man—after that I mentioned the matter to a friend, and in conse<lb/>quence of that two police-constables were in waiting on the Monday night—when the prisoner came on Monday night, he saw the constables and ran away and was taken.</p>

No. 48—I secured him just after he had passed No. 49 or 50—he was taken back to the prosecutor's lodgings—I told him I was an officer of police, and that this gentleman, pointing to the prosecutor, charged him with extorting money, a watch, and rings from him, by threatening to accuse him of having committed an unnatural crime—he said he was innocent—he appeared very much excited and became violent—I asked him if he would permit me to see what he had about him—he said, "No;" God strike him b—blind if I touched him, he would smash me—I said, "Such conduct will not serve you, you had better be quiet and submit to what I require, otherwise I must do it by force"—I then searched him and found on him a purse containing a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and a half-penny—I asked him if he would tell me the object of his visit to the house that night—he said, "To see Mr. Hawkin"—I said, "Will you be good enough to tell me for what purpose"—he said, "I shall not"—I then took him to the station—next morning I received this watch from Mr. Haworth—I have since been in pursuit of the other man, but have not been able to take him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, carrying on business at 34, Wind-mill-street, Tottenham Court-road—on 16th December I was in High-street, St. Giles', a little after 2 in the afternoon—I had just passed St. Giles' church to go to Long-acre—when I had passed the extreme boundary of the church ground, twenty or thirty yards, I heard a great noise, which I thought was a fire-engine—I looked up and I saw the prisoner and a lad in front of a wood cart—the horse was galloping at a faster rate than I ever saw in London streets in my life—they were in the cart—the boy was driving, and the prisoner was whipping the horse as fast and as hard as he could do it, from the time I first saw him till the accident occurred—I turned round when the horse and cart passed me, for I thought there would be an accident—looking ahead, I saw an elderly woman on the other side of the way, on the edge of the kerb-stone—she seemed to look to see if the coast was clear; but in a moment I saw her crossing, and I saw her knocked down; but whether by the shaft or the horse I cannot say; and I saw the near side wheel go over the body—I ran back to see that the driver did not escape; and when I got up by the church-gates, the horse and cart was stopped, and the driver was among the people—a lot of people were round</p>

               <p>matter—I was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, out of which I have served seven—before I was apprehended I was a silk dealer and manufacturer in a middling or small way of business—my house was at 4, Slater-street, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—about February or March last, I knew the prisoner Gillett, who was in the general line; he kept a leaving shop where they lend money on articles; not a pawnbroker's—I remember seeing him early in March at my house—he came alone of his own accord into my shop and said, "Can you purchase ten bales of silk of me?"—I said, "Are they your own?" he said no, they were not his own, but he would send the men they belonged to—nothing further passed at that time—he went away after that, and about a fortnight previous to seeing him again, I saw the other two men, Edwin Torn bull and one not in custody—I did not know either of them by name—I did not afterwards ascertain what the other man's name was—I do not know Turnbull's name except by what I have been told—I never heard the other man called by name by any<lb/>body—they came to my house—I asked them what they wanted; they said they had come about the silk that Mr. Gillett was speaking to me about—I asked them whether they had the sample of it with them—they said, "No, but they would bring it"—there was some conversation about the silk—they asked me whether I would have anything to drink—some gin was sent for—my servant Phoebe Salmon, fetched it—one of the two men paid for it; I do not know which—a man who is not in custody came before I saw Gillett again—I did not see Gillett again till the morning the silk was in the van—I beg pardon, he came a few days after he first came; he was very tipsy, and held up a key and said that that was the thing that would get it—that was before the two men came—I thought he was joking, being tipsy—I did not know what he meant—on Thursday morning, March 14th, about half-past 6, I heard a knocking at the door—I was in bed—I put on my trousers, went down and opened the door, and saw the prisoner who is not in custody—that was the same one as I had seen before—I cannot exactly say that I ever beard his christian name—I opened the door and he came in—I had a conversation with him—he opened his coat and told me that he had a sample of the silk that he was speaking about—there was about a pound in the sample—it was China raw silk—I took possession of it—he then requested me to go up into Shoreditch—he told me for what purpose, and I consented to go with him—I told him to go up the street while I put my clothes on and I would overtake him—I did so, and we then walked together up as far as Shoreditch church or a little way past, getting into the Kingsland-road—he then pointed out a van with one horse—it was loaded and had a tarpaulin over it—it was standing opposite a coffee house in Kingsland-road—while I was there with him the prisoners Gillett, and Edwin Turnbull, came from some part by the van, but where I cannot say—they crossed to me from the direction of the van—the man who had come with me spoke to them and said, "He won't have it," alluding to me—they both said together in a breath, "You don't mean that do you?"—I said, "Yes, it is no good to me"—I had no use whatever for raw silk—I never had any dealings with it in my life, not with raw unthrown silk, which that was—there was no further conversation with reference to this silk then—we all four went into a public-house; I do not know the name of it; it is right opposite Shoreditch church—we had one quartern of brandy there—while we were there Gillett left the house, leaving me and the other two inside—we remained about four or five minutes after he left, and then Edwin Turnbull, I, and the other man went out together—the van was gone then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060082"/>
               <p>—I was going towards my home and Turnbull told me not to be in a hurry, they wanted to have a conversation with me, would I come with them—I went with them—we walked up the Kingsland-road till we came to the Victory public-house which is in Kingsland-road—we went in there and had two quarterns of brandy and some biscuits—Edwin Turnbull did not say anything there to me about the silk, nor did the other men in his presence—nothing was said in that house about the silk—there was something said before I parted with them—as 1 was coming towards my home Mr. Turnbull asked me whether I could sell the silk for them—at the public-house Turn<lb/>bull asked me if I would lend them some money till the silk was sold—I said no, I could not—I do not recollect seeing any one in the Victory besides the barmaid and potman—I spoke to the barmaid in the presence of the two men—she said that I was up there very early that morning—I said, "Well, I have been taking a stroll in Victoria-perk, and that brought me here early—I cannot recollect whether I spoke to the potman—after leaving the Victory I went towards my own home, towards the Eastern Counties Railway-station—on my road, the man not in custody and Mr. Turnbull, asked me whether I would try to sell the silk for them—I said I would see about it—I then parted from them and went home—the sample was at home at my house—I remained at home up till 6 o'clock in the evening—I then saw Gillett and the man not in custody—they came to my house and asked me whether I had sold the silk or whether I had been about it—I said, "No," but I was going to try to sell it—they then left, and I went up as far as Mr. Shears' in the Dog-road, Cambridge-heath-road—he was a very large silk dealer—I am given to understand that he is now dead—I found that he had left, and I was told to go to the prisoner Hunter, who at that time kept the Red Deer public-house in the Cambridge-heath-road—I found Shears there—he was in the tap-room when I got in—I went with him into a private box in front of the bar—I saw Mr. Hunter there—I had given the sample to Mr. Shears—he gave it to Mr. Hunter—I had made a communication to Shears as to what quantity there was of it, and what price was asked for it—I did not hear Shears say anything to Hunter about the quantity—my communication to Shears was in Hunter's presence—I told Shears there was ten bales of it and it was to be sold at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, but I wanted 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Hunter said nothing to that—he said at that interview that he could sell it for us, not the least doubt—I remained there something like an hour, or an hour and a half—I asked him whether I should call there, or whether he should call at my house—nothing further took place on that Thursday, the 14th—on Friday, the 15th, I went to Hunter's again, about half-past 11 or 12 in the morning, as I was directed—I did not find Hunter at home—I stayed there, and had something to drink—it was half an hour before any one came—Mr. Hunter and Mr. Agg then drove up together in a small chaise—I was standing in the private box—I looked out at the door, and saw Agg come from the chaise to me in the private compartment, he produced the sample left with Mr. Hunter—I had some further conversation with Agg—I remained in the house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I then left and went home again—in the course of the afternoon while I was at home, a boy came to my house to deliver a message to me, in consequence of which, I went to the railway hotel near the Eastern Counties Railway-station—that was from 4 to half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I cannot say to a few minutes—I saw Agg and Hunter there—they told me they had sold the silk to Mr. Newton; Agg said, "I cannot pay for it now, I have not the</p>

               <p>money," and that Mr. Newton had not the money in London with him to pay for it then, but if I could make it right for the money, I could go down with them and receive the money myself for Mr. Agg, and they would pay my passage there and back—we were all three standing together—nothing further took place in the public-house—Sergeant Jackson was there when I went in—nothing was said in the public-house about packing the silk—after leaving the public-house I went home; I said that I would go home and con<lb/>sult my wife about the money, and would meet him in an hour—the same evening I was standing at my door when Gillett and the man not in custody came—that was from half-past 7 to 8 o'clock—I told them that the silk was sold, and I would meet them to have it fetched away—they told me to meet them at the Prince of Wales public-house about 9 o'clock—I do not know the name of the street in which that is—I went there about 9 o'clock and saw Gillett, Turnbull, and the one not in custody—I had a conversation with them there respecting the silk—I told them that I had sold it, and they could bring it to my brother-in-law's, and I would pay them the money as soon as I could get it—I had a brother-in-law named Barker, who lived at No. 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields—they all three went with me to Princes-street, where the silk was—I do not recollect anything being said about money on the road there—(the officers afterwards took me by the door of this place in Princes-street—it was pointed out to me, and I said, "That is the place")—I do not know whose premises those were—when we got to them we went into a stable which is at the back of a yard, down a gateway—as we passed the gate, a van was standing there—in the stable the ten bales of silk, as I supposed them to be, were shown to me—they were covered over with packing stuff like matting—it was down by the horse-manger—the tarpaulin that was covered over it was taken off, and they said, "There are the ten bales"—they were in matting like this on the ground here—a man was in the stable in his shirt sleeves—I do not know who he was—he was not either of the men at the bar—they then asked me if I would see it weighed—I said they could weigh it if they liked—a pair of scales was got, and they took the cloth off three, while I was there, and weighed them, and put them in the van, and I, and the man not in custody, came away—the man who got the scales said, "Don't make a noise"—that is the man who was in his shirt sleeves—we left and came back to the Prince of Wales public-house—we were sitting in front of the bar there when the van drove up to the door—Mr. Gillett was with it, nobody else—he got out and came inside—Edwin Turnbull came into the public-house, and I and the one not in custody came out and got up—we went to my brother-in-law's, Mr. Barker, No. 2, Hope-street—the van was unloaded there, and the silk put in the front parlour underneath the window—when it came there all the outer things had been taken off, and it was all in white calico, put into India rubber bags—it was then left at Barker's—I and the other man went back with the van to the Prince of Wales—when we got there Turnbull and the other man and Gillett were there, and I gave Edwin Turnbull 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to give them 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the silk—and what there was over weight was to be reckoned as tareage—Turnbull asked me when I would give them the residue of the money—I told them I would let them have it the next day, which was the 16th, about 1 o'clock in the day—I had not the money myself to pay—I had some deeds belonging to me which I took on Saturday morning, the 16th, to Mr. Angell, a solicitor—I asked him for the amount of money which I wanted on the deeds—he said he could not let me have the amount till he had looked at them, but I could have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060084"/>
               <p>liked—he handed me a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to the bank and got it changed, and took the money to the corner of Hunt-street, the Red Lion, where they had appointed to meet me—I found Gillett, Turnbull, and the man not in custody, and several more, but I cannot say whether they were with them—Turnbull beckoned me to go out—they were playing at dominoes when I went in—I went out and the one not in custody came up to me—we walked on till we came to a public-house in the same street as the Prince of Wales—we went in there into a room opposite the bar, and I there gave him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Mr. Angell had given to me—I saw no more of them till they were in custody—I was at home on the morning of Saturday the 17th, and Mr. Agg came to me—there was nobody then with him that I saw—I afterwards saw somebody with him; not at my house, but opposite the Compasses public-house—Agg came to me and I went out of the house with him, and saw a chaise, and Hunter sitting in it—that was opposite the Compasses public-house, about 50 yards from my own door—I did not speak to Hunter at that time—I went to my brother-in-law's with Agg—he said he should like to see the whole of the silk now we had got it there—he looked at the whole of it as it lay in the packing cloths; it was not undone—we then came back and went up the street to where the chaise was standing; Hunter was still in it—Agg then said, as we stood at the side of the chaise, that they were going up to Branch-place, and would I go with them—I said, "The chaise will not hold three, I know Branch-place, and I will take the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and be there as soon as you are"—Agg and Hunter then drove off together—I took the omnibus and went to No. 8, Branch-place—that is Mr. Crane's, who was a porter in Drakeford's service—I knew him by being a porter there—when I got there, Agg was inside and Hunter was waiting outside, in the chaise—I went into the passage—I do not know what Agg said to Crane—Crane and Barker were both tried with me—after Agg came out they said they could make room in the chaise, would I get up and take a ride with them—I got up and took a seat in Mr. Agg's lap—they drove me till we got nearly to Mr. Hunter's house, and then Mr. Hunter said that I had better get down and walk the rest of the way, as there would be people coming into his house, and I should be seen—the house was not open and I waited by a butcher's shop, and Hunter came to the gate and let me in—we all three went into the bar parlour and had some bread and cheese, and stout—Agg said that the silk was all right, they should get it down to Derby by to-morrow—and it would go down by the railway, and I was to be at the railway terminus, at Euston-square, by 8 o'clock in the evening—Hunter said, "If Shears should say anything to you about the silk, say you had nothing at all to do with us for we were too artful for you"—nothing was said at that interview about the price that the silk was to fetch—on the 15th, the day before, at the public-house by the railway, Agg, in Hunter's presence, asked me to make out the invoice for the silk at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—I said I could not do so, for I had no invoice myself—I should think I was at Hunter's about 20 minutes, or half an hour, on the Sunday—on Monday the 18th, I was standing at my door, at half-past 1, when Crane came up with bags to pack the silk—I went with him to Barker's, and saw him pack the silk there—he put it into these packing bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had never been unpacked from the sheeting, but was put into the bags in the sheets—I saw Crane put the direction on the sacks, he put on the whole of this mark, "Overland 1,022, A in a diamond, 3"—the direction, "Mr. Newton, Derby," was also put on, where they were to go to—I had not before that heard Agg, in Hunter's presence, say anything about packing the goods, that</p>

               <p>was done before—that was on the Monday—Crane and I remained till the goods were packed, and then he went home, and I went home—I returned to my brother's-in-law's that afternoon, and saw one of Pickford's two horse vans drive up to his house—that was before 4 o'clock—I should know the man who was driving—it was one of Pickford's men—I should know him again; two boys assisted him—after the silk had been loaded on the van I went to Hunter's and asked him if he was going; he said, yes, he was going to start almost directly to the station, and said, "You can meet us there"—I told him that the things were packed and gone, and he said, "Most cleverly done"—I saw no more of him till the evening, when we met in the railway carriage—Barker and I went to the Euston railway terminus that evening, and took second-class tickets for ourselves, to go to Derby—we got into a second-class carriage—as we were getting in I saw Mr. Newton, Agg, and Hunter in the same carriage—my servant, Phoebe Salmon, had given me provisions to eat as I went down—as we got in and took our seats they all three got out—I had not time to exchange a word with either of them before they got out—a hat and scarf were left in the carriage—Barker and I travelled down to Rugby and saw no more of Hunter and Newton till we got there—I saw Agg at Rugby—he told me to take care of Hunter's hat that was hanging in the carriage—I went on to Derby, taking care of the hat, and arrived there at past 12 o'clock—I went to Mr. Rowbot<lb/>ham's, the George Inn—I did not see Agg or Hunter there when I arrived, no one but Newton—I slept at Rowbotham's that night—I slept in one compartment of the house, and Barker on a sofa in another—there was not room enough in one bed, and there were not two beds to spare—I saw Agg and Hunter coming from the railway station about 1 o'clock that day—Agg told me to stop at the Railway hotel till 5 o'clock and they would be back—I remained at a tavern, at the railway station, till then—Agg and Hunter came a little before 6 o'clock, and another man with them, I do not know who he was—we had something to drink at the bar, and Mr. Hunter asked the publican whether he could let him have a private room; that he wanted to do a little business—this was not at Mr. Rowbotham's house—I re<lb/>member Agg sparring at the time—he hit me on the hat—he was very tipsy—the landlord let us have a room, which, seemingly, was their own little sitting room—I, Agg, Hunter, and Barker went in there—Hunter called for some drink, and paid for it—while we were in that room, Agg gave me three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he passed them under the table, Hunter making use of the words, "You had better give them to him under the table, and then nobody will see it"—there was a doorway through which any one in the bar could see into the parlour—I cannot say whether there was a door or not, if there was it was open—Barker was out of the room when that happened—he left the room just as the sherry was called for—I held one of the notes up to the window, and Agg and Hunter both said, "You have got more now than what the value of the silk is;" because I had asked them for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, which was the remainder of the money—we had another pint of sherry to drink, which Hunter called for—after leaving the house I gave Hunter his hat; he put a white wide-awake, which he had on, into it, and put it on his head—I had intended to go back to town by the evening train, but I missed the train by going to the urine place, and it started without me—we had got our tickets—I turned round to look for Agg and Hunter on the platform, but could not see them, and Barker and I went back to Rowbot<lb/>ham's and had some ale and pork-pies—while we were there I produced one</p>

               <p>of the notes to Mr. Rowbotham, upon which he put some questions to me, and after that I and Barker were taken in custody by the police, at the rail<lb/>way—I have been in custody ever since—at the Railway hotel, Hunter said he had tried to get the notes smaller, but could not—on the evening of the 15th, before I had purchased the silk, Gillett said he should have to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the man who the van belonged to, where the silk was put—that was before I had been taken to see the silk; it was when he came to my house—the cab stopped at the place where the things were in the stable, I had told the police what sort of a place it was—I was taken in a cab to the Thames police-court—I was taken down Princes-street, and we drove past the house where I had been to see the silk—I did not get out at the house at all—we drove past in a cab—it was pointed out by somebody and I said that that was the house—I had described the place to them before they pointed it out to me at all.</p>

               <p>of before—Edwin Turnbull gave me a shilling to pay for the gin—on a Thursday or Friday morning, a few days after that, Mrs. Debock called me up at 6 or half-past; that was earlier than usual—I had not heard any knocking—when I got up, my master was out—he came home to breakfast about 8 o'clock, and I think he went out again before dinner—a chaise drew up to the door, but whether it was Mr. Hunter in it or who it was, I do not know—I do not think I saw Hunter that day, but he came on Sunday about two days afterwards, in a chaise with Mr. Agg—Mr. Agg went up stairs I suppose to Mr. Debock, and Mr. Debock and Agg went out together—they were up stairs five or ten minutes—I think they went into the chaise, but I will not be positive—I heard the chaise drive away—I remember one day a boy coming with a message—in consequence of that, I called my master down, who spoke to the boy, and then I think went out—that was before the Sunday I have mentioned; it was in the morning—on the Saturday before the Sunday, a man not here, came, and my master went out with him—it was in the same month as my master went to Derby—I knew Hunter before; I have been to his house—I remember a message being sent round to Barker—that was the next day, Monday—Barker's is in the next street to Debock's—Barker came round after that message, and he and Debock went out together—I heard from them that they were going to Derby—I got them some brandy, and loveage, and some ham—my master did not come back—either the next day Tuesday, or on the Wednesday, Edwin Turnbull and two other men came—I will not say whether the others were either of the prisoners—they swore very much at Mrs. Debock and said, "You have got the money"—Mrs. Debock said, "I have not, for Mr. Debock has gone and left me without a farthing—I saw Gillett there after my master left—he came for the money—I heard him ask Mrs. Debock for it—that was on Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. In March last I kept the Gold Eagle, Agard-street, Derby—that is seventy or a hundred yards from Newton's mill, which is in Agard-street—I remember one day in March, Newton coming to the house with two other persons—Hunter was one of them, and the other I do not know—he was a light complexioned man—they came between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, and remained about half an hour talking together—I heard Newton invite them to go to his new mill—he had not been there long apparently, and they all three went out together—they were away a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when all three returned and remained about a quarter of an hour, I cannot say to a few minutes—Mr. Newton, and the light complexioned man, went out for about half an hour and came back and joined Hunter, who had remained—they talked together and had some refreshment—while Hunter was there he told me that they were two friends of his, publicans in London—I do not remember the exact day of the month, but I heard the day afterwards, that the two men were taken in custody.</p>

I am chief constable of the borough of Derby—I went on Wednesday morning, 20th March last, to Newton's mill, in consequence of a communication I received, and there saw a quantity of silk; one bale of skeins, and the other bales were loose; they had been unpacked—the bale of skeins was not unpacked—I afterwards caused them to be removed to the Town-hall, and afterwards that silk was given up to Mumford, superintendent of the police of St. Katharine's Docks—on Thursday, 21st March, I came to London in company with Inspector Fearn—we arrived in town sometime between 4 and 5 o'clock—we first went to the Clown public-house in search of a person of the name of Agg—we were told that he was not at home—we then went to the houses of Barker and Debock, and then went back to Agg's and then he was out—we then went to Hunter's house in Cambridge-heath-road—I heard he was in the parlour opposite the bar, and I sent for him out—he came out into the bar to us—I said, "Is this Mr. Hunter?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him I should like to speak to him in private—he asked me to go up into a room which led up four or five steps into a private room above the bar—I said, "Have you been to Derby this week?"—after a minute's hesitation he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "You went down with a person named Mr. Agg, and old Mr. Newton, on Monday night"—he said, "Yes, I did, we all went down together; old Newton got drunk and lost his portmanteau at Rugby"—I then called Inspector Fearn up into the room—I had left him down in the bar—I said, "Now, Mr. Hunter, you</p>

               <p>me the addresses of both of them—I found the addresses perfectly correct—at the time I called on these men I had a couple of men in custody at Derby, and a policeman in charge of the silk—it was Hunter's own suggestion to find Agg; all I wanted at the time was an explanation—old Newton was afterwards indicted here and acquitted—it is not my case—I am simply here as a witness—I did not get up the evidence down at Derby—we ex<lb/>amined the witnesses, and as soon as I knew what they had got to say, I sent them to Messrs. Humphrey's and Co.—I did not hear what they had to say—when the inspector told me what they said, I sent them—Fearn is my inspector—Gutteridge was called on the part of the defence, and gave evidence, I believe—I forget whether Fearn and I were both called; I think we were—when I got down to Derby, Mr. Loach, the solicitor, presumed that I was going to send in a complaint against Gutteridge; he sent in several sheets of paper before the complaint was made—he was dismissed for saying that Vessey and I went to his house, and for saying what was not true.</p>

               <p>only a few words—I have been a police-constable twenty years—I am a detective officer, and have had something to do with Frail—I only put down the sign of the house, and what time we went to Aggs', in my memorandum—I put down that he said that he would meet us in an hour—I think that was all—I only put down the tail of the conversation—when I told you that I had made a memorandum of the conversation I meant that I had made a memorandum that he had promised to come back in an hour—I made no further note except the name of his house, and the date—when I said that I looked at two or three important items, I meant the time we apprehended Debock, the time we came up, the name of his house, and the name of Agg's house—I made no memorandum of the conversation more than about meeting us in an hour—that is what I meant at first—I took the memorandum to refresh my memory of the name of the house, the street it was in, and the time we went there—I thought that I might forget the name of his house unless I took the memorandum—I do not swear that; but I thought I would make a memorandum—Mendoza knew the name of the house, and young Newton—it was a memorandum of the name of the house, and not of the conversation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City-police—prior to the 29th November, I received some information from Mr. Jenkinson—on the evening of the 29th, I was called to his shop and found the prisoner there—Mr. Jenkinson, jun. shortly afterwards came in—there was a large bundle containing three hides lying within a yard of the prisoner; it was not open, it was done up in an apron—I said to the prisoner, "You have brought that parcel in here"—he said, "No, I have not"—one of Mr. Jenkin<lb/>son's men said, "Yes, you have"—he then said, "Well, I have brought it in"—I told him we were two police officers (Baker was with me), and asked how he accounted for the possession of that parcel—he said he had bought it—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Where do you come from"—he said, "From Sheerness"—I asked him when did he buy it, who did he buy it of; and what did he give for it?—he said, he bought it—that was all the answer he gave then—I then took him to the station—lie there said that Sergeant Morris had given it to him—he said that he belonged to the Artillery at Woolwich, and he worked in the harness room, that it belonged to Sergeant Morris, and he had given it to him to dispose of—he was anxious to write to Sergeant Morris, and in my prestence he wrote this letter—I had told him I was going to Woolwich—he said, "You had better see Morris"—I said "I shall see the adjutant"—this is the letter he wrote in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"Mr. Morris—Three of the buff hides that belong to you I have offered to Mr. Jenkinson for sale; I am now in custody for doing so; see to this immediately—obediently yours, James Morrison")—I afterwards received from Mr. Jenkinson, sen. in the prisoner's presence at the station, 27 hand parts—I asked the prisoner how</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060105"/>
               <p>he accounted for the possession of them—he said they came from the same source—next morning I went to Woolwich and found this bag bearing the prisoner's name, in a room at the barracks where he slept—it contained two or three pieces of leather similiar to these—it is the same description of leather as the hand parts are cut from—I likewise received this letter from the quarter-master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am staff-sergeant in the Royal Artillery, and am in charge of the collar-makers—the prisoner worked under me—I remember 29th November—I was ill at that time—I gave up the key of the stores to the prisoner on the 29th, and he returned it to me about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he had it most of the day—I believe he bad it in his possession several times on other occasions—I have seen the hand parts and the three hides produced—they were locked up in my stores, and I had the key—I never gave him authority at any time to sell any of these hand parts or buff hides; I could not—until the prisoner was taken into custody I never knew of his having taken any to these things from the store; I had no suspicion—I examined the stores the day after I heard of this, and missed several hides out of the store—the three buff hides do not belong to me—I received this letter of 9th December, at Woolwich—I could not swear it to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I admit the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Gaol of Newgate, 9th December, 1861.

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Weaver was read at the prisoner's request; it stated that he saw the prisoner at Woolwich about half-past five.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> There are three things to be considered in this case; first, whether according to the evidence there have been any goods stolen, and if so, let us see whether the goods in question are the goods that have been stolen, and then let us see whether I stole them. Now, so far as the evidence goes, that there have been goods stolen, it only amounts to this, that Mr. Morris takes ill something like seven or eight weeks previous to my apprehension, and when he comes back to the shop he finds his goods diminished; and a very likely thing too; there were a great many men at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060107"/>
               <p>work there, and a great quantity of material used, and it is very likely that the goods may bare been out up in our trade. So much for goods being stolen. Then as to the identifying of the goods. It is all very well telling business men that goods are had out of the stores not marked; we all know it is not so; even our gloves, boots, and everything we get, and the tools we use, are marked with the Government stamp; it is only a trick that is tried to be played upon you, to say that there are goods in the store marked and not marked; but it so happens that the goods in question were given out of Mr. Morris's private store. Then as for my stealing them. The only evidence laid before you that I stole the goods, is that I was entrusted with the key from dinner time till evening; if Corporal Weaver had been here he would have told you that he was at work with me, and also another sergeant, and that I did not go to the stores the whole afternoon, and that I left without any parcel, and that I could not have taken or handled the goods without their knowing it; but the witness, very unfairly, is kept back, purposely, no doubt, that you may not see the rights of the case; I leave it to you, gentlemen, to say whether I did steal the goods, or whether they are the property of Her Majesty. I have great doubts whether they are leather at all; if not, the indictment must fail. I trust you will show by your verdict that the humblest, as well as the noblest in the land, can have justice at your hands, and that you will not send a man to prison solely upon doubts and suspicions, without the least foundation, and without being supported by evidence.</p>

I live at 51, Union-row, Horsemonger-lane, and am a publican, but have retired from the business at present—on 26th December I was at the public-house of a friend at St. Andrew's-road, Newington—the prisoner and another man were there when I returned from the kitchen where I had been—they were using very bad language before the bar—the landlord was not in the way—the landlady called upon them to be quiet—they used worse language, and I walked away into, the parlour—the language was so bad that I went back, and said, "Pay a little respect to the females, the landlord is away"—they said, "If the landlord was here what would he do I" and asked me if I was landlord what I would do—I said, "I should turn you out"—the prisoner rushed at me, and struck me—I laid hold of his collar and shoved him out; and a gentleman pushed the other two out, and then one of the others rushed in and struck me—I went out after him and he went away—I did not pursue him—I said, "I do not mind my hat being broken, I will forego that to keep quiet"—I did not touch him; but as I returned to the house, another one, not the prisoner, rushed at me to stirke me; but I caught his head under my arm, and while I had him so the prisoner, who was in the middle of the road, rushed at me—I did not know he had a knife, because it was dark, it was half-past 6—he <hi rend="italic">dabbed</hi> at me twice; but I did not know I was stabbed—he did not hit me hard, because I did not feel the blow—it was not hard enough to bleed my nose—I was within two or three yards of a lamp—I afterwards found blood streaming from the side of my nose, and from a wound under my neck—I went into the kitchen and bathed it; but could not stop it for some time.</p>

I am assistant to Dr. Evan of High-street, Borough—I saw the last witness—off the night of 26th November at Stone's-end police-station—I found two wounds, one on his nose and the other in his throat by the jaw-bone—they were not bleeding then—they were clear cut wounds, apparently inflicted by some sharp instrument—I was shown a knife with blood upon it—tire wound on the nose was about two inches long and about an inch deep, penetrating nearly to the other side of the angle—it went through the cartilaginous part—his nose is an inch wide—I put the probe through it—I saw him at twenty minuses to 8—the wounds were very likely to have been inflicted by the knife I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the pro<lb/>secutor was brought there on 11th December, about 4 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—I examined him—I found about sixty or seventy shot holes in the posterior part of his left thigh, which was slightly swollen—the space occu<lb/>pied</p>

               <p>about six inches in length, and four inches across—there was nothing to be seen except slight bleeding, and the shot holes—the facial of the thigh had turned the shot aside—the wound was not dangerous, unless erysipelas had chanced to set in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunmaker in Kennington-park—the prisoner came to my shop the evening before the constable came to me—he asked me to lend him a pistol on hire—he said he wanted it to shoot a dog; he said it was old—I agreed to lend him the pistol on his leaving the value—I believe this to be the one I lent him—I supplied him with three drachms of powder, one ounce of No. 5 shot, and six percussion caps—he chose the shot himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I belive you wanted him to have a bullet, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he refused that—there would be between 500 and 600 shot in one ounce of No. 5—if this pistol were loaded up to the muzzle, I should say it would contain about half an ounce of shot; that would be about 300.</p>
