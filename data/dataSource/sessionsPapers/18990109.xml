(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for the 5s.—it is the prisoner's writing—he has made no claim on me—I never saw him again till December 28th—I communicated with the police—I did not receive a registered letter from Mr. Dibbin containing £4 4s., the amount of my debt.</p>

H. Roe," I still persist in saying that it is not my writing, nor is it joined as the other is—I have heard the constable'n evi<lb/>dence—he did not say that ho should take me in custody for stealing a registered letter and a cash-box from Hodgkinson's in Chancery Lane—he said, "I shall arrest you for stealing a cash-box from Dobson's"—I sai bd that I was not Mr. Roe., because he referred to Mr. Dobson; if he had said Hodgkinson, I should have owned to my name, but I thought he was a man whom I borrowed some money of two years ago—I was arrested in Clement's Inn, which is a few minutes walk from Chancery Lane; I did not go there and ask for the money, because it was too early in the morning.</p>

I am a fishmonger, living at Church Road, Homerton—on this day I was in Church Road about nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor fighting; the prisoner's finger was bleed<lb/>ing, and he accused the prosecutor with biting him—the prisoner's mother got him away—the prisoner returned in two or three minutes and struck the prosecutor in the back-the prosecutor said, "Oh, oh,"—the prisoner was not sober—there were several persons there, but I do not think they were near enough to stab him.</p>

               <p>for assistance; the constable blew his whistle at the bottom of the stairs, which fetched another constable who went and fetched a doctor—Roberts said to the policeman, "Arrest this woman, she has stabbed my wife"—just before the consstable took the prisoner down the stairs, she tried to get hold of the deceased, and said, "O God, 0 God, what have I done Liz; I must have a kiss before I die"—in the struggle with Roberts the prisoner tore the shirt off him and tried to bite him; that was while he was trying toget the knife from her—I think the man was sober, but I think both the women had been drinking—when I heard the women's voices quarrelling I did not hear Roberts's voice.</p>

               <p>it was meant for me—she never screamed, but said. "Oh, Jesus," and ran out the door, which opens outwards—Roberts made a rush to go after her, and thinking he would catch her on the dark stairs, I rushed at him and caught him by the shirt (I think it was the collar) with both hands—I thought my sister bad gone for the police, and I held him, and we struggled, and the table went over, but the cups were broken before—he got away from me, and made a rash towards the bed which is near the window—I caught him again, and we struggled towards the door, getting out on to the dark landing—he had not got hold of my wrists than, but when wegot on to the landing he had them—he tired to get my hair and my throat in the room—on the landing he put his leg behind me, and I went flat over on my back—my head was close to Amory's door—I dragged Roberto over with me—I was lying along the Passage with my feet towards my own door—my head hit the partition—I kept on screaming, but nobody came till I fell—I did not see any knife till I saw it given to the policeman by Amory—I cannot swear wheather it was Amory or Roberts who gav it to the policeman—I had a knife which my sister and I used in our own work—I bought it—the last time I saw that knife before, it was given to the policeman was at seven o'clock, when we were going out, when I put it with some wax on a shelf, and the leather on the top of it, with other things—when my head knocked against the partition I saw Amory and Mary Johnson come out, but I never saw the other woman till yesterday—when Amory came out my brother-in-law said something which I did not not hear, but I saw Amory wanted to hold me and Roberts wanted to go back to the room—I caught him again, and then as the policeman came up the stairs he let go one wrist, and held both hands on the other—there was some blood on my wrist—in the struggle his nail caught me, and made me bleed—there is a mark here—when the poliman came I was excited—I was always on good terms with my sister—we had an argument about the leather sometimes; we never had any serious quarrel—I did not strike my sister fifteen years ago—I never struck her, and she never struck me; she was a quiet, industrious, good woman—when the policeman came Roberts was holding me very tight, and he said to the policeman, "I charge this woman with stabbing my wife"—it gave me such a turn that I lost power of myself, and I said. "What have I dome to you?"—I never said anything about a kiss; I never kissed my sister—I was taken to the station; I was drunk, and so was my sistershe was not in the habit of drinking much spirits, but it was a very wet night, and she was upset I was charged first with stabbing my sister I said, "Is it me to hurt my sister"—I meant to say, "Woe be to me to hurt my sister"—afterwards the inspector said. "You are charged with the murder of Elizabeth Roberts; do you hear?"—I said, "Yes, I hear, sir, but I am innocent"—I was so knocked up—I remember two doctors looking at my hands—my sister asked me to live with her—when we were out selling our work my sister did not want to go home, bat we did so because the child was at home.</p>

               <p>1s. 3d.; one for 2s.; 27 with no remittances, and two private letters—in the safe we found three cheques for a guinea each——in all there were 286 orders of different kinds from all parts of the world, mostly English—the total is £458, including £57 18s. in the safe, which included £8 10s. in gold, 12s. 6d. silver, bronze and postage stamps—we found also press copy of letter written to the prisoner from the Secretary of the Master of the Rolls of November 9th, 1898 (<hi rend="italic">complaining of the annoyance of being obliged to reply to letters erroneously referring to the Master of the Rolls by persons who wished to secure their dividends by suing "in formd pauperis." Home pencil shorthand was on the letter which was explained to be notes with regard to altering the statement in the prisoner's published register</hi>)—we also found between 4,000 and 5,000 copies of the register, also a cash-book, day book, and postage-book—the cash-book shows the receipts for November to be £480 10s. 9 1/2 d.—the outgoings were principally for advertising, £204 178. 4d.—we also found cards of Next-of-Kin agents and circulars, specimens of Turner &amp; Co.'s adver-tisements in various newspapers, and circulars relating to several thou-sand of the Smith family entitled to receive and claiming money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The books were kept in a business-like way—the ex-ternal appearance was that of a well-conducted business—from inquiries I find the defendant has been carrying on this business since May, 1897—before that he was a clerk to a Next-of-Kin firm named Cox &amp; Co.—I have seen the names of McDougall &amp; Co Sidney Preston &amp; Co., W. H. Lydall and others as carrying on the same business—I believe the defendant is respectable.</p>

I assumed the name Woodman because my mother married again—my name is Turner—I was employed by Cox and Co., Next-of-Kin Agents, for two years—upon leaving them I arranged to open a business of the same kind—I was six months preparing my register—the 291 pages contain the names of persons advertised for since 1700—I got the names from various news: papers, including the <hi rend="italic">Official Gazette</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the Supplement to the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>—information from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> I got from Palmer's Index, from which the names were copied bodily into my book—I kept fifty-four volumes, which were found in my possession, like this (<hi rend="italic">pro-duced</hi>) as an index to my register—against the names I put the source of information—"John Ferguson, 2462," would mean from <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> and so on—when search is required I go to this index, search for the advertisement, and then send the information—I returned the fee of a guinea when the advertisement referred to a missing friend—I have the receipts from persons to whom I returned the guinea in a number of cases—that is the meaning of the note in my book—about three per cent, of the notices are issued by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Payer's advertisement I got from Palmer's Index to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of July 18th, 1862—if a person pays for the information I search the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—that shows the money is to be transferred in three months—the latter part of the advertisement was always given to clients except for a short period—latterly I referred them to the Bank.</p>

Early on January 1st, I was on duty with Dunning in Eastcheap and saw the four prisoners on the south side—they commenced a conversation with a drunken man, and between them they got him to Tower Hill and set him up against a blank wall and Bruce put his hands in his pockets—he said, "For God's sake don't <hi rend="italic">do me down</hi> "—Bruce struck him in the face, and knocked him down, and they gave him a hick each—I was about ten yards off on a wall—there was a light about 20 feet off—Beaton kicked him when he was on the ground—they searched his pockets while he was on the ground—Beaton walked away, and came back and said, "For God's sake give the man a chance, here is a policeman coming"—that was a uniform man—the three walked away, and Bruce followed the officer—I got further assistance and then said, "We are police-officers, and arrest you for assaulting a drunken man"—Hart said, "This is a b—fine thing for the new year"—Beaton said. "I saw what was going on and walked away, but foolishly came back to see what was going on; if my <hi rend="italic">chums</hi> get punished I shall get it, too"—they all belong to the Scots Guards.</p>
