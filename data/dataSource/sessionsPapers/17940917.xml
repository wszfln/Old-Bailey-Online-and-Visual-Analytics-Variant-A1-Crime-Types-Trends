               <p>Q. Tell my lord and gentlemen of the jury what happened at your house the 17th of August? - Between nine and ten on Sunday morning the 17th of August, a very great quantity of people assembled at the door, and some of them unhinged the front of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the manner of their behaviour? - They were very riotously throwing stones, and insisted on having some recruits out belonging to the Norwich regiment, that I had there; I suppose there was a hundred people there. I have a middle door, which I barricadoed with a water butt, after they had taken off the hinges of the door at the end of the passage; the door of the house was a very weak door. After they had taken the passage door off the hinges, they took it out into the street, and they had a great difficulty to get it to pieces, and that diverted them some time, they broke it to pieces; after that they had the sign taken down, which they broke also; there was an application then made to the police office, to get the assistance of the military. I remained in the house all the while, I durst not get out for my life myself; I dispatched a man for the military; before the military did come, they came up the passage and brought the pieces of the outer door, and threw it over the middle door, at the windows, and broke the windows and the fashes, and swore they would get in; I had a military officer with me in the house, we threatened to fire at them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you convey this threat to them? - Over this middle door, which is six feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it yourself? - I did; they were forcing at the door at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect had this threat of your's? - They went back two or three times, and they came up again, and said, never mind, they cannot kill above two or three of us; we will be in the house, and have it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person who said these words? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, what past then? - The military came, and we opened the door, and the gentleman that I had with me from Northampton who desended the door got over the leads, and went and seized<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170004"/>the prisoner at the bar, but I never saw him till I saw him at the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said already that the sashes of your windows were broke? - They were; there is one of them here present</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this riot continue at your house, before the time that you was relieved by the arrival of the military? - About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. These expressions you speak of, you are very certain were made use of, "we will be in and have it down"? - I am; they said, come along, my lads, we will be in and have it down.</p>
               <p>HORNBY MORELAND sworn.</p>
               <p>I am quarter master of the royal Lincoln regiment, commanded by colonel Edward. I came from Lincoln on this business last Saturday morning. I was at Mr. Ostliss's the morning when this affair happened; I had been there all the night before, and I went to bed at four o'clock in the morning, all was very quiet then; at ten o'clock I was alarmed again, they ran up to call me, I rose immediately, at first I came down stairs naked, and I enquired what arms they had in the house, and if the pistols I had the night previous, were ready; a person of the name of Ewings was then in the house with some Norwich volunteers; I desired him to apply to the police office, for the assistance of the military; at the time they came down, they had forced a door of the passage contiguons to the street, and I heard them, as I supposed, breaking it in pieces, for I heard the wood crack repeatedly; when they had broke the outer door, there is a door at the far end of the passage, which is open upwards; they came with various pieces of the outer door, which communicated with the street, and with stones, which it seems were brought for the purpose of throwing at the house, and threw them over the middle door; the stones were blue flint stones, such as could not be had in the street, and also various brick bats, with which they demolished the first floor windows almost entirely, there were very few squares left unbroken.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons could you judge were in the passage at the time this not took place? - There were several; I could see many people through a hole which I made in order to fire a pistol the night before; I was told by the neighbours there were two thousand people at the front of the house; the passage was full.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to distinguish any persons there? - Not at that particular time, afterwards I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell us what you did observe? - The passage was almost full of people, whose persons I could not distinguish; I looked over the door and threatened to fire at them, and then they returned back, and I had a cutlass, which I held over the top of the door, and when they attempted to get over the top of the door, I drove them back with it repeatedly; I then could discover through the hole that I had made, one more particularly riotous than the rest, who rallied the mob as often as they retreated; at that time I made enquiry of the people at the windows, whether the man had succeeded in obtaining the military assistance? as soon as I heard that the military assistance was coming. I then went and disguised myself in a great coat, so that they should not know me, for I supposed that they would know my person by looking over the door; I had remarked this Strutt repeatedly to rally the mob, and I recollected his voice; the prisoner is the person, I am positive of it. I then disguised myself in a great coat with a black collar, so that they should not have any suspicion that I was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170005"/>man that had desended the house; I went up stairs and broke the lock of the one pair of stairs door, and went out at the one pair of stairs window, the window was demolished, I believe; I lifted up the sash and got on the leads.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it demolished? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you push open the sash to get out? - I did, I pushed the sash up, and got out on the leads, on to a little office that is contiguous to the house, I went into the one pair of stairs window of a Mr. Turner, and out into the street at the front door of his house, and so down into the passage, and so I got to that man; I was in the great coat, and told him in this manner, the horse guards are coming to assist the people of the house, as a friend, I advise you, pray desist; the prisoner said, b-gg-r your eyes, d-mn the horse, we will be in, we will be in, come on my lads, we will be in. Previous to that I had heard this man crying out hurra, down with it! down with it! I am positive as to the man and voice; for I took this step in order to be positive to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you heard that? - On the inside of the door. I then got back out of the passage entry, and went over to the horse guards, I went to the ordinary sergeant; says he, the horses are ready to come out of the stable; with that I came back about twenty yards before the horses, and I went along the side of the houses and got into the passage again, and when I got in, this man was standing with the rest of the mob, encouraging them to commit further acts of depradation, by saying, come on my lads, we will yet be in, or we will be in. I then went across the street to the guard and back again; as soon as I discovered the horses heads, I seized this man, he was amongst the foremost men, in the front of the mob, I said, you are the ring leader of the mon, and I said to the officer, who was then got up to me, sir, I have secured the ringleader of the mob; two of the guards came up to my assistance just at the door; he made a violent struggle, and his coat tore where I had hold of him all the way down, but I got hold of him again till the horse came, and he was secured, and then he was secured; and I took him myself to the watch-house, escorted by the horse; when he got to the watch-house, there was only an old man in the watch-house and a woman, and they were afraid of him, because the horse did not come in, they were on horse back; there was a great mob following him of six hundred people, and they said, d-mn him, I will have him yet; and they did nearly kill me the next day, I escaped to a miracle, (some stones produced) I can swear to these two; this stone hit Mr. Ostliff over the head.</p>
               <p>(Some pieces of the door produced, and a sash partly demolished.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Ostliff. It is my door, the only guard I have to the house, it is fixed at the end of the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. What damage did you see them do? - They broke the door down, the front door of the passage at the street, and they had the sign down, and broke that, and then they came into the passage; we prevented them coming into the other door, we barricadoed it up with a water tub and other things, but they forced out one of the under pannels, and threw the stones in; and thereby the glass, and part of the frames of the windows were demolished, and when they did that I went for the military, and went down to the Horse Guards, and told them the situation the inhabitants of Charing-cross were in; and they told me I must go and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170006"/>get an order from the magistrate, and I went down to Mr. Kitby's house, and he gave me an order for the military.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the mob say any thing? - I heard them say, down with it, down with it, b-gg-r and bl-st their eyes we will have them out, and this Mr. Moreland and a corporal belonging to a regiment that was there, stood with their swords, and if it had not been for them they would have been in.</p>

               <p>I am examining clerk to the board of works; I went and surveyed the premises; the outer door next the street seemed to me to be wrenched off its hinges, I have no doubt, but I saw the remains of it laying in the court yard, but that I am not positive; at the end of the passage there is another door, which I conceive belonged to Mr. Ostliff, and two other adjoining houses, at that door there was a little hole made, which seemed to be cut by a knife, and I presume now from what I have heard, that it was cut for seeing the mob, but when I surveyed the house, I took it as done by the mob, for seeing who was inside; when I surveyed the house, the sash of the one pair of stairs floor was taken out; there was a sash or sashes in the room of the one pair, which I did suppose to come from those window frames; the brick work had been struck in two places by stones, there was a joiner repairing the sash frames; the sash over the door, the glass was broke, all, except three panes, or only two, there were six panes of glass broke over the door, and there were five in the room on the left hand side of the door, there was a room on the right hand side of the court, which I considered as a parlour to the public house, one of these panes were broke, and part of the wood covering on it was injured trifling.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the situation of the house such on your inspection of it that it was your opinion that it was begun to be demolished? - I think I may say that the house was began to be demolished, in as much as the sashes were so far injured, and that I saw a joiner repairing the sash frames, which I suppose had been injured by the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. To Ostliff. Is that your sash that is broke? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so hroke by the mob at the time? - It was, and the sash frames were broke, only I happened to go down to Norwich, and I gave orders for the joiner to repair the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been into the City for a parcel, I had been to Snow-hill, coming back I called at my washerwoman's, I had not been long out of the country, I have no friends; four years ago I had a kick by a horse on the head, and I was sent to the hospital, and after that I went into the country, and when I got well, I being fit for nothing else, I was advised to go to labouring work, in consequence of the burt in my head, being fit for nothing else, and I went to labouring work, and afterwards I came to London, and I had not been long in London, I came up to get some labouring work, I worked for Mr. Wilson at Bow two months, all my friends are in the country; this day I was going from Snow-hill to Covent-garden, I had a handkerchief, shirt and a pair of stockings in my hand, and I met the mob, and they shoved me about very much, and asked me why I did not go along with them? I was rather in liquor, and went along with them, and the mob went to this house, and the gentleman, my prosecutor, he went for the horse guards, and they came with the horse, at the same time I stood at the corner of the court, and all the mob ran away, and some gentlemen stood by, and asked me why I did run? and I said I had not done any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170007"/>to run for, and they took hold of me, and took me up to St. Martin's watch-house, and there I was confined till they had me to Tothill-fields Bridewell. I have not a friend in town, except down in Essex, near Rockford, where I lived several years.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you at that time; - In the lower apartment, at supper with my family; they continued so for some time, for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then I went up stairs and left my family below, and told them to hide themselves from the brick bats and stones, that they might not be knocked on head, and I sent Sams to inform the Lord Mayor that the mob were about the house, in order to demolish it; I dare say it was half an hour before the guards came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said by any of the people? - I did not, there was so much noise, I left my house, I first got my family out at a back window, then afterwards I went out at the same window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the persons that were assembled? - I did not see any one concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish from the noise, whether there was many persons assembled? - I saw a great number by going up to a one pair of stairs, and looking out at the window where they broke in.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might you think there were there? - I suppose there might be two or three or four hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was your house before you left it? - The window shutters were broke in, and some part of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you left your house from your first hearing the noise? - I suppose it might be near half an hour before I got out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the military arrived at that time? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you left your house you say the shutters were broke in? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return to your house again? - When the military had dispersed the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your house when you returned? - The shutters were almost entirely consumed, with the frames and glass.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the door? - The pannel of the door quite entirely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170008"/>broke in, and the knocker at the door broke.</p>

               <p>Q. Hearing of this noise and confusion what did you do? - I jumped out of the back room of the kitchen, and went to the Lord Mayor, I came back, and they said there is one of them (I suppose they meant me as one of the recruiting party) if you can get at him kill him.</p>

Was you called upon to give your assistance on occasion of this riot? - About half past nine, a few minutes more or less, I was in Shoe-lane with my Lord Mayor, I received orders from the Lord Mayor to proceed immediately to a house in Holborn, which I understood to be the house of Mr. Layzell, a few doors beyond Hatton-garden; I went and took some constables, and the Lord Mayor attended with the military, I suppose about twenty paces in the rear of me, there was a deal of noise till I got near the spot, when I got as near as I could to the house, as I am to that bench, I put my mace behind me, and stood for a minute, or a minute and a half, in order to fix my attention on some that were most active in the riot, there were four or five hundred people there, I heard the glass breaking just in the front of me, and the stones falling about me; at last I saw three persons very busy at the door of the house, in attempting to break the door, they had got hold of a shutter, or part of a shutter, two on one side of it and one on the other, the prisoner Purchase and another were on the left side, Purchase nearest to me of the second, Warnbeck had hold of the shutter on the other side, they were using it, endeavouring to force the lower part of the door, the upper part was at that time broke; the fan light over the door was like wife broke, and most of the window frames and shutters were broke or pulled down, and I believe most of the windows of the house, but this I did not so particularly notice; having observed these things, and seeing those men so active, I immediately sprung forward, caught Purchase in my left hand, and Warnbeck in my right, while they had in their hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170009"/>the shutter, trying to break the door open; having laid hold of them I immediately delivered Warnbeck into the possession of two constables, who were close by the side of me, to support me, and said, take him to the Compter; Purchase began to struggle a good deal, whom I had in my left hand, and I kicked up his heels, in order to prevent him from making so much struggle; there were one or two constables near me, and I delivered him to one Streating, but seeing so considerable a mob, while I was going to deliver him, and while he was getting up, I received a blow on the back part of my head, and just at the same instant I heard somebody say, d-mn him, go it, we will have him off; what it alluded to I don't know, whether they meant to have me from him, or refuse him. By this time the military had marched up, and I desired Streating, as he seemed to be so very obstreporous, to take him into the front of the line, thinking there would be no attempt to rescue him there; they were afterwards delivered fase to the Compter, and brought before the Lord Mayor the next day, and then were committed; I have not the least doubt but they are the persons that were in that act.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. What time was this? - It was about half after nine, I think.</p>
               <p>

            Who did you say you gave Purchase to? - To Streating, and Warnbeck to Pierrpoint.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know these persons before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you see them from that time till you see them before the Lord Mayor? - Warnbeck I did not see after that time, but Purchase I saw for near half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there first, you say, you did not perceive any thing particular, you stood still? - I said, when I went there I saw a large concourse of people, to the amount of four or five hundred; I stood still for the purpose of making observation, and my observation sell on these two men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Though you did not see Warnbeck till the next day; had you any doubt about him then? - None in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, you took them both in the same instant? - I did; one in my right hand and the other in my left, and the reason I gave up Warnbeck immediately, was, because I had the mace in my right hand, and I could not so cleverly hold both.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am ward beadle of St. Andrews, Holborn; I am an engraver by trade; I took charge of Purchase, the young man on this side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your custody? - To the best of my thinking, about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is the young man that was in your custody? - Yes, I am quite certain; I received him from the hands of Mr. Hollier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Purchase. I was going up Holborn to my uncle's that lives in Walpole-court, he lives at No. 5, I crossed Hatton-garden, and I saw a great mob; when I came to that house, some pieces of a shutter took me by the foot and throwed me down, and before I could get up, the gentleman took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warnbeck. On this Wednesday night I was told by a person there was a great riot in Shoe-lane, and he was going to see it, and I said, I would go with him, and I came to Shoe-lane, and could not get in, and I could not get back again to go home, and the mob carried me up Fleet-street, and then I came down Shoe-lane to return home; and as I was going to turn off to come down Holborn, there was a mob assembled to break the house; I stood in the road side for about a minute and a half; when the city officers came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170010"/>up, and Mr. Hollier took hold of a person by the coat, and he gave a kind of a twist round to get away, and he made a kind of slip off; and then Mr. Hollier stood and looked me in the face, and said, you are one of them; I said, I am not. He took hold of me, and he said, he would keep me; by that means he took and delivered me into the custody of two officers, and I went very peaceably along.</p>
               <p>Court to Hollier. Warnbeck says, you aimed at another man first, and he slipped away, and then you laid hold of him? - I am positive that Warnbeck is one that had hold of the shutter. With respect to the attempt to get away, he did attempt it, but I again grasped him, before he got from me, and gave him over to the officers. I am sure that Warnbeck had hold of one side of the shutter, and I am sure that Purchase had hold of the other.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Warnbeck called eight witnesses; and the prisoner Purchase called four, who gave them exceeding good characters.</p>

I was at home, on Wednesday the 20th of August, the whole evening; about four o'clock a gentleman, a neighbour, sent for me to come to his house. In the evening there came by twenty or thirty women rather before ten o'clock, they cried out, Mr. Cafe, for Christ Almighty's sake get out of your house, for the mob is coming; there were several people in my house drinking, they all rose up; I told them I was not in the least dread of the mob's coming; I continued there till the mob were within ten or fifteen yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the number of persons there? - I should suppose there were an hundred. One of them came up to me, and laid hold of me by the coat, and said, d-mn my eyes, if you don't run off you will certainly be murdered else. I was about two or three yards from the steps, my wife called out, for God's sake, take take off your child; I said, Susan, go out of the house immediately. I went out and returned to my house between one and two o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your house? - All the front of the windows pulled down.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170011"/>Q. Do you mean the windows or the sashes? - The glass, and that that contains it, the wood work, and I observed the wainscotting torn off in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were the window shutters? - The window shutters were down when the mob came, and when I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How were your windows? - The bars of the windows every one of them were broke, and then the frames destroyed; the bottles containing different sorts of liquor, totally destroyed; in the kitchen there was not a bit of furniture to be seen, only part of the jack, the frame of the kitchen window that leads to the parlour, that was totally destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the house above stairs? - There was nothing destroyed above stairs only the pannel of a door of a closet, split in two.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your house that evening were these things in the situation you have now described, or were they all whole? - They were all whole.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On the 20th of August last I was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing taking place that was particular? - Yes; I was going up stairs between eight and nine or ten o'clock, I went up to fasten the room windows; I came down again, a parcel of people came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think? - Eighteen or twenty; and I went to the end of the back door, leading from the passage to the bar, and I saw Biggett and some more young men come in, I never saw him before in my life; that is the man at the bar with the red hair; I said, young man, what do you want? Biggett made me for answer, are you mistress of the house? I was rather fearful to say yes, but I did say yes; he asked me where my husband was? I said, I don't know; he said, I must go and setch him; I said, I could not go and fetch him, for I did not know where he was; and he proceeded to the bar, and took out a stone cask of gin, and put it on the top of the bar door, and turned the cock to let the liquor out; I turned it off, and he turned it on again, and I turned it off again, and he turned it on again; and I said, gentlemen, drink the liquor or give it away, do what you please with it, but don't let it run about.</p>
               <p>Q. What was going on at this time to your knowledge in the inside of the house? - They were breaking and destroying in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what they were doing without the house? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what was doing inside of the house while Biggest was at the bar? - They were breaking, destroying, and pulling down the place, and the furniture, as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any thing at the bar? - The bar is entirely broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Biggett there during the whole of that time? - I don't know that he was, I did not see him when he went out; he was there when the mob were breaking down the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner Biggett behaved, and the rest of the people behaved? - While this mischief was doing I saw nothing of Biggett, only taking out the jar and turning of the liquor on. The mob below broke all the windows, and window frames in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - After that I went out to the back door; I could not get out at the street door for the concourse of people; I went out at the back door, and went up in the court, and I could not get down at the end of the court, and I came in again, and just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170012"/>as I came in at the back door; I found somebody push or was pushed against me; I suppose I was out about the space of five minutes, and when I came back, I found some one push rather against me, and I looked up to see who it was, and I saw Osborne; knowing him, at first I was rather glad to see him, and I said to him, I thought that you would not have used me so; the answer be made me, was, I was pushed against you. He never passed any more words, good, bad, or indifferent; he went into the kitchen, but what became of him I don't know, I did not see him come into the house, nor did I see him go out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went down into the kitchen, what was going on in the kitchen? - All the things were breaking in the kitchen, but I did not see him do any thing at all; I heard the noise, but I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Osborne live, that you had an opportunity of knowing him? - About a minutes walk from our house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The mob were pulling down the bar at the time Biggett was speaking to you? - Yes, destroying the tap room.</p>

               <p>Q. He desired to know where your husband was? - He asked me where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. All that Biggett did was in overturning this stone jar? - It was turning the cock, in which stone jar was gin.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all Biggett did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Excepting that when you turned the cock back, he turned it going again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. At the time this happened it must be dark? - I believe it was, it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

            Had you any light? - I had not, but they had plenty in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known Osborne for some time? - For the space of two months, ten weeks or more.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was glad to see him? - When I first saw him I was rather glad that I saw a face I knew, being in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended he had come to assist you more than to destroy. You don't know that he did you any mischief? - I don't know, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. It was very light. How came it to be so light? you can describe that well? - There were five or six candles light up at a time, or more, and put on some part of the wainscotting that they broke down in the tap room; and at one time we were all in the dark, till the men went out and got lights. When they heard the horse were coming, they cried out, here are the horse coming, put out the lights.</p>

            How many do you think there were of the mob? - They were all about the door; the shutters were not up; there was a great concourse of people, they were swearing, and saying, where was the Black Raven? there were some stones came through the window and knocked the candle off the tap room table on to the floor, and all the window and frame almost came in together; they said, d-mn their eyes, if they would not kill Case, if they could catch him. Then I got off my seat where I was sitting, when I saw the candle fall, and I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170013"/>ran between the cellar door and the bar door, where there is a little passage, I went there, and there were five gentlemen, quite gentlemen, came in, and asked me who I was? I told them I was the servant; they asked me where my master was? I told them he was out, they asked me where my mistress was? I told them she was up stairs, and they made a kind of whistling, and the people came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to distinguish any of the persons that came in? - No. Then the gentlemen asked me who was up stairs? I told them there was nobody up stairs but the lodgers, and they cut some candles out of the bar, and they kept some themselves, and chucked the rest to the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think may be the number of the mob, twenty or thirty, or more? - More than that. They went up stairs with me, and my mistress was then going out at the back door with a bundle in her hand, and then Biggett came in, I did not see him come in, but I turned about and saw him in the bar; it was that young man in the red hair, I never see him only in the bar, till I see him before the justices the next day. I saw my mistress with him, with the bundle in her hand, and rather quarrelling with him, but what was said I don't know, I saw him knock down a bottle in the bar while he was moving the gin cag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he was doing at all with the gin cag? - I did not see any more of him at all, I only saw him at that time. Then these gentlemen bid me go up stairs with them, I went with them to the one pair of stairs, and I begged and prayed that they would not break any thing in my mistress's room, for they were all favourite things of her's, they stooped to look under the bed; while we were going up stairs, they below, were breaking down the bar, and the settles in the tap room; when I desired the gentlemen not to break any thing in my mistress's room, they said they would not break any thing, they were only in search of somebody; they came out, and I thought that I would not go away from my mistress's door till they came down, they had asked me who was up stairs further? I told them only a man and his wife, lodgers; coming down stairs, John Osborne, I did not know his name before, but I knew his person by being a customer in the house; he said to a chimney sweeper that was with him at the one pair of stairs landing place, d-n her eyes, push her down, for that is where the men are, or knock her down, I don't know which now.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean? - Me.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed then? - I told him he need not knock or push me down, for the gentlemen had been in and searched the room, and immediately he hit me on the head, and made me rather stagger; I turned about and I pushed him, he had a stick, and in turning round there was a splinter in the stick, and it made my arm bleed, the stick went against me, I don't know whether he went to hit me or not; he went into the kitchen afterwards, I believe he then went down stairs and was pushed against my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this had taken place before he was pushed against your mistress? - Yes. When I came down stairs I saw him pushing into the kitchen, my mistress was standing at the back door, and the chimney sweeper asked me, if we had any beer in the cellar; I was afraid to say no, and I said yes, and he had a gallon pot in his hand, and my mistress said, go and draw some, and I heard the people outside saying the horse guards are coming, we have done enough here.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the people in the house, when this alarm was of the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170014"/>guards? - I was drawing the beer, and I began at the stale bull, Osborne went down with me, and while I was drawing at the stale butt, he pulled out the cock of the mild butt, and set it all a float.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the mob stay in the kitchen after this alarm of the horse guards? - The alarm was made while I was going down stairs.</p>
               <p>

            How long do you think that might be after Osborne made his way into the cellar? - They staid in it till I came up with the gallon pot three parts full of beer; they made their escape on the guards arriving; I came up with the beer, and said, here is some beer, and one of them took it out of my hand, and gave it outside. I am certain of Osborne.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. All you see Biggett doing was with respect to this stone jarr? - That was all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. You did not see Osborne break any thing, or do any thing of mischief of that sort? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you sometimes go by another name than that you have now? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What reward do you get by coming here to day? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have never been promised a reward to swear so stoutly against Osborne? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 20th, and Osborne was not taken up till the 23d? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how that happened? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him between the 20th and 23d? - Yes, I saw him on Thursday morning, and I told my mistress, my master was not at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you saw Osborne before the justice had you any doubt of his being the man that struck you, and asked you as you have described? - No, I have no doubt at all, I am very sure he is the man.</p>

            How far did you walk with the old woman after you met her? - A little way, I was only a little while in going, but I don't know the place, because I am a stranger here; when we got into the public house, I looked about to give her a pint of beer, and she was off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this public house is situated? - I don't know, it was in the dark, and I was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you there? - There was a very good entertainment, there was one captain there said he was from Barbadoes, another from Jamaica, and another from Martinique, and some from Saint Le terre, which I took last war, and when I got in one of them said, will you have a glass of wine? and I said, I will have a pint of porter, I am tired of wine, and one of these captains said, will you sleep along with my mate, and I was walking to bed, and this pretended mate got up and shewed me into the room to bed, I know him very well if I was to see him, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170019"/>says to him why don't you shew me the light, and as soon as they got me inside they locked the door on me, and it was all dark, and there were three bars at the window, I was used very cruel, I saw the bars at the window in the morning, and four or five padlocks on the door, that was a pity; I heard them open three or four of them in the morning. I will fight for my King and Country while I am able.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sleep there all night? - I did not sleep a wink, the next morning there were one of these jail keepers came up and opened the door, and asked me how I found myself? I asked for God's sake for some drink, some ale, he said he would give me some directly, and he kept me there till it was dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you staid there all the day? - I did, and in the middle of the next night they transported me to this place in Whitcomb-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any ale? - No, not a drop; the next night they came and threw me into a coach, there were about ten of them about me, they threw me in like a cat, and they used me very cruel; the coach drove on at the rate of three knots an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the ten go into the coach with you? - No, only two.</p>

               <p>Q. What discharge was that? - A discharge from the navy office that captain Roberts and Willoughby gave me; they afterwards threw me into a coach, and put the blinds up, and drove me away to the Banbury road.</p>

               <p>Q. You was telling my lord that you was put into a coach to go to Banbury. Why was you to go to Banbury? - I don't know, your honour, why I was to go there. I would go to sea to serve the king, if I was well, sooner than go to Banbury.</p>

               <p>Q. You was put into a coach to go to Banbury? - I was, and they blinded the coach that I could see nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. The blinds of the coach were up? - Yes, I could not see no light, and they drove me away, and I take it the coach went about three knots an hour, about three miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you suppose they carried you in the coach? - They carried me a great way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take you out of London? - O, yes! a great way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose they were driving you that way? - About three or four hours. Then they threw me into a waggon, and the waggon carried me about fifteen miles. Indeed I cannot tell you all what they did. Afterwards when I could not walk and keep up with the party, they flogged me, and whipped me to make me go along.</p>
               <p>Q. What party do you mean? - The kidnapping party.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the party of kidnappers come from that house? - They had; they used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. They went with you all the way? - Yes, all the way to Banbury; I was obliged to go or die on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never was out of the kidnapping house in town, till you was put into that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you was put into the coach, you went immediately to Banbury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were? - Very well I do, if I could see them all I would shew them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that went with you to Banbury? - There are none of them here, a party of kidnappers went with me, but they are not here now.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got to Banbury what next happened? - When I got to Banbury all the gentlemen took my part, the justices and all. I asked the quarter master, when I went down to Banbury, what sort of a man are you? Says he, I am a quarter master. When they carried me down to Banbury, they kept me in prison to transport me, and I would be in a good ship of war now, if they had let me alone; they wanted to make an East India soldier of an old sailor.</p>

            When you went down to Banbury, they kept you in prison to transport you? - Why what else were they going to do with me? Well, then the justice of peace at Banbury, and the Mayor and all the gentlemen there got up, and they took my part, and brought me up here again.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they bring you? - With a coach; they brought me up very decent. Look here, see they knocked out half a tier of teeth. The man in the brown did that (Ruggles.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in Banbury after you got there? - I was three weeks there, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you at all certain whether it was in June or July that you got to town? - I don't know what time it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I cannot say. They kept me three weeks in Banbury, and three weeks in town, and I was about eleven days coming up from Deal; I was too bad to get into a coach, and I did not keep any day or hour in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went before the Mayor of Banbury, and gave information of this? - Yes, he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you arrived at Banbury was it the Mayor took your examination? - The second night, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170021"/>Q. Then the Mayor of Banbury, and gentlemen there, heard your complaint, and, I believe, they support you in this prosecution? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons at the bar, that you see now, are the two persons that you have described? - Indeed they are the two; I would not tell you a lie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I say, my honest fellow, I want to have a few words with you? - I have spoke to my lord, the judge, and I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in Banbury before you told your story to the Mayor or justice? - Not long. They came to me soon, the gentlemen of the town did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Banbury you did not like to be looked upon as a soldier? - I am a sailor and not a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you did not like; then you told your story to the good people there, as much like as you have told here, but they insisted on it that you was a soldier, and when you came to Banbury, you found yourself as a soldier; and you thought that by your story you should get your discharge from the situation in which you found yourself? - They took away my discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Banbury, they wanted to tell you that you was a soldier there, and you did not like it, and you gave this story; they gave you countenance and protection there, and you thought that you should get out of their clutches? - Certainly; I cannot serve three kings at once.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people went to Banbury with you? - There was some poor old men that they kidnapped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a good large party? How many in number? - I don't know. There was a woman that saw the second robbery made on me of my buckles, but they transported her out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. How many marched into Banbury with you? - There were about twenty-eight on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of dress had you on at the time? - They put a blue jacket and a pair of trowsers on me, and I could not button them about my lame legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was in this miserable condition when you got out of the waggon? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any of these recruits with you in this waggon? - No, they were able to walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any recruits in the coach? - Yes, there were two thieves with me.</p>

You went down the road and then you was put into a waggon? - Yes, and then when I was out of the waggon, I was not able to walk, and when I got on the road one of these kidnappers came and took a faggot of prickles and whipped me on my legs. When the justice wrote up a letter to try whether my name was in the navy books, my name was open on the books, and whereof the colonel got a letter, and he wrote down a loving letter to me, that I should be cleared when he came down, in about five or six days, he came down to the Red Lyon, and when he came there he was not a minute there, and these people that were kidnapped all together about the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, that you never was out of the kidnapping house from the time that you came in, till the time that they put you in a coach to carry you to Banbury? - Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170022"/>Q. During the time who was in this room with you? - No, nobody but the jailer, and he left a pot of water with me and a bit of soul bread. I cannot think on it all, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. So you was in this room for a fortnight and nothing to live upon but bread and water, saw nobody hardly during that time? - No, only the turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they keep you in this room for? - Because I would not swear before a justice; that man used to bring up a pint of beer, and I used to ask the servant for a pint of beer, and I used to say, for God's sake, good woman, will you give me a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you never went before a justice? - No, only in Banbury, and justice Bond, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look towards the bench and see if you recollect the face of any person that fits there, just by my lord. (Justice Kirby stands up)? - No, I never saw the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went before him and altelted yourself? - There was a wooden handed justice came into that man's house in Whitcomb-street, he says, take this book into your hand, and I said, band me that book out of your starboard hand; and he handed it to me out of his larboard hand; and I said, I was as loyal a subject as any man, and I was knocked down by that man there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now to your best recollection you never saw that man there (pointing to justice Kirby)? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went before any magistrate, to be attested, in your sober senses? - Never in my days.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will travel with you a little from the beginning of this system; how long had you been in Deal hospital? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you up from Deal? - I walked, I was afraid of going into a coach or waggon for fear of shaking my bones.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw in Deal a good many seafaring people there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you in London? - To come up for my money, that was due to me from the Inflexible.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have got the money at Deal? - I thought to have got my money and go into an hospital here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you had received any pay? - I did not receive any pay at all yet, I only got a note; I had not received any money for a great while before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you when you left Deal? - I had three guineas in my pocket, captain Roberts gave me one guinea, and the admiral gave me another guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the captain give you the money when you went into the hospital? - No, when I came out captain Roberts gave me two guineas, and admiral Beaconfield I believe, or something like it, his fleet lies in the Downs, he gave me one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the admiral's name that gave you the guinea? - Some cross name, I cannot think on his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no money till captain Roberts gave you the two guineas? - O! yes, I had money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you before? - I had only some silver in my pocket; when these people met me, I had about seven shillings and six-pence in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the silver? - Do you think my poor father had not sent me no money?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he send you the money to? - To Deal, from Ireland, he always sends me money, he sent me money in the American way.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170023"/>Q. What age are you? - I believe I am about thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. When your poor father had sent you some money, what made you apply to captain Robert or the admiral? - captain Roberts was a good man, and knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had contrived to send you money to Deal? - My father sent me money the last American war.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - He is a wine cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you then when you came out of the Hospital that your father sent you? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at it? - I got it from the man that brought the letter; he gave it me out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a bank note? - No, it was only three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to bring you the money? - This man came over passenger.</p>
               <p>Q. In what ship? - In the Mary brig.</p>
               <p>Q. And he found you out at Deal? - He did, because I had wrote to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Mary brig come from? - From the City of Cork.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was a sailor from on board that ship that brought you this? - No, he was a landsman.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say this moment that he was a postman that brought you it with this letter? - He was all the same as a postman.</p>
               <p>Witness to Court. My lord judge, am I to answer this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What time was it you received these three guineas? - I was pretty sure I was all the same as a dead man, in the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was the money brought to you before you left the Hospital? - I was not above two days in the Hospital when the man came to me; I wrote from Portsmouth before I came to Deal.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that the ship was going to Deal? - Because that was the place that we had got orders to steer to.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you wish us to be contented with that story, that you sent your letter to your father at Portsmouth, and two days after, when you arrived at Deal, this man brought you the money? - You want to confuse me. I wrote from Portsmouth, and was some time coming round Spithead.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, two days after you had been at the Hospital, you got three guineas, what became of that money? - Spent it; I spent all the money I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this money gone before you applied to captain Roberts or the admiral? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had got a watch left, and a pair of silver buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to captain Roberts for two guineas, and the admiral for one? - Yes; and if admiral Barrington was here he would give me ten. I wish to God I could see him here!</p>
               <p>Q. So you set out with your watch and your silver buckles in your shoes? - Indeed I did; and a lady coming along, Sir Charles Everett's wife, on the road, said she would give me a lift in the coach; but I was afraid to get into it, I was afraid of the horses shaking me to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was that on the road? - I cannot tell; she told me she was Sir

            's wife. Would not any gentleman take a liking to a sailor, seeing me walk lame on the road. If I was in a ship, the ship would ride fair and easy; that would do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be on the road from Deal to London? - I was a good while; I could not walk above four miles, five or three miles a day; I was about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170024"/>eleven days coming from Deal. I was bothered so much the last American war by the shot hurting my hearing, and this leg and thigh was condemned once to be cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very deaf now? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with any body on the road? - I did not ask any body any questions at all, only walked along till I came to London-bridge, there I saw an old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to this old woman she was the first person that you spoke to about your journey. How came you to speak to her? - Because I thought she was a friendless woman, whom I could speak to. My good old mother, says I, can you tell me where I can get a lodging? she said, she could shew me a very pretty house.</p>
               <p>Q. This old witch had slown away when you came to this public house? - O, Yes! she was an old rogue; what did she bring me into that wicked house for? that was no honest lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. So this old woman took you to this place, and as soon as she had shewn you there, away she went? - And I thought to give her a pint of beer for it, and she flew away instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was you in that night? - I had my stick in my hand and my seafaring clothes on.</p>

            Was you weak? - Shew me before a doctor, and I will tell the doctor how I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you surprised when you came into this house? - How do I know but you are a parcel of honest gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. So you never have recovered of this illness from that time to this? - No, I am afraid I never will. Is it not bad usage to use any sailor so, to make a sol dier of an old sailor?</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get this lameness? - This leg was hurt the last American war, it was splintered, and this other leg was hurt this war.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Honesty, you see I call you by a fair name? - I am an honest man for Old England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halloo when you got into this place? - What use was my hallooing at the back settlements of a house, there was nobody would hear me, it was as good hold my tongue, it would be of no use. May the great God strike me dumb, deaf, and blind, if I was not asking in his(Kerr's) house two hours, before I got a pint of beer; that man used to take the drop of beer, and sling it into my face, and lock the door on me. Drat it all gentlemen, my life is nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the coach and came from the first house, did you make any hallooing then? - It was no use then.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you was got into the hands of enemies? - Yes, they were worse than the French. Did not I do as well as I could? I hallooed as well as I could; there was nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the door of the house in Whitcomb-street, you must have got out of the coach? - There were ten of them people about had hold of me as I came in, because I did not like to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. And then they kept you in this room for a fortnight, and you see nobody but this jailer? - There were three or four jailers used to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation in which you are now, you will certainly remember this question, during the time you was in Whitcomb-street, did any person come to examine you? - They had a surgeon of their own, and a wooden handed justice of their own.</p>

            Was there in fact then, during the the time of your staying in Whitcomb-street, any body in the character of a surgeon that examined you there? - I saw no surgeon; I saw a wooden handed justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him at the time how you had been used? - When I came to that wooden handed justice there, in the one pair of stairs, there was his starboard hand off, he had a billet of wood on, and he paid me with it about my breast very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gentleman who examined you, as a surgeon? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you shifted any part of your dress where the old woman had left you? - There was a party of knidnappers that came along with me to strip me. I would shew you them if I was to see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shift your dress at all in this house? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you or did you not? - I did not till I came to Whitcomb-street, Gentlemen, give me fair play. My lord judge, there are two many against me; it is a pity, my lord, but to see a sailor righted; consider a sailor, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me if whether you was ever attested in your serious moments, at a time that you had every opportunity of examining for yourself? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pretend to say that you lost any part of your property in this house? - They stripped me start naked.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no complaint of any thing of this kind till you arrived at Banbury? - I did not, I saw nobody but a poor farmer on the road, and he would be knocked down if he came to take my part, he would be killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it cut your hair off? - The barber; he is not here; I see him at the outer door, and when he see me, he ran away. Gentlemen, it is a pity you don't see me rectified. I beg of my lord judge to shew me some lenity. You think better of them than you do of me, and that is a pity.</p>

               <p>Q. What questions do you ask? - Whether he has been enlisted twenty four hours, usually; then if the magistrate is satisfied he desires we would administer the oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you administer an oath to the person that comes to be enlisted? - We administer two oaths, one is the oath of attestation, the other is to be true and obedient to the King, and the officers that are set over them</p>
               <p>Q. That oath was taken in this instance? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at the man, and see if you have any recollection of him? - I do not recollect the man's person, but from his manner of giving his evidence, I think it is the same, because of his made of speech, and by his behaviour here, because he behaved exactly the same there, but his person I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have a great many persons attested there, of course Irishmen as well as this man? - Irishmen make blunders as well as this man.</p>

Did he appear to be lame at all? - No, he did not, he said he was foot foundered; I made him walk backwards and forwards in the tap room, to view him, and he did jump, and as he jumped one of his shoes came off, that was tied by a bit of cord, or rope yarn; I then said, my lad, if you are not ill, I will enlist you, I then took half a crown piece out of my pocket, and I put it into his hand, and I said, now my lad, you are free, willing and able to serve his Majesty, in the Birmingham volunteers, now laying at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, and I will make this up five guineas and a crown; he says, then by Jasus I will go to the bounds of b-gg-ry with you, I then gave him a supper, and a pint or two of porter.</p>

            Is it customary to have a man examined as to his state of body by a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the surgeon examined him? - I was not, I called two or three days afterwards and I saw him in a state of intoxication, not sit to go before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been attested before he went to the White Horse? - No, I believe it was six or seven days before we could get him sober enough to go before a magistrate; I then applied to Mr. Ruggles, and begged of Mr. Ruggles to let one of his servants keep him from drinking; he said he could not, for he would be down in the tap-room; Mr. Ruggles desired me to call early some morning, very likely then I might catch him sober; I called two or three days after that, and asked him if he would go and be attested? by Jasus, says he, let us have a drop of the creature first, I afterwards asked him what the creature was? and he said, sure man alive it is good whisky; I then took him to the magistrate's, before serjeant Kirby, and there he was attested; I then carried him home. and never see any thing more of him till this day.</p>
               <p>Mr. serjeant Kirby. Though I cannot swear to this man, yet I have a sloating idea of a man that I particularly examined whether he had been in the Navy, and I remember that the man that was so examined, gave me an account of his having been discharged, and I remember that that man did give an account of his being at an hospital, and ill for some time, and he pretended the circumstance of having had money of a captain or admiral, but he stated that he had been at Deal some time, and I remember the circumstance of his meeting an old woman, and he talked of going through a very old way, through Thames-street, to try to be enlisted; I have tried the best I could to bring the circumstance to my recollection since I have been in court; whether the witness remembers more than I can, I cannot tell, or whether it applies to that man, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Watson. When you went to him to the house of Kerr, and he was intoxicated, did he pretend that any ill usage had been given to him? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had been in the navy? - No, but I think since Mr. serjeant Kirby has mentioned it, he wanted to make some excuse.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is no uncommon thing when they have got the money, to want to get off? - No, when they have got eight or ten guineas, they will say they have been kidnapped.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you leave him in? - In the one pair of stairs, a very large room, and saw him sometimes in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the different recruits going off when they went to Banbury? - I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are a recruiting sergeant, and keep a public house? - I did not at that time, I have married the widow since.</p>
               <p>Barrett. This is one of the men that molested me along with these people there.</p>
               <p>Court to Barrett. Do you insist on it still that you never went before the magistrate at all? - I was obliged to sign that paper, or die that moment, and this very man pretended to be the justice of peace, and he struck me about with his wooden hand, and every stroke he gave me went to my heart.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never went before the justice? - I never was, till I came before the justice of peace at Banbury.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170029"/>Q. Then you did not sign this paper before the justice, Mr. sergeant Kirby? - No, never did; here is the man that made me sign it, I never was before the justice.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he drest? - In an old brown jacket, like a sailor's jacket; the next morning when I searched him I gave him some clothes to put on, the morning after he had enlisted I think it was, I gave him some jackets and trowsers that I had to spare of Sir Thomas Dunlap's independent company.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of his old clothes? - He sold them to a shop keeper, who now lives at No. 16, East Smithfield, I don't rightly know his name, he is here, he has got the shirt that he bought of him with him.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. How long did he remain in this house? - About three days, it was the evening when he came in, and I think he went away about eleven or twelve o'clock the third day, he went from there to the White Horse, Whitcomb-street.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When he is very drunk he is not in his senses? - No, I know I am not.</p>

               <p>Barrett. I never see this man in my life.</p>
               <p>Joel. I remember seeing Barrett at the Swan and Anchor in East Smithfield, the beginning of July, Mr. Inkingbottom came to my house, and said that he had a man that had enlisted, and came for me to come and buy his old clothes, I went, and saw him at the Swan and Anchor; I see him there, he brought down his clothes, a brown jacket, an old blue jacket and a check shirt, and a pair of trowsers, and a pair of old shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drest at that time in any military uniform? - He was drest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these shoes any buckles in them? - No, strings, he asked me half a guinea for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of strings were they? - I think they were yarn, I cannot say rightly; I told him they were not worth that money; then, says he, I will not sell them to you at all, except you call for half a pint of gin; I told him I would not buy them, they were too dear; says he, if you will call for half a pint of gin I will take less; with that I bought them of him for six shillings and half a pint of gin, and I gave him the money into his hand, and after I paid him for them I left two of the garments behind me, they were not worth taking away, I took nothing away but the brown jacket and his check shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look how he was drest? Had he any buckles in his shoes that he had on? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any watch? - No, I think not, I will tell you why I can say so, I had a very handsome chain hanging to my watch, and he took notice of it, says he, I will buy it of you if you will wait till I get my bounty; says I, it is not worth my while to go after you.</p>
               <p>Court to Joel. Shew Barrett the shirt.</p>
               <p>Barrett. May the great God strike me dead if ever I wore that shirt, or ever saw it before.</p>

               <p>Q. When you had let Mr. Hansel into your house, was the door shut again? - The inner door was, and the outer door was on the jar. He desired me, if I had got any property, to take care of it; I went up stairs and I laid my hand on a little writing desk, and Mr. Hansel called out again, and said, for God's sake make haste, for here they are; with that my wife took the child out of the bed, wrapped up in a blanket, and ran off; I followed, went down immediately with this desk under my arm; then I made my best escape out at the door, and by this time the bricks were flung in at the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go out, at the back part of the house or the front? - There is only one door to the house, the front. When I came out at the front door, the prisoner at the bar, of the name of Berry, was there, and a shorter one, and the rest of the mob were situated opposite to the pile of bricks, at the front of the house; I suppose when I first came out, there might be twenty or more.</p>

            Was it as soon as you came out of the door that you saw Berry and the other? - It was immediately; they were rather within the door; I was going out at the door as they were coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into the house beyond your situation? - I did not stop to see; then the other took me by the collar, and asked me if I was not a crimp?</p>
               <p>Q. Can you point him out amongst the prisoners? - He is not in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Berry to you at the time he collared you and asked you this question? - Not a yard from me; there was just room for me to pass between. I went immediately to a friend's house with this desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him? - I told him I was no crimp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass in the passage between you and that man that had hold of you, and Berry? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was anxious to get out of the house? - I made the best of my way to a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you observed when you got out of the house? - They were slinging in brick bats through the windows.</p>

            Was that the language of this party of people so assembled? - It was. They were joined at last by two hundred at least, in about fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to when you had escaped from your house? - I went to a neighbour's house, of the name of Cocket, in Mulberry-court, about one hundred and fifty yards from my own door, up an alley; then I returned back to my wife's mother, to see if my wife and child were safe; they had got out of the house before I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any other persons in the house when you came away? - The maid was in bed, and the lodger and the boy; that was all the people that were in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170034"/>Q. When you returned from this neighbour's house, did the neighbour go with you or any body else? - The neighbour was not at home; I gave the box to his lodger to take care of it. I returned by myself; the light horse association had been there, and were there; I got into my house before they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how soon after your return to the spot, you got into your house? - I suppose in about five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on what was passing while you was near the spot, before you went into your house? - I could not, there were a crowd of people flinging at the house, and a great many people in the house spilling of the liquors.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell my lord and jury every thing that you observed, when you returned from your neighbour's house. what they were doing, and how they were acting, and how many people appeared to be there? - When I returned there were two hundred, as I said before; when the horse came they drove them all away. I believe there were one or two taken; I don't know which at that time. When the light horse came, they all ran away and hid themselves in the quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into your house? - I did; but before I went in I met the prisoner Berry, in custody with an officer, about ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you know him to be the man that you had seen when you fast attempted to get out from your house? - Yes, I did very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - I told him that he was the man that first knocked at the door; it is this nearest to me, I believe; he had a black beard on then, and a brown coat and black hair; I believe that is I cannot swar to him not.</p>

Did you come back again with him? - I came back with the constable; there were a great many in the house, and they cried out, there is the horse coming again, and they rushed out again; I see them slinging the bricks, but I could not distinguish one from the other; they were soon dispersed, we searched the house, but we could find nobody in it.</p>

            What were the contents? - Ale. There was a partition in the cellar, and by his turning over the partition he overturned the casks; the partition had been made on account of the water coming into the cellar, and in order to hide himself, this cask was overturned.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that man that you saw in the hands of Harper, the same man that you had seen in your house before, with the person that collared you? - He was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will ask you a question or two. From the deplorable state of your mind, I should think on such an accident, that you was a good deal confused? - I was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Was you able to account for this attack being made on your house? - I did not know of it four minutes before it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to guess at any cause why they should attack your house? - Not in the least; I never expected it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We had got to the length of your acknowledging that you was in a considerable flutter of mind, very much distressed? - It was enough to make me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I think so too; that makes it more likely you should not recollect the persons of the people? - That man, Berry, I took particular notice of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - It might want about a quarter to eleven.</p>

               <p>Court to Wheeler. Look attentively at all the five men; examine them at your leisure; tell us who it is that you suppose to be Berry? - I cannot say now; this is Berry in the green coat; I would not wish to swear to him now; I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is Berry? - That black complexioned one in the green coat and yellow waistcoat. I took him after the gentlemen horsemen had been there, and before they came in. I was surrounded with the mob, for I was near the man's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it you came to the house? How soon after the mob being collected? - Very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing when you came to the house, before the light horse came there? - They were tearing the house to pieces, and some of them in the house, breaking the windows; but who they were in the house, or did it, I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were in the whole? - A great number, and they were like lions, they roared like lions, and extremely riotous.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were? - I dare say there was a hundred; I cannot positively tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170037"/>Q. You say the light horse came and dispersed part of the mob? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you apprehended Berry? - The light horse had been there and dispersed part of the mob, and I myself was then released from the mob, for I was before surrounded with them; then I withdrew from the door a little way; I was nearer to the door of the Sash public house before; and when I thought the mob was pretty well dispersed, I then went towards the Sash again; there were a great many people there then; I got pretty near the sash to the mob, and I saw the prisoner Berry, come from the mob; I says to him, what have you been at? I really don't know what answer he gave me; but I told him, seeing him come from that mob, he should go with me to the watch-house; and in taking him along from there to take him to the watch-house, I met Mr. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress was the prisoner in at that time? - In a working dress; not as he is now. Mr. Wheeler came up to him, and said, I will swear that is the first man that entered my house; the prisoner declared that he was in bed, and he got out of his own bed to join the mob; I asked Mr. Wheeler to aid and assist me; and we took him to the watch-house, and there we secured him; that is all I know of Berry; I know no harm the young man did, because I never see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We are pretty well ac- quainted with you in this Court? - O yes!</p>
               <p>Q. At this time, you say, the young man did nothing? - I did not see him.</p>

            You are certain as to his answer, that he got out of bed to join the mob? - He told me so.</p>

            Now try your hand a little in answering this question; might not be say that he was called out of his bed on the alarm of fire, and how that he had got into this mob where he supposed the fire was? - Upon my oath, he did not, nor nothing like it; but the very words that I have expressed.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the words you have expressed was fact, and his being called out of bed was not true? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am a peace officer belonging to Worship-street police office. I was in Moorfields watch-house, Wednesday, the 20th of August, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called out from thence? - I was not; Mr. Hansel and I went out together, to go to Mr. Wheeler's; we got there about half past ten; I called to Mr. Wheeler; and Mr. Wheeler came to me, and I observed the house all quiet, and nothing broke; when I went in I told Mr. Wheeler to get any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170038"/>that he had of any property to take it away, because I heard the mob were coming to his house; with that Mrs. Wheeler came down with the child in her lap and went away; I went out with Mrs. Wheeler, but another officer conducted her away with the child; I went back again to fetch Mr. Wheeler, about half past ten, it was all in about three or four minutes; when I returned I called out to Mr. Wheeler, why don't you come down, they are all a coming; just as we came out at the door, Mr. Wheeler had a little desk in his arm, as he came out at the door, one was in long clothes, and the other in short clothes, in a waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the man? - It is this man in blue; I believe his name is Todd, I believe; but I was so bad the next day that I fainted away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other? - I don't recollect the other. The other man said to Mr. Wheeler as he came out, here comes a crimp; I said, he is no crimp; then he says, d-mn you, you are a crimp; and I turned away to look for some of my fellow servants, and I had my staff in my hand, and I held my staff this way, and I turned about to look for some of my brother officers that I expected from the watch-house, and I had not gone ten yards from the door, when I was knocked down with a brick bat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who threw that brick bat? - I thought it was Todd, because I saw nobody behind me but Todd; I was quite flunned with the fall, and I catched hold of a man behind me by his apron, and it happened to be Todd, and I pulled myself up by him, and I laid my head over his shoulder, and I had a cutlass in my pocket, and the handle of it came out, and they said, d-mn his eyes, he is a crimp, he has got a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man at all active in the riot? - I did not see him active at all, only he was in the riot.</p>

            That man that you laid hold of, was the man that came into Wheeler's house? - He was, and I saw nobody behind me; in a minute's time they all came flocking about the house, a great crowd, and the windows were all knocked out.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you suppose there were? - I was not sensible, because I was knocked down the second time and carried away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had raised yourself from the ground, by taking hold of his apron, what followed then? - Another man with a white jacket came and gave me a blow upon my head, which brought me to the ground senseless; then I could do no more; I was carried to the watch-house; in a short time he was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons brought there? - Yes, Mr. Harper brought a man there, and that was the man that came first up to Wheeler's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides that man that Harper brought, what other man came? - The next man that was brought was Todd; I thought I knew him, that is the man, I believe that cut me.</p>

            Had you any doubt that that was the man that you had had the scuffle with? - I could not tell; I said, at the time, that was the man that cut me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have told us that when Todd was brought to the watch-house, that you even then could not tell exactly whether he was the same man or not? - Not exactly; I said he was the man; I got up and could hardly stand, and I said then, here is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you was very much hurt? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And although you have been in this employment a number of years, yet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170039"/>you was so much affected that even the next day you fainted away, when the matter came on again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say likewise there were at least two men dressed in the same way you have described, and it is natural enough that at that time of night you could not distinguish one man from another, but all that you speak of with tolerable certainty, is, that if it was Todd that served you so, he permitted you to rest on his shoulder, to support yourself? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you take on yourself to swear that you do or do not know the man positively? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Although you did at the magistrate's say, on your first impression, you cannot keep to that positive evidence, but you have since altered your opinion? - And I desired the constable to look at his jacket, to see whether there was any blood on it, and there was not.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough; I was called out on the 20th of August, about ten o'clock, I got up and went out; I was told there was a riot in Old-street Road; when I got to the Lying-in Hospital, I was informed that the mob had gone up the City-road; we went to Mr. Wheeler's house with the guard, or at least with the volunteers; they drew up in front of the house, I did not go into the house, but the first person I see come out of the house was a servant of Mr. Wheeler's; I took him by the collar and asked him what he did there? I was informed he was the servant of the house; I then let him go. The next person I saw was Todd, the prisoner at the bar, in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - I did not see him acting; he opened the door to come out of Mr. Wheeler's house, he shut the door after him, and I took him into custody, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person in the way to the watch-house, that you had any conversation with at all? - Some person assisted, but who it was, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Wheeler at all? - I did not see him at all till the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Todd do any thing at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Rainbow? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation take place between Rainbow, Todd, and any body in you presence, in the watch-house? - No, except Mr. Blackiter, when I brought him into the watch-house, he got up and said, that is the villain that cut me; his head was bleeding. He was then locked up, and I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Slater, you told my lord and gentlemen of the jury, that Todd was not active in the least, that he merely came out of the house, shut the door, and that you laid hold of him; I believe Blackiter, in fact, had fixed on somebody else? - He had, as I was informed.</p>

I replied, I am not an officer, and therefore I don't know that I can take charge, but I will take him to the watch-house safe; before I took him out of the yard I observed he had but one shoe on, I asked him how he came to have but one shoe only? he observed to me that he had lost the shoe on the top of the tiles, the tiles of the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the shed to Mr. Wheeler's? - I cannot say, the shed is between the two houses, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, the prisoner Ridley was in Mr. Wheeler's yard? - No, in the yard of Mr. Holder, the next door but one or two; I asked him how he came over there? he observed that he had got a fore leg, and the horses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170041"/>came down so fast, he was afraid they would hurt his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he got into that yard? - He said he got over the tiles, for fear his legs should be hurted by the horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. With respect to Ridley, the yard that he was taken in, was Mr. Holder's? - He was in Mr. Holder's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you know nothing at all of it, no more than what you heard from Mr. Holder? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a house or two from the Sash? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that there is a narrow passage next Mr. Holder's? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that in the account he gave you of his having lost one of his shoes, that he had a sore leg? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that his shoes was slip shod? - No, he did not, he said that coming to see what was the matter, he heard the house coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. That he must have heard in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the reason he gave for going away, was for fear the horses should hurt his leg? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And that in making his escape, he went down this passage, and he got on the tiles to secure himself from the crowd? - I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. These tiles adjoins this passage? - No, not on the passage side, they are on the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. All you know about Biggett, is that he readily agreed to go with you? - He did, in the passage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In the passage you described to be next to the stair case? - He was just at the stair case before he came to the tap-room.</p>

I do not recollect that he made me any answer what was in the cask; on which I perceived one of them, not the prisoner, drawing round behind me, and I had a small sword in my hand, and with which I struck on one of the casks, in order to stave it, to satisfy myself perfectly what liquor was in it, and could not the first time, and I saw then a peg in one of the casks, which had been bored, I suppose in order that they might drink a little, to refresh themselves by the way; on my stopping down to pull out the peg out of this cask, in order to prove the quality of the liquor, to make the seizure, they immediately struck me with both their hands with these large sticks on my head; I was obliged to strike the cask the second time before I could stave it, and the li<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170046"/>quor rushed out in a very violent manner, by the time I had done this I had received several violent blows on my head, and across my arm, on which I said to the prisoner, do you mean to murder me? and I attempted to run, and fell to the ground, and they continued beating me in that manner across the head, and I put my arms over my head laying on the ground, I attempted to get up three times, and did get up on my feet three times, and I was scarcely up but what I received blows that I fell to the ground again; on which I entreated them not to murder me, in the most supplicating manner I could, and I thought they said, when I was laying on the ground, d-mn him, it is too good for him, and they continued beating me till I was quite senseless, and I laid some time in that manner, and when I came to myself I began to get up, I put my hand up to my eyes and found the blood, and I had two or three cuts in my head, cuts three or four inches; it is impossible for me to describe what I suffered on that occasion, I attempted to rise, and I perceived the prisoners at a distance, I thought they were turning towards me, on which I got on my feet, and made the best of my way to a little house, not far from the place, where a Mrs. French resides, on which I prayed the woman to let me in, for the door was fast, she looked out of the window, and said, who are you? - I told her my name was Collings, that I was a supervisor, and how I had been used, and she admitted me into the house, which I was like to saint going in, and had liked to fall against the wall when the woman opened the door; when she let me in to the best of my recollection, she first got a chair for me, and afterwards she got a bed down, and threw it on the floor, and I laid on that bed the remainder of that evening, when I was carried up stairs by two or three gentlemen farmers in the neighbourhood, I was quite unable to move my hand, or stand upon my feet; I was in that situation, suffering most excruciating pain for four days, before the doctor would permit me to be removed home to my own house, at Lewes; my arms were dreadfully bruised indeed, so that I have not the use of this hand to this day, a bone was broke in this hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you got to Lewis before you was capable of pursuing your business? - Upwards of nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - I have not the least doubt but that is the man, if I was to die to morrow; when I arrested him it was at a little cottage, at his own house, and the man seemed very much alarmed, and screamed exceedingly, I said to him, Mich, how could you think of using a fellow creature as you did me; on which he said, I am very sorry for it, I have had no peace of mind ever since, the other began first, or else I should not have done it, you know I was running away.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you fell, was the prisoner at the bar the man that struck you after that? - A great many times, I had so many blows that I cannot remember, I was black entirely from head to foot, I was all over bruises.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, I went with Page, Harper, Ray, and Mr. Harper's son, we went to a public house in St. Giles's, and we waited there all but Page, until Page came back to us, and told us he had bought some whites, and then we went in company together to the Plume of Feathers, in King-street, Seven Dials, a public house, and I says to Page, point out the man; and he pointed the prisoner out, without his hat, from a number that were present, Harper being close along side of me, I said, I have a warrant to take you into custody, I am a king's officer; we took him into custody, and conveyed him to a coach, I did not search him, Harper did.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer, I was of this party, in apprehending the man, I did not search him in the house, there were several people in the house, and we were glad to have him out of the house, I did not search him till I got him to prison, there I searched him; when I came to the prison gates, I believe the gates were open, and my son was in the coach with me, he went out of the coach first, and the prisoner at the bar next, there was another prisoner in the coach, a woman, that we took from the same house, and she had a young child, I was careful of getting the poor woman out of the coach, on account of the child, and thereby the man, the prisoner at the bar, was inside of the gates before I was out with the woman, and when I got inside of the gates, I saw the prisoner at the bar shoving his hands behind him, at the same time one of the turnkeys was close to him, I says to the turnkey, what is that fellow a shoving? I says to him, if you do any thing that is wrong I will get you punished for it, as sure as you are born; I then takes the turnkey and prisoner at the bar both into the lodge, to the candle, I laid hold of the turnkey's hand, and in the turnkey's hand were all these shilling and six-pences, seventy-five six-pences, and one shilling; I then searched the prisoner; on his right hand side breeches pocket, there were eighteen or nineteen guineas in gold, I believe, I am not quite sure, and four half guineas, and I think a twenty pounds bank note, and I found about three shilling and six-pence good money in his waistcoat pocket; as I was not searching for good money or bank notes, all the money was put into the hands of the keeper of the prison, by his desire; after my searching him, my son, who is not an officer, was there, and he got these halfpence from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. On the person of this man you did not find even a single piece bad? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the turnkeys of the New Prison; the coach came up to the door, and young Mr. Harper came out and the prisoner, I saw the prisoner go behind the door and put something down, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170049"/>to him and took something up, and Harper came to take it out of my hand, he put it down behind the door, behind a box; I have never seen it since Harper had it from me in the lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put it down on the ground? - No, on the table, Harper said, what has he been doing there? I said, he has put down this; he said, give it me; I said, I would not, come to the light and I will give it you; and I went into the lodge and gave it him there.</p>
               <p>Harper. This is the bundle I took from this man's hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to the Turnkey. It was very dark? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him put it down? - I see him put something down.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told the officer immediately of it? - Mr. Harper came in, and I told him what I had got was in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him so directly, remember Harper is in hearing? - He asked me to give it him, and I said, come to the light and I will give it to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect he has been examined before? - Yes, but what I speak is truth.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of July last, Saturday morning, at half after eight o'clock in the morning, I went to this public house to meet Mr. Pendegraft according to appointment the day before, I called for a pint of ale and waited for the space of an hour, till I was quite out of patience; I then spoke to the landlord, Mr. Mullein, and he says, you may as well go into the parlor; I went to the parlour, and I told the young woman, whom I understood was doing business for Pendegraft, I should be glad to speak to you, and she came out to me, and I told her what I said to Pendegraft, and she said, I can do nothing just now, I have got no whites, she said she expected Mr. Pendegraft presently, and I went and sat down again, I sat there for the space of half an hour or more, then I went into the parlour and sat there some time with them, where she was very busy serving out this money, there were some score of customers, at last as I was sitting in the parlour, she asked me how many six-pences I would have? I told her I would have as many as she could let me have, I left it to her, I told her I wished to have some of all sorts, and she gave me eight shillings and twenty-four sixpences, and sixty halfpence, and I gave her half a guinea in gold for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Page, in the first place did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - Never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she is the wife of Pendegraft, don't you know that? - Just as much as you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that she is the wife of the last prisoner Pendegraft? - No, I do not,</p>

            . Did not you threaten me, and force me to marry you? Did not you say that you would make away with yourself? Yes, my dear, you did, you are my husband.</p>
               <p>Slark. I did not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You want that lady with the five thousand pounds fortune, that is all you want. I never have been married but once, and that was at Paris, with Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170053"/>Wettenhall; I was never married to Edkins. The reason that that woman appears here, is in consequence of an advertisement of so much reward if any body of the name of Wilson would appear. I would be glad to know her character, and how much money she had of Mr. Slark for doing this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Wilson. Pray how much money have you had of Mr. Slark? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. How much are you to have? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you married yourself? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never knew Mr. Slark had any thing, and I never asked him for a farthing of any thing, so help me God. And he worried me every day of my life to marry him; I knew he was nothing but an apprentice to his father,and therefore I had no fortune, and I could not marry him for the sake of fortune; and he knew what I was; it was no secret to him.</p>

On the 9th of July, I saw him at seven o'clock in the morning, in Covent-garden, he was passing the Hummums, the sash windows was open, there were two gentlemen sitting there, and he said, Sodomites; for God's sake, said I, don't say so, it is dangerous; says he d-mn your blood, what do I care, I will blow up for a sodomite, for half a farthing. Then we walked on as towards Hatton-street, as I was going that way home; and the prisoner said that he would go home along with me, for he must have some money of me; I said, I had none about me; he said, then I must go home for it, and he would go home with me, and if I did not give it him, he would go home and blow me up. I then, through fear, went and obtained three guineas; I thought he might stain my character in calling me a sodomite. I did not go home, I went near home and turned back again, and went to a public house, the Cock, on Snow-hill, that was where he waited, while I went for the three guineas; I did not go home for the three guineas, I went to a friend and borrowed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before you gave him any money? - He said, d-mn your blood, I must have some money; and he told me what he wanted it for, that he was going down to Barnet; he said, he must have the money, or he would say I was a sodomite. I went to Mr. Stevens, a person in the City, for the three guineas, he is not here, he is abroad at present. When I got the three guineas, I went back to the Cock public house, and I found the prisoner there waiting for it and I gave it to him; he said, he would see me again to-morrow, and he would return the money; I told him the consequence of doing what he did; he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170054"/>there would be nobody more hung for extorting money since the affair of judge Buller's son, for he was obliged to run away for bringing the men to trial, or words to that effect. I left him there at that time; I saw him again in about three days, as near as I can recollect; he sent for me to the Globe Tavern, in Hatton-Garden; I went there, and found the prisoner at the bar there; he was in the coffee room; there was nobody else there besides us two; he asked me to fit down; I refused it; he seemed very much offended; he asked me to drink; I refused it, but at last I did drink. He happened to turn his eyes round, and saw my partner at the door, through the glass; he asked me if that was my partner? I told him yes; says he, d-mn my eyes, I will blow him up too for a sodomite; I says to him, only consider the hazard you run, supposing he was to hear that; and he said, he must have some more money; he made use of the same words as before, he said, he would blow me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - I understood it was more to terrify, than what he intended to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that the effect of terrifying you, so as to part with your money? - Yes, it really had, to part with three guineas more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you three guineas with you then? - Yes, I had it in my pocket, but I went out to make him believe that I went out for it, because I had told him that I had none; he said, he should not think of gentlemen tradesmen not having money.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you mention this business to any body? - I did not mention it to any body till I had him apprehended, which was the next day or day after, when he sent for me again to the same public house; then he stood at the bar and asked me to drink; now says he, I have settled my business all but making a compliment to my attorney; and then he was taken up, and I mentioned the business to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned it to any body before you mentioned it to the justice? - No, nobody at all. He upbraided me then of being afraid of him; no, says I, I am not afraid, if I had I might have run away since the first time I see you; says he, if you had, I would have murdered you the first time I met you.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

               <p>Q. To Curran. How came she at your house? - She had asked me to let her come in, because I had known her so many years; and she said she had not lain in a bed for so long; I told her she might lay there for the present, but I should want my bed the next week, to get a shillings, to help keep my children, and by that time she might provide herself; she thanked me, and said, she was very much obliged to me.</p>

On Sunday, the first of June, my boarder, and the little boy went to church, and afterwards they went out to take a walk, and I was left at home by myself; I bolted my gate, and fastened the door, and went up stairs; it was about six o'clock, or after; I have a very good clock in the house; I went up stairs and put on a gown, and heard my door chink, and I went down and unbolted the door, and when I unbolted the door, the prisoner at the bar came in, and threw over my head a thing that was made to draw like a sish apron, it stunk very strong of salmon, it almost stifled me, then I tussled with her, and as I tussled with her, I heard the words, be quick, and then somebody came over, and struck me over the head two or three blows; I thought my eyes flew out of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose voice was it said be quick? - The prisoner's; and then I received the blows. Then I don't remember any more, but that I fell senseless against the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lay so? - I cannot tell; they tell me till it was near eight o'clock. When my boarder came home, she found me laying on the stairs; I did not recover till my boarder came home, and called several people in, and they thought I was dead. When I came to myself, I missed my ring off my finger and my pocket turned inside out; I had half a guinea, and half a crown, and one shilling in them, and I believe, two or three halfpence besides; the silver and gold were in one pocket, and the halfpence in the other; I had several more things in them, but they were found on the ground; I am certain I had that money in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>

            How long had you had the rings that you have been talking about? - I suppose I might have wore them twenty or thirty years. One was a wedding ring; the other was a ring that I bought in London.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you buy that ring? - Yes, and more that I have in my house.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you take up this woman and charge her with the robbery? - I am sure I don't know the day of the month it was now. I had a doctor to attend me; I was not able to get out of my bed a great while. The high constable took her at Edmonton about three weeks after.</p>

            How soon did you apply to a magistrate, or to a constable to take up this woman? - When I was in bed; and he said, I could not do it till I was able to go myself, and she still kept abusing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact you did not go before a justice till three weeks after? - I think it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner at the bar stay in the parish all that time where she had been before? - Yes, and put me at defiance, and said I could not do any thing with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a little quarrel with this woman, had not you? - She was always abusing me; I have bought sish of her many times out of fear.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a sish woman, is not she? - She is.</p>
               <p>Q. I am afraid that your cat played some tricks with her sish, on which she threatened to cut your cat's throat? - No, it was mine she threatened to cut.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this have not you exhibited articles of the peace against her? - Yes, but before that came on they did me this mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you never indicted the prisoner at the last session? - I was not able, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another person you charged, a Mrs. English? - But that was on another affair, that happened last November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take up Mrs. English, as well as Mrs. Freebody? - Yes; and I light of my mischief on the Sunday before the session came on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you feel it go from you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it go? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did these men surround you? where they going one way, or in different directions? - They were going the same way, as I went up Cheapside towards St. Paul's, or Newgate-street; there were some before me, and some behind me, there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body touch you besides the man that gave you the blow? - Not to strike or hurt my person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other people push you about at all, besides the man that gave you the shove on your left shoulder? - They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the blow before your watch was taken, or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watch go instantly on receipt of the blow, or some time after? - Instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you after that? - The prisoner at the bar and the two that I conceived to be at the front of me, immediately ran across the way, the way between the coaches; I immediately called stop thief! at that instant, Woodman, a constable came up; he asked me what was the matter? I told him I was robbed of my watch; after I had called out stop thief, the prisoner was obliged to cross the way back again, on account of the mob, and I saw him at the top of Ironmonger-lane, after he had past the coaches, the same side of the way, where I had been robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this nearer to St. Paul's than where you was robbed, or farther distant? - Alderman Boydell's is at the corner of Ironmonger-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was near the same place where you was robbed? - It was. After he was stopped they took him to the Compter; Woodman stopped him, I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do which you know the man was dressed? - I came that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you kick about him, to know that he was SAILER sworn. that you saw at Ironmonger-lane you the shove on your shoulder? - I know his face, I had seen him in the it man before, but not to know him personally.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing else that you venture to swear to him by but his face? - That is the principal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on or not? - He had a hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a round hat or not? - I cannot tell positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps light at this time? - It was getting duskish, I don't believe there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man speak to you before he was taken? - Not before.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the man, is that the man? - I am certain of it; the next day another party (Hyams) was taken, who has turned King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are positive to his per son; I want to know whether you was as positive to this man's person before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170060"/>you knew any thing of Hyams! - Yes, I was as positive, I have never conversed with Hyams on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether before Hyam's account, you was positive that the man that you saw at the corner of Ironmonger-lane, was the person that gave you the blow? - Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I should think the observation you could make would be very little indeed; you told the learned judge that whether he had a round hat on or a cocked hat, you cannot positively say? - I don't recollect that.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you come from to get into Bishopsgate-street? - From Petticoat-lane, Cox's-square leads into Petticoat-lane, and from there we went through Catharine Wheel-alley, that brought us into Bishopsgate-street, from there we came into Cornhill, we came towards the change, then we met the gentleman, says Stokes, here is a sucky gorge.</p>

            Was you, or was you not in Leadenhall-street that evening? - We never were near it that evening, though the boy said that he followed us from Leadenhall-market. Then we met the gentleman that lost his watch between the Change and the Mansion-house, us four were walking along talking of one thing or another, Mr. Glanfield was going up towards St. Paul's, and Stokes, says, there is a sucky gorge,(meaning a drunken man,) with that Stokes got before him, and we three were walking behind the gentleman, going along that way we missed Stokes. I thought we had lost him, we followed the gentleman from the Poultry compter till we came to Ironmonger-lane, then Stokes came and crossed the road from Ironmonger-lane, and ran against the gentleman, as we were behind the gentleman, and said to us, I have got it, (meaning that he had got the watch, as I thought,) with that there the gentleman did not miss it directly, he walked from the corner of Ironmonger-lane, to the corner of Queen-street, and then he missed his watch, he then said, I have lost my watch by some person, and he did not know by who, and he catched hold of a strange man that was going along the street, and then he made a catch to catch hold of me, and I asked him what he wanted with me? he said, he had lost his watch this instant, by somebody, by whom he did not know, and Morobus happened to come past, and he catched hold of him likewife, and let me go, and he challenged him with it, and he said he had lost his watch, and he believed he was one of them, a mob got round and he said that he had lost his watch, and by whom he did not know; and the prisoner said, that he was very willing to be searched, that he had no watch, nor knew of any watch, then the mob or constable took him to the Poultry compter; I did not stop to see, then I went on the opposite side of the way to the Poultry compter, and I met Stokes and Drew, I asked Stokes whether he saw the prisoner go into the Compter?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170063"/>he said, yes, he had, I asked him where the watch was? he said he had it safe enough, he had hid it somewhere, I told him to go back and fetch the watch, where he had hid it; and he went back, and I went back with him, he went then to a court opposite Ironmonger-lane almost, where there is a pastry-cooks at the corner, and he put his hand between some water tubs that were full of water for the sake of water for the horses, there are five or six, and Stokes took it out, and gave it to Drew, Stokes did, then we all three, me, Stokes and Drew, went and sold the watch for a guinea at Mrs. Lee's a silversmiths in Shoreditch, and we went and parted the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as the gentleman let you go, you made off? - No, I made the other side of the way from the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether the prisoner did not give the gentleman a blow or push? - He did not; Stokes ran against the gentleman and pushed the back of the gentleman against us two; the prisoner never touched him at all; I said the same before the Lord Mayor; the boy said, that he followed us from Leadenhall-street; and we were not in Leadenhall-street that night; and as for the prosecutor, he appeared to be rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told us it was duskish? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps light? - It was between.</p>
               <p>Q. Stokes had left you; you know you never saw him again till he came rushing against this gentleman? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You three had hold of each others arms? - I and the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>Q. Robus never put up his hand to strike? - He never did, if I was to die this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing at all about the watch being taken till it was over? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor took up a strange man first? - He did; he let him go and then he laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make sufficient observation to know whether the gentleman, the prosecutor, was drunk or sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sucky gorge? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner Robus any of the money? - I gave it to his sister to bring to him, on account that he was in trouble, because we went out together, I thought he was entitled to his there.</p>

               <p>Court. What business did you go out upon? - To see what we could get.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Robus take any part in this business at all? - No; neither did he know the robbery was committed, till Stokes ran past, and said, he had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Cheapside, just after the robbery, the gentleman was to much in liquor he laid hold of me, and Hyams, and several others that he came nigh, and then the mob came up, and he had me taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Will you say that you did not take hold of any body else? - I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Jury to Woodman. Was the prosecutor in liquor? - I really don't believe he was in liquor; he did not appear to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you ever been a witness before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is a forty pound on this man's conviction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hillier. The prosecutor did not appear to be perfectly sober, but so sober that he well knew what he said, because he told the exact story the next day.</p>
               <p>Court to Glanfield. Is it true that you never said you lost your watch till you got to King-street; did you give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170064"/>the account instantaneously or not? - Instantanecously.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Look at Hyams; was that man one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to Leadenhall market, did you see these people in Leadenhall-market, or was you coming from Leadenhall street? - I did; I see them all there.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the plate there? - A minute before. And I opened the street door and saw him at the bottom of the street; he was in China-street, and I thought he was looking towards me, and I told a person that was just opposite me, to go after that man in black, that he stole plate from our house, his name is William Reynolds.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of August, between three and four in the afternoon, I was going up China-street, and I heard a woman call out stop that man in black, for he has stole our plate; on which I turned me round, and saw a man run at the bottom of China-street, whom I judged to be the person, and I pursued on Francis-street, and I saw him at the bottom of China-mews, and I gave the alarm to some coachmen, and they pursued him, and I ran down Gower-street, and he was stopped in Gower-mews, in Gower-street, and I came up and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170065"/>hold of him, I took hold of him by the arm on one side, and another man by the other, and we brought him back to to the house, from whence he had taken the property, and when we brought him into the parlour, he went on his knees and begged for mercy; on which the lady, being much frightened, said, do you think I will forgive such a man as you, that robs my house while I am out of the way? On that he got up and delivered the plate out of his inside pockets, and I took it up, and it has been in my custody ever since; it is here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These was my property; they are the same that I lost from my house.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from him was you? - About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the place immediately? - No, I kept in pursuit after him till he was taken, I did not see what he threw down till I returned with the prisoner, which might be full twenty minutes after, or more, and there were three planes in that place, two where I saw him take some thing out of his pocket, and the other at some little distance. The plow I did not see thrown down, but three of the moulding planes I did; Haylock was with me when I picked them up.(Produced.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner Griffiths. Is it a likely thing that I would be had enough to take away the coat when I went in for a pint of beer? the coat was in the bundle, when I went into the parlour, and this very man would not go into the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutrix. Did you serve me with the pint of beer? - The pint of beer was drawn, but there was no time to have the beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about the coat than the man in the moon,</p>

             had taken? and she said, yes; and I never saw her from that time, till Saturday evening I saw her at Grosvenor-gate, I went with Mrs. Farmer there; there she acknowledged that she had taken the gown, apron, handkerchief, and two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take a pair of stockings one day when you went to the Hospital? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to speak the truth, and no more. I lodged with Mrs. Farmer one week; she is a very bad woman: one night, when she had two men on the bed with her, she sent me for a pot of beer; when I comes back, the door was locked; that woman the next day, took away a pair of stockings and handkerchief, and took them away, and desired me never to let Mrs. Farmer know; and she sold rags, and put the money in her own pocket; she has only done this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170069"/>because I would not bring a parcel of men into her house, and do as she would wish. She cannot bring a witness out of the parish that will give her a good character; she, at night, has two or three men with her, and so has the other woman that is with her likewise, and that is the woman, I can be upon my oath, that took the things away. I have not been in London long, I have come from Richmond; I did not know but what I should be tried at the Hall, and so I have not sent for any witnesses here.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lodge at the trunk maker's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lock the money up at the trunk maker's? - I left the money at the trunk maker's, because the trunk maker's house was very near the house where I thought to move; the trunk maker did not know that I had left the money in the trunk, I had just bought the trunk, and left it at the trunk maker's, the trunk maker gave me leave.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money? - In an hour after I left the money at the house</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come back again to examine the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Did you suppose that your money was very safe, when you left it at the trunk maker's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you return immediately almost to examine whether it was safe or not? - Because the landlord where I live, desired me to bring the trunk to his house, and said it would be very safe there.</p>
               <p>Court. Where, to the new or old lodgings? did you look into your trunk, and miss the money? - Yes; I went back to the shop, and the people of the house told me that the man at the bar had been to the trunk, and opened the trunk, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. And that led you to look? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner before? - Yes, I knew him a few days before; I happened to meet him, and he was my interpreter to many places where I went, and as I had the money in my pocket, he advised me to put the money in the trunk, as it was safer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you put it in? - Yes, he was present, but I did what I could to put the money in the trunk without being seen by the prisoner, but I don't know whether the prisoner see me or not.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the paper the money was in, and the money is certainly mine, because that man had no money of his own, I had given him half a guinea the day before like this.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Sunnock. I know the prisoner at the bar, I know him to be the person that came with this man to buy the trunk, it was on a Saturday last month, about the 16th, the prosecutor locked it, and took the key with him, and paid for it, they came and brought some clothes two or three hours after, and put them in; they brought it about eleven o'clock, they brought the shoes about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who locked the shoes up? - The prosecutor, he pulled a parcel out of his pocket, and put it in the shoes, and he took the key; about half an hour after the prisoner came with two keys, as my mistress told me, I did not see him, I was called to take the key out of the trunk, and I took the key out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same key that you sold with the trunk? - I did not take any notice about that, I was obliged to after the lock before I could get it out, I don't think it could be the same key. When I got it out, he went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. These locks are not of the very best manufactory of course? - Some sort are.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you and your master, and the little boy, has had any conversation about this business? - None at all, since we were at the justice's.</p>

I know the prisoner at the bar perfectly well; he came to my house the 3d of July, to the best of my remembrance; I would not take to myself to say it is the day, but it was the early part of the month; I think it was between the hours of twelve and one in the day time; he came to my house and gave me an order for two gallons of cappillaire in an hamper, and to be directed to lady Allen, of Finchley; accordingly I told him it should be fulfilled; he asked me the price? I told him; we agreed on the price, the price was twelve shillings a gallon. Accordingly after agreeing on the price, I says, I don't know that I can send it to day; he said, it would do tomorrow; I thanked him for the opportunity, being busy at the time; it was to be sent to the Horse and Groom, Finchley. Accordingly he tendered me a note; I took the note in this manner and looked at it; this is the note he gave me, to the best of my knowledge. He says, if you don't like the note you may take the money on delivery of the goods; I was not satisfied myself with not taking the money till the delivery of the goods, I rather preferred taking the note, therefore, without any doubt took the note, preferring it to running the risk of the money; I kept it till the next morning. On my bed, in the night, something struck me that the note that I had taken was a bad one; the next morning I sent my son to Sir

               <p>Q. How happened that? It does not occur to you? - It does not.</p>
               <p>Q. It would be very material for you to prove that he was the person, and your son was not.

               <p>Q. Did you ask him to come here? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was this? - He is a dark man, black hair, black beard; he is quite swarthy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he likely to be taken for this man in light hair? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A very different man by your description.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alby to Richard Ramsden. Did not you tell Peter Cattipodi that the person who came and got this cappillaire, was a swarthy man? - I gave him no answer at all, for I told him I could tell him nothing about it, for I did not take notice; he asked me if he had not such breeches on? I told him I was not able to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So he asked you a great many questions, what sort of a man be was? and you told them you could not tell him as you said in your first examination and they tried to make you do it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I work at bricklayer's labouring; I came from a job belonging to my master, the 30th of July, to our cellar for some stuff, and I heard a rustling noise come into the passage, over my master's cellar; it is in Castle-street, Holborn; the passage runs between Castle-street and Dyer's Buildings; this was about five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from Leather-lane? - Not much more than across the street. I heard this noise come from Castle-street towards my master's door; and I heard a voice, d-mn your eyes, here they come in Castle-street; and I ran and looked up out of the cellar into my master's yard, and a man came and dropped a bundle, which afterwards I opened, and found it to be three counterpanes; and then he took hold of the door and pulled it to, and latched it, after he had dropped the bundle in the passage; he shut himself out, and he went out of the yard; he shut the bundle inside of the door, in the yard; when I saw him pull the door after him, I came out of the cellar as soon as I could, and I opened the door; there was him and another, as I supposed, to be just at the beginning of a run from the door, for Dyer's Buildings, and one of them said, d-mn your eyes, you have put them in the wrong place, and they turned back, both of them turned towards the door, and I pushed the door to as far as I could, and the force of the two against it, I could not push it so as to latch it; I was inside, they were outside, in the passage; I said to them, what have you put this bundle here for? I called out for master's clerk, and they ran off; he came down, and I took up the bundle and opened it, and found it to be to be three counterpanes, as they call them. When I opened the bundle, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170077"/>tied it up agian, and gave it up to my master's clerk.</p>

            Who were the people that brought the bundles in this way? - That is the man in the red coat that laid the bundle down, Tilbury; I cannot tell who the other man was, because this man that was nearest to inside of the door I could see him, but the other that was outside I could not take notice of.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had these counterpanes, how did you get at the men? - As I went with the stuff to where my bricklayer was at work, I was turning into a court into Fetter-lane, and I saw a publican that keeps the White Hart, at the corner of King's Head-court, Fetter-lane, and I was telling him what happened in master's yard, while I was away, and this man, Tilbury, came up, and said, I have kicked up one of their heels just now, I knowed him directly, and I asked him do you know one? says I, so with that I went up with the stuff to the bricklayer, and I went back to my master's yard, and there was this man in his shirt sleeves in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the man if you knew him? - I brought the bricklayer down along with me to the White Hart, and the publican told us that this man shot into Holborn like a dart, and I found him in my master's yard, demanding these things in his shirt sleeves, and when I first saw him he had on a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the yard then? - Two clerks and a footman, and one or two of the labourers; I told our clerks to stop him, when he turned about and saw me, then he says, I will go and get my master and he shall prove the property; and I said, you are the man that put the property down, I will swear to it; and then he got off, and I did not see him again till Thursday week following.</p>

            How came the other man taken? - In about a quarter of an hour he sent two men, they said he sent them, they came in and demanded the things as he did, Coleman was one of the two that came, him and the other man was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the counterpanes again? Was there any thing over them? - Nothing, over them but a piece of jack line I made no mark on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. What are you? - I have worked at bricklayer labouring for this seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you are a very faithful attentive servant? - I have a right to be so, my master pays me very well for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at work abroad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You came home for some stuff and instead of attending to get the stuff you heard some conversation, and then you ran up to see what this conversation was? Was that the usual way you attend your master's business? - I ran up to see what the bundle was, I saw it in the yard from the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you how you came to know it was there? - I saw it put down by a man in the yard, while I was in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after this you met the prisoner at the bar in the street? - He came up and stood where I was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not stop him then? - I was unable, after falling down the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. Could not this landlord have taken them into custody? - I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you ask him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170078"/>Q. I believe you told the prisoner at the bar, that this man was foolish in running away? - I told the publican so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Tilbury by at the time? - I knowed him to be one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say they were fool sif you knew him to be one? - I was telling the publican, and he came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mention this if Tilbury was by? - I thought he might come back to demand the things, and then there was somebody would stop him; a man in many instances may not have in his power to do what he would wish; and besides, how did I know but what that man might spend more money in the publican's house than ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think then the landlord would have refused you? - They tell me it is not a landlord's business, and one customer is as good as another.</p>

On Monday, July the 21st, the prisoner Coleman, and another, came into Mr. Norris's yard, and another man, that is not here present, he is outside of the door, to demand three counterpanes; I asked him, from what authority he came? Tilbury had come first to demand them, but I had suspicion that he did not belong to them, and he said, he would go and get his master; I asked him whose they were? and the other man said, that he was master of the cart, and his name was John Rose; and I said, I did not know that, and I sent a labourer out to see if such a cart was standing as he said, at the end of Leather-lane; on that I refused to give him them, and I sent for an officer from Hatton-garden, and they were both taken into custody; the other man turned evidence; I delivered the things into the hands of the officer, and he took them before the magistrate, at Hatton-garden.</p>

Then you come here to save the prosecution of yourself; you must tell us the whole truth; how long have you known the prisoners? - I never was in their company before, I never knew any one of them, only by sight; I was standing at the back door of the Swan public house, in Field-lane, I saw Tilbury and Coleman coming down the passage; Tilbury came up to the door and says to the man that keeps the house, the things is good now; with that I went up to ask what they were; they said, they were three counterpanes, and they said, if I went after them, and said I was master of the cart, I might get them; they said they had dragged them out of a cart just by Leather-lane, Tilbury said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of Coleman? - Yes; I had got on a silk handkerchief, and Tilbury proposed to let me have his white one, because it would make me look more like the master of the cart; I have got the handkerchief now in my possession; then Coleman and I went up Holborn, and as I went up Holborn, Coleman told me that he was not with him when they were stole; he took me to the place where they were, and went in first, and says, here is my master, with that I followed in afterwards, and they asked me if I was the master of the cart? I said no, I said I was the master's son, with that they said they should detain us, and send for an officer; and we were detained.</p>

               <p>I am headborough of St. Luke's parish. I was on duty at the watch-house the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170083"/>21st of July, the prosecutor was brought to me for quarrelling with the watchman; he appeared very much in liquor; I could not get out of him where he lived, nor any thing else; I was obliged to put him in the Cage till the next morning. About one o'clock the prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house by the watchman, as a disorderly person in the streets; the prosecutor was brought between eleven and twelve; the prisoner came about one, in company with another.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he, drunk or sober? - Sober. I told him it was troublesome times, it was not proper to be out that time of the morning; I searched him, and asked him if any body knew him to give him a character? and I would let him go; the watchman came and I let him go. About three o'clock I took him again, with some lead about him; I searched him and found a knife and key, and seven farthings on him; I returned him that money, but the key and knife I kept; I then put him in the Cage, where the prosecutor was for an assault. At twelve o'clock the same day, I took them both down to Worship-street; the prosecutor told me in the coach, before the watchman, that he had lost his watch, twelve shillings in money, and his buckles broke, and he shewed me his buckles there; I said, have you really lost the things; he seemed to smile, and said, yes. I have; the prisoner made answer and said, d-mn me, you will think that I have it presently; I said, there was nobody else could have it, if he had lost them. I took them to the office and called out Blackiter, and we took them to a lock-up-room to search the prisoner, and the first time we found nothing, but the second time we found the watch up the sleeve of his coat; it was a tortoise-shell watch case outside; Blackiter has the watch. In the presence of me, he says to the other, d-mn me, if I had known your buckles had been wedge(meaning silver) you should never have had them any more. I have something else to say: While the prisoner was in custody, the man was very unhappy about the watch; he says, I will make the officer find the watch, for putting in the thief along with me; with that I went back to the place, and searched all about the place, and did not find any thing, and we returned back, and searched him again and found the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You very fairly stated that the prosecutor was extremely drunk? - Indeed he was persectly drunk.</p>

He said nobody but the prisoner at the bar; I said to Gass, we had better search the prisoner at the bar; and we went and searched him, and found eighteen-pence on him, in silver, but no watch; and I sent Gass back to the watch-house, for fear the watch was there; and when Gass came back we searched him again, and found the watch, we took his coat off, and we found the watch rolled up in his sleeve; I have kept the watch till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Blackiter, how long have you been an officer? - Ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. In that time you must have searched a great many people, in the course of your profession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you searched the first time, and had not the good fortune to find the watch? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched him in the usual way I suppose. How much time might elaple between the first and second examination? - Half an hour, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prosecutor was extremely drunk? - He seemed very ill used when I see him.</p>

            Now, you say, the second search was half an hour after the first search, and you mean to have these gentlemen believe that you, who has been an officer ten or eleven years, did not make your search in the usual way the first time? - We did the first time, but did not take off his coat.</p>

            Then if Mr. Gass has been saying so in Court, you never heard it before? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about this business altogether? - I have had none; I did not want any conversation.</p>
               <p>Court to Gass. Was this watch delivered to you by this drunken man the over night? - No, nothing at all was delivered to me. The officer was in a very great hurry when he searched him the first time, having business to do in the office.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackiter. Had you the care of the buckles as well as of the watch? - No, the prosecutor has the buckles himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the silver buckles, they are mine, I know them by the mark and pattern; they are the buckles I had in my shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long had you had them? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark that you can swear to them but the pattern? - No, no other than that I swear that the buckles are mine. This piece has S. on it; I put it on about twelve months ago, to know one side from the other, to put the straps in right.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you buy these buckles new when you bought them? - Yes, I did, It is a cross.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Just now you told me that you should know it by an S. which does not appear? - I made a mistake, it is a cross.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you mean the cross when you said the S. or do you mean a separate and different mark? - I meant the cross.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On this night, what I saw first and foremost was, Mr. Steward, he was very much in liquor, like a mad man, and was obliged to be carried into the Cage by hands and feet, the officer of the night said they had got a mad man in the watch-house, and asked me to come in to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - I don't know, he could not stand, he was very obstreperous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about his watch the next day? - I did. When in the coach, he said, that he thought the officer had his money, and likewise his watch; and the prisoner made answer and said, d-mn me, I suppose you think I have the watch; and the prisoner was searched, and the first time he did not find the watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have sent to none of my friends, because that I knew I was innocent.

               <p>I had the money taken out of my pocket, and I suspected the prisoner, and I took her up, and delivered her to the watchman; there were two of them. The other one picked up this one's patten, which she throws off her feet to run up a court, with the money; the other one I took her to the watch-house first, to secure her, to find out this; and I came back, whereabouts I had lost my money in the street, and there I found the other one, (I live at No. 15, Wigmore-street, Cavendish-square) I took her by the hand, and held her, and charged the watchman with her; the watchman took her to the watch-house. On Monday morning, she went to Marlborough-street. and she offered to pay me the money, and his Majesty would not let her, she offered to pay me the same money I lost, which was one half crown, one shilling, and six pence; the magistrate said, he durst not do it, to let her make it up.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she get your money? - The prisoner dipped her hand into my waistcoat pocket, while she was discoursing with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Oxford-road last Saturday night was a week, going up as far as a court that leads into Oxford-market; I met the two women, and the prosecutor stood talking to them; I could mention their names, I knew them, and I asked them how they were? With that he cursed his eyes, and said, he had been looking for me these two hours; he said, I had robbed him of three guineas, and he would take me to the watch-house. I went with him to the justice's on Monday morning; and he said, I had robbed him of half a crown, one shilling, and six-pence, and he took me over to the public house, and said, if I would give him three shillings, he would make it up; with that I pawned the handkerchief off my neck, and my apron, and sent home for an old bed gown, to give him the money; and he went to the justice's to get me discharged, and he sent me here. The witn sses that were there were two constables, that saw me give him the money, the three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know this woman before? - No, I never see her before.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you take her up? - In one hour, it did not exceed an hour before I came back from taking the other to the watch-house, and I found her coming out of the court that she ran into.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present when she offered you the money? - Yes, there was the watchman that I delivered her to; he is not here.</p>

I called this day at this shop for some property that I had in their hands; but he not having time to answer me, desired me to call a second time, which I did; coming out of there two men asked me to go with them to drink, I went with them, and was standing at the public house door when the prosecutor came in and searched the two men, but found nothing; he likewise searched me, and sees plainly I had nothing about me; there were many people in the house, and the man went away, and the waistcoat was found under the table; I can give no further or juster account. Honoured gentlemen, this is the truth, and I hope you will consider it as such, in pity to my helpless children.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any of them say that she lodged there? - yes, Fitzpatrick told me so himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss out of your stock these stockings that are now contained in that paper? - Yes, after the young man informed me that she had taken them. I swear them to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Within what time do you know that they were in your stock before you was told that some had been taken? - They came to me the night before from the manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never sold them to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord I have got three children, one of my three children is in St. James's infirmary, (that is at the workhouse,) I applied to that gentleman to take my child out the Sunday morning till Monday, which he has always given me order for before, I had fish to sell that would be spoilt, as they would not keep over Sunday, so I went on Saturday night for the order, and he said he could not think of giving it me then, I left my barrow outside of the door, he said he could not think of giving it me that week, but he would the next, I came out to take the barrow home, I took it into the yard where I live in Cross-street, Carnaby-market, I wheeled my barrow into the yard where it always stands, and I saw the bundle of stockings in the barrow, and I thought that somebody when they had come for currants or apples had put it down; it was never touched, nor never untied, I took it up and put it down again as I found it, I went into the parlour, and I says, well, I will go for some butter, tea and sugar, I went for a quartern of butter, and came home with it, and went out again for tea and sugar, and that gentleman laid hold of my arm, and asked me for the stockings? I told him there was a bundle in the barrow, but how it came there I did not know; I went home to his house directly and he went to where I lived, and he took the bundle, and when he came back he charged the watchman with me. I have no witnesses, for it was all done in a few minutes; sometimes I have many things left in my barrow, which people leave, and come back again and have them. I have three children and never a father for them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I took her, I told her if she would confess I would not hurt her, but she did not confess to me.</p>

               <p>I am a fire-man, belonging to the new fire office. On the 24th of July, in the morning, after the large fire at Ratcliffe, I was on duty, then going down London-street, I met the prisoner at the bar, and saw something under his coat, underneath his arm, I thought he had something that did not belong to him, at that time of the morning, it was rather before five o'clock, the fire was still burning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the fire was it? - It was almost to the sign of the Cricketers; I met him a great distance from the fire, I suspected that he had something that did not belong to him, I followed him into the public house, the Cricketers; he placed himself down on the bench in the tap-room, along side with his wife, as he said she was; and I went and stood by him for a minute, and I looked to see waht he had got under his coat; and I asked him what he had got there? he said, indeed, man, I have got my wife's sheets; I told him they did not look to be sheets, I insisted on seeing them, I told him I did not know but what it belonged to some gentlemen that were insured at our office, and he and I had a bit of a skirmish to get it from under his arm; when I got it from under his arm I see a table cloth, I asked him before I opened it, what was in the inside? he said he did not know, but whatever it was it was nothing to me; then I opened it, and took out his plate, I asked him how he came by them things? he told me he picked them up in the street; I looked on the cloth and found there was no dirt on it, and told him it was no such thing; then he said a genteel man gave them him, coming along the street; I asked him where the man lived? he said, he did not know nothing about him; then I called in one or two of my fellow servants, and we took him to the watch-house; as he was going along he tried to make his escape into a public house, below Limehouse, but we prevented him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The first thing that excited your suspicion, was, seeing him that time in the morning. Don't you know that he was burnt out that morning? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170096"/>Q. Did not you see his wife there in the public house, and his children? - I see his wife there as he said it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he desire you to stop a little, and that he expected for the man that gave them him to come there for them? - No, he did not, he told me I had no business with the property, it was his own.</p>

I think you belong to the ballast office; he said he did, he said, will you take it to where these things of your's are, that you said you saved? he said it was at the Cricketers, in London-street, and he would take care of it, and presently after I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take any notice of the man? Was he an old man? - He was a middle aged man, he had his hair tied behind, and a brownish coat on.</p>

            , and asked him what I was to do in this case? he immediately sent for a constable, that is here present, he came and took her to the Compter; the constable brought back immediately from her, some duplicates of some ribbons that that she had pledged at different places, they were patterns that were ours; she had made a practice of coming to the shop every day, I suppose six weeks before the the 6th of August, to have a yard and quarter of ribbon. I know these ribbons by the pattern, they are ribbons so well known, that they are not marked with the private mark.</p>

            Had you any ribbon in the shop that belonged to any body else? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say of your own knowledge that any ribbon was removed out of its place, except that that fell down on the counter, and that you took on removing her apron? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say that any were missing out of the drawer, of that pattern? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in the whole might it be, that the prisoner dropped from under her apron, and that found under her apron? - The two pieces made thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I beg pardon of you when the ribbon fell on the ground, and you said, ask pardon indeed, and did not I stoop to pick it up as well as you? - She did ask my pardon as it fell down, and said she did not intend it, or something to the same purpose.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to this person's house, the day I was committed, for half a skain of fourpenny thread, and some needles, and after I was served, there was some ribbons in the window, and I asked the lady the price? she said, seven-pence a yard; and I asked her if it was new fashioned? she said, no, it was old fashioned, butshe could shew me some very new fashioned ones, when the took out the drawer immediately, there was one ribbon there in particular, that she said was a very handsome one, and she unpinned it herself, and opened it, and asked me if I should like it? and she looked out one purple and green striped, at the same time she asked me how much I wanted (I had some currants in my apron eating at the same time) I told her a yard and a quarter; after she had cut me off a yard and a quarter, I paid her for it, and I paid her for the thread and needles; as I was turning about to go out, I felt something fall at my elbow; I said, I beg your pardon; and the man said, beg your pardons indeed, and they said I wanted to steal it, he took and laid it on the counter, and the other piece stood on the counter at the same time, and he said I meant to steal that too; they then sent for a constable, and took me to prison, and they took the yard and quarter of ribbon from me, that I had paid for. I hope you will pity my situation.</p>
               <p>Court to Walworth. Did you sell her any thread and needles? - I did, and she paid for them, that she had first, and then asked for ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew her either of these ribbons, or unpin them, and put them in her hands? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them on the counter at all? - I did not, I am perfectly sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had fruit in my apron, and whether the ribbon was under my apron or no, I cannot say, the young woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170099"/>shewed me eight or nine pieces, before she picked out one that I liked.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mr. Hart at that time, but I am not now; my mistress calls me up out of the kitchen to go with this man to shew three umbrellas to some gentleman, my mistress was in the shop, she gave me the umbrellas, she did not say where I was to go but said, go with this gentleman to shew these umbrellas to some gentlemen, and bring me the money if any are sold; I went with the prisoner, and he took me to the Custom house, and when he came to the Custom house, he snatched them away from me, he says, I am going up into that room, to shew them to some gentlemen, and he went up stairs, which I went after him, he got into the room and the door was shut before I got up the stairs, when I got up the stairs I opened the door and observed a room full of gentlemen, whom I asked if there was not a man come in to shew some umbrellas? The answer they made me was, no; then I asked them what place it was? They told me it was the long room in the Custom house; which I went into the room and looked about, which there was no man to be found there, there was another door, which he went out at, which I was not acquainted with the place. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your umbrellas again? - No.</p>
               <p>Hart. They have never been recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - Sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I promised to pay them when I received the umbrellas, I went to the shop of this gentleman, and the woman went along with me to the long room, and I told her I would pay her for the umbrellas when she delivered them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. To Morris. Your account is that he inatched them from you; did he say that he should pay you for them? - He did not. Before he spoke to me he snatched them from under this arm, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170101"/>said, I am going into that room; that was all the conversation that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. You may have done a childish and foolish thing, in parting with these things to this man upon this promise of his; if you have you must say so? - He never said nothing to me, but snatched them from under my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. To Hart. How did you find this man? - I made every endeavour I could to find him out; he was taken at Lloyd's coffee house, endeavouring to swindle a man about some china bugles; and he was advertised, and I took the girl before the alderman, and she swore to him, and gave the same account as she has now.</p>

Says he, some men have been a quarrelling; says I, that is a pity; so I stopped about two minutes; after that, I said, I will be much obliged to you to let me pass now, I think there is room enough; he said, you had better stop a little longer. When I went to go forward, and I felt something, and I said, what are you about, picking my pocket? No, says he, I am not, you had better stand still; with that he snatched his hand out of a sudden, and my pocket was turned inside out; with that he ran off; so with that I called out stop thief! and says I, I am robbed. In less than half a minute's time the prisoner was taken; it was not the prisoner at the bar that robbed me, it was one Shield that robbed me. I had just changed half a guinea, and had the ten shillings in my pocket, just before.</p>

               <p>Q. What situation was this house in at the time you lost your property? - The prisoner was employed by my father to pull down this house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he and others procceded in pulling down this house? - Very near to the basement story. The bar was situated in the basement story, to support one jam of the chimney, to support the brick work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where in consequence of any information, to any house, and did you find any bar? - I went to a house in Duck-lane, Westminster, on Sunday evening the 20th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did that house belong? - I understood to a Mr. Roach; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, did you find any bar of your's? - I found a bar similar to the one that had supported our stack of chimnies; but I could not positively swear to it till afterwards. I took it with the constable, to the watch-house of St. Margaret's, and the prisoner he was in bed. I don't recollect the said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner in bed, at Mr. Roach's? - Yes; I understood he lodged there. It was found in a out house, after we had been at the watch-house; the prisoner was locked up till the next morning, I left the bar there, and the bar was taken the next morning, with the prisoner, to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave the bar with there? - With the people of the watch-house; I left the constable there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the custody of the bar? - I cannot say that; the bar was taken to Queen's-square the next morning, and I met them there the next morning, Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the magistrate's was the bar produced then? - Yes, I believe by the constable,</p>
               <p>Q. To all appearance, was it the same bar that you had seen in the out house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same bar that you said before was similar to the one that had been in your building? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. After it had been produced by the constable before the magistrate, what next did you do with the prisoner at the bar? - By desire of the magistrate, I took it with the constable or people that belong<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170106"/>to the office, to the building, and there I sitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to tally exactly, and to fit the place that you tried it at? - Exactly; certain parts of the morter adhered to the iron and corroded iron to the morter.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, from the method that you took to discover whether it was your property or not, are you able to state from the best of your knowledge, that it is your property? - I think I can safely say it is my father's property.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been in the house, and sitted the bar, and found it exactly tally with the premises, what did you do with the bar then? - I think it was taken back to the office, and I went with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was brought back to the office, the prisoner was had up again before the magistrate, was not he? - He was, and committed, and the bar was taken to our house, and locked up in a wareroom.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the wareroom? - It was kept under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key? - Not the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else access to the key, besides yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these persons here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make observation enough, to say that the bar, that is now about to be produced, was the bar that was taken from the prisoner? - I think without doubt it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have sworn with very great solemnity, that when you found this bar you was present; you found this bar in the outhouse, who put it there you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. This bar had been put into the outhouse before you came? - I don't know anything to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken to the, watch-house by the constable, did you accompany the constable all the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whole care did you leave it? - The constable's that I took with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it the next morning to the office? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken from the office to your premises, by whom you don't know? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put into a cellar, the key of which was kept by a publican yesterday? - Yes, it was, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what particular mark is there on this bar, by which you will venture to swear to it? - I don't know whether there is a mark that I put on it when I examined it at the time that it was taken from the office to the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Then between the time of having found the bar in the outhouse; and to this time that you took it to your father's house, it had been out of your sight, without a mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My learned friend has just now asked you who took this bar to your house from the magistrate? Did you go along with them? - I cannot swear that I was the whole time with them, I might be part of the time out of their sight, however they went to the building, and there I found them with the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With respect to this bar, I have not asked you who took it from the office to your ware room, where you kept it after it was examined? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany them? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Though my learned friend has been endeavouring to persuade the jury that you shall not be able to ascertain your property; after having made the trial to the best of your observation is this your father's property? - It is my father's property, to the best of my observation.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing home any thing to your house? - Yes, about nine or ten weeks ago, between nine and ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he bring it in? - He brought it on his shoulder, and I asked him what he had got? I said, what have you brought a log in? ay, says he, and you may burn it; I did not know then it was iron, or anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a light burden or a heavy one? - Heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it covered at all? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing with this when he brought it in? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it again in the washhouse afterwards? - Yes, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it again the next day, did you find it to be wood? - No, I did not know what it was, till I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew perhaps it was not wood? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Mr. Glanvill and the constable came to your house? - Yes, that was on the Sunday following; he brought this home Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they find any thing there? - Yes, a piece of iron, and carried it away.</p>
               <p>Q. The same piece that he brought in? - Yes, I am sure it was the same piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they find it? - In the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same place that he had put it in, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How do you know it is the same piece. Come listen to me a little, let us hear your answer? - Because I know it is.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this is the same piece of iron? - It looks very much like it.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you positively swear that that piece of iron, that Mr. Glanvill found on Sunday night, was the piece of iron put there by the prisoner on Thursday night? - It was that piece of iron that was in my wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. I know it was in your wash-house on Sunday? - I have nobody to go to the wash-house but the lodgers.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there any marks on the iron? - I did not look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it is the same, if there are no marks? - Why it is so much like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether it be iron or not, the same thing that was brought into your house, was the same thing that was taken out? - It was.</p>

               <p>I am the husband of the last witness; the prisoner at the bar lodged at my house; on Friday morning I looked into the wash-house, and I saw something in the wash-house that my wife told me came in the night before, she told me it was wood; I went afterwards in at twelve o'clock, and I found it was a bar of iron, in the room of wood; I left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. After you made an enquiry about this iron, did any body come on Sunday? - On Sunday evening Mr. Glanvill came; I went down first and foremast, and he followed after, and he saw the very bar, and he sent the bar away with his man.</p>

               <p>Q. That bar was afterwards taken and shewn before the justice? - Yes, it was, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the bar again before the magistrate, did you know the bar again? - I declare I would not positively say it was the same bar, but it was very much like it, it had been cleaned in the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You saw this bar first on Friday noon? - Yes, I could not swear to the bar again.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Glanvill to Roach's house, on Sunday evening, between nine and ten o'clock; when we came there we knocked at the door, Mrs. Roach let us in herself; as soon as I came in I asked her if she would lend me a candle, and I took the candle out of her hand, and went backward with Mr. Glanvill, and saw this bar of iron in the wash-house, fronting the door.</p>

            Had the bar any thing annexed to it? - Yes, beaters, to bear up the brick work, it has a claw at the bottom to stand upon; there was mortar about it; we carried it to the watch-house, and we went all as fast as we could, one after another; when we came to the watch-house, Mr. Glanvill gave the charge, for stealing the bar of Iron; the bar was left in the watch-house all that night.</p>

            Is that constable here? - No, the next morning I went to take out the man, to take him to the justice's; I found the iron in the watch-house, where I left it, the prisoner was locked up in the hold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same that you had seen the over night? - To the best of my judgment it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other bar of the same kind there? - No, not a bar in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take that bar to the justice's? - No, I did not, I went with them that took it, as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with them all the time, till they got to the magistrate's? - I was with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the justice's, was it the same bar? - It was, to my thoughts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was afterwards done with the bar? - Mr. Glanvill went down with the bar to fit it, I went with him, it was brought back to the office again, and the man was committed, and the bar was carried to Mr. Glanvill's house, and I have not seen the bar since, till yesterday I saw it in the cart, in the Old Bailey, and there was some mortar about it then, but it rubbed off in pulling it out of the cart, because it is a very heavy bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You took the prisoner to the watch-house, and somebody else took the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you found a bar like that at the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the justice's you saw a bar like it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw a bar like it at Mr. Glanvill's? - Yes.</p>

            Did you see the prisoner there? - No, I heard he was in bed; I saw nothing at all till the bar was brought into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170109"/>the passage, I was ordered to carry it to the watch-house, and I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a bar was it? - I am no judge of bars, it is a very heavy bar to my certain knowledge; it had a parcel of mortar about it, it had a flat piece at top, and the same piece at bottom; I took it to the watch house, and I set it up against the wall at the left hand side, going in at the watch house door, till such time as my master came in, and the constable and prisoner; it was left there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the bar again? - I went out of town; it is not above a week ago, I saw the bar in my master's yard, it is the bar by the weight of it, and the look of it, I brought it in the cart yesterday with the horses, into the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any mortar on then? - Yes, there was a little, and in getting it out of the cart, I knocked some off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it the same appearance about the ends of it as the other bar had? - Yes, it had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This bar had some mortar on; why if any bar had came out of a chimney piece, it would have had the same? - It would.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it a very heavy bar, it made your shoulders ake? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it in your master's yard, how came it there? - It was locked up in master's coach-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had it the appearance as if it had been taken from a building? - It had.</p>
               <p>Court. You see it at the watch-house where it was left; did you see it when it was carried to the justice? - I did not.(The bar produced)</p>
               <p>Glanvill. To the best of my recollection it is the same bar, there is a spindle at the bottom that fits into a back, and there was a mark on the stone where this flat piece of iron had been, the top part is a piece of wood, which is entirely taken away, therefore I cannot speak to that so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same bar that was put into your coach-house, and brought here? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same bar that you found in the wash-house? - I really believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I suppose that bar is like any other that is used for the same purpose? - I never see such a one used for such a purpose before.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this man a labourer of your's at the time? - He was a bricklayer's labourer on Thursday the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it be in the line of his business to remove such a bar as that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says the bar fitted the place, when the piece is entirely pulled down the Saturday night, I worked fifteen years in the same parish, I worked nine years for squire-, and I worked three years two or three doors from Mr. Glanvill's, I sent master a letter and desired him to look into my character, if he thought that I took the bar.</p>

               <p>When I am well I go with messages for the admiralty. On the 31st of July, I had been employed to take a parcel to Litchfield-street, when I came back I had a pint of beer, I was then going home, when I got to the Admiralty gateway, I saw a boy making gestures to the prisoner at the bar, who had this trunk; it wanted five minutes of ten o'clock when I came out of the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy make the gestures to the prisoner in the street? - No, under the Admiralty gateway, and when I went to look at him he wanted to hide the trunk with the slaps of his coat, which gave me a suspicion that he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from the trunk at that time? - He was close to it, and I went back again, and told Mr. Gillum, that keeps the Anchor and Vine, and then he came back with me, and he was sitting on the trunk, and we laid hold of him by the collar, as soon as we took the end of his collar, he got up and ran away, Mr. Gillum ran after him and brought him back, and we took the trunk into Gillum's house with the prisoner; in a very little while after Mr. Bichner and his wife, I believe it was, came to Mr. Gillum's house. and he said it was his trunk, and his wife, or whoever it was, seemed very much frightened and knew the trunk directly, and we took the trunk and prisoner to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend them to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not see the prisoner with this trunk? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In the time you went back to the Anchor and Vine, he might certainly have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170111"/>run away with it if he chose? - If he had attempted it he certainly would have been taken.</p>

He said he had got a trunk, he had found it, I told him, I believed he had found it before it was lost, and he attempted to run away, and I ran after him and catched him, I took the prisoner down to the watch-house and gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor claim if as his? - He did; I saw a chaise about a hundred yards up, and I sent my man up to see whether it came from that chaise or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you found this boy he told you that he had found the trunk? - He did.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me ten months, he lodged there the 25th of July. The reason that I had to suspect any thing of the kind, was, the prisoner was discharged from the master that he worked with the 24th of July, and when he came home, it was past eleven in the evening; I told him that I had been informed of his stealing from his master. As soon as I could get entrance, I looked about to see if I could see any thing of his master's; I got entrance there the Friday, the 25th, about nine o'clock, his room was all over litter of paper, he had light a fire in the room, and appeared to have burnt a deal of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property belonging to Mr. Paramore, in his room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find thirty copper plate prints? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a printed book in sheets? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find a pamphlet in sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a quire of demy paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you shew these articles to? Did you shew them to Mr. Paramore? - Yes, I sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present when Mr. Paramore came? - He was not; I had discharged him from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the things? They were left in my care; I kept them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170113"/>by themselves; Mr. Paramore carried them to the justice; I delivered them to him, and they were given to my care again before the justice, and I have kept them ever since.</p>

               <p>I live in the house with Mrs. Pitburn; I see the things in the prisoner's room, she called me in, Mrs. Pitburn left me in the room, after that she said she would send her brother, Mr. Paramore, to see them; Mr. Paramore was sent for; I went out before he came. I am sure these are the things that were in the prison's room.</p>
               <p>Q. To Paramore. I understood from you that the things were put in your care before they went to the magistrate? - They were; but she took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pitburn. We all went together at the same time, and I delivered them to Mr. Paramore, to shew before the justice.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar. On the 26th of August, the last witness, Harris, came to me as the constable of Chelsea, and informed me that the prisoner had had a child, and had murdered it, and asked me what was best to be done? accordingly I told him I thought it was proper she should be taken up; this was about nine or half past nine in the evening; accordingly I went, and he informed me that she lived <rs id="t17940917-46-deflabel236" type="occupation">servant</rs>

We both went down to the house, but the gates were shut, they were gone to bed; there was a garden before the house, the doors were all locked, but they were not all in bed; I got over the rails of the adjoining house, and knocked at the door; and they looked out and asked me who was there? there were two servants, the prisoner was gone to bed, but the other was up; I told them my name was Sanders, I was the constable of Chelsea; and they opened the door, they knew my voice, I suppose most people know me at Chelsea. When the maid opened the door, the old lady came out, an infirm old lady; I told her not to be frightened, I was come for one of her servants, but she had not been guilty of any thest; she desired me to walk into the parlour. I then informed her that her servant had had connection with some man, and that she had had a child, and had made away with it; by which means they called her up; she was gone up stairs to bed; and she said as she was coming down stairs, she was very happy I was come, and seemed very willing and desirous to go with me; she called me by my name. I took her home to my own house, because being a decent servant, and I put her in the next room with me, and put her to bed, and fastened the windows, for fear any accident should happen. The next morning I took her to Bow-street, but on my journey, I stopped at <placeName id="t17940917-46-crimeloc237">No. 7, Renelagh-row</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she say what happened in consequence of her putting her finger into the child's throat? - She did not; she only told me that she put it in, to prevent the child crying. I went on to Bow-street, immediately after she informed me where the child was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the necessary from the house? - About the length of this court, as near as possible. At Bow-street the justice committed her for further examination, till the child was found, to know if it could be found. As soon as I returned from Bow-street, I went and got two bricklayers to take up the vault, and they did so; I was there at the time; in about half an hour we found part of a child; the left leg and left arm was perished, separated from the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the leg and arm? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that the child was born without that leg, or did it appear to be naturally perished? - No doubt it had naturally perished, for the rest part was nearly the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course then you could hardly observe any appearance of any marks on the child? - No; I believe it was out of the power of any of the faculty to tell whether it was born dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not mean to make away with the child, I did not know what I was about. Here are some things that I made for the child; a shift, cap, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sanders. That was what I was going to mention. When she went up stairs she shewed me a vast quantity of child bed linen, plates, clothes, and money; you see, says she, Mr. Sanders, I want for nothing; but I am an unhappy wretch; and I want to be out of the world. She asked me if I thought God would forgive her, and take her back again, if she took a book and prayed? I told her no doubt, my dear, God forgives every person that truly repents of their sins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the sex of the child? - She did not; I found it out after it was was washed and cleansed, it was a male child.</p>

               <p>I was in Fenchurch-street on the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner there, it was six o'clock in the morning, there were two other men with him, one was a blacksmith, that was very much in liquor, the other appeared to be a countryman; they made towards Whitechapel, and Whitechapel Church, I did not follow them; I had suspicion that he was doing the man an injury, in regard of getting his money, by tossing for gin; they seemed to come towards Whitechapel church, and they passed me, and another that was with me; I was as far as the pump of Aldgate, before I lost sight of them.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was that to the place where this unfortunate affair happened? - Near about a hundred yards. After I came out of the Royal Oak, I saw this man, the blacksmith, and several people standing about him, and the blacksmith was stripped, had no shirt on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the third man, that was with him in Fenchurch-street? - Yes, I think he was there, but I will not be positive; the blacksmith wanted to fight this prisoner, he charged him with a robbery, and would lick him whether or no; and I went to him, and I persuaded the blacksmith to go home, and the prisoner he came up to me, and asked me what business I had to trouble my head with it? I told him I had business, or any other person; he told me that the man had money about him, and he was such a man as he wanted to be with, and it was no use for such as he, to be with one that had none; after that, a man in the company came and taps me over the shoulder, and calls me on one side, and I went about three or four yards, and in the mean time I was talking to the man, I see the prisoner draw a knife, and he began flashing it about, all manner of ways, stabbing; I made up to him as soon as possible, to attempt to secure him from doing any mischief, I got him by the back part of his neck, as he was on the rising ground, and held him down to the ground, and put my foot on his hand, while another man, James Smith, took the knifeout of his hand.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Court. You see him brandishing about this knife, and you say it was purely for mischief; when you saw the wound, or rather the hand coming from that thigh, do you apprehend the would was given by the accident of the man being thrown down, or did he make the blow by design? - He was pulling backwards, it was not particularly for this man; the blow was intended for any body that came in the way.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, the first of it that I observed was, that when I came up, I saw a man take hold of the prisoner by the coat; says he, this man has robbed me, and I see the prisoner put his hand into his left hand pocket, and pull some halfpence out, and give it to the man; after that some person cried out, take hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that was charging him with the robbery? - I don't know, he was quite drunk; he then immediately put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pulled a knife out, and opened it, and began to clear the way; the witness, Ducroix, went to catch hold of him, he made a stroke at him, and cut the last witness about the arm, Ducroix stepped on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing while he was doing this? - I did not hear him; he still kept his knife in exercise, trying to run away, and get out into the middle of the road, and I observed the witness, Smith, catch hold of him behind, by the collar, and the deceased man ran in to assist him, and he got hold of him in the front, and the prisoner gave his hand a tug back, and the deceased man turned on one side rather, and the prisoner stabbed his knife into the deceased's thigh, I see him push the knife in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased Pepper, - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound? - No, I see the blood run, and he run away to the Hospital directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany the prisoner to the watch-house? - I went along with him; we went to the watch-house door, but there was nobody there; we went to a public house with him, but I did not go into the room with him, I only staid in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you hear any thing concerning ducking me? - No, not a word; he was not used ill at all in my sight.</p>

               <p>I am attending the London hospital in a medical capacity. I was there in the morning when the deceased was brought in, he had a small wound on the left buttock about half an inch wide, which poured out an amazing quantity of blood, it was examined and found to be about five inches deep, in a stanting direction, it was then laid open and found it had divided a very considerable artery; the man was then drest and put to bed, I attended him till Saturday morning when it was going on well, after which time I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person appear in a good habit of body and apparently in a good state of health? - He was; he was brought in on Sunday, and I attended him till the next Saturday morning, Mr. Martin attended him after me; Mr. Richardson was present with me at the time.</p>
               <p>- RICHARDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pupil attending the London hospital, I was with Mr. Heddington when the deceased was brought in, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170119"/>man came in on Sunday morning, about eight o'clock with a puncture in the hip, which bled very prosusely, about five inches deep; I attended him till Saturday; he was a strong hale man, I did not see him so lately as Mr. Martin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin. I attended him on the Saturday following that he received the accident, I did not perceive any thing amiss that day, I was called up on Sunday morning, and the man was labouring under a violent hemorrhage, a bleeding, I endeavoured to ascertain from whence the blood issued, but I could not, I made use of an application to stop the hemorrhage, which succeeded for a length of time, but at the end of four or five hours the hemorrhage began as rapidly as ever, from this same wound; I was sent for again, and I went and removed the dressing, and examined it very minutely, but could not ascertain it, I renewed the dressing and it stopped for the present, but it soon after began again; I then sent for Mr. Neale, he was out of town; as soon as he came he found the man in a deplorable state, with a sainting and coldness of the extremities, in a dying state; he died about twelve hours after the bleeding began.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the bleeding of that wound, and the wound was the occasion of his death? - No, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a person in other respects in a good state? - He was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was about six or seven o'clock on Sunday morning, the 17th of August, the day the accident happened, I was going down Fenchurch-street, there was a couple of men standing there, one seemed to be a smith and the other a countryman, he says, which is the way to the Maypole, to East Smithfield? I says, I am going past the Minories, which is the best way, as I was going along towards the Minories, says he, I will treat you with a quartern of gin for your civility, accordingly we went into a house and had a quartern of gin, and he pulled out two or three shillings to pay for it, and he said he had no halfpence; and I said, change a shilling, and he said, you pay if you have any halfpence; accordingly he said he would not go down the Minories, he would go with me; we had not gone much further than we got near to Whitechapel church, now, says he, we will have another quartern, and I will change the shilling and pay you the two-pence halfpenny that you laid out at the other house; says I, do so; so we went into another house, and it being early in the morning, there was nobody up but the maid, and she had no change for a shilling, says he, have you got any more halfpence? Yes, says I, I have, and I paid for that quartern of gin, then we walked down the road, and just by the other side of the New-road, says he, I have got a clean shirt in my bosom, I will pull off my dirty one and put the clean one on, so he pulled off his coat and waistcoat and put them on the ground, and his wristbands were tied with strings, and I took the knife out of my bosom to cut the strings of his wristbands and he took off his dirty shirt, and put his clean one on, pulling up his cloaths, his waistcoat, some halfpence dropped out of his side pocket on the ground, I picked them up, I says, I will have these halfpence now for the amount that I have laid out, I don't chose to go any further, says I, I will keep them, and I put them into my left hand pocket; then he began to cry pickpocket, and a mob gathered about, some where for ducking me, some for hanging me on the lamp post, and some for knocking me on the head, says I, if I have done any thing amiss take me to some other place, for I will not be ducked, they insisted on it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170120"/>and they shoved me backward with the knife in my hand, which it was impossible to help my cutting the young man in the arm, at last somebody came behind me and took hold of me by the collar and pulled me back, and I was flat on my back, and instantly six or seven of them came treading on me to get the knife from me, and the deceased being nearest to me, I suppose he had the wound then, but he never had the wound before I was on the ground. I have no witnesses; there have been report about the streets in halfpenny papers that I stabbed the man on the highway, and I suppose seeing the reports in the papers none of them would come forward.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I produce nine shawls, six in one piece, and three in the other piece. I was going along St. Paul's Church-yard, Monday, the 11th of August, between nine and ten, it might be about ten, and I saw the prisoner, she seemed to have something that she wanted to conceal, I followed her and she turned up a court in St. Paul's Church-yard, by Mr. Wllkie's, she stock broker, I just turned up the court, and I found her taking these shawls out of her apron, and just delivering them to a little boy, she ran past seeing me, as I was going up the court before I was aware of her, so I see her going past me, the boy had just got hold of them, I said, what have you got here? Says he, I don't know. The boy said the girl asked, him to hold them while she tied up her stockings; I took the things from the boy, he had them hardly in his hands when I went up the court; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get the woman? - I went out and I asked the people that were passing if they saw any thing of a girl run that way? and some boys went after her, and I first saw her by the boys that went in search for her, just at the Compter; the prisoner is the girl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. A little boy was charged with this offence, was not he? - He was taken before the magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to the court that this was between nine and ten, and afterwards ten? - I cannot exactly say, I did not look particularly to the clock.</p>
               <p>Court. If you see these things in possession of this woman, how came the boy committed? - The grand jury threw out the bill against the boy.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear these to be my shawls, I know this piece by my own marking, it is in a character, I know that we had that pattern, and we had not sold it, I can say that for certainty; the other piece has the same mark and character.</p>

            Was you at home when Ruggles came? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined your stock so that you can say you missed that property?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170122"/>- Yes, I did examine, and they were missing; but we did not miss them before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How many journeymen may you have? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you last took stock? - About twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold any shawls of that character and pattern since that time? - Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have not? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The other journeyman he is not here, but he was in the shop at the time this girl was there? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted if you was to buy shawls to-morrow, you would put the same character on them as on these? - Not the same exactly, pretty nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was committed for this affair, but the grand jury threw out the bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that I understand from you, is, that you speak to the character, that is to the pieces of common shawls and the pattern; and the pattern, you told me just now, is as common as is to be seen in any shop in London? - It may to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the lowest value? - They cost us about eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>jeaves. I can swear that they are Lawrence and Jolland's shawls, from the patterns and marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were missing when Mr. Ruggles brought them? - They were not before, but after he had brought them we found them missing from the quantity of shawls which we have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had not taken stock of these goods for above a twelve month before, so whether any body else might have sold these goods, in the course of these twelve months, you cannot tell? - Yes, I can swear that I did not sell them.</p>

I am sure that the door was shut, and I heard the rustling of paper; and when I went forward I saw his head, and when I got to the door I saw the; muslin under his arm; and he still kept the bundle under his arm, till I see him in the Old Jewry, and see him throw it away.</p>

Mr. Reeves! here is a woman stealing your pots; I immediately went to the door, and I saw Mrs. Russell, who was the woman that called, she said, there she goes up the street, she has got some of your pots; I ran after her, she turned up Hanover street, and she took the pots and slung them into the passage of the White Bear; I did not see her sling them from her; but I heard them fall, and the gentleman is here in whose house she slung them; and he picked them up, and gave them to me; I pursued the woman, and took her about two houses further; I brought her back to my own house, I sent for a constable, and delivered them up to his care; I did not lose sight of her at all; that is the woman.</p>

               <p>I was going out it the door to take down the shurter, and I had taken down one shutter, and I met the prisoner coming out of our passage with the pots in her apron, and I asked her what she wanted there? she said she had been to a gentleman in the first floor; I looked in her apron, and I saw both the pots; I held her by the arm, but she wrestled off my hand, and I called Mr. Reeves, and he came out, and followed her, I followed, but Mr. Reeves was before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down the court, and they said, that I had got some pots, and I had no such property when I was taken; I know nothing at all about it; the gentleman sent me word that he would have nothing to do with it, he did not think I was the person, and so I have not sent for any body.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves. They are my pots.</p>

            Your husband keeps the house where this transaction happened? - Yes. On the 6th of August, Mr. Oram came twice to my house for pots; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170127"/>could not get any from that part that he went to, he went all over the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose lodging was it where these people were? - Frances Price. I went up stairs to every place that was let, and asked of all the lodgers that were in the house, from the top to bottom, and I could get no pots; when I went into this room, there were three men at breakfast, and one of these two men that stands there, he laughs at me, and bids me look under the bed, I did not then, I went down to Mr. Oram, and told him there were no pots, and he was not satisfied, he said, if you please I will go up with you, and we went up again, and I went to the closer, and I found a quart pot, and I went to the window, and I found a penny pot, I turned down the coverlid of the bed, and I found another quart por, and I took off the bolster, and next the bed there were two pint pots and a quart pot; I gave them to Mr. Oram, they were tied up in a man's shirt, and a handkercheif, and when the man found that I was in search of these three pots in the handkerchief, they made their escape, and Mr. Oram followed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward. When you came to enquire for these pots, we were at breakfast; do you know who came in about half after eight? - You and that young man came in, and then you went out again, and a little after that you brought in a two-penny loaf, and something in a glass tumbler.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the expression that I made when you came to enquire for the pots? - Why you sell a laughing, and said, look under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man, the third man, was a strange man, who was in the room? - No, you had all come in together, for two or three days running.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was it you found these things in the bed? - About half after ten, or a quarter before eleven, the clock had not gone eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the handkerchief that you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on them? - No, there is none; they said before the justice's that it was none of theirs.</p>

               <p>I heard the cry of stop thief! down in the Broad-way, Westminster; I think they call it King's Head-court; there I saw Mr. Townsend, with that man with the handkerchief in custody, he then told me there was another gone into that house, a house in the court; I then went into the house, and I desired some person to point out the man, who was challenged with the theft, and they pointed out that man in the right hand; he was on the stairs; I then followed him up stairs; and he was walking softly up, when he see me, till he got to the garret door, when he tapped at the door, one of the soldiers, that is not present, pointed out the man that I took into custody, I saw several men running, but I cannot on any oath say that this man was the man that was running.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Stirrops.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170128"/>Q. Do you remember any beer coming in a pot with a spout to it? - Yes, I had it the 5th of August, in the evening, I kept it in the room till next morning between nine and ten o'clock, when I put four on the landing place adjoining my room; I then did what I had to do, and I went out to market to get some mutton chops for my dinner; I put out a plain pint, a plain half pint, a plain quart, and a spouted quart; as I was coming from market, going by the window of the two chairmen, Mr. Oram's, we see the two men at the bar, a young woman came with me from market, and we asked them to give us something to drink; they did; I thanked them, and the young woman and I went out at the back door; this was between nine and ten; I then went strait home.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get home? - I cannot tell exactly. In a few minutes Mr. Oram came in and asked for the four pots; I told him to go and take them, for there were plenty; I said this in a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward. At the time you met with us, drinking at the public house, had you put the pots out then? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time we were drinking with you, did any doubt arise in your mind that we were concerned in taking these pots? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Stirrup. They came first at half past eight, and they went out again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in, one hour? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Three? - I cannot say; it cannot be so much as that, because they were taken before eleven; it was not an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When they returned with that tumbler, what time was that? - Between nine and ten; and they stayed till we went up to look for the pots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ward to Oram. Do you know on what day we came to your house? - The 6th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands were these pots lodged? - In my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. I have a witness that they were lodged in the Old-bailey last night? - They were, but not left.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether his lodgings were broke open at any time? - I do not; the things lost were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were these things missing? - The 19th of July last; they were in a box; I missed them about half after four o'clock in the morning; it was light. I went to lodge at Mr. Simmon's the 17th, that man came to sleep with me the same night, and he helped me to carry my box up stairs that same night, and we went to bed together that same night. On Sunday morning I got up and cleaned myself; the 17th was on a Saturday; on Sunday morning the man was very desirous to look into my box, as I sat up in my bed; I had a pair of buckles in my shoes, and he asked me if they were not silver? I told him they were not, they were a pair of my own making; he said, if I had not told him he should have thought they were silver. I came home that night and found he had been to bed from about eight o'clock; when I awaked the next morning at half after four, I turned about and found he was gone, and I looked under my pillow to see what o'clock it was, and I missed my watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170130"/>from under my head; it had a chain and seal to it; and I looked at my box, and I found all my things were gone out; I lost all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your things again? - Yes, the coat I found on him, and the watch he owned to; I found a pair of gloves in the pocket of the coat, and them I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. Had you known the prisoner before this time? - I never see him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Leary? - Yes, Leary was a lodger in old Round-court, in the Strand, at one Mr. Goodwin's.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour coat was it you lost? - A brown striped, elastic cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. It was near four months before you see it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with it? - I asked him if that was not my coat that he had on his back? - He said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. And he then went with you very voluntarily to Bow-street? - No; one of the officers took him.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get an officer? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go with you to the officer? - No, I brought the officer to him, and he was conveyed down to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he owned to having stolen the watch? - Yes, he did, in the presence of the officer of Bow-street, and my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, I ask you this question, did the officer or you tell him if he would confess it would be better for him, and they would endeavour to interest the magistrate to send him to sea? - I never spoke a word about it to him; he never denied the watch, only the coat. After that, going to the office, he consessed that he had pawned the watch; and in the coach, going down to Clerkenwell Prison, he confessed that he pawned it at Mr. Bechum's, in Holborn.</p>

               <p>I belong to Bow-street; I produce a coat I got from the prisoner, I took it from him at the Red Lion, Cross-lane, Long-acre; he had the coat on; I have kept it ever since; the young man, the prosecutor, said, it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the presence of the prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there? - The boy's master came down to me, and told me that he had got the person that stole his apprentice's things.</p>
               <p>Q. On his way to Bow-street, or in any conversation at Bow-street, was he told that if he confessed to taking the watch and coat, that you would endeavour to prevail on the magistrate to let him got to sea? - Mr. Steward put that question, and after he said he had pawned the watch and lost the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Page. This is my coat, I know it by a particular mark, one of the skirts has two slits in the slap; I put it in my box the over night, before I lost it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170131"/>Mr. Dowers. The coat has been lost near four months; how long have you had it before that? - About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat is worn since, I suppose? - Yes, very much; I can swear positively to the coat, it is a very remarkable coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the box left open or locked? - I had left it locked, I found it unlocked; it is a box that the lid falls down on the top, and when I awaked in the morning, I found the lid had fallen in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who said, he was a shoe-maker, and gave him a character.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you had all these things in the indictment, about you? - Yes. When I laid down I would my watch up, and my money then was all in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at your money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You being drunk went very soon to sleep? - Always very soon.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that the girl you saw the next morning was the same woman? - I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you sure? You did not see her above ten minutes, and you was not very sober? - I am perfectly sure it is the same woman. I charged the watchman with her and had her taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things? - No.</p>

The prosecutor sent word down to me last Monday morning, that if I would even own to the things, he would say nothing at all about it, but let me clear; I would have done any thing to have got clear, for the sake of this child in my arms which is in a dying state, I have been in this dismal place for this month.</p>

I am not certain whether he was employed by Mr. Hamerton, or Mr. Hamerton's Bargeman; he worked on the wharf, I was informed; so by the person that keeps the wharf; I took the sack and acquainted Mr. Hamerton of it.

               <p>Q. In what way has the prisoner been employed? - As an assistant in the barge, at the time of unloading wheat; we send away our barges empty, and receive them full of wheat, and return them full again, either with meal or flour; we receive the sacks from Deptford, in our own barges.</p>

               <p>Q. Then from that circumstance you judge it has not been returned to the King? - It does not appear to have ever carried flour.</p>

I bought in Rosemary-lane, about five weeks ago, there were two jews standing together, I was coming by, one of them said, young man, do you want to buy any shirts? Yes, says I, I do; says he, here are two shirts I will fell you for half a crown a piece, I took the shirts; and I gave her three shillings for the stockings; and for the watch I gave three guineas and a half; I took them to my lodgings, I put them in my drawer; and I also bought a pair of boots, which Mr. Arm strong has got; I told the young woman of it that I lived with; and since I have been in New Prison I told her to take the key of my drawer, and to go and pawn the watch, shirt, and stockings, which she did.</p>

I know nothing of the property, but that shirt that was taken off my back, which I bought about three weeks ago, as high as I can guess, and when I bought it the srill was on it, and as I examined it I saw a place sewed up in the slap, and the person let me have it the cheaper for that; the man asked me five shillings for it, and I bid him four; and by means of the place sewed up in the slap, he let me have it, he told me it had been tore; the young woman that they have got an evidence against me, is witness to my shirt.</p>

               <p>Court to Miss Comber. At what time did you see it? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Pate. She opened the trunk case directly, and took the watch case out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she was there? - She took out the case to shew me, she held it up in her hand, and asked me is it was not very handsome? I said yes, she then said, here is a very handsome pair of golden-rings! I begged of her not to pull them out, and to put the watch in again, she then stooped down and took hold of some clothes that were there, and said, are these not handsome clothes? I said, for God's sake shut it down, she then shut it down, and she then went and stooped, and put something in her pocket, but I cannot tell your Lordship what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing there at this time? - I was there to clean the room, and the trunks were moved out of one room into the other room; as soon as ever she shewed it me, by her desire the door where the trunk was, was latched, by herself, or somebody else. I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You desired her to put this watch back again, and she put it back again? - I did not see her put it back, I see her shut the trunk, but I never see put the watch in.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in a box with the lid open? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The washerwoman used to come to the house to wash? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found the watch since? - No, I never see it before nor since, and if I was to see it now I could not swear to it.</p>

               <p>Johnson. On the 21st of July, at half after three, I was standing at my plying place, at Bread-street, next to Cheapside, and I saw the two prisoners at the end of Bread-street, in company with another, and knowing of Delser, having had him in custody before, I directly went up to the top of the street, and crossed the way, and kept them in my sight till they came against Mr. Mountsey's shop or warehouse, in Cheapside, a little below Bow-lane, they passed backwards and forward three or four times, at last, I see Delser go into Mr. Mountsey's shop, he was in not above half a minute; Barber, while he was in, placed himself next towards Cheapside, a little from the door facing, and the other on the other side, then Brown came out with this bundle, in this manner, before him, I directly crossed the way, and before I got over, he gave it to Barber, and went to the third man, I was on the other side of the way. He gave it to Barber before I crossed the way, I followed Barber for fear I should lose the property, I overtook him at the corner turning round in Queen-street, Cheapside; I took him by the collar, and asked him where he was going? he said a man had given him the bundle to carry for sixpence, I told him he must go back again to the warehouse, and deliver it there, I brought him back to Mr. Mountsey's shop, when I got to the door, the lad met me, he did not know he had been robbed; I told him I got some property here, he said it belongs to my master, seeing the red mark on the wrapper. I took him to the counter before Mr. Mountsey came down stairs, told the lad that his master must come down to the counter. I delivered the goods into Mr. Mountsey's and Porthouse's hands; I put my mark on it, and sealed it. This is the seal I put on it, and my name on the outside wrapper besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has brought it here? - Mr. Mountsey.</p>

            How did you get the other prisoner? - A little time after I had him for picking of pockets, I had him one day this last week in Newgate, I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170141"/>him very well, I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, I tied it up before I went to dinner, that might be about three o'clock within a few minutes, and left it on the counter of the shop, it is muslin, nineteen quantities, one hundred yards altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them, not as if you was to sell them, but as if you wanted to purchase them? - Thirty pounds, here is the shop mark or back piece in letters, different letters, they were marked by myself.</p>

            When these goods were brought back to you, were they in the same wrapper as when you left them on the counter? - Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before the prisoner was brought in? - Half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop? - No, my master was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I see him go in, and see him bring them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them at all in any manner removed from the place in which they were? - I did not. I knew not the place where they lay till I was told.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. In the mean time that this selony was done, I was at home at my master's, he is in the yard, I fancy, to speak to my character, he was there all the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. At that time that they were about the house did you see them talking together? - I did. I see them talking together all the way into Bread-street, and when they passed backward and forward, and locked in at the door, they all three talked together.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the door open or shut? - It stood open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barber. I was catching from Mr. - , a painter and glazier, and as I was coming along Cheapside, a man tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I would take this bundle to Queen-street, to the wine vaults there, and he would give me sixpence, and I took it, being glad to earn the sixpence, as it was in my road.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you come back for your things? - I believe it was past two; and as I was coming back I met the skins on the porter's back, I did not reach as far as the house; they were on that short man's back; the first thing I knew was the cord that tied them up; the next thing I knew was my knot that I carried them with.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see them? - They had just turned down the gate that goes to the George, on Snow-hill; that was the first place that I took notice of the cords; I had a gentleman with me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170143"/>then when I knew the knot, I said to him, that is my leather; and then the tall man, Doyle, said to the short one, drop it, and I will get a coach directly; I was not five yards from them then; then for fear the man should damage the leather, I jumped forward and catched it in my arms, at his throwing of it down, I catched it between the side of my arm and the edge of the wall of the public house; then when the leather came to me I slipped it down at the side, and I held hold of the short man, and I said, for God's sake, secure that other man; and Doyle got off at that time; then I sent my friend to the Cock, at Snowhill, for the publican to come up, and it was half an hour before my friend came; in the mean time the tall man came along with the crowd, among some women, and came to the short man, and told him to mind what he said; then I laid hold of him; then there were two decent men going past, and I asked them for God's sake to assist me.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever examined the quallity since they were taken from that man? - I have not; there is no mark on them, only by the journeyman that dressed them.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL PITTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I stand as a porter in Fleet Market; this tall man applied to me first to do this business, to obtain this leather under the false pretence.</p>
               <p>Owen. I packed up the things myself; I am certain they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Wednesday morning, I went to work till dinner time, when my master sent me of a message; going along I met an acquaintance, with whom I had a pint of beer; when I came out, and coming along I met Doyle, and he asked me to carry a load for him; he said it did not weigh above a hundred and a half; I was to carry it from Snowhill, to Long-lane, Smithfield, and then I was to have a coach. When we came to the Cock, says he, Mrs. Reynolds and me are at variance, and I don't like to go in for it; so with that I went in and had a pint of beer; and came out again, and he comes to me; and says, your load is ready, go in and ask for it, and I will shew you where to carry it; I did not tell Mrs. Reynolds that Mrs. Pendegrast sent me; I told her I came for the leather; so a porter put it on my head; going out at the door, she asked me if my porter was paid for? I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Doyle. This is propense malice against me, and I will tell you how it is. Pendegrast is one that was tried here for selling bad money this week, and I had told Mrs. Reynolds that this head man of the coiners, came there to sell the money, and I said, I would take him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170144"/>out, and so? was judged in having a hand in having this Pendegrast taken. This day a man comes up to me, in my own room, and I was finishing a shoe for a customer of mine, and asked me to do some business for him; and I said, I will be down with you in about ten or fifteen minutes; and I goes down to Mrs. Reynolds's house, to meet him, and I did not see the man that came for me there, nor any body else; this man he comes in, and another man, and they had a pint of beer, and they stopped together and drank; this man speaks to Mrs. Reynolds, and he moves the leather from the inner part of the house, into the outer, towards the street; and Mrs. Reynolds delivered it to this man. I have another reason to mention, for the words I uttered to Mrs. Reynolds, I says, you know Mr. Pendegrast better than I do, and I suppose he would not send a wrong porter to you. Jones before had told me that he was the porter.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners each called two witnesses to their characters.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What is the value of this leather? - Twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Doyle. This gentleman that left the leather came and told me that if I was to pay the attorney his costs, that he would put a slaw in the bill; and wanted to extort money from me to make it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him before in my shop. I remember he came to my house on Friday the 15th of August, in the afternoon, between the hours of four and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come alone? - He was in company with a woman. When the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, he asked to look at some pistols; that was an article for sale in our shop; the pistols were shewn him. He asked for pocket books likewise; they were shewn him; he fixed on a pair of pistols and a pocket book, the price of both were two guineas and a half. He said to the woman that was along with him, give us what you have got; have you got some gold about you? The immediate reply she made I don't know, because I was in a hurry.</p>

            Did she give any gold to the prisoner? - Not to my knowledge; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170147"/>see any given. The prisoner presented the note which I have in my pocket; he laid it on the counter before me, saying, I suppose you have no objection to that; I examined the note, finding it to be a country note. I observed, that I had an objection to them in general; since the failure of country banks I had not taken them with that alacrity I had before done; I don't know he made any sort of reply. I took the note, and gave it to my apprentice. He is here.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you give it to your apprentice? - To take it in for the inspection of my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your apprentice take the note away with him to your next door neighbour? - He did.</p>
               <p>

            After he had taken it into your next door neighbour, did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner Ross? - After the apprentice was gone, Ross and myself sell into some conversation. The first conversation was respecting the woman that was with him; she had two sad black eyes. I was commisserating the misfortune of the woman; Ross informed me, that she was subject to sits, and had fell down and hurt herself in that manner. Previous to my taking the note, he had observed, that he was in a very great hurry, going to set off in the coach, he was fearful he should be too late for the Sussex coach; he said he was going to Steyning. I should not have taken any further notice of it, but during the time my apprentice was gone, about five or six minutes, Ross seemed greatly agitated.</p>

            Did he say any thing more about Steyning? - He represented himself either as a Custom house officer or a smugler, or words to that effect, either one or the other, residing at Steyning. After this he observed to me, if he was to drop me half an anchor of rum or Holland's, or some spirituous liquor, whether I would take it or no. I observed to him, that I should not take any thing of the kind; that I was certain it was worth no person's while to run any sort of a risk. My apprentice returned, bringing the note back; I observed that to be the same note that I gave him, saying, my next door neighbour said he should take it; Ross was by at this time; that Robert Herries was a very good house. I then took the note, desiring Ross to indorse it; he indorsed the note, Ross only, no addition to it. I then asked him for his address. I took down Ross, in Sussex; near Steyning, on a separate piece of paper, left any thing should transpire. After this I gave him a five pound Bank note, two guineas in gold, and five shillings and six-pence in silver; that, together with the sum of the pistols and the pocket book, made up ten pounds. Ross asked me to indorse the Bank note which I gave him. I told him, it was not necessary; it was not like country bills; it was payable any where; then he went away, and I sent the note to Sir Robert Herries' banking house within a few minutes by the same apprentice. His name is John Simpson.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you see the prisoner write his name on the back of that note? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that note been in your possession ever since? - It has the greatest part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say, that that is the same note? - I am, because I saw the prisoner write his name on it. I am sure it is the same note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards did you see the prisoner at the bar? - On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the result of your sending the nore to Herries for acceptance? - I hat it was a bad one, a sorged one; they refused the note. The note was brought back to me, refused pay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170148"/>ment. On the Monday following I saw the prisoner at the bar again in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the Poultry compter did any thing pass between you? - I told him I was sorry to see that he had been guilty of such a thing, and to see him in that situation he was in; he said, he was very unfortunate; it was the first thing he had ever attempted in his life; he had never been before a magistrate in his life, and that he had no intent whatever to defraud; that the notes were given to him by his brother-in-law, in an account standing between them of seventy five or eighty-five pounds, I will not take on me to say which. I then enquired of him if he had any other notes? he answered that he had. I told him I was sorry that they had not all remained in his possession, it would have saved me the trouble of coming there; I then asked him, as he had had so much money of me, where the pistols were that he had of me? he said the pistols were at a friend's, or words to that effect. I then enquired at what friend's, or where, if I could not get them? he then answered that he did not know, but he would send the pistols to me; I enquired where, he, the prisoner, lived, if I could apply at his house, knowing, by his being in prison that he did not live at Steyning; he then told me that he lived at the King's arms yard, High Holborn, No. 13, on the second gallery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Bull and gate yard - It may be so; he told me the right place then, because I found it out. I went to his lodgings to enquire for his wife; I saw nobody there but three little children, who told me their mother was not come home. I went the following morning, which was the Tuesday morning; I was admitted into his apartment, where I had been before in the same yard, the same number where he had described to me before, where I saw the very woman who was with him at my shop; from the extreme misery that I saw of the man's family, I declined further pursuit till I was called upon by the banker. There was not a single thing in the room but the bed rolled up in the corner, and three naked children.</p>
               <p>Q. At the Poultry-compter, or at any other time, was you present when the prisoner was searched? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you was desired to attend at Bow-street? - I never attended at Bow-street at all; I attended at the Mansion-house; I believe it was the Saturday following; there I gave the same account that I have now related.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You seem to be so inaccurate in this conversation, that you cannot tell whether he described himself as a Custom-house officer or a smuggler? - I was very busy at that time.</p>

            While the apprentice was gone with the bill he gave you the reason why he was agitated; for fear he should lose his stage? - He told me so; and what makes me so correct in this business, I copied every thing that transpired, when I found it was a bad note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said Horsham, not Steyning. - I am certain to the place he mentioned; it was Steyning; because I looked at the Directory, to see what time the coach went off that time in the afternoon.</p>

            Was it the same transaction that you attended about that we are talking of now? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>I am constable; I was present when Ross was taken into custody on the same charge, and I attempted to search him at Mr. Crouch's; he said he wanted to go to the necessary. I went with him into the yard, and I attempted to search him in the yard; when I did that, he refused to go to the necessary then; he said, now he did not want to go, and we returned into the parlour of Mr. Crouch.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine him then? - Not immediately; no further than the attempt. We took a coach, and going along in the coach, I told him that I should strip him naked when I got him to St. James's-street, for I suspected he had notes about him. On my saying that, he put his hand to the back part of the waistband of his breeches, took out this pocket-book, and gave it me. I examined it, and found two notes in it; there was also an order in it to press men, which I gave him up; he begged for mercy both of me and Mr. Crouch; I told him I did not wish him any ill, I must take him to the house where I was going. It was at Mr. Crouch's, a pawnbroker, in Fore-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170150"/>street, a near neighbour, where he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, The prisoner voluntarily gave up these notes, I believe, telling you that if one was sorged they were all sorged? - He told me he had taken them of his brother only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say they were all alike, or something to that effect? - I don't know that he did.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. These notes I received of my brother for money sent, seventy-five pounds eighteen shillings, at the Castle, in Devizes; there were gentlemen in the room in the mean time that the money was paid to me; and whether he might know that they were sorged or no I cannot say. I left one of the notes with Mr. Crouch from Saturday till Monday before I called for the balance of the note. On Monday I called for the note, and he told me, Mr. Ross come in; have you had any thing to drink this morning? I told him no; and he asked me to breakfast with him, and I went to breakfast with him; and at breakfast he says, Frank, I am afraid that the bill is sorged that you have left. I told him, I received it of my brother. My brother was going as captain's cook of the Argonant? he was a man cook, just paid off from the Syren. I was going to take an eating house with the money; and I told Mr. Essex I was going to take an eating house or public house at Horsham, and was going by the Steyning coach.</p>

Whether in the room, or in some place near the room, I will not swear; I was laying down on my bed at the same time; she cried out that she was robbed; she called me down and told me that Kit Neal had robbed her of her gold. She cried out I am robbed! Tom, says she, come down, I am robbed.

               <p>Q. How come you to suppose this young woman, your servant, had got them? - I supposed it by missing a pair of tea-tongs. I immediately thought that my servant had made free with the other things; I went and searched the very next day, which I believe was the 19th of June, and the very first place I went to one Mr. Fordyce's, Shadwell Dock, where I found several pair of shoes; he is a pawnbroker. I found some more articles at Mrs. Crouch's, Ratcliff Highway, to the best of my knowledge; they were childrens shoes; a pair of red-morocco shoes, wrapped up in a South-sea handkerchief, belonging to me; they were left at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            Is that one of the eight? - No; I put it among this other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any of the pawnbrokers know of these duplicates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the duplicates of some of the things that have been produced? Are they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was two days with my prosecutor when he began to make attempts to seduce me, and repeated it so often that it was with great difficulty I could do my business. I told his wife of it, and she told me to keep my distance, and he gave me these things to seduce me, but finding he could not, he had me apprehended as a thief. No sooner was I taken than he went to my father, in hopes of making property of me, told him that, as he was a constable, his daughter had been robbing in the Back-lane, and now was the time to save her; but he could not leave his work in time before I was committed. The prosecutor told me last Wednesday, that he would throw the bill out if I could give him a note of hand for value received, and actually went to buy a stamp for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever give her any of these things? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, you hear the reason that she has assigned, is it true or false? - It is entirely an invention. The father came to me, and begged of me to accept of half-a-guinea to make a slaw in the indictment. I immediately told him that I should forseit my recognizance if I did any such thing; I told him I could not do it, but I humbly ask for mercy for the prisoner if you can but grant it; I do not come here maliciously to prosecute her, my noble Lord, but I humbly beg, if there is mercy to shew, shew it to the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of July I lost some linen; it was from my own house, where I live. I lost two shirts, a sheet, two flowered muslin caps, a pair of white stockings, a check frock, a silk handkerchief, a cotton handkerchief, and a bed-gown.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them altogether? - About 10s. or 12s. My wife on the 24th of May sent down the prisoner with part of these things to wash in the wash-house; in a little time after my wife went down, and missed her and the things too; directly after that we went after the woman where she said she lived, in Catherine Wheel Alley, Whitechapel; we could not find her out there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to trust her with these things? - She was a charewoman; I sent my wife to Spitalfields to look or a woman to nurse the child, or to do about the house, and she brought the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was hired by this woman as a charewoman on Monday; I was to have six-pence a day, and to find myself; I was there chareing three days; the fourth day was the washing day, and I had the things in the wash-house to wash; on the fourth day I went to empty out a little dirty water, and a woman came to inform me that my child was very bad in the poor- house, and I went to see my child, and left the door open, because there was no fasten- ing to it; and when I went to the poorhouse I begged leave to stop that evening, which I did, and the next morning I returned to this woman again; after this I went into the country a fortnight to hay- making, and when I came back Mr. Houghton took me up on this charge, and took my bed-gown off my back, and said it was his property. I am a poor widow woman, I must leave it to God and your mercy.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner. I live in Moors-street, St. Martin's-lane, I am commonly called a Strapper, in the yard, working in the yard, dressing horses, and sometimes go out with a glass coach. I had been to Darttord with a gentleman's's carriage the 9th of August, coming home I met with the prisoner at this side of New Cross turnpike, at the watering house, and asked him how he was? he told me he was very well, and he asked me how I was? and then I asked him where he was going? he told me he was going to town; says I, if you will call on me at master's yard I will give you some victuals and drink; which accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170158"/>Q. When did he call? - That same night, and had some bread and cheese, and part of five pints of beer, and then he wished to go and see a friend, that keeps a public house in Little Norwich-street. He asked me to go along with him, I told him I would. I went; we had two pints of ale there, and in paying for it I gave the woman instead of six-pence, half a guinea, and she brought it back to me, and I said, I beg your pardon, and when she gave it me back, I took particular notice of the half guinea, and took the half guinea and gave her six-pence. When we had done that, I said I wanted to go and see a friend in Vine-street, we went there and had a pot of ale, and I paid six-pence for it, and had a penny out of it, I had had two sixpences in my pocket; from thence I asked him if he had any place to go that night? he said no. I then said I would put him into my stable; we went, he slept in the stable, I laid by him being rather intoxicated with liquor and tired, I fell down and slept. I was in liquor, I cannot say for him; then about midnight, it may be about one o'clock, a fellow servant of mine coming from the country, came and opened the door; (every one in the yard have all got keys,) he heard somebody asleep, and waked us with the whip, he waked first, and then awakened me, and we went up the stable, and I said I am very dry, and I clapped my hand into my pocket and missed my money, I said to him, you have not taken my money from me; he said no, I said I know where I had the last pot of ale, I'll go there, and while I knocked at the door and the girl answered. I said, what money did I spend here last night? they said only a six-pence, and I observed him working his hand underneath a board, and I said, what are you about? I am sure and certain that you have got my money, and put it there; accordingly as I was talking to him, a watchman came up, this was in Vine-street, by talking to him to, the patrole came up and asked the same question. I told him the same, says he, do you give a charge against this man? Yes, says I, I do; accordingly he took him to the watch house with him; he says, you stop by this hole till I bring a light; says the prisoner suppose you do bring a light there may be another half guinea as well as his. I went to the watch house, in about twenty minutes the patrole brought the half guinea down; says he, young man, would you know the half guinea if you was to see it? Yes, says I, if it is mine, it is a little crooked on one side; accordingly he shewed it me, and I said if I can swear to any piece of money, I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pay for all these things, had the prisoner any money? - He said he had only two pence halfpenny, and I thought it was charity, knowing him before. I charged him with it, and he called me all the fools in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in liquor when you went to lay down in the stable? How was you you when you gave your first half guinea in payment? - I was rather in liquor then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in a state of mind to take notice of your half guinea? - At that time I was perfectly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had not we a pot of ale at Jones's house, the last house we went to? Then we went and lay down in a binn, and there came a man, and whipped us up, and you missed half a guinea. Did not you say you would go back to the house? Did not I stand up against the wall a good while before I sat down? and did not you poke in the hole as well as I?</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PENNINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrole of St. Martin's lane. About half after three o'clock in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170159"/>the morning; in the night of the 9th of August, hearing some noise in Vine-street, I went up to see what was the matter. I see the prisoner and prosecutor, the prosecutor said, that that man had robbed him of half a guinea, says he, I look upon it, it is in that hole; I said if it is there I will take you first to the watch house, which I did, and told the constable of the night, and he told me to go back with a light, and I went back and found the half guinea in that hole with a knife; I asked him, a young man, do you think you should know your half guinea, if you should see it? Yes, says he, I should.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not this man say he was coming back to see whether he had given his half guinea away? - What he had said to you before I came up I cannot say.</p>

            Was it underneath the boards or where? - Yes, I believe it was, on the outside, from a hole made I took it, like a a mouse hole.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Garnet. Whereabouts was it you see him siddling with the half guinea? - Within about a yard of the post door, it is boarded down, and comes down to the payement, and under this payement there was a hole where a mouse had run in.</p>
               <p>Acton. That was the sort of place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sent to the Three Jolly Post Boys, and I met the prisoner, says he, did not you once turn a wheel for Mr. Saville, of Pall-mall? Yes, says I, says he will you come and drink along with me to-night? Yes, says I, I will come, if you will find me somewhere to sleep; so I gave a boy sixpence to lead me to this man's place, and there I met with this man according to appointment; he took me to a public house and gave me a penny worth of bread and cheese, then we went to the sign of the Three Chairmen Little Warwick-street, Pall Mall; there were Mr. Saville's cutlers, they knew me, I drank a good deal, but was not in liquor at all; then we went to Mr. Jones's, where he says the money was found, there we had a pint of beer, before he had paid for the beer he said, I will take care I will not pay half a guinea; when we got to the door there were a parcel of people at the door, they said, what is the man blind? Yes, says he, and he came fifteen miles out of the country on purpose to see me, and I heard some money rattle then, and I thought it rattled in his pocket, we went home to his stable, and slept in a binn together, by and by, there came a man in, and whipping him up, and he missed his half guinea. I told him I would stand the search; he said he did not think it was I, so back he goes to this house where we had the last pot of beer, to see if he had given it away there, and I thought I would try if I could find any thing. I could not feel it out then, and whether I poked it into this hole I don't know. I am sure I never stole it in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Did not you come to me and say, are not you hiding my half guinea? No, I said, I am only picking up stones, and if I could have found it, I would have made him give me sixpence, because so far as I know, they can demand a shilling out of a pound for every thing that is found.</p>
               <p>Court to Acton. When you found the half guinea was there any other money to gingle? - No other money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I offered him to search me, and he would not search me. I come from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170160"/>Farnham, in Kent. I used to setch and carry letters for the Bishop of Rochester's widow; I take all parcels from the stage coach, and goes on messages for all the gentleman all round. They don't know where I am now; I cannot send word because I cannot write. I was committed the 11th of September, but I was taken up the 9th of August.</p>

I was gone a journey out into the country of Essex. I locked the door and bolted the gate, and made every thing secure, there was nobody in the house. I cannot say to the day. I was gone a fortnight, and I returned on the 16th, and then I missed them. I went to the pawnbroker, at Hammersmith, and found the candlesticks pawned, his name is Lawrence. I went and setched my wife, and she swore to the property, we went to the justice's and took out a warrant on the information of the pawnbroker.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker at Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner? - Yes; very well, for some years. He brought a pair of candlesticks on the 16th of August last, Saturday, for eighteen pence, he used to come to my shop, and his wife too; I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. When he has pledged things has he redeemed them again? - Yes, and his wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the candlesticks that Mr. Talbot had of you, the same that the prisoner pledged with you? - They are the same, because I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you when things are pawned to you mark them with a ticket? - We sew a duplicate to them; they had, I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Talbot. They are my candlesticks, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is no artificial mark, it is occasioned by the candlestick falling on the ground? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any other candlestick falling on the ground might have the same mark? Yes, but it may not fall in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say when they were first produced to you that you could not swear to them? - I setched my wife, and she did, and I could swear after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the first time that you could not swear to them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. He is a very industrious man, I have known him for some years.</p>

               <p>I produce a tea chest and two pair of shoes. I am the officer that took him. I am the constable of Hammersmith. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170161"/>the 18th, Mr. Lawrence, and Mr. Tal- bot came to me; Mr. Talbot said he had been robbed, and that he had got the mark of his property; I took the prisoner, and had a warrant to search his house; going towards his house, he asked me where I was going to? I said I was going to search his house, for a tea chest, and two pair of shoes, he said, the tea chest he had not got; the shoes he had; going up towards his house, in the road to his house, I asked him where the tea chest was? he said it was not far, it was not out of the field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What did you say to the prisoner before any thing of that past? you told him it would be better for him to confess? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Or rather it would be worse for him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do recollect? - I do perfectly recollect. He then said he would shew me where it was; accordingly we went with him, and he went to a dunghill; he then said it is somewhere here, I cannot say exactly to the spot; he went about there parts up the dunghill, and he scratched with his hand and could not find it; he said, I believe I am too high, it is lower; accordingly he came lower and scratched up the dung and found it, and then we went to his house, and when we came there, he said, you need not search I will give you the shoes, they are no service to me; he then went to a cupboard, in the cupboard there was a bag, and in the bag there were the shoes, and he took them out, and gave them me into my hand; from thence we proceeded to the justice, and he was committed for re-examination, because Mr. Talbot did not know at the present time what he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him whose shoes you wanted? - Yes, mentioned Mr. Talbot's name. I said I was going to search for Mr. Talbot's tea chest and shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This is really a very pretty story. So you mean to tell us, that without your making any promise, or any threat on your part, he voluntarily told you all this story. It is very astonishing!</p>
               <p>Court. This man has a wife and family, has he? - He has a wife and three children.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - He works in the ground as a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Talbot. Did you find your house broke open? or how had they entered into your house? - In at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his master and another witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was walking in my master's grounds, I saw a man hiding something in the dunghill, not knowing what it was; but when I came nearer he seemed as if he was doing something for himself. I came up to him, and I said halloo, and he hallooed to me again; and he asked if I did not work in the gardening grounds? I told him I did; and he told me there were a couple of pair of old shoes if I would accept them; with that I took them shoes home, and got up the next morning to see what he was hiding, and I went to this dunghill, and I found the top of a candlestick at first, and afterwards another, and in pulling out the other I found the tea chest. I watched till nine o'clock the next day, to see if any body would come. On Saturday night I took the two candlesticks out of the dunghill, and took to Mr. Lawrence's for eighteen pence, when they took me, I was at my work, and shewed them where the things were.</p>

How soon did you get the prisoner after this? - I went to the night officer, and he came, and we took the wife on suspicion, we took the prisoner the next day about ten o'clock, we got him in Tower-ditch, when he saw me he jumped down the Tower-whars, into the Towerditch, as such he was apprehended and taken to Whitechapel court.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this? - About nine o'clock, to my best recollection; there were a good many panes broke, but I cannot take on me to say whether he broke them or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a man without breaking a pane of glass get into this window which was fastened? - The buttons were quite loose, and shaking of the sash they turn round and so the window was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend the window was opened? - By shaking the windows and forcing it some how or other, which the buttons will fly open, turn round.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any violence done to the window? - Not to my knowledge, there were panes broke, but I cannot pretend to say that he broke them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you tell any thing particularly in the clothes that I had on? - You had no clothes on; he was in his shirt, I see his shirt sleeves laying in the window when I came in.</p>

On that I immediately jumped up and ran up stairs; when I ran up stairs and come to the parlour door I was afraid of going into the parlour; I jumped out into the street and gave the alarm; I had not been in the street above a minute or two before out comes a man out of the parlour window, and in jumping out of the parlour window he came over the rails; immediately the rest of the gang surrounded him, (there were about six or eight) and throwed him off the rails into the street; with that I immediately jumped up to him, and laid hold of him; with that the prisoner at the bar appeared to me as if coming down from the steps of Mr. Stebbing's door.

               <p>Miss Baker. This is my pocket book, I know it by the singularity of its make, and by its cut; here are a pair of scissors with silver bows, and one of the bows is broke, the pocket book is lined with green silk; I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it? - A very short time, it was the gift of a person that is since dead; I know the work of the lock, and the work about the book, I have no doubt in the least: I missed such a one.</p>

               <p>Q. To Mrs. Crowle. How do you know it? - The bombazet hath several notches in it; I am certain of it, there is seven yards of it, and it cost two shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it is fairly worth ten shillings? - I should suppose so. Here are nine linen sheets, two of them, are marked; the linen pillow cases are all marked.</p>

            . This girl has said, that a fortnight after she came, her master gave her the watch. Have you had the watch since that time? - It was not in the house a fortnight after she came; the master borrowed it of the child for me; he was at the boarding school.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the child brought the watch home? - I cannot rightly say when he gave it me, it was very near a fortnight before he went.</p>

               <p>Q. After the watch was given to you by your master to take care of, had it ever been returned to him till it was missing? - No, there was a strange woman in the house, whom we had no character with, and I told the prisoner I would not put it out of my pocket, because I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170171"/>not lose it, and when I put it out of my pocket, this strange woman was gone, and I had no suspicion of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. What may be the value of this cloak? - It is not worth much, a crown; the petticoat half a crown; the watch about a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she leave your house? - She asked me to go to her washerwoman's, and never returned.</p>

               <p>Cole. I saw the shift and gown both drop from her; the publican said, that he did not think she came honestly by them, and she should be detained; and he went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that is the gown she dropped? - Yes, I can; and I can swear that is the shift, it has got a frill.</p>

               <p>Q. You must not swear positively to property without being able to tell why. Are there not many shifts of the same appearance? - There may be; I believe it is the same. I don't know any thing about the gown, as to particular marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they solded up in any thing? - No, they were not.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had opened them, who did you deliver them to? - The landlord had them belonging to the public house, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Ray.

            To Cole. How came that gown in the pail? - I don't know, they were both slung in the bar while I went for the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man was not in the house when the things dropped.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This gown and shift are both mine; the bed gown I wear myself, and as for the shift, it was my husband's grand mother's, and I know it by the frill, which is not commonly wore now; the bed gown I had seen it on the Monday before, in my chest, on the top of my clothes; I don't know when I had seen the shift; the chest was not locked. I had but lately come into the house, and the lock was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the Grey Hound do you live? - About two or three turnings; being but lately come into it, I don't know the street's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you stay at home in the day time, or do you go out to work? - I was out with the milk with her; she worked for me, and this same day she left me, and came home before me; it was yesterday was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning did you go out? - I think it was about seven o'clock, we went out both together.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return home? - As near as I can tell, it was almost ten; she came home before me, she was at home when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did she go out? - She staid about an hour after I came home; I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any more of her? - I heard no more till the constable came and acquainted me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a carrier to this Mrs. Spencer, and we went out together that morning, and she lent me some things to put on; and coming down, we sell out, and she said, she would fasten me in Newgate, if I did not give her the things off. It rained very hard that morning, and we had two or three glasses of gin on the walk; then when we came home we had three half quarterns, and she told me never to mind the wet, I will give you two or three things to put on; and when I came to take up my pails to go out again, I looked and found things in my pail; and I said, God bless me, I did not know that they were in my pails; and I thought she put them in the pail for me to shift myself with.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever lend her these things? - I lent her a black gown that morning, to go to Islington in, but I never lent her these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the things in the pails. I have not got any friend in the world, but what you gentlemen please to do with me. I have got two small children to work for.</p>

            ? - I did, and no other. I sent over to the Navy office for a search, and on this being returned, I found it was more than ten pounds due; I then informed the prisoner that the will must stop to be proved in Doctors-commons.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the custom of the office not to pay any more money than ten pounds without the will is proved? - Yes; or letters of administration. I gave the will to one of the junior clerks, to enter in the proper book; he is not here. I then made the usual noration on it myself, which is inserted in the office for inspecting seamens wills, to which I signed my name. I then stamped it with the official seal on the office, and delivered it to the prisoner, in order to obtain a probate of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you saw the prisoner again? - On the morning of the 22d of the same month of July; I believe it was Tuesday. He claimed the certificate, the probate being in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On receiving that certificate he becames entitled to the produce of the pay? - He does. I made out the usual certificate on parchment, and delivered it to him, giving him directions where to apply for the payment.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time you had received the probate? - The probate had been sent the night of the 21st, or the morning of the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was paid at all? - I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you direct him to apply? - To Mr.

               <p>Q. Would he, representing himself as master of these boys, be entitled to their wages on producing these indentures? - I believe he would. It is a different department to ours.

On the 10th of August I saw the prisoner in the hall of office, before his conversation took place with Mr. Cranston; I am not confident how long before. The prisoner presented me papers, which were marked C. B. indentures, the same as Mr. Cranston speaks of. I perceived they were indentures of apprentices, and I found considerable difficulty in comprehending what the prisoner had said; I therefore desired him to state his case in writing. I afterwards went down stairs to the office of Mr. Cranston, the last witness, and I observed to Mr. Cranston, that I found considerable difficulty in comprehending what the prisoner said or what he wanted, or words to that effect. Mr. Cranston, in answer said, that there was something extraordinary in the business, or words to that effect; for that it appeared that the prisoner at the bar had been sworn in by the name of

She said, sir, the man is run away, or words to that effect; on which, as the prisoner appeared to me, either through ignorance or design, to have been guilty of a great offence, I did not think it agreeable to my public duty to let him escape; I followed him, and he got up to the top of Somerset-stairs, nearly out of Somerset-house, but he stopped before I came up to him on my calling to him, and a messenger passing by at the same time, I desired him to take him into cus-</p>

            , who belongs to the workhouse of Spittall-fields, called on me, and my not being at home, he left word requesting that I would call on him; I went to him and found him ill; he told me that he had received intelligence that his son, in his Majesty's sea service, was killed by the enemy, and requested I would go and receive his son's wages for him, which I did undertake, and I was told at the office that as it exceeded ten pounds I must administer; I accordingly went and administered as they directed me, and received the money in Barker's name, having gone by his authority, and gave him the money. Some time after this, one Buckea, of Spittal-fields, hearing that I had got the money for Mr. Barker, came and requested of me to go to the navy office to enquire what wages was due to two sons of his apprentices. I went to the navy office, and the clerk recollecting that I had been there before, gave him some suspicion; sent for a constable, and brought me before a magistrate, and Barker was there, who said that I gave him the money that I received, and Buckea only sent me to know what he could do with his apprentices. That is my lamentable case, and I hope it will appear to your Lordship and Court, that I had no criminal intention in view. I went by Barker's direction, and gave him the money, as to Buckea, I made no claim of any, and did not think that the making such enquiry would be deemed criminal. I am now upwards of seventy years, and never brought before a court before, and humbly hope that your Lordship in the midst of justice will shew mercy to me. Mr. Barker desired me to do the business for him; my having a son dying at sea, I had a great deal of trouble to get his money; I was about three quarters of a year getting it, going backwards and forwards to the navy office, and there was a gentleman told me he could get it for me; accordingly I gave him a letter of attorney, and he got the money, and went off with it. Mr. Barker knowing this, said get this money if you-can for me, make use of my name. He says Esq. Hopkins will give me a character.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your friend's house? - In-street, Clare Market. I met Esther Jackson in the street, I went home with her, and she wanted some money for sleeping with her, I was not satisfied to give her any that night, she and I rather disagreed there, and she sent the prisoner at the bar in to me; I did not see her before she came into the room, and wanted money of me, I did not like to give her money at that time, till the morning, and I lay on the bed with my clothes on; I soon fell asleep, I was not very sober, nor yet very drunk; I had my recollection so as to know what passed. When I waked in the morning I missed my watch, and my money out of my pocket, and a pair of silk stockings out of my coat pocket. I awoke about three or four o'clock, my clothes were on me; I missed also some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all your money gone? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was missing? - One shilling and three-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. And how much left? - Seven shillings and six-pence. They were in the room when I awoke, cursing and swearing, asking how I came there?</p>

I had her to Bow-street in the morning; I could not swear that she took the watch out, but I lost the watch in the room in her company.

               <p>I keep the King's-head, in Wych-street, On the 19th of June, Whitsun Monday, the prisoner came to my house in the morning, about half an hour after eight she came in and called for a pint of purl, which I made her. There were several people there; I suppose as many as a dozen. She took the watch out of her pocket, and asked if any of them wanted to buy a watch, she had got one to sell; they took and looked at it, most of them round the tap-room; she asked two guineas for it; and none would give her the money. Then she came to me, and asked me if I wanted it; she said it was her own, at least her husband's, a person, that she called her husband, a young man that was a carpenter, but at that time had enlisted for a soldier, he called at my house the night before; he went away for Staffordshire; and she said that he had given her the duplicate of the watch, and she had been this morning to get it out of pawn, and she thought she could make more of it than letting it be there, and she seemed much distressed for want of her clothes. I laid her down a guinea and a half upon the table for it, before all the people that were there; I looked at the watch before I bought it, and saw Mr. Perigal's name on it, and said, I knew Mr. Perigal; and I took the watch to Mr. Perigal's that evening; and he said he made it for one Daley. I bought the watch of the prisoner.</p>

The cargo was under the necessity of being relanded, and that Committee gave me the management so far as to take care of it. On Saturday, the 2d of August, the men whom I employed on board to work the ship, among whom the prisoner was one, taking the goods from the wreck into lighters; in the evening, when they had finished their day's work, they were returning on shore, the prisoner, after leaving the wreck, was stopped by one of the King's officers with a piece of satin concealed under his shirt. What I mean by it is, it was covered under his shirt. When the officer had taken it from him, I requested that he might be taken into custody by a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him coming on shore? - No; I meant to say, that they were returning from on board the wreck to come on shore; that they had left the wreck, and were on board a lighter, as if returning on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him leave the wreck? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come on shore? - I came on shore with him when he came on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come in some of the lighters? - The lighters did not come on shore; they were lashed along side, and there they remained. He got into the lighter lashed to the wreck, and I see him there, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the officers of the Custom-house on board the lighter? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. And he came on board the lighter where the officers were, and he stated he had a bit of silk, which he suspected to be smuggled? - I never heard that before the re-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked for the Custom-house officers; did not he? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He might, and you not know it? - I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the defendant say? - Not a word, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was not committed the first time? - He was committed for reexamination; I not knowing whose the property was, I did not hardly wish to have the man committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought up the second time he stated, that he was carrying up this piece of silk with intention to give it the Custom house officer? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. He came from the ship into the lighter where the Custom-house officers were? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this vessel wrecked? - On what is called Blackwall Reach, a little below Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you stated who are the consignees of this cargo? - She is a borrowed vessel; when she comes to London she is addressed to Grote, Myer, and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. They shipped this silk? - No; it was shipped by

               <p>Q. Do the duplicates which the constable has got correspond with the other two things; namely, the two shirts and the gown? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I know this neckcloth to be mine; I will take my oath of it before any justice in the world; I am sure it is my neckcloth; it has no name on it; it is the size, and I missed such a one; it is gone out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say of that napkin? - As to the napkin I will not swear to it all; I missed such a thing, but I will not swear to it at all.</p>

How came your watch in your coat pocket? - As I was going up stairs I took my watch out of my fob, and put it in my coat, or waistcoat pocket, I cannot say which; the prisoner went to my coat and waistcoat pocket, and carried off my watch, money and handkerchief; the handkerchief I see in her hand, the watch and money I heard rattle, when she went to my coat, I had no idea at that moment, that she had taken my watch or money; she went down stairs, and in the course of a minute after, I went to my coat, and on searching for my watch and money, I found they were carried off, and I went down stairs, and took the light in my hand, that was in the room, and on looking up the court, I perceived a watchman at the head of the court; I called him, and told him what had happened, I described the woman to him, and he told me that he had seen a person of that description, at the time I mentioned, passing up the court; the woman I found in the same house, in the evening; I am certain it was the same woman; on searching that evening after wards I found my handkerchief, the evening I saw the woman; I brought her to the watch-house, and returned with some of the watchmen; and on searching the prisoner's room, I found the handkerchief that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at any time in that room but herself? - No; at the time I took her, she had another person with her, her husband, or some friend of her's; I found the handkerchief in a small cupboard in the room; nothing else has never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are a bricklayer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You live next door to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed at this fire which happened on the 4th of September? - Yes, I was alarmed by the watchman, and then by Mrs. Moon's coachman, before I could get my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mrs. Moon's house? - Yes, I went to the forward side of the house, and there I saw a light of a fire; and then I went to the back of the house, and then I saw, as if it was from Mr. Molyneux's house; I then went to Mrs. Moon's house, and I knocked at the door, and there were several more together, I went and when I got up stairs to the upper room, the top gallery, three pair of stairs, which is built of wood work, above the brick work, there I observed a smoak.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better produce the plan of the house if you have it there.</p>
               <p>B. COOPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the plan of the house.(Produces it) - This is the side of Mrs. Moon's house, that comes against Molyneux's roof, it is weather boarded and painted; in Molyneux's roof there is an aperture of thirty-eight inches in length, and eleven wide, so that any person might get out of Molyneux's house, and command about eighteen inches of Mrs. Moon's house, above where the weather boarding began; this part of Mrs. Moon's house, which come against Molineux's roof, and where the hole was made, has a gutter all covered with lead; when I went to these premises, I went into the man's chamber, Mrs. Moon's servant, which is here in the inside, that was that part of the house that was raised by weather boarding, and, as I understand, was wholly raised after the house was first built, they cannot build in that manner now; I soon discovered by going into the chamber, the mode by which the string was done; I then desired that a carpenter might be sent for with some tools, to take down some timber; the witness, Osborne, came to me, being Mrs. Moon's carpenter; he got into the gutter, and cleared it, for all the materials had been cleared out of Mrs. Moon's into this gutter; on looking at the lower board of the weather boarding, I clearly discovered the mode by which the fire had been communicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be done on purpose or accidentally? - Certainly, on purpose; I had not been there five minutes, before I could determine that perfectly; the board is in court. (Produced.) It has been kept sealed up in this box ever since the time it was taken down by my directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Did you see these boards taken down? - They were taken down by my orders, and I here wrote on each of them, that I might know them again; these are the bottom boards that lay against the front of the house, weather boards; when I came to look at this boards; I observed that here it was cut away by a knife, and that this board, as well as the other, had been cut in that way; the fire had not got any higher than this, for it went in a sliding direction above this part, by which means the mode in which this was done, was not concealed; this is the bottom board, on which these boards lay, and here is the place where the fire actually commenced; this is the bottom part of the brace, the partition which is shewn by the model, as your worship will see, the slope of it here, and which I have no doubt at all, was burnt by a poker, or red hot iron, because without some additional heat, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170189"/>would not have burnt so rapidly, as to set the whole on fire.</p>
               <p>The jury shewn the model.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Cooper. Did you observe any combustibles inside? - Yes, I did; this man's chest and a portmanteau flood close against where the firing was, the skin of the portmanteau was burnt off, and if it had not been for that, the poor coachman must have been burnt in his bed, for the heat of the plaister had actually burnt the skin of the portmanteau off, and had actually fired the board, so that it was with difficulty they prevented it breaking into the room violently. Here is the piece of a brace which stood in this manner, and which evidently shews to be burnt with a hot iron, or poker, or something of that sort, in order to continue the flame. (the portmanteau produced) There is the back of the portmanteau, if this had not lain very close to the plaistering, it must have been very fatal indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. In what position was Molyneux's house? Was there any fire in that? - None at all. This opening of the roof of Molyneux's house was evidently done from inside, it looked as if the tiling had broke in by something falling on it. When I had got in, this man Osborne, had cut away these different matters, and searched the gutters for things that had been thrown in, I found amongst other things, these, here are some matches, some burnt and some unburnt; here is a piece of tarred oakum or rope that was laying there by it; the roof had all remained just in the same state at the time that I saw it; there was a variety of more, but it was unnecessary to bring a large quantity. In going at another time into the prisoner's house, while I was making the observation of the mode in which a person might get through to the roof, a person desired me to go into the front room, and there was in the front garret this handful of tared junk, in a hole of the plaister stopped, it is oakum very much tared; it was this, but when picked out very fine it made a very large bunch; this was placed between the plaister, and part hanging out between the rafter; if the fire had got to any considerable height here, it must have fell through the roof in Molyneux's house, where there was a quantity of shavings, perfectly clean, and which must have been lain there very recently, because every thing else in his house was very dusty.</p>

               <p>Q. What business is Molyneux? - A mason.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these shavings near the oakum? - No, it appeared as if they had dropped somewhere on the gutter, some lay in the passage loose by the hole, and some partly burnt; it appeared that those that were burnt had fell from this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the burnt shavings and clean together? - The clean ones were in this place, and some clean ones in the passage; but the whole part of the house of Molyneux upper part, was like a gentleman's house, not a particle of dirt all about; the plaister likewise, where this tar junk was set in was evidently cut away, very recently for it lay on the floor, so that it was evidently laid there within a short space of time, it was evidently newly broke; by the mode in which combustible matter had been placed, the fire had ran on each side of the brace, it had burnt both sides of it, and this is a quarter which had been burnt totally about this, and had communicated to a piece called an intenslice, which prevented the progress of the fire; it requires very little examination to see how it began, and what part; in one of these bars, and in another that matches, it proves the hole was cut, and the combustibles dropped in here, and an hot iron<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170190"/>applied to the brace, and the fire was communicated to it underneath by means of this hot iron, or a candle. These boards which came from the bottom is evidently cut with a sharp knife, so as to avoid being heard by making any noise.</p>
               <p>Jury. Supposing any body for a moment might have dropped a candle in, would not that have fired the place? - It appears very evident from every thing that fire had been placed from the outer part, and not from the inner, for there is the mark of some kind of liquid put outside, as that board will shew you considerably.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not that possible to run out of the deal? - The deal was painted, and therefore not very probable; this is the piece of timber that has the appearance of being burnt with the hot iron; it is an outside piece, and the skirting board on the inside was very much burnt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have described pretty accurately the situation of these parts of the premises; according to your observation of the whole in Molyneux's house, how many tiles did there appear to be removed in order for this aperture to be made? - As to the number of tiles I should suppose there were fifty; the aperture was thirty-eight inches, by eleven; but every lath was evidently broke from withinside, and the bottom laths were evidently bent considerably, by a person standing on them to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the tiles placed that were removed? - Merely as they had slipped down, they were in the gutter.</p>

               <p>Q. You of course being called in some time after the fire, other people had seen the situation of the two houses before you come? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. With regard to the aperture, I think you say, that the ceiling of that part was broke through too? - Yes, so that a person might get out of the garret very easily; I could get out myself; I have got out of openings through buildings less than that, many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You certainly seem to have paid a very laudable care in the examination into this business, you say the place where you suppose the fire to have originated, was a place in which a poker might have gone in, because of the appearances of the wood, is it not possible that a knot of the wood might have fallen out, and that to appearance would it not have made a similar mark? - No, it would be quite a different appearance, and when I view the boards, and see the nature of the materials, there is scarcely a knot in them.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to judge from one part of a board whether there may not be knots in the other? - This board was so very near the place if you examine it, you will find it so.</p>
               <p>Q. You observe that this trunk was inside of this aperture? - This chest and trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. And you observe also that on the sloping boards there are marks of something having run out as from that place; might not the appearance be some liquid substance that run out from the inside? Supposing this combustible matter had been placed behind here, would not this liquid naturally have oozed out? - Not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean that this might have oozed out from the boards, but out of the combustible matter? - No, that, is a very different kind of matter; and if it had oozed out of that, it would have had a very different appearance; what is on the boards has the appearance of some kind of strong turpentine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at the time you made the subsequent enquiry, you went to the prisoner's house and found these things? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards? - Six or seven days.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170191"/>Q. In point of fact you found it there a number of days after the fire happened, consequently if he had put it there he might have removed it? - He was taken into custody before.</p>

               <p>Q. That aperture in the prisoner's house was immediately under the place where the fire had been light; and such a one that he might have gone in and out for the purpose of cleansing the gutter? - Yes, for any occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. These premises we have heard are insured? - I have only heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. If this had been done by the prisoner in consequence of a resentemnt, which we have heard of by the learned gentleman that opened the prosecution, to Mrs. Moon, if that resentment had been in his mind, and he had purposed to have done it, would it not have been done with no more execution by first setting fire to his own house? - It would have been less likely, because it is four feet nine inches above his brick wall, where this timber begins.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing. Mr. Cooper, the prisoner had purposed doing it, in order to secure to himself the amount of the insurance he had on his house, could he have done it with more effect, and with less probability of discovery, by setting fire to his own house? - I think it would as effectually have fired his own house as if he had done it in this way, for in a very short time it must have fell into his own house, because there were dry shavings, and it must have caught to whatever part of the timber was there, which was very light, and very dry; there is no boards under this place but only joists; and I am only astonished that the ceiling did not fall in, that it did not take fire and run all through the house.</p>

            Was it not possible, and more than probable to suppose, in case he had a mind to consume the building, that he had best to set fire to some part or other of his own house? - If the fire had fell in there through the house, and come in with a body of slame, this tared oakum would have took fire immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he kept any servant? - I never see him till I see him before the magistrate; I knew neither party till I was sent for. I don't know that it is proper for to mention an opinion, but the fire after burning his house would have taken away all suspicion from him, and that, I should hope, was the sole motive.</p>
               <p>Q. You will observe, and the principal ground where upon you have been led to form your opinion, that the fire began outside is, because that in some parts there appears a greater aperture outside than inside. Do not boards sometimes burn uneven according to the quality of the boards? - Certainly.</p>

            you armed on this occasion? Tell us what past? -  The first I heard of it was by the watchman's rattle, I laid just opposite, I got out of bed in my shirt and found Mrs. Moon's house all in flames, it appeared so, I went out and I knocked at Mrs. Moon's door, there was no entrance there, I went to Mr. Molyneux's door and knocked with a brick till I broke it in pieces, then after I knocked at Mr. Molyneux's, I saw the maid at Mrs. Moon's door in her shift, then I spoke to the maid, and I told her that I thought the house was on fire, she said it was not her house, it must be next door, I went next door again and there was no appearance of any body coming, I went over the way, I crossed and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that take up? - I do not think the whole course of time was ten minutes, when I came back I put my coat and waistcoat on and returned, I found the door not opened, then I went up in Mrs. Moon's house, up stairs, where there were three or four people in the room were the servant's bed was, one of the young men that was up there, took the bed from the bedstead and chucked it out of the window into the garden, I looked to see where the bed was a going, and I saw Mrs. Molyneux standing at the bottom of her yard in a bed-gown, which I thought from the appearance that somebody was a washing.</p>

            What age was the child? - About five or six years old, and Mr. Molyneux at the same instant was carrying something towards them, a kind of a bundle, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Molyneux appear as to his dress? - He was dressed in a blue coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he dressed completely? - Yes, as far as I could see of him, he had a coat on, I returned from the window and went towards where this mother appeared, which as soon as the bed stead was turned up, the people pulled away some trunks, and when the trunks were pulled away then the fire was seen through the plaistering; the trunk is in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How close was this to the servant's bed? - There was only a chest that stood between; the chest stood at the feet of the bed. Then I bursted the plaistering and made a hole right through with my hands, and I got a blanket and dipped it in a pail of water, and put it through the hole; as soon as we could assist with water sufficient to pull the fire away, I made a hole in the top of Mrs. Moon's room, which was on fire, and got out into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not put the fire out enough to go out at the window? - I had it put out so far as to go out through the hole but the fire was most generally on the outside, and after I got outside, I got the fire out, by pulling down the boards and the assistance of the people bringing me the water, and when I got out I saw a hole in the roof of Molyneux's house about two feet long and one broad; I perceived that before I was out, in getting through, I stood on the roof of Mr. Molyneux's house, and I pulled off the weather board that was hurning, and by the assistance of water that came, I put the fire out; after it was put out I went through the hole back again, that I had got through before. I went down stairs, and got into Molyneux's yard; the door was open, and I was called in to aid and assist to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing between Mrs. Moon and Molyneux? Did you say any thing to Molyneux, or Molyneux to you? - Not any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Molyneux taken into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the fire had been put out? - Immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had entinguished the fire did you go to Molyneux's house? - Yes; I went into the parlour first.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us every thing you have seen and observed there. - There was a deal table stood against the wall, and there was part of a glass or a kind of frame of a picture hanging on the side of it, and five or six plates in the cupboard. I looked at the fire grate, and there was a piece of wood on the fire about half consumed; there were two tongs at the side of the grate, and two pokers under it. I went from that to the door of the back room, and all that I saw and could find was two hat boxes, one upon the other. No more furniture at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did you see the deal table? - In the parlour a kind of a deal table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs? - I did not; I returned to the garden, and the constable told me to aid and assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in his garden? - Not quite down to the bottom; there was linen and furniture down at the bottom of the garden; and I saw a cradle stand.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. What furniture did you see in the garden. - I saw linen and a candle; I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170194"/>Q. Then there may be chairs for what you know? - There might, but I did not perceive any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation when you was about extinguishing the fire in the weather boarding? - Three holes; two of them rather small, and of them a largish hole, that I could put my thumb in; it appeared to me to be made as if a poker or something hot had been run into all the three.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the other two holes? - Not quite so big.</p>

            From the judgement that you formed on the spot, with all the circumstances about you, did it or did it not strike you, that the fire was by these means? - Yes; it appeared to be done with something of a poker or a piece of iron of the same size, burnt in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You observed, that after you perceived this fire, you got up a brick bat, and knocked at both these houses, Mrs. Moon's and Mrs. Molyneux's? - I I knocked at Mrs. Moon's with the knocker.</p>

               <p>Q. Some time after this Mrs. Moon's servant came to the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went into the house, and so out along to the garret, where the fire was particularly observed? - I returned over the way first, where I had lodging, to put my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to this garret, you pushed out a parcel of these boards that were on fire? - No, when I came up, there was a young man putting a bed out of window.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact. You pushed something out of window; you pushed against these boards that were on fire, of consequence part of these boards must have fallen down into the gutter, and likewise all these things might have fallen down with the boards for any thing you know? I take it for granted, that pulling out these boards made a number of holes or apertures in these boards? - It was a part that I pushed out where I had seen these holes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man in his garden, saving some of his furniture? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said something about a piece of wood in the parlour grate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was no danger to be apprehended from that. You asked for a light I understand? - I was not the first person that entered Mrs. Moon's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask for a light there? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you the least idea that your pushing against these boards could have occasioned these three holes? - Not in the least.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed on this night by the watchman; I got up into Mrs. Moon's apartment; I looked about, and see no fire, but smoke; I got out at the front window, which was the garret, and went on the parapet to Mrs. Molyneux's gable, and got to the ridge of the gable end, and there I saw the fire. It had the appearance to be lighted on the outside in three places.</p>
               <p>Court to Emery. What occasion had you to make a hole? - Because we could not get into the gutter without getting down six or eight feet.</p>
               <p>Banks. I went out of this window to see where the fire was; I goes then from this place again into Mrs. Moon, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170195"/>told her, it was not Molyneux's house, it was her house, on fire, which I conceived was set on fire; the fire seemed to come from three places; and I then run down to my own house.</p>
               <p>Court to Emery. You saw three holes. How far did they appear apart from each other? - About five or six inches apart.</p>
               <p>Court to Banks. You say the fire appeared to be in three places. At what distance did they appear from each other? - I cannot tell the distance; it looked to be light in three places, and they soon consumed together. After I had been home I came back again, and they seemed to have damped the fire, and I went down again, and told my wife to stop taking the things away, for the fire was mastered. I was employed to point the tiling of her house three or four weeks before this happened; I saw that hole in Molyneux's house on the 14th of August last, because we were above there on her building.</p>

            Was there any thing to cover that hole? - There were two bits of boards put together, and a bar laid across it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these premises after the fire? - Yes; and then the door laid by the side of that hole, when I saw the flames not covering that hole, but by the side of it, I could see the hole plain, I said it was set on fire on the outside, but I cannot say who set it on fire. It was impossible for any body to get into this gutter without a ladder of thirty feet long, or else a person must have come out of Mrs. Moon's premises the way I did, and get down six or eight feet, or else through that hole in Molyneux's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You seem very positive that this fire must have been on the outside. You cannot be positive sure? - Yes, I am. I saw it burning outside, and not within, and nothing but smoke in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem also to have said, with not a little emphasis, that when you perceived the fire, you was at your own house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's house is between you and Mrs. Moon's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, when you went to the prisoner's house, ask for a light? - No, I never went into his house at all.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it must have been set on fire on the outside. Could they get there from your house? - No, they could not; there are no parapets, they are old houses.</p>

            What was the circumstance that happened to take your attention? - I was going to bed, which is the general hour I go to bed, and my family likewise; before I get to bed, I always make it a constant rule to look out at my bedroom window, to see that all is safe; and when I was looking out, I see the prisoner Molyneux with a lighted candle in his hand passing to and fro, from a little wash-house that adjoins his dwelling to the further end of the shed, at the bottom of his garden, and some person with him, who appeared as a woman, I apprehended he meant to move off, and go away. The shed stands in a narrow place, about the width of this table; there was some person with him, by the hand it appeared to me to be a woman's; and I only see the hand, handing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170196"/>things to him; it struck me at that time he was moving off. I rather was curious in seeing what he meant to do; it obliged me to fit up till almost two or three o'clock; I missed him several times in the night, and I saw a light glimmering in some part of his windows, sometimes in the back part of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more particular strike you? - I was apprehensive, my stable being broke open before.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge now is whether that man set fire to your house; he is not charged with any one thing beside, therefore do not tell us of any suspicion. - I do not know any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you was alarmed with any call of fire? - About five minutes after four.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you first receive the alarm? - From the watchman knocking at my door very violently.</p>

            What is your family? - Myself, one maid servant, and one man servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the family of the prisoner consists of? - He has a wife and two children, the oldest about four, and other about two, both girls.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was alarmed by the cry of fire what did you? - When the watchman knocked at my door I instantly got out of bed, and I said, Holt, what is the matter, he said there is a fire next door; and as I was running to my next room, I called to my servants directly to go down and open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did the fire make this apperance? - In the room where the boy slept, and the adjoining room, where my maid slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room yourself? - No; all was done by other people that came in when the door was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man, or his wife, any farther than living adjoining to them? - He went away two years and a half from the premises; in his absence the children were always still and quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of going into the house, to see how the furniture was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Molyneux at all that morning? - After some neighbours had got into the yard, and they seemed not very hasty in taking him, I said, Oh! you wretch, you have done it, for I have watched you till three or four o'clock this morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they either of them make any answer to you? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You say you keep two servants; I take it for granted they are very attentive of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems so, because the very moment you called them they came down stairs; I take it for granted they could not be very fast asleep at the time you called them. You say you don't know any thing of these people before, only neighbours? - No, only neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you never had paid a debt for the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did.</p>

            Then how can you pretend to say, that you never knew them before? - I have got no further to say, than that they only asked me that favour.</p>
               <p>Court to the Counsel. She told you that she did not know any harm of them, and that they behaved peaceably before, and you are not satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Have you ever gone to the prisoner's house since he left it. - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you ever remember having any conversation with the wife of the prisoner at that time? - I went to speak to her, and I gave three shillings and sixpence for the rellef of her and her children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to this woman, that if you did not convict the prisoner for this indictment, that you would prefer some other against him, and endeavour to transport him? - No, not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any thing like it? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a light about two? - Yes; it was in his own bed room window, it shaded against the rails, that is round my garden.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten you observed the light in the wash-house and shed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you own light move about? - No; I put my own light in the next room, my drawing room.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the window of the drawing room look into the garden? - No; it looks into the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your own people gone to bed? - Yes; I always see my servants a bed before I go to bed myself; I always see every candle put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that these lights that you saw playing about in your garden were from his house? - I think it was so; I did not open my window.</p>

He went down stairs, and I went down after him; with that, my mistress gave me the keys, and told me to go down stairs, and open the street door; with that, when I got to my mistress's door, my mistress said, Mary, they don't hear at the next door; with that my mistress rattled the rattle out of window, and I went to mistress's room window, and looked out, and there I saw Mrs. Molyneux standing in the yard, and her little girl Nancy by the side of her; she was quite perfectly dressed, had on a black stuff gown, quite dressed, with a round eared cap, with a little bow knot.

               <p>Q. After that what did you do? - I returned, and came into the garret after Mr. Banks. I got out at the garret window, and I saw the boards on fire outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it proceed from the outside? - Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the weather boards more than the other on fire? - I could not really perceive any one part, but I see it in a blaze.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the exact place? - Yes, on the board. It seemed to me to be set on fire right opposite the hole underneath, in the prisoner's house, in the top of the roof.</p>
               <p>OSBORNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Mrs. Moon's house on the alarm of the fire; Mrs. Moon's door was open; Mr. Molyneux's was not; I went up stairs, and see Mrs. Moon on the stairs in very great distress. I went up to the back garret, and the room was full of smoke; the fire was then penetrating the roof; as soon as it was convenient I got through, and put the board that was on fire into the gutter; I put it there, and then I searched about, and I found a hole above the near board that lies on the top of the brick work; that hole was made by some instrument, by what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170199"/>cannot tell; it was on the top edge of the near board, and the bottom of the weather board, and I instantly broke the board, to see if there was any fire put in there, but there was not. It was out then.</p>
               <p>Court. There had been a fire in that hole then? - Yes, there had. As soon as the fire was out I perceived a light coming up from Mr. Molyneux's house; it was Mr. Molyneux himself, and two or three more evidences, and I went through that hole into the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was you able to get through, was it large enough for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these boards first of all; are these the boards that you discovered? - That is one; that is the near board; this is part of the board that I broke, that is the other. This was whole before I broke it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the same state in which Mr. Cooper first examined them? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went through the hole into the prisoner's house? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in the garret? - I did not see any thing at all in the gariet, I did not search closely. In the front dining room there was a bed, in the back kitchen there were some wooden wares, in a couple of boxes in the wash house adjoining the shed there were plates and dishes, and saucers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any boxes near? - Yes, two or three boxes or chests; and when we came into the kitchen there was a chest locked, which Mr. Thirlwall insisted on having opened, and that was packed with every kind of linen. It seemed as if it was quite full; I did not take the things out; this was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you opened it? - I did not open it, the Reverend Mr. Thirlwall and others that were in the kitchen opened it, I only looked on; there were a part of the goods in the further end of the garden.</p>

            What time was you alarmed? - About twenty minutes past four, as near as I can recollect. I went to the spot; I immediately went up Mrs. Moon's stairs into the garret where the fire was supposed to have communicated. On inspection of the premises a very violent suspicion was immediately impressed on my mind that it was the effect of design beyond all question. I went down stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170200"/>went into Mr. Molyneux's house and saw a woman in the yard, and found it was Mrs. Molyneux; she was with her two children, and seemed to have some kind of bed clothes in the yard. I enquired where her husband was? she informed me he was in the house. In searching for him I was informed that he was up stairs shewing one or two persons the premises. As soon as I got to him I immediately gave him in charge to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you? - Nothing, only which is Mr. Molyneux? I am, says he, I gave him charge, and the constable took him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the house, whether there were articles of furniture about in different places? - I examined the house very minutely, and that confirmed my suspicion; out of nine rooms there were seven compleatly empty.</p>

            What were the articles that you noticed in these rooms? - In the one pair of stairs there was one bed, in a very miserable condition; it seemed to have been a post bed, but there were no posts, and the bedding in a confused state, as if it was wrapped up with the intention of being taken out, and a broken chair or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any box that you directed to be opened? - Yes, it was in the back kitchen. I afterwards went into the back kitchen, there I saw a box; I directed it to be opened, and found it full of clean linen, and removed from the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How large might it be? - Considerable large, as much as two men with difficulty could carry; the linen all clean, and packed in that box that stood in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observations of what there might be there, or in the shed? - I went into the shed that communicates with the back kitchen, and found there some china; there was a trunk which I directed to be opened, and found it contained his papers; he is a professional man as an engineer; paper and other things of considerable value; and in that shed there was a door through which it could have been conveyed if there had been any apprehension of the fire spreading: all these things could have been conveyed through that door without any difficulty into the garden.</p>

               <p>Q. Out of the garden could they have been conveyed? - O, yes! Indeed his wife begged that the greatest care might be taken of these papers, because they belonged to her husband, and they were of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time you did not hold any conversation with him? - Not at all. I desired immediately another constable to go with him, because I felt it my duty to have the woman apprehended also, and desired that no communication might pass between the man and his wife till they were brought to a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was taken to the watch house? - She was in charge of a constable, and in the course of the day taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. When you saw the house on fire; undoubtedly you was angry and irritated, supposing a man capable of doing such a transaction? - The fire was extinguished before I arrived.</p>

            Still resentment continued? - No. I never knew the man, I thought it my duty to act wherever a suspicion would have harboured in my mind, I would have taken you up if I had any ground for suspicion, but I had no agitation of mind than what arose entirely in the mind of any man.</p>
               <p>Court. You see these things ready to be removed and packed; was there any thing in the appearance of these things which led you to think they might not all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170201"/>he put in that condition in the course of a few hours? Might not the linen be packed in that trunk, and the china be so placed in the course of half an hour, if they knew there was a fire in the house, and they wanted to remove them? - From the time that the fire was said to happen, and from the time that I was in the house, there might be time, but it appears to me there were people in the house a quarter of an hour before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not these things he packed up in the course of half an hour? - I think they might.</p>

I asked the night constable if they had been up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - I suppose it was about twenty minutes, or half past four, and the prisoner came into the kitchen and struck a light.</p>

            ; the prisoner was in the garden, and he went into the kitchen and got the tinder box, and began to strike a light; they had none when I went in, and with his striking a light, I said Mr. Molyneux I wish you would make haste; the answer was, I will make as much haste as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not day break? - It was light.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Court. You observed this hole in the rafters? - Between two rafters, the lath and plaistering cut away, and the tiles off, I then asked the prisoner what that hole was for? he told me to go out to repair the top of the house, or words to that effect. I told him Mr. Molyneux this has a very bad appearance, and much about that time Mr. Thirlwall came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Molyneux make you answer to that observation? - No answer at all.</p>

On Thursday morning, a little after four o'clock, my bell rang very violently, I got out to my window, and they told me there was a fire in Mr. Moon's, or the next door to it. When I went to Molyneux's, the door was just opened, and the night constable and several more going in; they had requested Molyneux to strike a light which he hesitated very much about.</p>
               <p>Q. You desired him? - No, he was desired, not by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take the light with him? - He took the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him up stairs? - I, and the night constable, and him altogether went up stairs. We looked on the first floor, went into the room on the first floor; there was nothing particular there; we then went up to the second floor, there was nothing particular there; he then made a stand, and hesitated about going up further, saying, how there was nothing more to be seen than what we see there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the fire was out? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the fire to be out at the time? - They told me the fire was just extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you persist in going up stairs not with standing this? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing else when you did persist in this? - I don't recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go up stairs? - He went up stairs; we went up to the upper story immediately, on the landing place we discovered a hole big enough for a person to get out; some one person asked him for what purpose that hole was made; he answered it was for repairing the house. He was then asked how long it had been there? - he first said two months, then on being asked by somebody else, he said three or four months, we see then evidently through that hole where the fire had been applied.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe particularly the appearance of the hole. - The hole was made in the roof, between two joists, against, it there was a gutter, and at the other side of the gutter was Mrs. Moon's house weather board, at the bottom of which there appeared to be some holes made for some reason or other, apparently by some hot iron, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner and his wife and children at that time? did they appear to be dreft? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me what the articles were that you found? - It seemed to me to be a piece of new picked oakum and tarred.</p>

Be so good as to describe particularly where this; hole was in which you found the oakum? - It was in the front garret, the cieling runs up in this manner, and in the opposite part to where the fire was, in the cieling, there I found this oakum in this opposite side to where the fire had happened in Mrs. Moon's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it immediately opposite? - No, as I went up stairs, I went into the hole, and this was in the garret.</p>

After the constable was given charge he charged me to aid and assist. I went into the yard with him; he said he wanted something to say to his wife; when he got to her he told her that he was going to the watch house, and as soon as the people were gone out of the place to shut the door up and come with him to the watch-house; he then went, as if he was going out to the road, and he then went back again and asked her for some money; she gave him a shilling, and then he went out; as he was turning again she said this is all through you; he immediately turned back, and says this is not a time to have any words.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you an occasion at any time to take the contents of your stock? - I had on the 12d of June last. It is customary for us to take it once a year; we are assisted by five or six of the trade; I found my stock four hundred and odd pounds at the time deficient of the sum it should be of the money that I had taken in trade that year.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence, did you search any box or trunk in your shop? - I recollected Barney's telling me the Sunday morning, that there was a trunk that contained clothes and other things for nine pounds nine shillings of his taking in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else but what there was a trunk? - The trunk had a ticket on it for nine pounds nine shillings in the name of Cooper, in Barney's hand writing; when we opened the trunk, which we were obliged to break open, what should it contain but chiefly his own wearing apparel, and other things, his property; a watch, and a pair of spurs, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any property particularly that did not belong to him? - There was a shirt that we found; the shirt is here; I brought it here; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose that is? - It is my property; it has been worn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You took stock the 22d of June? - I did.</p>

            How am I to know when he was discharged, or the Jury, or any body else? - To the best of my knowledge, the 3d of August. He was in the Hospital for a broken leg, which he got in his pleasure, and I could not accuse him while he was in the Hospital; I went before the magistrate and spoke of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, man, did you go before a magistrate and give any information about your suspicion of stealing the shirt till the 3d of August? Now we are on tender ground let us go on quietly? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you that you did not accuse him till the 3d of August, because he was in an Hospital for a bad leg? - I was at the justice's before this to accuse him of making false pawns, but as to the shirt I did not accuse him of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you was before the magistrate, and accused him of several other things, but not of this till the 3d of August? - I did; and you was present, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. If the reason of your not accusing him was being in the Hospital, how came you to accuse him at all of any thing? - Because he told me that there was a parcel for nine pounds nine shillings, which when opened consisted of nothing but his own clothes. My son discovered this shirt before we went to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son did. You never saw that shirt in your possession till your son accused him of taking it, and told you it was your's? - I never saw the shirt in my possession till my son found the parcel, and compared it with other shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet here, before the Gentlemen of the Jury, you have already positively sworn it is your shirt? - I never saw it in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you come here and call God to witness, that you never saw it in your life? - I saw it as soon as it was found in the trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170206"/>Q. And yet you swear positively on your oath it is your's. On your oath, did you ever live in this No. 154, Gravel-lane? - Almost seventeen years ago; in general I sleep there two or three nights in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath that you have taken, has there been any two persons on worse terms than that young man and your son? Has there not been continual quarrels between your son and that young man? - I don't know of any quarrels between my son and the prisoner; I know he has been very disturbing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that they have been on very bad terms, and have been so for a long time? - Not that I know; I am sure it is quite new to me; I don't understand your meaning; my son did no business in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your son has not always spoken unfavourably of him, and he of your son; has not he complained of ill usage from your son? - My son does not interfere at all in the shop in Gravel-lane; he is at the shop in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The reason you did not make your accusation of him before, was because he was in the Hospital with a broken leg? - That was my sole motive.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken out any warrant against him for stealing this shirt? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - About the 1st of August; I shewed him all the favour I could.</p>
               <p>Court. You had taken stock the 22d of June? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was there at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this shirt found? - On the 25th we opened the trunk, that was on Wednesday, and the shirt was not found till the 27th, by my son's information.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shirt found in your presence? - It was in my presence, with other things, and he had it in wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present besides you? - My son, and William Pomfret; I believe; I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time? - He was in the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner go to the Hospital? - He got his leg broke on Sunday, the very day that we took stock; we cannot do it on another day in our business, because the people coming in and out so; he broke his leg on the 22d in the afternoon, he went out on his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when this shirt was found? - I was present when the trunk was broke open, and the first thing I took up was this shirt; it belongs to a pledge; it is a particular made shirt; a foreign made shirt, and the sleeves are strait sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shirts were pledged with it? - Four shirts and two waistcoats, all for a guinea; they were pawned last January was a twelvemonth, they are my property now, because they are unredeemed, and the person is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken it into your stock? - It had been entered as part of my stock. I have not got that book, because it is a book so long back that this pledge was put down in.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son he carried on the pawnbrokering business for you in the Minories? - Yes; he carried it on for me there, No. 105.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not any thing at all to do with this shop in Old Gravel-lane? - No, only assisting me to take stock.</p>
               <p>Q. He never took in pledges nor made entries in your books? - No; and when I missed so much property as four hundred pounds, I was determined to follow the business no longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170207"/>Q. Then all you know is, that this is made like the others? - Yes; the gussets are made down low in the shirt.</p>

            When you receive these pledges you make an entry in a book? - When we receive a pledge of five shillings we make an entry in a book, and put them up in some part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you keep your book which refers to the different pledges, and when these are forfeited you take off the different duplicates that were on the goods and enter it as so much stock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This had been in your warehouse locked up safely for a year and a half? - This had been in my warehouse, but I never had any account of it; it was, as I judge of it, concealed by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being with your father when you opened any trunk? - I was present; I brought it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a pawnbroker in the Minories, No. 105. On Wednesday, the 25th of June, I opened the trunk; the first thing I see was this shirt rolled up; going a little further I found a coat; I found different things, some things I knew to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that shirt to be his? - No; I know it to be one belonging to a parcel that I found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any thing to do with this business in Gravel-lane? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ticket on this trunk? - There was for nine guineas, of the name of Cooper.</p>
               <p> Mr. Ager. How many people have you and your father prosecuted this Session? - Not one except Barney and Curling.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you prosecuted a woman this Session? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - I did not give evidence against any one; but my father has.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is there any one individual in his business that he has not one time or other prosecuted? - No other than these three.</p>
               <p>Court. How many parcels did you tumble over in this warehouse? - This was the first parcel I opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know what parcel to tell you to bring down stairs? - Barney told me in the morning that there was a trunk of nine guineas, and my father said bring it down stairs and I will look over it. There were a great many pledges there besides this one.</p>
               <p>Q. But you was so unfortunate as to hit on this first? - There were cupboards in this warehouse where this was found, and household furniture in the same warehouse; this trunk laid in a chair out of the cupboard; the ticket was pinned to the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this been written? - January 1793. January 14, 1793, Sarah Laws, four shirts and two waistcoats, one pound one shilling and a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Sarah Laws? - She is not here. I issued out a subpoena out of the office; she was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jury. Your father said the person was dead? - She pawned them for a man that is since dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the book? - It is not here; it has been sold among some more old books.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that shirt? - By its remarkable make.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out Sarah Laws? - My father found her out; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take in that pledge at all? - I never did any business there.</p>
               <p>Q. To Matthews the elder. How long have you been a pawnbroker? - Near seventeen years.</p>

               <p>Q. You did a great deal of business in Gravel-lane? - We did some business; we took in about one hundred things a day.</p>

What reason have you to accuse this young man, independent of your suspicion, and the idle mode of their living? - There was a milk pot taken in for pledge for twelve shillings and six-pence, and it was ticketed for five pounds; it is a false pawn. When they found I was going to cast up my stock, they knowing of course what they had done, they made up all these false pawns to deceive me in the stock, that I should not know what they had done.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what past the 25th of August, what time did he come in the morning? - Five o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him come? - No, I did not; I see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular after you came into the warehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a board? - He went up into the lost to work, and took a board, and he put a board down, a deal twelve feet three inches, with one cut in the middle; he put it down from the lost, and he came down the steps and put it down into the cellar, and I was getting out of bed at the same time, and went across the place to make water, and I said, Elkins, mind you shut the slap up; he said, very well, and I went to bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he put it? - He put it against the lost ladder on the floor, then he went down the cellar, and I don't know what he did there, and I went into bed.</p>

            When did you get up? - About an hour afterwards. I did not see any thing at all of the deal after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Elkins? - He came in doors just as we were getting up, and then he said he did not like to disturb master, for fear of making us get up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that? - I really cannot tell you. He was to have done work below, in making a door, and therefore he went up into the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up? - About half after six, between six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that deal board again if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So then he brought down a deal from the lost, and put it down into your master's premises, and what became of it you don't know; you went to bed not seeing of it, and when he came back again he was to have done some work, but he did not like to disturb his master.</p>

            What time of that day did you first see him? - About ten minutes past five in the morning, as I was standing at the corner of Little Carter-lane, I see him come round Distaff-lane with a twelve foot three inch deal on his shoulder, with one cut in it edgeways; it was about sixty yards from his master's house where I stood. I had a suspicion of him, I ran to Mr. Webb's house to see if Mr. Webb's shop was open, I saw the door was about an inch open, I ran and followed him; he pitched the deal against the Cock in the Corner, at the court called Cock-court; the mark of the deal was outwards when he first pitched it, and before that I saw the mark on his shoulder; he went into this public house, I imagined to get something to drink; he came out and took the deal on his shoulder, and I walked on this side of the way up the Old-bailey, following him to see where he would go with it; and he went and pitched the deal against Mr. Hayward's door, in Fleet-lane, the middle door, there are three doors to the house; I think it was the middle door, he has three houses made into one I think it is. Seeing him pitch the deal there, I went back to acquaint Mr. Webb, he walked backwards and forwards before Mr. Hayward's door for some time, but the house was not open. I came back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170210"/>Mr. Webb, I sent for him to a neighbour's house; it was nine o'clock before Mr. Webb was stirring, and I informed him what I had seen; in consequence of that we went back to Mr. Hayward's, and went to the door where we saw the deal pitched up, and the deal was in the passage of that house, leading to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you then tell it was the same deal? - Yes, on account of the particular mark.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you get to Hayward's house? - About five minutes past nine. Mr. Hayward was offering the deal to fell to Mr. Wessell, at the corner of Fleet-lane, in the Old-bailey; Mr. Wessell said it was too thick. Mr. Webb thought he would go and offer to buy it himself; I did not go in; when he came out, he said, that is my deal, I will swear to it. It was Mr. Wessell said, it was too thick; Mr. Hayward said he had got thinner.</p>

             the deal you left him to do the best he could? - I did. I went to fetch a constable, I came back with the constable, and Mr. Webb gave charge of Mr. Hayward to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hayward say any thing at that time? - Nothing further than that he would go with him. I am positive it is the same deal, it is marked with a stroke on the top with red chalk. The deal is here to be produced.</p>
               <p>Herbert. This is the same deal he put down by the ladder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Combley. I understand that this deal was put into the passage, and not into the house? - It certainly must form part of the dwelling house, because it leads to a pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that these premises belong to Mr. Hayward? - It is my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you know of your own knowledge these were Hayward's premises? - I cannot tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You past a cart of deals in the Old-bailey? - Yes, they were loading at Mr. Trinder's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not some such sorts of deal in this cart? - No, his work was prepared work, going to a job, framed doors and partitions that were put into that cart.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary and surgeon, in the Old-bailey. The prisoner Hayward sent me word by a messenger he had got some deals to fell. I went to Hayward's house, I saw one in the passage, which, I said, was too thick; it did not suit my purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that passage part of Mr. Hayward's premises? - I cannot be positive; I have no doubt of it. When I said it was too thick, he took me into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of bargaining with him? - He sent me word that he had got a number of deals for flooring boards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you them intending to have sold you them, if you had liked them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe this particular deal? - I observed no particular marks in it, it was sawed in two, one cut in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that deal. - That is my deal. In consequence of some information I had from Combly I came into Fleet-lane, to Hayward's house; this deal was standing in the passage against the stair case, because there was not height enough for it to stand up, and Mr. Hayward and Mr. Wessell were in the passage, and Mr. Wessell had his rule in his hand, taking the width of the deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other deal there? - No other deal at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Wessell there taking measure of it? - Yes; Hayward came from the passage, and went to the next door, and opened the cellar window, and he put up some battens for Mr. Wessell to take measure of them. In consequence of that I went down to the cellar to him; I told him I wanted some thin stuff; I brought them all to the cellar window and examined them, and I was pretty sure they were all my own deals, I put them all up to the window, and then we came out of the cellar, and I asked Hayward whether he had any more? He said, he had no more. He came into the street, and I fetched this deal and laid them all down in the street together; I told him they were all my property, and that I had sent for the man that had brought that very deal to him that very morning; says he, if they are your's don't make a noise with them in the street, come in doors with me, let us go and talk about it, if they are your property you shall take them all away, and I will give you any indemnification whatever, that you shall have no trouble about them, if I would take them away quietly. In consequence of that I went in doors and waited till Mr. Combly came with the constable. He told me that a man had brought them there in order to repair his house, to do odd jobs with them; he said, that the man brought him doors and sashes, and every thing that he usually had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hayward. Did not I say to you, that when it was brought I was in bed, and I did not know how it came there? - You said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hayward. I did; and I told him there were two carpenters in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What sort of a shop is this? - It is an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the deal? - It cost me three shillings and three-pence. Then I secured him, and had him in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you went to his house the door was open and this deal stood in the passage? - The door wasopen.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said they had been brought to him by a man who had left them there that was to do some odd work with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say at the time, that when these deals were brought there he was in bed. Recollect yourself. Might he say so or not? - I am pretty sure he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 25th of August, any deal boards being brought to Mr. Hayward? - My business calls me up early in a morning; as I was looking out of the window I saw a man pitch a deal against a house; he then seemingly opened a door and put the deal in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Hayward was in bed at that time? - I imagine he was a-bed.</p>
               <p>Court. This spot is in Fleet-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a man come and pitch a deal board against a house, what house? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have lived there? - Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it? - There were three doors together, and it was the middle door of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the first door? - It was a green shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the next door? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the third door? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a laundress, and I confine myself to my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man when he pitched the deal against the house? - It seemed to me he put his finger on a Latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk back ward and forward by this door? - He stood with his back to it, he opened the door, put the deal in, and stopped a minute or two, and came out, and shut the door after him, and came down the lane, and went down the lane as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house did he go into then? - He knocked twice as he past Mr. Hay- ward's door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the house of Mr. Hayward that he went in? - About three doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses has Mr. Hayward there? - I don't know, he keeps an iron shop in one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that one of the three doors? - No, it is above the iron shop, where the man put the board. Mr. Hayward, after a few minutes, came down and went into this house, and stopped about two or three minutes, and then came back, and opened his own shop, and I went in to my business. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a new thing, bringing the things early in the morning there? - Upon my word I cannot undertake to say that; I never saw none brought before.</p>
               <p>Q. Never happened to be up? - O, sir, I am up very early, generally at four o'clock.</p>

You have now been found guilty by a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170213"/>very attentive jury, in consequence of that verdict, I must pass that sentence which the law demands, and which you richly merit; you have been the means of bringing many a man to this place; I therefore do not regret that that law has laid hold of you; the law has inflicted a punishment on you, twice as severe as that of the principal, because very likely you have been the means of inticing that man to rob his master; it is no extenuation of him, but it is an aggravation of your offence.

I was robbed on Thursday, the 31st of July, about eight o'clock in the evening; I was serving another woman with a petticoat, on the opposite counter, to which this woman and another came in, on which counter, opposite to where I was, some cotton were laid, they began looking among, then to reach over; I said, what do you please to want? they gave me no answer, they kept among these goods; while I was cutting this young woman her petticoat, I perceived they stood remarkable close to each other, which gave me a suspicion that they were not about any good; as we are pretty well used to these kind of people, and I observed the prisoner at the bar her gown stick out rather further than what I thought was necessary for it to do; I concluded she had something, I saw the the gown move in fact; I immediately went round the counter that I was at, and went between them, and laid my hand on her clothes, and turned her round, and then I went and looked in, and found that piece of cotton, that will be produced, under her clothes, seven yards of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a cloak on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it under her cloak or gown? - Under her gown, secreted; I secured both the women, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the other not here? - I fancy the grand jury cast the bill out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the property? - The constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you delivered the same you took from the woman to the constable? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - Twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have told us now every thing you said before my Lord Mayor? - Every thing that is necessary, respecting that business.</p>
               <p>Q. So you judge what is necessary? - Yes; I have nothing to say about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pulled the print from the prisoner's gown, did you say so before the Lord Mayor? - I said from her clothes, I said so before the Lord Mayor, I think so, if I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you will swear; on your oath did you say before the Lord Mayor, did you say that you took the print from her clothes? - I said I took it from the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that? - I cannot recollect what I said before the Lord Mayor, I cannot take my oath about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you what you did say, you said this, that Morton dropped the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170214"/>piece of printed cotton? - I said before the Lord Mayor, that I laid my hand on her, and turned her round, and the things sell from her clothes, and I took them.</p>

               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner at the bar a child in her arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Fielding was there, you know that we know her pretty well? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. On your Oath don't you know that the grand jury threw out the bill; how many persons have you prosecuted here, within these few years, in this very place? - That is no consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer? - To tell the truth, I never was in this court before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you prosecuted any before magistrates? - Not before this court.</p>
               <p>Q. How many have you prosecuted before justices of the peace? You don't hear me? - Yes, I do, but I don't think it wants an answer; suppose I have prosecuted twenty, what is that to the business.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have you charged with different things, and received money in order to drop the prosecution? - I came here to speak the truth, and you shall not put me out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took the cotton from her; upon your oath did not you take it out of her hand? - She said she was coming to bring it to me, to ask me the price, but she had no business with it under her clothes in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had her searched I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you find on her? - Nothing at all but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found nothing in her pockets, no child's clouts, or any thing of that sort? - The constable examined her, you must ask the constable that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see clouts? - Yes, I believe there were some.</p>

            ) I see stealing the wool; on Friday, the 25th of August, about the hour of twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell, I was at Mr. Dolland's, and was standing against the window, washing my hands, and I saw this man going along, and he stopped nearly opposite to the school; I see him get up to the top of the wheel of the cart, and list up the middlemost bag in the cart, the cart was loaded with bags, there were three bags laid across the body of the cart; he listed up the middlemost of the three, so that he got into the cart, and let the bag rest on his shoulder; after that I see his hand move, as if he was drawing something out of the bag, I could distinguish he was taking something, but could not tell what; I kept my eye on him, and it seemed as if he was stowing it away to somewhere else in the cart, and then he seemed as if he was fastening the bag up again; I did not see him take the wool out of the cart till afterwards, he put the bag down in its place again, and got off the cart; I put my coat on, and ran down stairs immediately, and followed the cart immediately, till it got nearly between Queen's-court and Queen's Arms tavern, there he stopped his cart again; I stepped off the pavement, and went against the iron rails of the church, to see what he was going to do, and he got up on the top of the wheel, and he turned about, as if he was looking at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170216"/>me, and I thought that he saw me, and I turned my head away, and pulled out my watch, as though to see what it was o'clock, and I see him take the basket out of the cart, and bang it underneath the axle-tree of his cart; it is the basket they carry their hay in; after he had done that he went on, and I followed him down into Fleet-market, down at the Arrow public house, there he stopped, and called for a pint of beer, when he called for the pint of beer he drank once out of it, and this other man, that is standing there, he beckoned to him, and he came to him, Watley beckoned to Hill, they drank together, and tasked together for about the space of three minutes, after they had talked together a space of time, Hill went up as if he was going up towards Fleet-street way, and Watley went on with his cart, there was a cart at the Angel door, and there Watley stopped, and took the basket that was at his own cart, and put it to the cart that stood at the Angel door.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Watley at the time that Hill went towards Fleet-street? - He was going on towards Snow-hill; I took the number of that cart at the Angel, 25290, Thomas Potter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then discover, or have you discovered since, who was the driver of that cart at the Angel door? - We had not discovered then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any driver by it at that time? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between twelve and one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - After I see him put the basket up into that cart, I followed Watley down to the Swan inn, where this wool was going to be unloaded; as soon as ever he had got into that inn, he set his cart there, and went away and left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the basket after he put it to the cart at the Angel door? - I do not, I still kept following Watley, and left the basket to take its chance.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left his cart? - He left his horse, cart and bags, and all in the Swan inn, and went out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way Watley went towards? - Fleet-market way, towards where he had left the basket; after I got into the inn, I asked the bookkeeper -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will not hear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stay to watch Watley where he left the cart, or give information to the inn? - I gave information to Mr. Palmer, the book-keeper, I went and asked him if he could tell me was the wool belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he the book-keeper of the inn? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He got up on the bags and looked at them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct him to the middlemost bag? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the middlemost bag when Palmer took it, and did you observe any opening of the bag? - It appeared to me that there had been wool taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been done? - It appeared to have been opened at one side, by the string being cut where it had been sewed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the contents of the bag was? - Yes, spanish wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to have been opened and sewed up again? - It was a string run from one end of the bag to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that the bag had been opened? - It appeared to me that the string had been cut, and drawed out so that it could be put in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been drawn up again? - Yes, but still there was the appearance of its having been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer weigh the bag in your prefence? - Yes; I went with the person that went with the weight of the bag,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170217"/>and by their books it appeared it was deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brookes is a wool broker, is not he? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Hill afterwards, or Watley? - Watley came back again and was taxed about this wool, and denied it; I gave charge of him myself; Mr. Palmer taxed him about it; he said he knew nothing at all about it; he said I was a false man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mr. Dolland still? - Yes, I have been there these two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing afterwards of the basket or Hill? - I never see any thing of the basket after I see him put it on the cart. Mr. Palmer and I went to look after it, but the basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? - To the Angel door; the cart was standing there, but the basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Potter about the number of the cart? - I gave information to Mr. Brookes, I did not go to see after Mr. Potter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Lynch, you live with Mr. Dolland? - I work for him in his own house; I have worked so for upwards of these two years.</p>

            Nothing else struck you at all? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it was pretty odd that a man should get up in a cart in St. Paul's Church yard? - Whether it was odd or no he certainly did, that there side is not so public as the other side is.</p>
               <p>Q. The carriages go all round by the school? - But I don't think that there was a carriage come by.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that you did not take notice where there were any carriages came by? - They might, but I did not fix my eye on them. I fixed my eye on this man, that was my object.</p>
               <p>Q. This took up a consideraole time; you followed him down to the Arrow public-house; you must have passed a great number of persons in that space? - I kept close by the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you stuck to that like a leech, but you must have passed a great number of persons? - Without a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you see this business carrying forward, a man robbing his master, you did not mention it to any body in the course of that space? - No; I never stopped to speak to any body; I never mentioned it to any body till I got down to the inn, and then I mentioned it to the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Watley came back to the inn, you tell us, and there he was apprehended? - Yes, he came back again after he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. And then was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was taxed with it, and denied it? - That was very impudent, after you had seen him do all this in open day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Come let us have a word with you. The first time you see the prisoner Hill was coming out of the public-house? - The first time I see Hill he was talking to Watley.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Watley so far as you conceive, apprehend your design of following him? - I rather think he did when he see me in Fleet-market, by before seeing me against the rails in the church yard.</p>

               <p>Q. You received some information about this business from the last witness Lynch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did you examine one of the bags? - Yes; it appeared to have been cut open, and property taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh the bag after you had received this information? - Yes; one hundred three quarters and seven pounds was the weight of the bag and wool altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any information go to any cart? - Yes, we went to one near the Harrow public house, it is on the right-hand side about half way down nearly, not quite so much from Holbourn-bridge end; Lynch went with me and shewed me the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the basket there? - No, it was gone; I sent information to Mr. Brookes, the wool broker, to let him know that the bag was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Watley was taken up? - Yes; he was taken into the Swan yard, at the corner.</p>

               <p>Court. Then he came back to the Swan Inn, where he was taken? - He went out first and had his dinner, and came back again before he was taken.</p>

               <p>Jury. If Mr. Palmer missed any, why did the prisoner go away before his cart was unloaded? - That I cannot say, the carman left the cart and returned again after a time.</p>

I received the mark of the bag of Mr. Palmer from the inn, No. 15, S. C. Jones, and I find a deficiency of nine pounds.

            Did you find any basket that contained wool? - Yes, behind the upper stone in the yard; behind the horseblock of the Angel yard, in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the wool there? - I found it in the basket as I was coming into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing over the wool? - Yes, a bit of ragged cloth.</p>

            How much was there of it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - To Mr. Palmer; the basket with the wool weighed twenty-one pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the basket? - Probably it may.</p>
               <p>Court to Palmer. Is that the basket you received from Skeates, the last witness? - I delivered it to a porter in the yard to go to Mr. Brookes, and Mr. Brookes paid him for his trouble; he is not here; he is out of place now.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it like the basket? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is like every other basket of the same sort I suppose? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bond. I believe that to be one of my baskets; it is marked S. B.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your baskets marked S. B.? - Yes; but there is another person marks his baskets S.B.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Wader brought home a basket? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you have missed such a basket? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the S. B. done? - Painted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the mark of the S. B.? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the other gentleman's baskets that marks S. B.? - Yes, I believe they are both made by one basket maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray what is the number of your cart that Watley drives? - 407.</p>
               <p>Q. Look and see if that hath the No. 407 on it or not? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. And other people may have the same number, and S. B. on it? - No; that is impossible.</p>

I was present when the man searched the prisoner in the dining room, and he found on the prisoner some duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the key? - We went up stairs to his room, and he gave the key to the constable; I was in the room the time the box was searched, and when it was opened, in the box I found some cotton stockings, ten pair, and two different lengths of Irish cloth.</p>

            Do you know how many yards they made together? - I cannot say exactly to swear to; there was a memorandum taken at the time, and the constable has got it; and a length of cambrick, and I think these ten pair of men's York tanned gloves, and a length of black silk mode, and some more duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at these things that you took out of this box of the prisoner? - Yes; the constable took them into his charge, and he has had them in his possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you resort to your stock to see that you had lost all these things? - One article in particular I had; that is the four pair of womens cotton stockings.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went up stairs he was searched in the dining room? - He was.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this I suppose he was taken into custody, and taken before a magistrate and committed? - Before we took him to the magistrate we searched a woman's apartment, and there we found several things my property.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you missed any of these articles? - One article in particular we had missed.</p>
               <p>Q. The cotton stockings? - No; I did not miss the cotton stockings till I found them in the box; I missed the black lace particularly; I know it of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I went with a search warrant to Mr. Wigley's the 6th of August last; I saw the prisoner at the bar behind the counter, and he went up stairs into the dining room, and I searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him to go up into the dining room? - Mr. Wigley did; because there were people in the shop, and he wished to keep it as secret as possibly he could: I searched him and found four or five duplicates in the fob of his breeches; I found a smelling bottle, a knife, and a key, which he told me was the key of his box. After that happened we proceeded up stairs, up into the garret where he slept. Mr. Wigley told me so. He was present when the box was unlocked and searched, and in his box I found these articles: he was very sorry for what he had done, and begged his master to forgive him. I took him and the things in a coach, and I executed the other warrant in Castle-street, Oxford market, and there I found a vast number of duplicates on a woman of the name of Harrington. I had a search warrant to search this apartment also. I found I believe twenty-nine duplicates in all in his box and in his fob.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made your search you went to Mrs. Harrington's. I did, and found thirty-six duplicates there; and after that we went to the pawnbroker's, and there we found every thing correspond.</p>
               <p>Where did you find them? - In a black pocket book in her pocket. I have got thirty of these duplicates, and the rest I gave to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are all goods of mine; but these four pair of stockings I can speak to particularly; they have lace clocks, which is not a common thing in a cotton stocking, and the rest I believe to be mine all of them. These four pair of stockings, a few days before, I sent two dozen to a customer by him, and the customer bought twelve of them, and twelve were returned; and when I found these stockings; I went down and looked in the paper, and there was only eight pair there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no marks, I take it, on any of them? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any mark on any one of them? - There is no mark, no otherwise than the particular clocks of these four pair of stockings; they are a very scarce article, and never made except to an order.</p>
               <p>Q. These were for sale in the shop. How many days had past since he had carried out two dozen pair to the lady? - It must be within a week.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for you to say that from the other dozen, four pair might not have been sold by other persons in the shop; and you certainly don't mean to say, that there are not other shops that have genteel custom in town, but have the same sort of stockings.</p>

            What time did you go to her? -  Nearly about two. She said she had never been out of the room that day. I took her into custody, and searched her, and found the ticket on her; and that led to the pawnbroker. This is it.</p>
               <p>Pawnbroker. This is my duplicate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my shawl. She did not cut it from the other shawls at the door; it was tore off; I left it hanging at the door; I see it there about eleven o'clock in the morning. There is a space left between, to cut them with the scissars; and she tore it, instead of cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she did it at the door? - Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it easily done? - No, it is not; I have brought one shawl here to compare with it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the circumstance of that being the same pattern, can you swear that to be your's? - I have no doubt about it; not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any shopman in the shop at this time? - Yes; there were two shopmen, but they don't know who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Golden-lane about three o'clock in the afternoon, a woman comes up to me, and asked me to buy an handkerchief; she said I should have it for two shillings and three-pence. I said, I had no money but nine-pence in my pocket; says she, will you go and pawn it for eighteen-pence, and you shall have the duplicate for the other nine-pence; and I went and pawned it for eighteen pence; and came out and gave her the duplicate. The pawnbroker see me; and I gave her the other nine-pence for the duplicate, not knowing that it was stole, or else I would not have done it.</p>
               <p>Jury to Williams. Did you see the prisoner give a woman eighteen-pence? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any woman with her? - There were two women with her.</p>

            Does any body in your house know that she had pawned them? - No, not one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lodged with Mrs. Riley six weeks, at three shillings a week; on the 1st of August my week's rent was due, being Saturday. I paid her two shillings on Sunday morning, and promised to pay her one shilling. It so happened, on Saturday night I was out late, and I was committed to Bridewell for twenty-eight days. Mrs. Riley came to me at Bridewell, and I told her what had happened, and told her I would get them out when I came out. When I came out, and would pay her what I owed her, and the week I had had the key, she staid with me some time, and I begged her to have mercy. When my time was out, she came to the door, and said I must go with her; she said, I must pay her twelve shillings for the month's rent, and get the sheets; I told her I would pay the four shillings I owed her, and get the sheets besides; with that she would not let me go any where; she took me to Guildhall, and I was committed to the Compter; she told the Alderman that I had been missing six weeks, where of I had been missing no longer than what I have told you. I could have got them out again, and should have got them out again, if that accident had not happened; I did not do it with an intention to wrong her out of them, far from it. When I had my hearing with the Alderman, she would have made it up with me.</p>
               <p>Jury. The prisoner has said that the prosecutor promised to forgive her on her paying twelve shillings and taking out the sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. That could make no alteration, the prosecutor cannot compound felony. <rs id="t17940917-98-verdict506" type="verdictDescription">

A young woman in our house met her the next day, and she told her she wanted to speak to her, and she brought her back to our house on the Friday following. I see her, and this apron was on; the other things, she told me, that she had sold them herself to an old clothes woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you ever find the other things? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said that she had sold them, did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - No, not I myself; I believe the officer asked her what she had done with them, and said, perhaps I should favour her if she told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess before or after the constable said that? - Upon my word I don't know, because I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the linen apron that was on her? - I took it from her, and the officer has kept it; his name is Mackenzie. I can very well say it is my own, because I had lent it to one of my servants before, and they tore the corner of it, and I put a piece on. When she came first in, she said you accuse me of a thing that I am not guilty of. I am very well assured it is my apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to the apron? - I cannot; I met her in St. Paul's Churchyard, and she went with me to Mrs. Bazeley's house. I told her that Mrs. Bazeley had lost some things, and they were laid on her, and she had better go down with me, to see whether she was guilty or not. She said she was not guilty, and she would go with me.</p>

I observed something under the chaise, which I supposed to be a basket; and behind was a trunk, and at the same time I see the prisoner run by, on the curb, on the foot way, and my fellow servant says to me, let us go after him, and see what he is after; his name is Joseph Thomas; and the prisoner made up to the chaise, and my fellow servant went and took hold of him, and sent me to call the chaise, and I went and stopped the chaise, and returned back to Mr. William Baylis's door; I gave notice to the groom.</p>

S. I. in a heart, and which was marked Henley, it appeared to contain about two bushels of malt, or rather more, when he came out I observed him go towards the house of Parker, it is about a hundred yards from this place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Parker? - He collects sacks for the West country barges, he keeps an iron shop, and buys things of that description, iron and rags.</p>
               <p>Q. How did West take this sack? - He took it on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be weighty, or how? Not very weighty, I see him take it, and go in great haste to Parker's house.</p>

Parker goes to different brewers about the town, collect the sacks for the west country barges; I saw that come out of Parker's house.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came into the house did you observe any thing? - I went into the room on the left hand side, and there I saw the very identical sack that West had taken there; the tier was loose, and I put my hand in, and it appeared to be malt that was stoned, not sweepings, it appeared brisk, and if it had been sweepings, it would have been slack and damp, it appeared as it was taken from the heap; Parker was not at home; when I saw Mr. Day, I communicated it to him, and I and master went afterwards, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the time you went before? - One o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Parker at home when you came there? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what past when you went there with Mr. Day, was the sack there in the same state? - It was, and Mr. Day challenged Parker with buying malt of his man (West, the prisoner) he said he knew nothing about it, and then Parker asked the wife; and she said that a man had brought a sack there, and threw it down and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken into custody? - Not till the next day, I was at the apprehending of West, at his master's warehouse, the next morning; he said he was innocent, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You see the sack the second time in the same place where you had seen it before, though there had been six hours to remove it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any communication between one warehouse and the other? - There was not; I had been at a great expence this spring, to have all the floor stopped with brick and mortar, because there had been a great deficiency before.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body being in the oil warehouse, have access to the malt room? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went with Mr. Lyon, the last witness, to Parker's? - I did; I examined the warehouse the next morning, on taking up West, and found it all perfect underneath, I was not at a loss to know from whence it came in; I examined up the stair case, and on the first flight up the stairs, there was a hole broke in one of the boards, about eight inches long, and six broad; the piece was made to slip in and out, seeing that had been broke, I took it down, and Mr. Whitbread's man examined it the next morning.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. What was she to pay you? - Three shillings a week, and she pledged a pair of sheets, she did not pay her rent, and she was very noisy and clamorous, and there was a great confusion among my neighbours, saying they would indict my house if she did not go away, and I gave her notice to quit the apartment, a week's notice; on Saturday I went to ask her whether she meant to quit, she said she would not quit it; she slept in a bureau bedstead, I went to the bed and turned down the coverlid of the bed, and missed a sheet and bolster, and I missed a steel sender, I asked her what she had done with them? her answer was, she had pawned them, and how could I help myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - No, she told me she had pawned them to buy gin with, and how could I help myself? - I was ashamed to mention it before, then I sent for an officer and gave charge of her, and he took her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask you the liberty to do it, and you said I might if I was distressed, if I would but replace them afterwards? - I never did.</p>

               <p>- Court. You had known them before? I had seen them at a house, in Field-lane before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know nothing more than the last witness has related; I suppose it is my handkerchief, but I never swore to it, nor cannot; there is no mark on it; I believe it is mine, and I had no handkerchief in my pocket when the witness informed me that my pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is a very common pattern indeed? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. I look upon it to be of no use to speak any thing, for I look upon him to be a man that will say any thing. I have had friends here every day, waiting for my trial; I don't know whether they are here now or no.</p>

He is a bricklayer's labourer, employed by the Company; he was along side of the nail box; he was lifting the nails from the box, and putting them in his pocket; he observed that I see him put some in his pocket, and he dropped some on the stairs, and said that he wanted them, to put them in his shoes. I said nothing to him, but I went and told my fellow labourers that Longley had got some of the Company's property; and my fellow labourer went to the counting house to this gentleman, Mr. Duree. I went back to my employment, because I was requested to be back as soon as possible.</p>

               <p>I belong to the East India Company. I am what they call an elder there. On Saturday last, about twelve o'clock, I believe it was, I was informed by the last witness, and another man, that the prisoner Langley had been taking some nails from a box on a stair case, belonging to the Company. Afterwards he went on the top of the house to work; I went to the top of the house after him, and called him down. I asked him what he had in his pocket? he said, nothing. I told him I was sure he had some nails of the Company. He then emptied the nails into an apron, belonging to one of the men, out of his pockets. I asked him if had got any more in his pocket, he said, he had not. I put my hand into his waistcoat pocket, and found there was some tea, two ounces and a quarter weight of Singlo tea. I sent for a Custom house officer that is here, and he took it from him; and he has got it in his possession. I asked him where he got the tea? he said, he thought there was no harm in it; and he went up, and pointed out the chest where he took it out from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - Not to my knowledge; I was there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the nails? - Very likely three shillings. I gave them into the custody or one of our men.</p>
               <p>- HETCHELL sworn.</p>
               <p> I have got the nails; the prisoner took them out of his own pocket and delivered them into my possession; likewise I see the officer take the tea out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had a piece of tiling off, and the bricklayer was not in the way to lath it on, and I went down and took some nails on purpose to lay it on as soon as possible I could; the lath nails don't run very little larger than them; I did it to get it lathed in as soon as possible I could, because of the rain; and when I went down to get some lath nails there was some tea laying down along side of the chest, and I scratched it up and took some of it, and they asked me what chest it came out of? and I shewed them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a good shilling? - No; but in the mean time I looked at the other that was in my hand with the two six-pences, and I said here is another as bad. The constable Peat was standing by me at the same time I held the two shillings in my hand; I never gave her them back; the six-pences are one good and one bad; I kept the two shillings and two six-pences in this state, and have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

He knows me these four years, and he knows that I have a family of children? - I know nothing of the woman otherwise than by her coming to market buying fish; I know nothing of her otherwise than being informed of her being a common utterer of bad money, and I was surprised at her giving it me.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the corner by the side of Mr. Finch; he says to this woman this is a bad shilling; she gave him another which was equally as bad. I then desired Mr. Finch to keep what he had got in his possession; I went to her, and from her left hand she attempted to drop something, but I prevented her by seizing her hand, and I found two shillings and a six-pence in it, one six pence was a bad one and the other was a good one, and the six-pence was good. I have kept the bad ever since, but the good was given her before the Lord Mayor; I took her up stairs and searched her afterwards, and found two good shillings, two bad ones and a six-pence. These three bad shillings I now produce, one was taken from her hand and the other two taken from her pocket. I cannot tell which is which.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the two shillings and two six-pences that were taken by Finch? - That is produced by him.</p>

I kept my eye on it, and went to it immediately, and kneeled down, and picked up a shilling, which here it is. One of Mr. French's servants put his hand into the water, and he found two shillings; that shilling I picked up I marked, I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. The exact quantity of this particular bale you don't know, I suppose? - </p>
               <p>Court. Is your warehouse within the gates of your yard? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Do you know the quantity nearly that is in this bale? - Ten pieces, about one hundred and fifty yards, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this deposited? - In the warehouse, which is over the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe the situation of this warehouse? - All the buildings adjoins, and this warehouse was connected with other warehouses, which join my house.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, there are gates to that yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that yard one side is the stables, over which is the warehouses, and the other side is your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who else, within this court yard, is in partnership with you? - Not any concerned in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. There are some other persons that live in the same yard with you? - None but tenants to me, who keep the tavern business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other persons accountable for the loss of these things besides yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there none of your own family concerned with you? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay rates? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In what parish? - In two parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish was this warehouse, where this cloth was removed? - It stands in both parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish is that part of the warehouse, from whence the cloth was taken? - In Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - It divides in the warehouse, but the locks that were broke open were most certainly in the parish of Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whe ther that part of the warehouse, from whence these goods were removed, was not in St. Botolph, Aldersgate? - I believe myself it is in Christ Church parish.</p>
               <p>Court It is perfectly indifferent in what parish.</p>

               <p>Q. About ten o'clock at night on last Tuesday sevennight do you recollect observing any men come there? - Yes; I observed five, I see them walking backwards and forwards in the street, and taking great notice of the Bull and Mouth inn; and I went in doors, and when I came out again I went of an errand, it was between nine and ten; I saw two of them at the top of the street, and one of them said to the other, it will not do to night, and the other said, yes, it will, but it must be later. To the best of my knowledge Booth is one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice him particularly? - I think he is one.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you an opportunity to observe him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take notice of, the dress or the face? - I took such notice as I think I should know him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - In much the same dress as he s now; I think he had a light coat on the night that I see him.</p>

               <p>Q. What waistcoat? - I did not take notice. I thought he was after the Bull and Mouth inn; I had seen several men, for above a fortnight, taking notice of the Bull and Mouth inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? - Yes, I see him the Friday before in Aldersgate-street, him and a tall man, walking backward and forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a belief that you are almost certain; only you don't choose to swear to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt in your mind? - I have do doubt but he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw five men talking together. Are you sure that the men that you saw afterwards, at the top of the street, were two of these five? - Yes, I am; three of them went down the street, and two went up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you disturbed? - Yes; I did not hear nothing at all about it, only my father did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was a dark night, past nine o'clock, and you had never seen the person before. Did not you state, be fore my Lord Mayor, that the person of Booth was dressed exactly as he is now? - Not to my knowledge, I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a dark night? - Not a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was in its last quarter I believe? Pray, in what line of life are you in? - I live with my father and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. In Bull and Mouth street? - Yes, my father is a shoemaker, and I work at the binding of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you again what my Lord asked you just now; consider, this man's life is at stake; and tell the jury whether you can take upon yourself to swear that he is the man? - No, I don't wish to swear.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you as positive at your first examination as you was afterwards to the man? - To the best of my knowledge I was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a fact you must recollect, because they were taken up soon after the robbery. You spake then as you do now, of five men; was you as positive to these men being two of that five as you are now? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Q. It is a very material point, because where it depends on identity of a person,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170241"/>it is very material to know whether you was at all times as positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never any doubt on your mind? - Never. When I went in before the Lord Mayor, my father said, now, look round, and see if you know either of these young men; and I looked at Booth directly.</p>
               <p>Were they in irons? - The other had, but not Booth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing passing at Mr. Willan's last Tuesday sevennight, at night? - On Wednesday morning, about two o'clock, I had had some difference with my family, which kept me up till that late hour; I went up then to go to bed, and I went to my window to shut it down, and I observed two men standing by the side of Mr. Willan's door, directly I see one of them open it, as if he had a key to it; directly I see another man come out, as if he came to my door, and I heard an expression, it will do, George.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that? - I cannot take on me to say. With that it struck me there was no good going on there; I see three of them enter the stable, and they immediately fastened the door after them; there was another seemed to watch outside. I continued to watch, and I heard them pass through the stable to a pair of gates that is a little above the stable; I thought I heard the bar of the gates taken down, the found was like the found of the bar being moved; I then soon after saw a light in the lost, pass backwards and forwards, over the stable, in a warehouse above, where the goods are deposited; I then thought that they meant to rob, and I watched an opportunity to get out, that was when the watchman came down the street, about half after one, and the man walked away. I should inform you, that the man that was watching got up to the lost door, and peeped through, and seemed to me as if he spoke something, but I drew back, because he should not see me. When the watchman came, I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get up to this door? - By means of the window, where the bars are underneath; he got up as far as the window by means of the bars. I went out, and told the watchman what I had seen, and asked him what he should do; he seemed to hesitate, that it was out of his beat; I told him he must not stand about beats in such a case as that; I told him to wait there, while I went down and alarmed the inn; and I went down and alarmed the inn. I knocked at the gate, and told the porter that opened the gate; he is the chamberlain or porter. I waited some time watching; when the three men that I see go in rushed out at the gate, where they had taken down the bar; I immediately ran after them, and pursued them, and I cried out, Stop thief; and the last man cried out, Stop thief likewise. When I came within three or four yards of the last, he was then turning the passage that leads into Little Britain, as he turned round he fired a pistol right at me, which alarmed me very much, and rather struck me so that I could go no further; it was two or three minutes before I recovered myself, and the watchman came up, and sprung his rattle. I lost fight of him then; I then ran down into Little Britain, and the watchman had got the prisoner Booth in custody. I ran the way that I supposed he ran that fired at me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he gone in Little Britain? - He was at the bottom of the Britain, I suppose it may be about one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of the watchman that was with you? - He followed after, I believe, and assisted.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no opportunity of seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170242"/>the face of the man that you followed? - No, I did not.</p>

            You don't know as to his person at all? - I cannot identify his person; when he was in custody of the watchman he was very much confused; he said he was pursuing the thieves, and that he belonged to the inn, and that his master had been robbed. They then took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. If I understand you right, you did not mean to speak, nor never did mean to speak, to the person of the man, whoever he was; and the pistol was not tried till he came into Little Britain? - No; is was fired at the entrance of the passage, at the top of Bull and Mouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no pistol found on Booth, I believe? - Not that I understand; there was a search made, and none found.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any body running between you and the prisoner? - I saw no body at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you at your door at one o'clock the night of last Tuesday sevennight? - Yes. Mr. Stanhope and I had a little difference, and I went to the door, because I would have no more words; and there were three men came past, and one of them said to me, what do you stay here for? I said, that was my business, and not their's. I think Simmons was one, but I could not swear to him, because it was moon light, and not so very light for me to swear to him. He asked me why I did not go in? I said I should when I pleased; and told him to go about his business. He asked me if I had lived there long? I told him eight or nine years; he then asked me if I knew old Mr. King, the grocer? and I told him, that I believed he dropped off his horse at Islington; he said that was right. He asked me if I knew Mr. King's son? I said yes; and he asked me if knew the opposite King? I told him yes. He asked me if I knew Mr. Wilson? I told him I knew every one in the street; and then Mr. Stanhope desired me to go in, and I went in, and shut the door, and the dog was out, and scratched at the door, and I went to let him in; and the noise of the door induced Mr. Stanhope to look out of window, and he came down stairs, and desired I would come up and see, for he was sure somebody had gone into Mr. Willan's place; and when I went up stairs, I see the light below, where the horses were, and I heard a kind of a bar taken down from the large gates, and then I see the light afterwards in the lost above, and the light, came up to the far end of the lost, which is the warehouse, a very great light, and then Mr. Stanley said, he would not stop any longer; and he ran down stairs. I said he had better stop a little, for the watchman was coming, and I would tell him; then he went up the street, and met the watchman about No. 17; he said it was not his beat - My husband went and alarmed the men of the inn; and in the course of that time there were three men came out of the gate; I see them come out, and they ran up the street towards Little Britain. When they came out, I cried out, Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out had you an opportunity of observing them? - I had not of the two first, but I had of the last. I believe that to be Booth; I think so; then I heard the report of the pistol; and the man that was the last made a slip, and something like a pistol struck, and I saw a flash come from it; and then he ran up the street, and there was the report of another; and then Mr. Stanhope drawed back.</p>

            Whereabouts was the man when you heard the report? - At the gateway; it flashed in the pan, it did not go off; I did not see any thing more of them till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any more people abou there? - No, I did not see any thing but a man without, that got up and whiltled to them through the bars, at the left door.</p>

               <p>Q. You was standing at the door, conversing with Simmons about five minutes. How far was you from him? - About the distance I stand from you; he stood across the kennel, behind the gate.</p>

            Then you do not mean to say positively that Simmons is the man, but you believe him to he the man? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whoever was the person that was talking to you, he went down the street? - He did, towards St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>Court. You speak of four men; three that were in the stable, and one that was outside; did you know him that was outside? - No, I could not know him again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to be standing at the door at that time of the morning? - My husband and I had a few words.</p>

               <p>Q. This was in Bull and Mouth-street; there are some gentlemen in the city that know that street better than I do; I don't live in the city.

               <p>Q. At the time this past, your husband was standing with the door in his hand? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many inches happened your husband to be from you at the time you had this conversation with Simmons? - If I had a person standing by, taking measure, I might have known it.</p>

I says to Duckham, mind be drops nothing; and he said no, I am not going to drop any thing; and we took him to the constable of the night at the watch house.</p>

On Wednesday morning sevenight early I was standing at the end of my beat, and my other partner was standing just by his, I heard a pistol fire, or a gun, I don't know which; I said to my partner there is something a matter below; we went down as fast as we could; we had not gone above a hundred yards before we met the prisoner at the bar, the man at the right, Simmons, I said, where is that rattle sprung? the prisoner says below. My partner being just behind me, said, perhaps you are the man, and took hold of me. I turned round directly and said, very possibly you are; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170245"/>intimidated indeed, very much shocked, and we afterwards conveyed him to the watch-house. He began to shuffle his pockets, as if he meant to throw something out; we don't know that he did.

               <p>Q. Where are these posts? - Going up to Bull and Mouth-street, that way. I stepped up directly and caught one by the collar, that was Booth; he made answer and said, not me, take the other: with that he got somehow or other from my hand, and I called out stop thief! and he called out likewise; and I called out to my partner that was below to stop that man, for I believe he was one of the people.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see Stanhope? - I cannot say, for I went directly to the watch-house with the prisoner we had got, I and my partner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the bales there deposited? - I did, three; one was deposited close to the warehouse door, a little on one side, on the left hand side of the door, and the other two were deposited to it against the front wall; they were perfectly safe packed with strong cordage.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Willan. Early on Wednesday morning, about two o'clock, when the alarm was given, I observed a pack cut open. I did not go into the warehouse the same way the theves broke in.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170246"/>Q. Whereabouts was that bale of goods which you see cut open? - At the end of the lost near to the harness maker's room; they had taken the cloth, almost the whole of it within three parcels of that bale, and carried it to the further end of the lost towards the door, near the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know where this particular bale had been deposited the night before? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other two bales? - They were standing at the right hand of it. There was a place cut with a knife in one of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wrapper that contained this cloth? - The wrapper stood where the bale was cut open.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the cloth that was taken out from the wrapper that had contained the cloth? - About forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you observe in the warehouse? - I found a dark lanthorn, a black bag, and an iron crow made out of an old file; I delivered these things to the constable who is at the door now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed where the persons came in? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not go in the way you believe the thieves came in? - I did not; I believe they came in at a place called the Dunghill Gate.</p>

               <p>Court. You are called here to give your evidence on oath, and you are told that you have been examined before, therefore a caution is given you to speak the truth; if you prevaricate and do not speak the truth you will be liable to be punished, both here and hereafter, therefore let this be a caution; perhaps you are going to say now what may be the truth, perhaps what you said before may be the truth; you stand there in a very suspicious light, therefore now be cautious.</p>

             at that bag; do you know that bag? examine it carefully woman, look at it? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't ask you yet? - Yes, sir, I believe it may be the bag; but I never see it open till I see it open at the house it come from, at Cow-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That was subsequent to this robbery? - A gentleman came on Saturday morning and said, is Mr. Simmons at home? and directly asked if he was a hatter? I shewed him his work shop, and all his tools. He said he was sorry for him to be in trouble, he would soon be out, it was only for an assault, or quarrel; he came again in about half an hour, and said, I have been to the Mansion House, and he said, I am all of a muck sweat; he untied a black thing in the handkerchief, and said to the mother, do you know this black bag? if you would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170247"/>come and speak to it your son will soon be released out of trouble.</p>
               <p>Woodman. I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Coleman. His mother said she could not leave the shop; then the mother said to me, you go and speak for him: she directly said she believed it was the boy's bag, or cloth. I went with the gentleman, and he took a coach and took me to the Hall. I came before the Lord Mayor, and I said, when is this poor man to be released? he said never mind, you will be paid for your trouble. He came with this bag before the Lord Mayor, and I said I had seen a black cloth under the bed, the gentlewoman's bed, but I never see it open in my life.</p> 
               <p>Q. Now you are sure that that man that stands by you said, that if you come and swear to this bag that this young man would be released? - I would not take a false oath for my life and soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear to the bag before the Lord Mayor? - The old woman said that she believed it was her son's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell my Lord Mayor that story as you do now? - I said the very same; I think I said what I say now; I said it was the bag that I had seen, cloth or whatever they call it. I was very much troubled about my own brother, who was gone for a sailor, and I had been drinking rather more than what I should, and I really cannot tell what I did say.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it on the evening that he was there? - It was in the morning, and I drank more than what I should, because I could not do my business at all after.</p>

            Therefore you don't know of your own knowledge that that was his bag? - No; nor I cannot swear that it was his bag, nor I never saw it opened no more than what the mother said.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore positively to this bag before the Lord Mayor, and I am confident if you had been in liquor, as you say, you would not have been examined at all there.</p>
               <p>Woodman. I was the person that went with this bag, and I said, is your name Simmons? to the mother-in-law; she said yes; I said directly, is your daughter at home? I come just to ask a simple question; I untied my handkerchief and I opened this bag, and I asked the mother-in-law if she knew this bag, that was all I said.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the mother-in-law against these people? - I only went to get the bag identified. I don't know whether it was the mother or no, but I was directed by my brother officers.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodman. What did you say to her to induce her to go with you? - What I said to her was this, when I asked about the bag the mother said she could swear to it; and this woman came out of a little back room, and she said, I can swear to that little black bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what she was going to swear about? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Johnson. This is the key of Simmons's own door, which I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you sometimes carry a key of your door in your pocket? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward if a man is convicted of a burglary? - I don't know that ever I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what the reward is? - I have been told it is forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if one man is convicted and forty pounds got by it, what is got if two men are convicted by it? - Double; that was not my intention of shewing the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simmons. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Simmons called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            , No. 128, in the Minories; I was standing in Mrs. Macqueen's shop the other side of the counter about eight days before Christmas, the prisoner came into the shop; his brother stood with him; he came in and says, Mrs. Macqueen I want some money; says she, Bothrow, I have done no business this lottery, and I a cannot give you any, as I told you before; he said he knowed that she had done business in that lottery, and that I was clerk to her, and that it lay in his power to take me away, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen? - About eight days before Christmas last. With that Mrs. Macqueen says,

            , give him a crown. I put my hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, and he made answer and said, Ma'am, I never had less than a guinea of you; she said, it is not in my power to give him a guinea now, so give him a crown; and before I gave it into his hand he said cannot you let me have half a guinea; says I, Bothrow, I have got no more about me; I told him I had not got half a guinea; he took the crown and he went about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him the crown for? - Out of fear; because he said I had done business that lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. That he might not take you up as a vagrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you bring forward this prosecution? - From the day before Fast day, after the English lottery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it end? - In April.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let all that time pass without commencing any prosecution? - The 27th of January, the day before fast day, he faced me at the bottom of the Minories, and he touched me on the shoulder; his brother was present with him; he says to me, I want to speak with you; he said he had particular orders from the Lord Mayor to take me wherever he met me; with that I asked him for what? and he said it was on the lottery business, that his daughter had done some numbers with me; so I says, Bothrow, recollect I gave you a crown just before Christmas; he says d-n that crown, it is nothing, if you have got ever a friend to send for I will take you into a public house. He would not take me any where about the neighbourhood, he took me to the City Arms, and I sent a person for a friend; the friend did not come, and he said he would take me over to the Compter: he took me over to the Compter and gave charge of me, and I remained there from Thursday evening about five o'clock till Saturday about one, and he told me before that that he would let me go only so many people see him take me out of the Compter about one, and he says, Miller, it is, stasb, I am satisfied, and I shall tell you what to say when you come before the Lord Mayor; he tells me to say, that a woman gave charge of me to him on account of insuring; then, says he, you will be acquitted: and he had money for that, but I cannot bring the people forward on the business. I was acquitted before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you bring forward the prosecution? - Directly after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170249"/>this; because I was afraid of being stopped again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day you brought forward the prosecution? - I believe it was in the month of April, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have told my Lord and gentlemen of the Jury, that you first of all was a watch finisher, and then you became clerk to Mr. Lucy, and now you are not in his employ? - Because he has no employ for me.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have been employed by Mrs. Macqueen as her clerk in the lottery business, at an unlicensed lottery-office? - I suppose it to be such.</p>
               <p>Court. Has your mistress ever paid you that money again? - No, never; it has been deducted out of my book by a gentleman that was at Mrs. Macqueen's office, that acted as master there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by your master or mistress you have been allowed the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was no extortion on you?</p>

               <p>On last Wednesday was a fortnight, I was informed that a person wanted to speak to me in my dwelling house; when I came in there, the last witness was present, and he asked me whether I knew any thing of this silver that he produced there to me? As soon as I see it, I said, yes; I was conscious that the silver came out of our manufactory; I knew it by the particular pieces, because it was all in pieces; but I said I would call my nephew, who was better acquainted with it than myself, because he was always distributing it to the workmen; it is no difficult matter for a workman to know his own work. We have our own sletting mills, and it is about a month since one of these rolls broke; we put in a new one, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170250"/>happened to be what we call cross cut; one of these pieces that were produced has the impression on it of the cross cut, and were statted in these rolls that had not been in above a fortnight. There are six ounces, but we swear to a certainty of an ounce and a half. I swear to one piece that is cross cut; I have evidence to make out the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was produced to you, how long might it have been missing? - I cannot tell only that of the cross cut. On the evening of that same day, Mr. Stocker called on me again to know whether we wished the prisoner stopped, because she had been there to demand it again that day. I said, by all means; he waited on me the next day, and told me she was stopped, and desired me to come down to the City Arms.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the silver which Mr. Bateman spoke of just now? - I see it when it was produced before the Lord Mayor, at the Mansion-house. It is the property of Mr. Bateman? I made the tools that it was drawn in, I have got some in my pocket to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the piece that has the cross cut? - No; I know some of the other pieces, that were drawn in the tools that I have with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has every workman in the trade different tools? - Different tools of their own making.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make your own tools? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can swear to some? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of what you can swear to? - Three or four pieces.</p>
               <p>Tipper. I produce some silver; I got it of Mr. Cave.</p>
               <p>Cave. It is the same as Stocker brought it in; it was put on the counter, and I gave it to Mr. Tipper.</p>
               <p>Tipper. I have kept it till now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bateman. What account did the girl give of it? - When I came down to the City Arms, that a man, who prosessed himself to be a mate of a ship, that she had lain with two nights, in Dark-house-lane gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you his name? - She did not know his name; she said, that she went on board a vessel with him, lying at Chetter quay on Wednesday, and that they drank together, and that the Thursday afterwards he came to the Green Man, and gave her this silver, and she got up on Thursday morning; she did not lie with him on Thursday night; and went down to the vessel to seek him, and the vessel was gone. On this information we went to the Green Man, in Dark-house-lane, and there found she had been there with a man, but they could not say who he was; but they said, that she lay there on Thursday. I went, in hopes that we had got in a train of finding out the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she always kept to the same story? - She has; but we have done all we can to find it out, but we find it was a false one.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the silver? - This is the piece that is cross cut; here is another piece, that I have compared with our tongs, which every piece has the impression on it.</p>
               <p>Ware. I can swear to these three pieces from the tools that I made to draw them.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of all that you can swear to? - Seven shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with Mr. Bateman to the house in Darkhouse-lane, and I told him that I slept with that man. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170251"/>was with that man, as I told him; and I said to him, you will not treat me ungenteel, and on Thursday morning he untied his silk handkerchief, and gave me that, and said, he had given good money for it to take it abroad, to make some trinkets. I kept it till Saturday night, when I went to an acquaintance's house, to know if she could tell me where to sell it; and she sent her girl with it to this gentleman's. He stopped it, and I went for it; and he said, he could not deliver the property. I called for it on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; on Wednesday they told me they had found an owner; I said, I hope you will not let the gentleman have the property, for it is mine. I went on Thursday morning, and they took me into custody; I came honestly by it. I have nobody to speak to my character only women of the town, whose characters I would not wish to bring before you, that I am not connected with.</p>
