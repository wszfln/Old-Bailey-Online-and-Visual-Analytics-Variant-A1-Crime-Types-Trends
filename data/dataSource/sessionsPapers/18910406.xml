                  </hi>. I am head parlour-maid to Miss Robson, of 60, Corn<lb/>wall Gardens, Kensington—on Monday night, 2nd March, I and the cook went to bed at half-past ten—I was the last person up—before going to bed I saw that everything was secure—at eight next morning on going downstairs I found the cellar-door and pantry-door open—a window in the housekeeper's room, which is a back room on the base<lb/>ment, was also open, sufficient to allow a person to get through—the w. c. door had been forced open; I had bolted that door before I went to bed—I missed a quantity of silver, a teapot, a kettle, spoons, and forks, to the value of at least £40; also twenty-two shillings of my own from the pantry—the silver had been in the cellar.</p>

On the evening of 3rd March I went to Craven Passage, Charing Cross, and saw the prisoner leaving the Northumberland Arms—I told him I was a police-officer, and I should arrest him on a charge of committing a burglary on the night of the 2nd at 60, Cornwall Gardens—he said, "Yes, I know all about it"—a little later on his brother-in-law, named Cook, was with him, and I said to him, "I shall require you as a witness in this case"—the prisoner said, "No, don't do that, he is as innocent as my umbrella; I was in with it with two others, and I will stand to it, and I have come up here to receive my corner out of it; I was to meet the other two at eight o'clock at Charing Cross"—on the way to the station he said, "I suppose I shall get twelve months for this.

Shortly after eight on the morning of 3rd March I went to 60, Cornwall Gardens—I found that an entrance had been effected through the w. c. window in the basement at the hack of the house, and the door of the w. c. had been forced leading to the inside passage; the pantry window was wide open, two large panes of glass were broken, and several drawers and cupboards had been ran<lb/>sacked—I went out on to the flats at the back of the house and saw marks apparently as if somebody had climbed up the side of the wall to the top of the stables—I got on to the top of the stables, and while up there I saw a coil of rope from the top of 61 next door; I then traced footmarks along the top of the stables to 37, Emperor's Gate—it was possible for a person to get from Emperor's Gate to the stable through a side window winch almost touched the top of the stables—I could see by</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Cook—we were in charge of 37, Emperor's Gate—the prisoner married a sister of mine—he had been living with us for about a week—on 2nd March he came in that night about half-past ten—he went out about a quarter to eleven—I did not see him again that night—the key of the front door was on the mantelpiece—I went to bed about a quarter to eleven—next morning I found everything as I had left it.</p>

'A few minutes afterwards I heard a man call thieves out of a Window, and the men came clambering up to come through the window, and I let them out of the house again; they told me to come at eight that night, and they would give me my share of the proceeds. I made their acquaintance in prison. One of them touched me on the shoulder one evening, and asked me where I was going, and said he could put a few pounds in my pocket if I could let them pass through the house up there; he knew a house or twp there that he wanted to turn over, and I might put £50 in my pocket; they sent me a letter that morning when I went out with my beer; I met them; they came back, and I let them through the house."</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 15th February, about a quarter-past four, in consequence of information, I went to Scrub Lane, Hammersmith—I there apprehended John Walsh, who is not now in custody, for being a principal in a prize-fight—Hamilton and Ricketts, two constables, were with me—I apprehended John Walsh, and had him in my charge—there were a number of men there, about forty or fifty I should say—the prisoner Walsh tried to take his brother away from me; he kicked me on the left leg, and struck me on the back of the head with his fist—Hamilton then went and took the prisoner Walsh into custody—he struggled with him, and finally got away from him; he struck him in the face, and then caught hold of him at the back, and said to Leonard, "Go through him, Mike," meaning search his pockets—Leonard then placed his hands in Hamilton's pockets, and drew a purse from his left-hand pocket, and threw it among his companions—Hamilton was in uniform—McDonald was punching Hamilton in the face and about the head at this time—then Richard Walsh let go of him, stepped on one side, and struck him a severe blow in the face, and Hamilton then fell to the ground—I then dragged my prisoner, John Walsh, up to Hamilton and drew my truncheon—the prisoners on seeing me decamped—Hamilton got up and went after the prisoner—at a quarter to twelve the same night</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Wesleyan minister, living in John Wesley's Home, 47, City Road—on the night of 3rd March, about a quarter to twelve, I had been to the post, and on my return I saw a gentleman walking on the other side of the road, and suddenly saw seven or eight men leap out of the shadow of a building and knock him down on the pavement; I ran over and saw two or three of them tugging at, his pocket, and another pulling his vest open—I said, "The man has fainted; get him some water"—they took no notice; I said, "Go and get him some brandy, I will pay for it; the man is dying"—the prisoner immediately got off the gentleman, came to me and put his arm on my shoulder, and said, "Stand away from him, sir; he will be all right directly"—they still continued grappling with his throat, and then I noticed one man rifling his pockets—I said, "You cowardly rascals, you are robbing the man!"—they then jumped up, the man who was rifling his pockets shouted, "All right, I have got it," and then they all started off down Castle Street—I spoke to a policeman, and followed them, and saw the prisoner caught; I never lost sight of him for a moment.</p>

               <p>went to the British Lying-in Hospital in Endell Street, and was confined there—on Wednesday, 3rd December, I went to the hospital and fetched her away with her baby, a girl—she stayed with me until the following Tuesday, the 9th—she then left and went to live with Mrs. Wood at South Hampstead; I went there with her, and she remained there, and I took the child back and kept it; she was to pay me as she took her money—this piece of paper is my handwriting—I always received the money from her on giving her a piece of paper, and the paper would be sent back to me by her when she sent more money; this was the last paper I had—up to 9th December about £2 15s. was owing to me; that has not been paid—on Tuesday, the 13th, the prisoner came to my house and said she had made arrangements with a person to take baby from me, and Mrs. Aubrey would come next day to take baby—up to that time the prisoner provided the clothes that the child was wearing—I was to prepare clothes, everything fit for a child, and she brought more clothes with her when she came on the Tuesday—on the 14th January Mrs. Aubrey came and took the child away—it was then in perfect health—I have never seen the child since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Aubrey, of 18, Dieppe Street, West Kensington—I am at present engaged as a cook in the Isle of Wight—I have a daughter, she belonged to a girls' Sunday-school, and a lady there knew Mrs. Wood, with whom the prisoner was then living—in consequence of what was said to me I went to Mrs. Wood, and saw the prisoner there—I told her my name was Aubrey, and that I had brought a card from a lady who had asked my daughter to ask me would I take a nurse child—she said she was wet nurse to Mrs. Wood's child, but that the person who had it then had another child, and so could not take care of it any longer; I asked her what her terms were—she said five shillings a week—I said that was not quite sufficient for so young a baby—I said I wanted seven shillings and sixpence—she said her husband was in a consumptive hospital ill, and I agreed to take five shillings—I was moving at this time; I gave her my address, and she said she would come and see me in a day or two—I got a letter from her about 14th or 15th January; it was destroyed, it was telling me she was sorry she could not come to see me as she had agreed for me to go to Mrs. Dainton's, and bring the baby back with me, and a few things which she had—she said in the letter that she was rather short of the long clothes, but she was making short clothes, and she would send them in a week or so—upon that letter I went to Mrs. Dainton's and got the child—it was in good health when it came into my hands—at the end of a week I got another letter from the prisoner, enclosing a postal order for five shillings—then on 30th or 31st January I got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Millwage Green, Croft Gardens, West Hampstead. Dear Mrs. Aubrey,—I have enclosed five shillings for baby. I hope it is all right, and no trouble. I am glad that you are going to take her to be vaccinated next week. I am afraid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189104060028"/>
               <p>I shall be obliged to deprive you of her again, as my husband says he has a friend in the country who wants to take baby, and would like to keep her as their own; so if you won't be offended, and won't mind taking her to be done, as I am wanted here, so can't get away for a week or two, but will let you know when I can come and fetch her; so I don't know that it is worth while to send the clothes now, as I shall have to bring them back again.") I did take the child to be vaccinated on the Monday after—the child got over the vaccination very well—about 9th or 10th February I received this letter from the prisoner, in answer to one I wrote asking her to send me a certificate of baby's birth in case it should be asked for. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I am pleased to think that baby is vacci<lb/>nated, and that she is a good little thing. I hope it will get on all right, and not make her ill. "You must not think it anything against you that I am going to take baby away, only it is a friend I have known almost all my life, and she wishes to have baby. I hope you will be successful and get another. If I know of one I will let you know. I have enclosed P.O. order for five shillings and card of register of birth. On Thursday evening I will fetch her, or if you can bring her to Baker Street at a quarter to seven, and I will pay you for it; that would save my coming right there, as I have to go to Waterloo. You can send me her things by Carter Paterson. I shall not want them, only what she wears, as I have short clothes made for her.")—on that Thursday night, 12th February, I went to Baker Street Station at a quarter to seven; I took the child with me; it was then in good health; I fed it before leaving home, and I fed her with the bottle while in the train—I took with me a clean nightgown and half a dozen diapers, tied up in a brown paper parcel; my daughter's address in writing was on the paper—the child had on a flannel band, a shirt, a long flannel, a linen binder, a white nightgown, and a little pink-and-white jacket, and boots tied with pink ribbon, a piece of blanketing and necessaries to keep it warm and comfortable; a white wool shawl, a red-and-black shawl, a little white neck-handkerchief, and a hood—I met the prisoner at the station; I had to wait a little while for her—she was carrying a tin bonnet-box, of a yellow colour—I gave her the baby and asked her how she thought she was looking—she said she thought she was looking very well indeed; that she had grown, and that she was a dear little thing—I told her I had brought a parcel of a few things for her in case they were wanted; a little nightgown, and diapers, and her bottle—I handed her the parcel and bottle separate, and I said, "I don't think you will have to feed her again, she will go to sleep, as I have fed her in the train"—she said, "Will you untie the string and put it inside for me? it is rather hard to lock, so I have brought a piece of string—I untied the string and opened the box, and put the parcel and the bottle inside—there was a small sheet of brown paper folded in the box; I think I laid the certificate with it; I had carried it in my hand, think<lb/>ing she might want to put it in her pocket, but I think I put it in the box—this is it—I said, "Are you going to take the baby to its destination?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "When you take off her things you will see how she is grown"—she said, "Oh, I can see now, Mrs. Aubrey; you have taken care of her; she is a dear little thing," and kissed her—this was in the station—she asked, did it matter about not paying me the money she had promised; that she had not been paid herself; but she</p>

               <p>would send it on to me next evening—I said I was a little disappointed, but of course that would do—she carried the baby and I carried the box—she said she wanted a Westminster 'bus, as she was going to Waterloo—I said, "I will go with you to the corner of Baker Street and see you in the 'bus—she gave me two shillings; I was to have had six—we walked to the top, and there was an omnibus going to Oxford Street—she got in, and I handed her the box, and that was the last I saw of her—I left London on the Tuesday afterwards, and went to the Isle of Wight—I afterwards received four shillings from her—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the things I gave the prisoner on the 12th.

I live at 88, Finchley Road—I am related to Mrs. Wood; she sent for me about four in the afternoon of 25th February—I went upstairs into the bath-room, and found the tin bonnet-box produced; it was hasped, I think, but not locked; I opened it, and found the dead body of a child, covered with brown paper, tied round with a piece of string—when I opened the box I could see the body well, it was very much decomposed—I should say it had been dead about ten or twelve days—I went into an adjoining room and saw the prisoner—I said to her, "You know there has been the dead body of a baby found under your bed"—she said, "Yes; I gave it some pepper<lb/>mint, and it took its breath away; I gave it in the street in Westminster, it was crying so"—I said, "But peppermint won't kill a baby"—she said, "That was all I gave it, but whatever was done would not do it any harm"—there were no clothes on the child, it was quite naked—there was nothing else in the box except the body, the paper, and the string—on 27th February I made a post-mortem in conjunction with Dr. Pepper—the body was well nourished, weighing from ten to twelve pounds, a proper weight for a child of that age—there were no external marks of violence—there was a deep stain on the upper side of the tip of the tongue, in the centre, extending about a quarter of an inch down<lb/>wards, about half an inch wide; that might have been produced by pressure of the jaw—the brain was quite healthy; the lungs were healthy, just a little swollen at the edges; that might be from decomposition—the heart was quite healthy; the stomach, liver, and kidneys perfectly healthy, the stomach empty—I found no trace of any chronic disease—I found no trace whatever of peppermint or of any poison having been ad<lb/>ministered—the cause of death was asphyxia, i.e., suffocation—I could not say from the appearance of the body in what way that suffocation was caused—the body of the child was doubled up in the box, lying with the right side of the face towards the bottom of the box; the head bent</p>

               <p>on the chest, wedged in—the box was not large enough to take the child at full length; it pretty well filled the box—I could not say whether it was put in before or after death, it was so decomposed—in a child of that age rigidity would set in probably in about three or four hours—I am unable to state whether the body was rigid or not when put into the box; I have no knowledge of cases where peppermint has caused suffocation; it is sometimes properly given to children, generally when they have flatulency; it is warming and soothing—a pennyworth bought at a chemist's would be essence of peppermint; that is not very strong, not the strongest form—I am unable to state whether traces of it would be found in a body ten days after death, because of the decomposition—I say that death was caused by suffocation; but I am not able to state in what way that suffocation came about—holding the child's face firmly to the breast might cause suffocation, or covering its face with clothes.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 13th March, enclosing a form of letter to be written on the firm's paper, and requesting the re-purchase of</hi> 11,000 <hi rend="italic">bonds, to be paid for at</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic">per cent, of the price quoted for the day, and</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">per cent, commission</hi>)—I also received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 13th March, from Brown, to the witness, agreeing to allow him a quarter of any money recovered, after paying the amount arranged to the people presenting the Alabama debentures</hi>)—I wrote to him on 14th March by instruction, and met him on the 16th in the Bodega, in answer to a letter from him—he said we were to go to 37 and 38, Mark Lane, at five minutes to two, to meet his people, and I was to take with me a cheque for £1,500, and cash it in gold and £5 notes—he wanted it all in gold, but I objected because it was very heavy, and we arranged for £500 in gold and £1,000 in £5 notes—we went to our office, and I told Brown I could not get the cheque that day—I left him outside and came back and spoke to him—I got a cheque on the 16th, and wrote to him, telling him that I had got it and would cash it next day, and on the 17th I received this letter from him, which crossed mine. (<hi rend="italic">Offering to meet the witness next day outside Martin's bank</hi>)—on the 17th I found him outside Martin's bank; we went in together, and I cashed the cheque for £1,500, and got £500 in gold and £1,000 in notes at his request—I told him I did not consider it safe with such a large sum on me to meet people I did not know, and that I would rather go to his house or mine, where we could transact the business quite as expeditiously—he said he had arranged to meet them at a friend's office, 37, Mark Lane, and he must acquaint them with my objection—he said that his friends were to pay £5 for the use of the office, and a larger sum if the business was satisfactorily carried out—I said I would remain in Lom<lb/>bard Street while he went to see his friends—he said that I must not go—he hailed a cab to drive to Mark Lane, and said, "You must trust me with at least £200 to begin with, as my friends cannot do anything with<lb/>out seeing the money"—I said that I could not part with any money</p>

               <p>without the return of a corresponding number of bonds—he said he was sure there would be no business done unless I gave him the money, and offered his personal guarantee, which I did not accept—the cab arrived at Mark Lane and stopped—he invited me to go upstairs to the office; I said I did not consider it safe to go upstairs with such a large sum of money, and I remained in the cab—he went into the building and came down with Flobert, who asked me if I knew French—I said I could not speak in French with him—he said that the business was a very difficult one, but if I gave the money to Brown it would be all right, and Brown said I must give him £200, as his people had to go to Peckham for the bonds, and the object was to drive to Finborough Road, where we should receive the bonds from his people coming from Peckham—Brown said he would give me a receipt for the £200, and took a leaf out of his pocket-book and wrote this: "Received of Mr. Artesani the sum of £200 for the return of Alabama Bonds. <hi rend="smallCaps">ALEX. BROWN</hi>"—I then handed him a bag containing 200 sovereigns, and he and Flobert went into the building; I remained in the hansom—the three prisoners were then brought out in custody.</p>

There was no ill-will between Brown and me, but there was a little misunderstanding; we had a difference, and the acquaintance absolutely ceased; it was renewed on my receipt of this letter this year—our respective families had kept up the acquaintance—Brown did not go into Baring's bank with me, he remained outside while I went in and consulted Lord Revelstoke, and I returned and told him I had done so—when Brown offered me a fourth of the commission I did not say, "Well, it would be handy to have £100 or so just now"—he suggested that bonds value £400 should be handed over from time to time, and I said in my letter that it would take a tremendous time to receive them in driblets—he told me that the £200 was to be given so that the people might fetch the bonds from Camberwell or Peckham, and bring them to his house in Finborough Road, and we, meaning himself and me, were to go to the Cintra Road, meaning his own house, and wait for them.</p>

I am a cycle engineer at 103a, Dalston Lane; I repair and deal in cycles generally—on Monday evening, 23rd March, about 9.30, the prisoner brought a safety bicycle—he said he had had it for four years, and said, "Will you buy this bicycle?"—I said, "I will sell it for you"—he said, "I have to go abroad to-morrow, and I want to sell it at once"—I told him I thought I could get 30s. or £2 for it—he said, "I want a sovereign for it"—I said, "If you leave it for two or three days I can get you 30s. or £2"—he afterwards said he would take ten shillings—I asked him his name and address, and said if he chose to take a small deposit on the ten shillings I would buy it, and he could call for the rest of the money to-morrow—he wrote his name and address as Cook, 14, Canterbury Road, Balls Pond, and gave it to me—he said the bicycle cost £7 four years ago, which I thought from the date of manufacture would be reasonable—I gave him five shillings deposit, and said he could have the other money next morning—it is my custom to give information before I purchase anything, and I informed the police—next evening at seven o'clock the prisoner came for the money—Constable Buckner was in my workshop at the back—I said to the prisoner, "The address you gave was wrong"—he said, "It was 41, not 14, Canterbury Road"—he maintained the name of Cook—the officer came out, and said he must go with him to the station—he said nothing,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189104060041"/>
               <p>and did not seem to have any objection—neither I nor the officer thought the bicycle was stolen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not say I could get you 10s., when you asked a sovereign—you went out of the shop, and came back with another man, and I think you said to him, "This man says he will not give £1, but he will give 10s.; will you take it?"—the other man may have said he would take 10s.—I believe there was an arrangement for the other man to call for the 5s., but that was an arrangement between you, and had nothing to do with me. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see the other man again. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BUCKNER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Constable J</hi>). I received information through the last witness, and went to his address on the morning of 24th March, and again in the evening—while I was there the prisoner came in—Alum said to him, "I have been to 14, Canterbury Road, with a view to pay you the rest of the money"—the prisoner said, "41, old man "—I said to the prisoner, "Is your name Cook?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you live at 41, Canterbury Road?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You partly sold the machine to Mr. Alum last night?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I want you to account for the possession of it"—he said, "I was selling it for a friend"—I said I had every reason to believe the machine had been stolen; and he would have to come to Dalston Lane Police-station with me and be detained while some inquiry was made—he said, "Very well," and he went with me—at the station I said, "I want your correct name, and address"—he said, "It is Joseph Coates, 66, Leman Street"—I said, "Who is this friend of yours?"—he said, "His name is Cook"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "41, Canterbury Road, I believe"—I went to 41, Canterbury Road, no person named Coates or Cook was known there—the prosecutor identified the bicycle at the Police-station.</p>

I am a sailor, and live at Peabody's Buildings, Pimlico—on the night of 14th March I was at the Three Elms; while there a dispute took place between Noakes and Clark, and they went out—I don't think Watts went out—a few minutes afterwards Clark and Noakes came in again—I saw Duffy push Noakes on to the floor—Watts asked Duffy what he pushed the man down for; they talked together, and as I turned my head I saw Watts with the door in his hand, half open, and the prisoners rushed towards the door and jumped at him, and pushed him outside, both of them together, and he fell on his head—I went out, and saw both the men kicking him as he was lying with his head out in the road and his feet on the pavement—I saw both of them kick him in the upper part of the body more than once—Creswell came to his assistance, and he got knocked down; I don't know by which of them; he got up, and Watts was trying to turn himself round on the pavement, and Rushton was kicking him on the back, at the back part of the neck, and Duffy on the front—the prisoners then walked away for about fifty yards up the street—somebody went over and said, "Come back; you have been and kicked him to death"—then they both ran away—I followed, and spoke to a constable—I did not see either of them again until Duffy was in custody in Rochester Row at the station—</p>

I am a private in the Grenadier Guards, at Chelsea Barracks—Watts was in the same regiment—about eleven on the night of 14th March I was with him in the Three Elms—I saw the prisoners there and some civilians—a fight occurred between two of the civilians; after that I saw Duffy push Noakes; Watts told him he should not have done it; that he had nothing to do with him—some words took place between them; I told Watts to keep still, and not to have any bother, and he sat down—after about a quarter of an hour he got up and walked over to Duffy in a friendly way; Duffy said to him that he had been on all the night, and he had better go out and have it out—Watts said he did not want to have any bother—the two prisoners then rushed at Watts by the door, and struck at him, and shoved him, and the next thing I saw was Watts on the pavement outside—I followed them out, close after them, and while Watts was on the pavement the prisoners kicked him—I saw Duffy kick him somewhere about the neck; it was a running kick; he stepped back about a pace or two, and then rushed at him—I saw Rushton kick him, but not with such force as Duffy, and in a different part of the body—I assisted to pick Watts up, and Duffy and I fell; they ran away, down Star Street and up Peter Street—I pursued them for about two hundred yards, and then lost sight of them—I returned to the public-house; Watts was still on the ground; I spoke to him, but got no answer—I undid his tunic and sent for the police, and he was taken away on a stretcher—next day I went to Wellington Barracks, and identified Duffy, and picked him out.</p>

I live at 4 1/2, Bath Street, Clerkenwell, and am an ice cream vendor—on 19th March, between half-past eight and nine p.m., I was in my kitchen—I heard a noise in the street and went outside and saw a crowd of fifteen or twenty people outside a public-house close to my house—I went three or four steps and I met the prisoner, who said to me, "Where are you going to, you disgusting object?"—the prisoner was alone—Raphael Tricia, the prisoners uncle, said to the prisoner, "Strike him!"—on that the prisoner drew an open knife from his pocket and struck me on the side—it was a bigger knifeman this—I received another blow at the same time from Raphael Tricia with a knife also—I only received one wound from the prisoner—I went into my house—the prisoner came in with a shovel two minutes afterwards and said, "I want to finish to kill you," lifting up the shovel—there were some barrows between us that protected me—he did not strike me with the shovel—an Italian blew a policeman's whistle, and the prisoner went away—he came back again not two minutes after when he found the policeman was not there—I saw he was infuriated like a madman, and I drew a barrow between us; seeing he could not strike me, he threw the shovel at me; it did not strike me—the prisoner ran away—I knew I was wounded—I bled much—the policeman proposed to take me to the hospital, but I said I would rather go home and have a doctor—a doctor came to see me—I am sure the prisoner is the man who stabbed me on my left Bide—there was light enough for me to see him.</p>

I am the prosecutor's brother—at half-past eight p.m. on 19th last March I was in a public-house in Little Bath Street with the prisoner, Raphael, the prosecutor, Raphael Allocca, and another Allocca—we had a bit of a dispute in the public-house, and went into the street, where the dispute went on—when there is confusion people accumulate—I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor with a knife which I saw in his hand; it might have been this knife or another, as it was dark; it was open—only one blow was given; it was on the shoulder—there was an enormous lot of people about—the prisoner returned shortly afterwards with a shovel and began to strike—he struck the prosecutor on the arm, and struck him six or seven times with the shovel—there were barrows there, and instead of striking the prose<lb/>cutor, he struck the barrows—I went to assist my brother when he was stabbed—I saw blood on his shoulder and hip—he fell down—after the. prisoner struck my brother with the shovel he ran away—I am perfectly certain it was the prisoner who wounded my brother with a knife.</p>

               <p>quarter to eight on 19th. March I was called to 4 1/2, Little Bath Street, Clerkenwell, and went there with my assistant immediately—I saw the prosecutor on a bed—he had an incised wound over the left shoulder-blade, extending to the bone, but there was very little flesh there—it was about 1 in. long—it is not serious; it might have gone into the lung if the bone against which the instrument struck had not been there—he had another incised wound on the left loin, perhaps 1 1/2 in. long and at least 1 1/2 in. deep—I was afraid to probe further because it was in rather a dangerous position, near the bowel and kidney; there was a good deal of blood from it, but I could not say it was dangerous—a knife such as this might have caused it, without very much force being applied—the prosecutor has been in danger, but is better now—both wounds bled, but the lower one bled the more—he was in a state of collapse, when I saw him, from loss of blood—he had an abrasion on his left arm from the elbow to the wrist—it might have been done by a shovel or by a fall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ealing Dean—I am not in business—I am the freeholder of a farm of 100 acres at Ambledon, in Hampshire—on 30th December I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, "Farm, wanted to purchase, not more than two hours from London," etc.—I wrote this letter the same day, describing my farm, and saying, "The price is £1,650, or I am open to a reasonable offer"—I addressed that to E. Charles, and in reply received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From Miss E. Clifford</hi>, 11, <hi rend="italic">Bloomsbury Square, stating that she thought the farm would suit her, and inquiring whether the witness would take a portion in cash and the rest in a reversion</hi>)—I replied on,5th January, telling her I should prefer cash, but no doubt we might come to terms—on the same day I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Signed E. Clifford, and requesting the witness to send her an order to see the farm</hi>)—I wrote to her on 6th January, stating that I should be in London one day in the week, and would call on her, a ad received this reply: "6th January. Dear Sir,—I shall be pleased to see you here at three o'clock on Thursday.—<hi rend="smallCaps">E. CLIFFORD</hi>"—on Thursday, 8th January, I went to 11, Bloomsbury Square, and saw the prisoner I Clifford—I told her I had come in reference to the farm—nobody eke was present—she said, "The gentleman who attends to my business will be here directly"—she requested me to wait, and left the room—I waited about ten minutes, and then the prisoner Morley came in in a great hurry with his top coat on, I understood his name was E. Charles—i he said, "I am sorry I cannot stay with you at present; I have to go off to Bristol directly; however, you can give me a few particulars"—I gave him some particulars of the farm, and he suddenly walked across from the fireplace and pointed to photographs of winding, up apparatus for a pit, and said, "Miss Clifford is a rich lady; she has £25,000 in this colliery, which is paying a large percentage; we have only one shaft at present; we have gone through two seams of coal, and come upon a third one, which is a very good one; we shall have three more shafts, and then we expect to pay thirty-five per cent., and we shall be able to get any amount of coal"—he also said that Miss Clifford had £5,000 in another security, and that her father had left her a large amount of money, and that she wanted the farm for a hobby, to rear poultry—he said, "You under<lb/>stand</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189104060052"/>
               <p>how the payment is to be made?"—I said, "Yes"—he requested me to send him a plan of the farm, and not to sell it till he had seen it—I then went away—on 11th January I sent a plan of the farm in a letter to Miss E. Clifford, and on 30th January I sent her this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Asking her, or anyone she might appoint, to meet him at Petersfield, and go and see the farm</hi>)—I got this reply from her; it is in the same writing. (<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness to meet him at Waterloo Station, to go down and see the farm</hi>)—I received a telegram the same night, and went to Waterloo next morning at 9.30, and met Morley—I asked where Miss Clifford was—he said, "She is not very well this morning, and she has left the matter entirely in my hands; whatever I advise her to do she will do"—when we got into the train he said, "I have a better thing for you than the part payment mentioned in the letter and the reversion; it is to transfer to you the amount of the purchase-money from some of Miss Clifford's shares in the colliery company, 25,000, it will pay you better"—I made no reply—he then said, "Miss Clifford is a curious tempered woman, but she is a dear creature; I have known her ever since she was fifteen years old, and I have managed all her business affairs for her; you must leave the matter to me," giving me to understand that she might throw up the farm—I suppose he meant if I vexed her—he said he had bought 1,800 acres of land near Bristol—I said, "What interest have you in the colliery in shares?"—he said, "I and my family have £50,000 in it myself, my wife, and my daughter, son-in-law, and two nieces"—I asked him what it cost to raise the coal at the pit's mouth—he said, "6s. and we are selling them at 20s. "—I said, "What percentage did it pay last year? "—he said, "Eight to nine per cent., which they were using for working expenses"—I said, "How long has the pit been opened?"—he said, "Sixteen months, twelve months last October, and the £25,000 capital was left untouched"—I said if the purchase was complete I should require my solicitor to carry it through—he said, "We can do without a solicitor; my solicitor has gone out of town for a fortnight, and he has left me a blank form to fill in and a copy of all that is necessary, and it will save us £25 apiece; you do not want to throw away £25"—I said no—I went to the farm with him—he expressed himself satisfied with it, but made some complaints about the dilapidations—I said I would knock him off £50 for that—he said, "Oh no, Miss Clifford is a rich lady, and she will pay for the repairs; bring your deeds to Bloomsbury Square to-morrow morning at 10.30"—next morning I went to 11, Bloomsbury Square, and saw Miss Clifford—directly afterwards Morley came in—he said, "I have given Miss Clifford the full particulars of your farm, and I have advised her to buy it at the price, £1,650; now let us look at the deeds"—I objected; I said, "I prefer to go to my solicitor"—he said, "We can manage it for ourselves, and save £25 apiece each; I assure you, Mr. Hobson, it is a genuine thing we offer you"—I said to Miss Clifford, "Is it perfectly true that you have £25,000 invested in this colliery?"—she said, "It is perfectly true"; and on the faith of that statement I showed them my deeds—they looked at them, and Morley said to her, "You see, my dear, Mr. Hobson has given so-and-so," naming the purchase-money that appeared on the face of the deed—it was £910, and he said, "If I give 5s. for that table and sell it for £20, that has nothing to do with the purchaser"—he also showed Miss Clifford the</p>

               <p>amount the late owner had given for the property, and remarked that the late vendor had given almost as much as I say; the late vendor gave £1,600, and I said, "£1,650 after laying out a lot of money there"—Morley read portions of the deed to Miss Clifford, and asked her if she was perfectly satisfied—she said, "Yes"—he said, "Let us draw up the transfer" and produced a blank form headed "This indenture," and also a draft copy which he said the solicitor left him a copy of—I then wrote at his dictation—Miss Clifford went in and out of the room—when we came to the recital of the purchase-money Morley said, "You had better ask him how he will have it"—he said I was to have 2,000 in shares fully paid up—I objected to that—he said, "We will allow you 350:250 to purchase the stock on the farm and 100 to pay to Miss Clifford in cash for the dilapidations"—I said I should show the document to my solicitor before signing it—I went on writing, and almost directly Morley said, "My dear, give Mr. Hobson something to drink"—I said I would rather not have anything to drink while I was writing, but she shortly brought a tumbler about one-third full of whisky and soda water—I drank a little and then went on writing, and shortly afterwards drank the rest, and I very soon became confused and said, "This affects my head," and put the pen down—I was some Utile time before I could proceed—Morley said, "It will do you no harm, you will soon be all right," and urged me to go on—I seemed to lose my self-possession—I completed the document and signed it, and executed it, putting my finger on the seal—there was no one there to witness the signature, but a man came in afterwards and sat down at the table—I did not see him sign his name—Miss Clifford took the paper up from the front of him immediately he sat down, and he and Miss Clifford went into another room—Miss Clifford returned in about two minutes, and brought the document back, but I do not remember seeing the man again—I did not see a witness's name appended to the document—Miss Clifford said the man was demented, and could not write before other people—I understood her to say afterwards that he was her brother—besides this document, I signed this document B on 4th February—this pencil memorandum is also my writing—I did not sign this document (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>)—that is Mr. Jackson's signature—I left the docu<lb/>ment signed by Jackson with Morley—Jackson signed it in my presence at the Railway Inn—this is my signature to this document D—I signed that on February 4th—I see that it is dated February 3rd:—"Dear Sir,—Having sold the farm to Miss Clifford, this shall be your authority to deliver up the same to that lady or her order. To Mr. E. A. Jackson. Please surrender the lease. "—the-pencil memorandum is the valuation of the stock—I left that with Morley—the next is "E. M.

(<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt, dated 4th February, of a share certificate in the Bristol Midland Colliery Company, to be transferred from the name of Miss E.

(<hi rend="italic">This demanded the return of the contract by twelve o'clock next day to prevent further proceedings; the other was a similar letter addressed to Miss Clifford</hi>)—he gave me a number of papers together, but I did not look at them—I gave them to my solicitor.</p>

I should have been satisfied—Morley gave me a number of papers, and I believe this prospectus was among them; but I have never seen it; I never saw one of the papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. This colliery was a speculation from the beginning—it was worked some years ago by two men who earned their £6 or £7 a week, and sat down and spent it—my attention was first called to the matter by Mr. Alfred Scott—I have heard that Morley is—an undischarged bankrupt, and for him to take up the matter in his own name was impossible—he has to my knowledge advanced a great amount of knowledge and labour and capital—he has found several thousand pounds either from his own resources or from his friends—he may have spent £7,000 or £8,000—when I was first required to act I went to the place, and went down the shaft—I made inquiry with regard to its position and prospects before I consented to have anything to do with it—I have given time, attention, and labour to it, and have never received a penny—I have put cash into it, and in lieu of salary I am the registered holder of 3,000 or 3,500 shares—it has never been put on the public market—it is the intention to keep it in the hands of the private shareholders as a source of income, instead of letting it out to the world—I have from time to time applied for and received the reports on the mine of eminent civil and mining engineers—Mr. Stuart, M. D., is a man of eminence of Oldlands, near Bristol, and I think I received copies of the report from Morgans, of Bristol, and in addition to that there was the engineer of the company, Mr. Alfred Scott, and Mr. Henderson—the colliery was reported once by the Commissioners of 1886 in their report on the coal in the United Kingdom—I went down and viewed it, and have been down to watch the progress several times to see whether the coals were there the first time, and the second time from the notice of the Government that we must brick up the lining of the shafts—they were only six ft. in diameter, and they are now ten—it is in the red sand<lb/>stone—my opinion is that it is a very valuable property, and I think it will be proved so—I have been surveyor for thirty years—I never was much in the colliery line, only as they came to me in the ordinary way of business—I formed my opinion in a very great measure by the sur<lb/>rounding lot—our company have a colliery within one hundred yards from which we are bringing up coal—I should not say that the property</p>

               <p>is worth one penny less than £80,000, but it will be doubled in July when we have gone a few feet further—we have had an action before Mr. Justice Stirling, in the Chancery Division, not only as to our right to the property, but our right to the next, and the result is that we have got it—it is part of the same property—it is in the lease of 1,800 acres—the man in possession has been turned out, and we are working that very coal—we believe we are nearing a seam of four feet six in width—we have opened two other seams—I think the geological map is here show<lb/>ing the slate we have actually gone through—we have increased the amount from six feet to ten, and have also sunk another shaft as an auxiliary—all that required a considerable expenditure of money, and it is requiring it still—there is what is called fault in the strata—that makes no difference in our finding the coal, but it may be 60 ft. lower—the idea that a fault renders it impossible to get the coal is absurd—I have not paid for my 3,000 shares, but I have given money, labour, and time—Mr. Morley and I are responsible for the expenses yet to come—debentures have been issued to the extent of, it may be, £55,000, and the interest has been paid—judging from the strata and taking the fault into account, we are on one side of the fault, and we have certain strata on the other side—we shall have the same strata pushed down or drawn up—we can tell pretty well how far we are from the bed of coal, it is about 20 ft.—that will cost about £300—we shall then have got enough—we do not want to go lower—the colliery is in the parish of Mangotsfield—that is the junction of the railway to Bath and Bristol at the point of a triangle—our area runs up to the railway, and they can lay down a line of rails at any time—it is bounded on one side by the Midland Railway and on the other by the collieries of the late Mr. Handel Cosbam, which are very valuable mines—we have an old servant who was with him thirty-two years as underground engineer, and he has reported to us upon it—the pit is some<lb/>where about ninety yards deep—under Mr. Justice Stirling's decree we have got power to use one shaft—there are two shafts there—the former manager was turned out and another manager put in, and we are working the whole—we are working the second seam at about eighty-four yards down, and there was an output from that of 100 to 200" tons a day when we were at full work—it might cost 5s. 6d. a ton delivered at the bank—we are selling it now at 14s.—the third seam is about the same depth and two feet thick—that makes 14s. a ton as well, and it has made 15s.—we are making 15s. now, but I take off a shilling for casual expenses—supposing we do get everything at work, so that we could attract capital, there is nothing to prevent our raising from 300 to 500 tons from the third seam—Mr. Henderson was in charge of the colliery, and working it before we got the decree from Mr. Justice Stirling—he was called at the Police-court—he has been turned out in consequence of the decree—if he had made a report like this I should agree with him entirely.</p>

I am a mining engineer of Mangotsfield—I have known the colliery claimed by the Bristol and Midlands Colliery Company for the last two and a-half years; I have not been down; I have been to the mouth of the shaft several times—it has not been worked so as to pay any percentage for two and a half years—it is from ten to twelve acres; it is all private property around it except ten or twelve acres—I know Morley—he sent for me to an hotel last spring, and told me they had about 2,000 acres, and he had given £60,000 for it—I said I was sorry to hear it, for they had no acreage there—he said Newman and Scott were responsible for that—I know Scott, and told Morley his name was not Scott, it was Tooth, and Mr. Newman and Mr. Nichols knew it—that is Mr. Scott. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to him</hi>)—I told him that Baron Grant was going to stop it, and he would be the dupe; that there was not likely to be any coal in the Midland Colliery, and I was sorry for him—since I saw him in March they have raised fifty or sixty tons of coal, which was used for the engine—I am not aware that they sold any—so far as I know, no coal has been got since—I did not know Morley before this; he asked me what our colliery was likely to turn out, and to give him a memorandum to show his friend Mr. Hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. I was then manager of the District of Bristol Colliery Company—that had nothing to do with the colliery with which Morley is connected; his was the Bristol and Downend Colliery</p>

               <p>Company—ours is the Mangotsfield Colliery—if Morley purchased the Mangotsfield Colliery it was not ours; they were both known as the Mangotsfield Colliery—I was the manager of the com<lb/>pany which was working that part of the colliery; I am not manager now, because the colliery has been transferred to Mr. Scott's son with a mortgage of £2,000 on it—the shaft is between 400 and 500 yards from the shaft I used to work; some seams cropped up a few feet from the surface; we did not touch till 84 yards, there is a fault, and the seam we did not reach till 84 yards down; they reached at 15 yards down—I proposed to Mr. Morley that he should take our colliery, and thought at the time it would be a reasonably fair specula<lb/>tion for him—I do not think so now; I recommended our people to dis<lb/>pose of it six months after I went there; that was about the time I recom<lb/>mended Morley to buy it; I did not exactly know the extent of it then—it was 25 acres, under Emmett's lease, but it was understood at the time that they had 750 acres—I understood that there was more than 25 acres which the company intended to work—I was the manager until the de<lb/>cree; I ceased to be so by the order of the secretary—the fault in the vein was all on the other side—there is nothing more uncertain than when or how you may come upon a fault—I reported to Mr. Morley that the deep pit was 90 yds. deep, and that we were working the second seam of coal at 84 yds., which was 3 ft. 6 in. thick, and that taking it at 100 to 200 tons a day it would not cost 4s. 6d. a ton; delivered at bank it would cost about 5s. 6d.—it is true that we were working the third seam at 2 ft. thick, and that it was very hard good household coal, and that there were several other seams about 20 yds. deep, and that if the property had sufficient hands to work it it would make an output of 300 or 400 tons a day; that was on the supposition that the other 750 acres would be added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The Mangotsfield series of seams are not on the geographical survey; the Parkfield seams are—they are the series which are worked in the neighbourhood—no colliery worked the seam except the one I am manager of—the Mangotsfield series are below the Parkfield series; they are called the lower series—these mines were worked by the district of Bristol Colliery Company, the leaseholders; Mr. Emmett is the freeholder—the ownership of the Bristol and Downend Colliery is separate and distinct from ours; they are not adjoining; there are ten acres between the two—two seams of coal were never worked together during my knowledge—the Bristol and Downend Mine is three<lb/>quarters of a mile to a mile from any railway—Mangotsfield is a colliery village—only these two are called Mangotsfield Collieries; ours is a private property—on the morning the colliery was transferred to Mr. Scott, Mr. Nichols brought an order to Mr. Cripp, the agent, made out in the name of the secretary of the company—this report which has been put in relates to our mine, the other has not been worked at all; no coal has been sold—in the Bristol and Downend Colliery the coal falls down and leaves the inside of it without any coal; one part of the valley runs down close to the colliery and another part towards Bath—the effect of the anteclinal fault would be that the coal would be more broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as secretary of the Bristol and Midland Colliery Company from August 6, 1890, the date of its registration—I was present at the meetings of the directors—Morley was present at all the meetings; he was not a shareholder, and therefore could not be a director—no money was paid for shares by any person—the shares were illegally issued; in any case the certificate bears the title fully paid—I have experience as a secretary of limited companies—£50 was all that came from the coffers of the company while I was there, which came from Mr. Morley; besides the shares, debentures were issued to bearer and given to Morley, but not to anyone else that I am aware of—Morley informed me that he had liquidated his own personal accounts with them, and several persons whom he had given debentures to called on me afterwards—I did not see Miss Clifford till I saw her at the Police-court—I know by the share list that she is a shareholder—Morley described her as a lady of considerable means, and that she acted as his nominee, and enjoined me to say so should inquiries be made—he told me that she lived at 11, Bloomsbury Square and also at Brighton, where her address is the same as that given for Miss Hart in the share register—I went down to the colliery about September and made inquiries there of persons in the employ of the company, in consequence of which I ceased to act; I never was secretary—I did not ask for remuneration—I was not paid for giving up the documents—I received one cheque for £5 for petty cash, and I kept the documents as a lien—I am not a discharged servant of the company that I am aware of—my name appeared on the prospectus, but it has been pasted over; Mr. Morley requested me to do that.</p>

I understand much about companies—the shares of this company were only offered to the public by transfer; they were divided by a family arrangement—there was no fraud on the public, it was only a speculation at the risk of those who carried it on; I think the only mistake they made was not registering the shares—it has become a very common practice for banking firms to become limited companies without offering the shares to the public, and not with a view to invite the public to join them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Palmerston Buildings, Old Broad Street—I produced a lease yesterday, granted by Alfred Scott to Henry Hands on December 31st, 1889—I got it from Mr. Hands, but Morley told me some time before September, 1889, that he had had an offer from Mr. Scott to get the lease of the Mangotsfield Colliery, and that Scott had an immediate right to grant the lease, and he had an equitable right in the adjoining property, subject to the litigation before Mr. Justice Stir<lb/>ling, so that he got that lease in an equitable contract to be turned into legal documents, and simply disposed of—he showed me parts of collieries in the "West of England, and I agreed to advance him £100—I have a memorandum of deposit of deed that refers to this lease, and a letter from Scott to Hands—I have not got the agreement, but I can get it—if the company was successfully floated I was to have a bonus of £2,000, in</p>

               <p>disappointed at the last moment about the securities—I have no idea how many of my cheques have been dishonoured during the last twelve months, but the majority have been paid—I am in better circumstances now since I know what I receive—on April 4th, a few days ago, a committal order for ten days was made against me in the City of London Court; that matter has been paid now—I paid the prisoner's wages regularly, with one exception during this year, and then I paid £1 on the Saturday and seventeen shillings and sixpence on the Monday—my cash-book from 1st January this year showing the payments is here—the cash-book up to 31st December is missing from my office; it began in April or May last year, I swear to the best of my recollection—I have not got here the cash-book which I had before April or May of last year; I suppose it is somewhere among my books and papers—such a cash-book is in existence—I have not had notice to produce it—I had two notices to produce a fortnight or three weeks ago at the Police-court—I have been at home upon and since 6th April—I may say I have never seen any such notice to produce as this—I have had two or three notices to produce books, and I have brought them; I had. no notice about the cash-book prior to April or May, 1890, and I did not think it necessary to produce it—it is not a fact that up to 1st January this year I had no cash-book at all; it is absolutely untrue that I began keeping a cash-book at the beginning of this year in consequence of the prisoner suggesting to me that I should get into trouble in the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court if I did not—I had a solicitor to conduct this case at the Police-court—he did not say on the third hearing that he was so dis<lb/>satisfied and disgusted with the case that he would have nothing more to do with it—he withdrew from the case-when I told him in Court I would not allow him to proceed further—I did not tell him that in the Magistrate's hearing—after a quibble between the prisoner's solicitor and Mr. Waring, my solicitor, Mr. Curtice Bennett said that he never had a prosecution more disgracefully presented to him; I fully endorsed that, and I then spoke to Mr. Waring; then I said to the Magistrate that as I was not represented by solicitor, if it was necessary for me to be represented I should withdraw from the case, but that if he would allow me to conduct my own case I would go on—the Magistrate said he would give me every assistance to go on, and he did so; he never said I could with<lb/>draw—the prisoner's solicitor said he objected to my withdrawing, and insisted on the case being dismissed—on 23rd February, two days after the prisoner had left my service, he wrote to me this letter, threatening the with an action for slander, and giving me notice that he was going to Mr. Waddington; that was not my first intimation that he was going to Mr. Waddington—I went to try and induce him to prosecute the prisoner, not to forestall the prisoner—Mr. Waddington said the prisoner had been to him in the morning and given him instructions—I had several conversa<lb/>tions with the Mr. Bull and Mr. Sells mentioned in the letter—I did not tell them that I must do something to stop the prisoner's mouth; something had been done before I saw them; instructions were given to proceed long before I had seen Bull—I cannot give the words I said to them—I swear I said no words bearing that construction, because instructions had been given to proceed—I collected rents for Mr. Gammage—he holds my dishonoured cheque for the rents I collected; payment of it was stopped because I have a contra account against him—he has never taken proceedings</p>

               <p>about it—we had a quarrel the day after the cheque was given—I cannot swear there were funds at the bank to meet the cheque when I gave it, but I had money to pay into the bank to meet it—I collected rents for Mr. Davison—I do owe him the money I collected—Mr. Gordon was Mr. Davison's solicitor, and claimed the money on his behalf—the prisoner wrote that I was absent from town—this is a balance-sheet in that matter drawn out by the prisoner—I do not owe Mr. Davison a penny; he owes me money—I owe Mr. Cobbold £2 10s.—I gave him a cheque for it on February 21st—at the time I gave it I asked him to hold it over, and I found afterwards it was presented the following week—it has been dishonoured—I swore on the first occasion at the Police-court that I did not know it had been dishonoured; I corrected that on the second or third occasion—after the first hearing I asked Mr. Cobbold to present it again—I asked Miss Smith, of Paddington Green, to cash my cheque for £2 in December last year, because I wanted money—that cheque was dishonoured—Miss Negus, of Norland Square, cashed my cheque for 30s.—that was not dishonoured; payment was stopped; I had a contra account against her—she got judgment against me be<lb/>cause we entered appearance one day too late through the prisoner's fault, and the contra account did not appear in Court—I have instituted proceedings against her for three guineas—Miss Gover, of Ormiston Gardens, cashed my cheque for £2—it was dishonoured; the money was forwarded to her—she got judgment against me in August last year—I collected rents for Miss Grimston in cash—I gave her a cheque for £6 over twelve months ago—it was dishonoured—she obtained judgment against me—I did not set up a bill of sale against her claim; it was already set up; I had it twelve months ago—the Judge knocked it down; he did not say it was fraudulent—my wife's aunt was put forth as the bill of sale holder, and she had the money—I sold some of Mr. James Keast's stock for him—I did not get cash, but promises—he served me with a writ, of which I took no notice, as I had lent him money—I do not know that he has got judgment against me for £140—I collected rents for James Tyler, of London, to the amount of £7 or £8 over twelve months ago—he got judgment against me and a committal order; the debt has been liquidated now—Cramer and Co. got a committal order against me—this was all over twelve months ago—Cramer's committal order was a week ago—I gave Alfred Smart a cheque which was lost—I don't know that it was dishonoured; I don't owe him a penny—he did not say that it would be easier to collect his rents himself than to get them from me afterwards—Miss Coombe cashed a cheque for me—she gave me cash to pay for work to be done for her on one or two occasions—I suppose I put the money in my pocket—I gave her a cheque—I believe it was not dishonoured, but it was not paid by arrangement because I had a contra account with her—if I had no money at the bank at the time it would have been there when the cheque was presented—Brooks, of Thornton Heath, had a cheque of mine, which was dishonoured, and got judgment against me twelve months ago—there was no contra account there—twelve months ago Cornish and Gardiner, of High Hol<lb/>born, had a cheque of mine which was dishonoured; they obtained judgment—I gave Barber a cheque which I told him I should not meet, I had a contra account there—Lewis, of Bucklersbury, lent me £10—gave him a rotten cheque—he did not obtain judgment against me; he</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Tower Hill Branch of the National Amalgamated Sailors' and Firemen's Union—my office is on the firstfloor of 17, King Street, Tower Hill—below are Lockhart's cocoa-rooms, and above are two floors—Mr. and Mrs. Bell live in a kitchen, the door of which is almost opposite my office. door—the prisoner was a member of my branch of the Union—on 18th March, shortly after half-past six, I returned to the office, the street door was ajar; I opened it and saw the prisoner coming downstairs—I knew him personally—I said, "Halloa! what do you want here?"—he said, "There is a man wants you upstairs"—I passed him and went upstairs, and on the middle of the stairs I saw another man, who rushed past me on the stairs, and he and the prisoner ran away together—I gave chase to the top of Queen Street; the prisoner ran in front of the other man—when they turned into Royal Mint Street I lost sight of them—I went back to the office and found that the office door had been forced, and the lock of a box was forced, and about 5s. 6d. taken, mostly in coppers—I found on the ground my carpenter's tool for boring holes; it was bent and broken—I gave information to the police</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189104060072"/>
               <p>—I have known the prisoner for three or four weeks; he had come up to the office and I had seen him almost daily—I have no doubt that he is one of the men that rushed past me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I spoke at the Police-court to their rushing down the stairs and to my chasing them—people occupy the floor above my office—there was no light on the stairs—I fixed the time because when I came back from chasing the men I looked at the clock and it had turned seven—that was after I examined the office—numbers of Union men are continually going up to my office—the office is closed at five o'clock, after that they knock at the street door, sometimes they go no further than the street door; no one is living there belonging to the Union, after the office is closed, to admit them—no man would gain admittance to the office through people on the other floors—sometimes I am there after hours—a member of the Union might think I was there—I could not say how long the prisoner has been a member of the Union; he had been in London three or four weeks before this happened—after seeing this paper I have no doubt he was discharged on 28th February—he has been out and in of the office daily since he has been on shore—at that time a great many sailors were coming to the office—he gave an address which was on our books; I did not know where he lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 259, Brockley Road—I am manager to Messrs. Kearsley and Tonge, wholesale provision merchants and tea dealers, in Mitre Square—they employ about three hundred hands at the chief office—they have close upon two hundred establishments in different places, in which they employ a large number of hands—Curme was a porter in their employ at Mitre Square, at 25s. a week—he was also employed by the housekeeper there in cleaning out the offices, and in clearing up after the close of business in the day, and before opening in the morning—he would arrive as nearly seven in the morning as possible; the warehouse would open at eight—he would remain in the evening about an hour after he had done his work—he was a porter in the delivery department; he would deliver the goods to the various vans that came to the place, under the instructions of the delivery foreman, and to wheel the goods on to the vans—as a cleaner he would have access to the whole of the premises—Mr. Jenkins was the head of that department; he would arrive at 8.30—before a carman leaves the building he has to get a delivery-sheet from the delivery foreman, which is registered, and that contains the names of the customers to whom he has to deliver goods, and he has to bring back the sheet to the delivery foreman, and that is filed—the firm does not allow the sale of provisions to their <hi rend="italic">employés</hi>, that has long since been discontinued—Curme would have access to the delivery-sheets in the course of his duty as cleaner—the Allisons were not customers of the firm; their names do not appear on our books as such, there is no trace of any transaction with them; I had no knowledge of any of our goods being delivered to them—on Thursday, 5th March, in consequence of information, I went with Inspector Mitchell to 55, Leadenhall Street; Curme had been dismisse on the Monday previous, the 2nd—I saw Allison, who made certain statements, which were reduced to writing; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) Curme had no authority from the firm to deliver goods to the Allisons.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The statements were read as follows:</hi>—Emma Allison's: "About two years ago my son introduced me to Mr. Curme. Between four and five months ago he asked me if I could get him some customers. I said, 'I daresay I can; I know so many people about here. 'He asked me if I would let him have some money to send in an order in the morning. It was my practice to pay him some cash over-night, and the goods to be sent in in the morning. He said the firm would not let him have the goods until he had paid part of the money, and he settled up on the Saturday. Since then I have given him orders from time to time, con<lb/>sisting of bacon and hams, as far as I remember about thirty hams and about forty sides of bacon; my transactions were with him from the 9th to 11th February, I bought from him two hams and two sides of bacon; also two small hams, one weighing 5J and the other 6 lb., for which I paid him £4. I sold Mr. Turner two hams and a piece of bacon on 14th February, which I received from Curme, and Mr. Turner paid me fifteen shillings for them. At the time I was dealing with Curme I knew he was employed at Messrs. Kearsley and Tonge, of Mitre Square. I asked him, and my husband asked him as well, if it was all right, and he said, 'Certainly; Joe had mentioned it to me as well as you if it was all right.' On the 28th February I also bought from him two sides of bacon and two hams, and paid him about £5 for that week. On Sunday last I paid him six shillings on account of future orders, and again on Monday five shillings. On Tuesday he and his wife called round and said he wanted all the money I could let him have for Wednesday night, and he would bend in a large order on the Thursday morning."</p>
               <p>Joseph Allison, husband to Emma Allison, of 55, Leadenhall Street: "I was introduced to Curme at the same time as my wife. During the time of his business transactions with my wife he had asked me on several occasions to take cheeses out for him to various public-houses, the George and Guy, Brick Lane, Busby's, corner of Swan Street, Mansell Street, and the Horseshoe, Aldersgate Street, owned by Mr. Perkins; also the Bull, Leadenhall Street, and the Roebuck, Duke Street; he first of all left them at 55, Leadenhall Street, with my wife's goods, giving me instructions over-night what he was going to send, and where I was to take it to. I have received two cheeses from him for my services. I have also lent him money; he would calculate what was the value of the cheeses, and say, 'Now you give me so much to settle. 'The first cheese was eight shillings, and the second five shillings. I asked him if the goods were honestly come by, as I would have nothing to do with anything that was wrong, pointing to the house we were then in, 55, Leadenhall Street. I said, 'Harry, this house is my bread;' and he said, 'Of course it is right, Joe; do you think I would have anything to do with it if was not right? I have a position to look to as well as you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> by <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. Curme has been in the employment, as near as I can remember, two years—at the time he entered the service and for some little time, we used occasionally to sell to the <hi rend="italic">employés</hi>—that was discontinued in Curme's particular case in December, 1889, and generally about a year ago; the practice did not apply to warehousemen, except to gentlemen like myself; it was discontinued to myself about four or five months ago; I was the last—there would not be occasional sales to Curme for about a year after he came; there was only one transaction</p>

               <p>with him, that was at the end of 1889, and then we told him we should not supply him again; after that were transaction with other <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> not being warehouseman, down to three or four months ago there was no public notification that the firm had ceased to deal with their <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> but it was well known—I did not of Crume having billheads printed in the name of "H. Curme and Co., 3 Duke Street Aldgate, Provision Merchants" until I saw them at the Police-court; that was entirely with<lb/>out our knowledge—when I went with Mitchell to 55, Leadenhall, Street, both the Allisons said that they were willing to give every information it was after that that they made the statements-we last took stock in January last; we usually took stock half-yearly-we last took stock in September, 1890, and before that in March or April I think 6d. a pound is a fair wholesale price for hams.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That would be the imported price; they are smoked after that-we should sell to retailers at a different price—76s. a cwt would be the average price of a side of bacon—the average value of a Canadian cheese would be 60s. a cwt.; that is principally the kind of cheese we have—the principal thing our employ's used to purchase the firm was tea, and in small quantities-such a thing as cheese would only be sold in the original package, and no one would buy an original package for their own consumption.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have been in the employment of Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was arrested on the evening of the 5th March; I was discharged on Monday, the 2nd—I was arrested before the Allisons; I was in bed when the police came—I made a statement to the police on the 6th—I said, "I wish you to tell the Magistrate that there in no one but me in the robbery; I have had sides of bacon, hams, and cheese, and have sold them to Mrs. Allison; 'she thought I came by the goods honestly; I have destroyed the delivery-sheets that the Allisons have signed "—that statement was not true—I was taken before the Magistrate and remanded from time to time—the Allisons called witnesses; some of them spoke of me and of my dealings with them—I was not annoyed at that—I was annoyed at them telling lies—I heard that it was a son of the Allisons that brought the police to me—he came into my room with the police—I made up my mind to give evidence after hearing the lies that were told by their witnesses—I had not made up my mind to give evidence against the Allisons till now—the evidence I give now I should have given in any case, right through the case, the same as I told the Magis<lb/>trate and the inspector from the first, that I should reserve my defence—I made up my mind to give the whole facts of the case from the first—I first heard that I should be called as a witness on the Thursday or Wed<lb/>nesday—I made a statement on 4th April—I sent to the inspector, and asked to see him on 2nd April—I think that was about a day after I had been committed—I said that Mrs. Allison thought I came by the goods honestly, because I was in hopes that the case would have been settled that day—my wife told me that the best thing I could do was to speak the truth—I was not induced to make the statement, because I thought the counsel for the prosecution would let me down light if I incriminated the Allisons—that did not occur to me—I do not know a man named Day—I don't remember saying to anyone, as I was leaving the dock last Thursday, that my late master was going to have counsel to speak for me to let me down lightly, and that in return I was to give evidence against the Allisons—I will not swear I did not—I have been stealing from the prosecutors since last June, not before—I have no doubt said that people knew I could get them things if they wanted them; that I could supply them with bacon, cheeses, and hams—I have done so, and have bought them, which I can prove, from Kearsley's; not in my own name—Pearce was a witness before the Magistrate—I heard what he said—I believe he knew mo by the name of Hampshire—I believe that was a name I had—I did not say I could supply him with bacon, tea, and hams, not at the time: he mentioned, for he said three years ago, and I was not then in London—I no doubt said so, and I have done so—I did not say I had a trifling commission on what I sold—I only had one transaction with Pearce, for which he paid me by instalments—I remember Payne in the Coldstream</p>

               <p>Guards—I told him I was at work in a firm in the City, and asked him if he could introduce me to some member of the sergeants' mess—he did introduce me—no doubt I promised him a commission of 2 1/2 per cent, on any orders that came from the sergeants' mess—I did not supply the mess—he did not know me as Hampshire—I can't say; he may have done so—I was doing a little business of my own at that time—I had some billheads printed "H. Curme and Co., Provision Dealers, No. 3, Duke Street, Aldgate," and sold goods, goods that I had bought, some from Messrs. Kearsley, not all from them; that was-in the middle of last year—I purchased goods from them on 28th March or the beginning of April, 1890; that was the last dealing I had with-them in the name of. Hammond; that was the name I gave—I swear that—the carts I sent the goods in to Allison were MacNamara's carts; they contracted with Kearsley, and I believe Keareley's name was on them—the carmen were Brown and Holloway; I gave them delivery-sheets; I took them, and when the carmen returned them I destroyed them—I can't say how often Mrs. Allison paid me; perhaps once or twice a week; she has passed me money in the presence of other persons, 2s. or 3s. or 10s. at the outside, but never the lot—on Saturday she would come out and pay me—she may have paid me £2 in Mr. Pearce's presence; I won't deny it—I can't remember requesting Mr. Allison to sell things for me—I asked him to take some things for me to Busby, of Swan Street, and George and Guy, of Brick Lane, and Perkins, of the Horseshoe—Perkins bought cheeses of me—I may have asked him to write me a letter of recommendation—my dealings were not very extensive; they may have been as many as twelve—those were goods that I got Abraham Weaver to deliver for me; they were not all stolen—no cheeses were taken to Duke Street; they were taken from Duke Street and delivered to Perkins, with billheads of Curme and Co.—I went in the evening to the Allisons from time to time, sometimes I was paid there; friends of theirs would be there—the goods stolen in June were delivered to Mrs. Allison mostly—I think I was dealing with Perkins in June, and with the other names you have mentioned; no others—I began to steal about June—I don't know the date of my conversation with Pearce, but it was when I bought in my own name, and likewise in the name of Hammond—the dealing with Pearce was over a year ago; it may have been over two years—the suggestion to Payne about the sergeants' moss was, I should think, about twelve months ago—my dishonesty had not com<lb/>menced then—Hammond was a young man who lent me some money, and I asked the use of his name, and he said, "Yes"—that was in order to put his name on my master's books—Hammond knew that the goods were not going to him; in fact, he had gone to the firm and bought things for me—that combination with Hammond lasted until about May,. 1890—it was put an end to by my leaving my lodgings in Duke Street, and going to where I was arrested about a month after—Hammond and Weaver were co-lodgers with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was in consequence of a conversation with my wife that I expressed a wish to see Mitchell; it had nothing to do with the prosecution—in the first instance I thought this matter would be disposed of by the Magistrate—I never gave the Allisons any invoices in the name of Curme and Co.; in fact, they never troubled about it—they generally used to pay and take no notice.—it would not have been possible</p>

               <p>to buy goods anywhere at the price I sold to the Allisons—Mrs. Allison, when she paid me, would generally call me on one side and say, "Don't forget next week"—I did not send goods to any people by the carts except the Allisons—I sent cheeses to the Allisons to be delivered else<lb/>where—Mr. Allison would take them; perhaps he would have a truck—I have had a bye-name of "Hampshee," not Hampshire; it is a phrase for going away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Inspector</hi>). On the 5th March I was—consulted by the prosecutors about this matter, and proceeded to make inquiries—I called at one or two places, and eventually went to 55, Leadenhall Street, where I found the two prisoners were housekeepers Allison was formerly in the City Police, he ceased tube so in 1884—55 is a double house; they were also housekeepers at 43, up a court—Mr. Evans was with me, and Mr. Parkinson, one of Messrs. Kearsley's managers, and Mr. Turner—I said to the prisoners, "I am an Inspector of the City Police; this is Mr. Turner, and this is Mr. Evans; I want to know from you where you have bought the hams you have been selling to Mr. Turner; it is a serious matter, and you had better be careful, and for safety what you say had better be taken down in writing"—Mr. Parkinson then took the statements down—they said they were willing to give every information—Mr. Parkinson then took down Mrs. Allison's statement; I read it over to her, and she signed it—the male prisoner also made a statement—Mr. Evans took that down—it was read over, and he signed it—I afterwards went to 49, Great Prescott Street, and arrested Curme—on 10th March I went again with Mr. Evans to 55, Leadenhall Street—I saw the male prisoner outside the door—I told him I should charge him with being concerned with Curme in stealing and receiving goods belonging to Kearsley and Tonge—I then handed him over to Drury, and told him to take him to Bishops<lb/>gate Station, and wait till I arrived there, when he would be charged—he said nothing—I then went upstairs, and saw Mrs. Allison—I told her I was going to take her into custody, and she would be charged by Mr. Evans with being concerned with Curme, now in custody, with stealing, on the 24th of February last, from the warehouse in Mitre Square, one case containing 100 lbs. weight of bacon and one cheese, value £4 10s.; and further, on the 28th February, 1 cwt. of bacon and two cheeses, value £6; and further, between 1st September, 1890, and 24th February, 1891, with stealing and receiving a quantity of butter, hams, cheese, and tea—I then said, "If you make any answer to the charge, you had better be careful; I will take it down"—she then said, "I have always paid Curme for what I have had; but he may have charged me too much or too little, I don't know; I did not have all the things he has brought here; he used to tell us overnight that I must not touch a certain case, as he wanted it to go else<lb/>where; I don't know what was in it, as the case would be nailed up; one case he sent my husband with to his own house in Prescott Street; the first bacon I had of Kearsley's I fetched away from Miss King's, where Curme used to lodge. I asked Curme whether he could not send the vans direct from the firm to my house, and he did so in Kearsley and Tonge's cart, and always in the morning before 8.30; I have also bought bacon of Hudson's in London Street, and I bought one or two hams there; I am innocent"—I took her to the station, and read the charge,</p>

               <p>and I read the same charge to her husband in his wife's presence—he said, "I wish to state distinctly that I did not know the goods were stolen, as he gave me to understand they were honestly come by"—before their arrest I saw them on the stairs of the building where they are housekeepers while I was making inquiries, and I said to both of them, "I understand that you have been selling things or goods to the clerks in the building"—Allison said, "I don't know;" Mrs. Allison said, "No; I have never sold anything to any clerks; always to labouring men and poor persons "—I made a good many inquiries of persons to whom they had sold; I found no labouring men to whom they had sold; I did find numbers of clerks.</p>

Three years ago last February I saw this paper signed in the red book produced. I saw Mr. Twynam pay £10 to Mrs. Taylor "—then Frederick Twynam said, "I am a printer, and the husband of complainant, and live at 14, Annersley Road. In February, 1888, I paid £10 to Mrs. Taylor for her goods; it was my wife's money "—William and Jane Gallander were then called for the defence, and then the plain<lb/>tiff was re-called, and this book was put into her hand—she said, "I gave the money to my husband, he brought me this re<lb/>ceipt, and it has been in my possession ever since. They were ten sovereigns I gave my husband. I did not pay myself, because I was called to a nursing job. It was at my request the witness Mason went; I paid him for going "—the case was adjourned to March 9th, when I took the notes—Annie Twynam was called, and said, "On 14th February, 1888, I was in custody, but it was on 26th December I gave ray husband the money; I did speak to the police-constable in Court today "—that appears on my note Def ore the evidence of Charles Garner—it was taken before—Charles Garner was then called, and Jane Gallander and Frederick Twynam were re-called—he said, "My wife gave me the money to pay for the things about the end of December, 1887; I was to pay her supposed mother when she came to me; she was living in Camden Street then. Complainant was then nursing at East Dulwich. She was taken into custody in January. She was tried at the Central Criminal Court; no one defended her that I am aware of. She gave it me in case she was not nursing. I was married to her in 1872, at the Registrar's Office, Ampthill Square"—the prisoner pro<lb/>duced a certificate of marriage—Alfred Mason was then re-called, and said, "I had money of the husband; I used to have shillings now and again of him. Mr. Twynam asked me to go. If Mrs. Twynam swears she gave me money on that occasion, it is not true; she didn't ask me to go. I saw Mrs. Taylor sign her name to the book and Mr. Twynam paid the ten sovereigns over. It was in the middle of February, 1888. This was at 78, Camden Street, in the second-floor back "—Jane Gallander was then re-called, and then Annie Twynam, who said, "I wrote the list in the book A, and the heading that was made out in December.

                  </hi>. I was formerly married to Mr. Taylor—I have been married three times—my maiden name was Donaldson; it was Sinclair when I married Mr. Taylor—it was never Hayward—my daughter was never known as Mary Ann Hayward; she was not married to Frederick Twynam in 1872, she was a mere child then—she will be thirty-three on the 28th of next month—she was born in 1858. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>, "This is not my mother, her name is Smith, she has had four husbands")—in August, 1885, I went to live at 78, Great Camden Street, and occupied a second floor front room; Mrs. Dyer was the landlady—this is my rent-book—I had some furniture, the same which was afterwards the subject of a dispute between me and my daughter at the North London Police-court—on 8th September, 1889, I removed to 15, Peach Street, and stayed there till June, 1890; from there I went to 246, Kensal Road, and stayed there till November 10th, 1890, when I removed to my daughter's house, 14, Annersley Road with my furniture—I was still Mrs. Taylor—Mr. Twynam was there, living with my daughter—I met Mr. Gallander there, who is now my husband—on February 6 I removed my furniture to No. 9 opposite; my daughter and her husband were present—I said, "Annie, I wish you would stop while I take my furniture out of the house "—she said, "No, I must go back to the lady I am nursing, but Fred will see to that," and she said to him, "Let mother have all her things," because they were scattered all over the house—they tied up my feather bed in a sheet, and put it on the bed<lb/>stead, and helped to carry them down into the passage, and then they were moved to No. 9 by a Mr. Robins and his wife—on 22nd January my daughter and Frederick Twynam came to No. 9 with two friends and picked out some things which I had moved by mistake, and accused me of stealing them—I was taken in custody to the police<lb/>station—I said that I had taken them by mistake, and admitted that they belonged to my daughter—I was brought up in custody next day, and Frederick Twynam gave evidence against me—the Magistrate discharged me—on February 3rd I saw Frederick Twynam and my daughter and a man named Mason and my son, James Sinclair, near the workhouse gate; two women came and asked me to go and nurse a lady; I went with them in the direction of the workhouse, and when I got near the gate my son and daughter and the others took hold of me and pushed me into the workhouse, and my daughter said to the clerk at the gate that I was insane, and I was detained eighteen days—I was discharged on February 18th as sane—when I got out my husband told me of this claim for my furniture, and I went to the Police-court on the 22nd and gave evidence—my husband had been to the workhouse, and told me about the claim to the furniture—my daughter had never claimed it before—I gave evidence on all the hearings, and the summons was adjourned—this receipt, signed "Jane Taylor," with a stamp in this book, is not signed by me—I do not know whose writing it is, but the list of furniture above it is my daughter's writing, and so are the figures, "Feb. 14th."—Frederick Twynam did not call at my house, 78, Great Camden Street, nor about that time, nor did Mason call—Frederick Twynam did not</p>

               <p>forgot that at the Police-court—I was committed for trial, and acquitted—that was three times with this—I was not in want of money in, February—I was locked up in a lunatic asylum at Hanwell in 1884, and came out in 1885; I had money then, and I had a little furniture at a friend's, Mrs. Ham wick's; she has been dead some years—I had some money there—they gave me a sovereign when I came out of the asylum—I went to 126, Arlington Road, but did not stay there, because my daughter came and took me out of the asylum—I was there eleven months—that was the second time I was there—she has tried to put me away twice—I have been each time wrongfully placed there—when I came out at first, I had to go back again—I got this furniture in 1885; Mr. Shaw gave me the money to get it; he is dead—I mean to declare that my daughter took me out of the asylum in 1885; I never saw her again till 1890, though I saw her children and her mother—I do not know where she was between 1885 and 1890—I did not trouble to inquire, I did not ask her where she had been—I did not inquire about her when she was in prison, I did not think it worth while—Gallagher had been living with her as a lodger for several years—he was living in the same room for six days before he was married—this is my ordinary signature to this letter—I swear I never received £10 from Frederick Twynam—I did not tell my son, James Tucker, at the end of 1888 that I had sold my furniture—I saw him in 1888.</p>

I am the wife of Charles James Booty, of 21, Rich<lb/>mond Gardens, Forest Gate—the prisoner, came into my service on 16th February last as a domestic servant—on 14th March, about twenty or twenty-five minutes to eleven in the morning, I asked her to go up and clean the bath-room out; she went up and was there about a quarter of an hour—no one else was there—my bedroom is three or four stairs up from the bath-room—when she came down I asked her if she had cleaned the bath-room—she said "Yes"—my daughter went up to take something to put on my bed, and she called out loudly, so that the prisoner could</p>

               <p>hear, "Mother, mother, your bedroom is on fire"—I at once ran to the police-station and returned with Inspector Crawford, and we went up to my bedroom—I saw nothing but smoke—after the fire was put out I went into the bath-room with the inspector—it had not been cleaned—when I last left it there were no matches there that I know of—there might have been—there was no one in the house but my daughter-in-law, myself, and the prisoner.</p>

I am chief superintendent of the West Ham Fire Brigade—at ten minutes past eleven on 14th March I was called to Mrs. Booty's house—I made an examination of the bedroom, where there had been a fire—it was a very suspicious fire—I can't say how it originated—it occurred at a time of day when there was no light or any gas in the room, and it was not necessary to take any light into the cupboard; it was perfectly daylight, light enough to see anything—the matches were shown to me by the inspector; they were then at the bottom of the cupboard; he said they had been on the shelf—it would take great heat to melt a metal teapot.</p>

I live at 3, Roscoe Street, Canning Town, and am a hammerman—on Saturday night, 29th March, a little after twelve, I was going home, and in Woodstock Street I was stopped, knocked down, and robbed by the prisoner and another man; they took out of my right-hand trousers pocket a purse containing half a sovereign, five threepenny bits, and a knife—I shouted "Police!"—the police came and took the prisoner, the other man ran away—this is my purse, in it is a little pay</p>

I said, "You will see later on"—the other man ran away; he was ten yards from the prosecutor when I first" saw him, I should say—I took the prisoner into the middle of the road—the prosecutor said, "The worst of it is I have lost my purse with half a sovereign and some threepenny pieces "—I watched the prisoner, and saw his hand in his right-hand jacket pocket, and he took the purse out and dropped it at his side—I picked it up and said to the prosecutor, "All right, I have got your purse, he has just dropped it"—the prisoner did not say anything—I took him to the station, and charged him with stealing—he made no statement—I searched him and found a knife, not the prosecutor's, one shilling, and a penny in bronze—I found in the purse half a sovereign, five threepenny pieces, and this piece of paper—the prosecutor was charged with being drunk and incapable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector P</hi>). Prior to March 13th I had Croft and Collins under observation, and on that night saw them in the Old Kent Road—I was with Garner, Cooper, and Robinson—Croft and. Collins entered the Dun Cow, and came out about 10.15 p.m.—I stopped them, and gave a signal; Garner and Cooper seized Croft, and I seized Collins's right hand, and took this bag from her; she struggled, screamed, and threw from her left hand what appeared to be sixpences, and I heard something like money falling—we took them into a china, shop, and they were searched—Cooper handed me ten bad florins and ten bad shillings, and Garner handed me a bad florin and shilling found on Croft—a woman in the shop searched Collins, and I searched her bag; and. found 10s. in good money, a bad sixpence, and two eggs—I said to Croft "These are counterfeit coins that were found on you; you will be charged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189104060094"/>
               <p>with having in your possession counterfeit coin with intent to utter it"—he said, "We are done; I can see how it is," holding up the counterfeit sixpence to the woman—I said, "This is a counterfeit sixpence," she made no answer—we took them in cabs to the Police-station, and on the way I said to Collins, "You are not married to this man"; she said, "I do not know whether I am or not "—I said at the station, "What is your name?" she said "Sarah"—"I said, "What is your other name?" she said "I'm blowed if I know; I am sorry I can't think of it"—I said "Where do you live?" she said "I live anywhere, where I can; I have got no home"—I said "Well, give me your surname now?" she said, "Well, Collins, if you like"—shortly after<lb/>wards Hathway and Bent handed me two sixpences in Collins' presence, and I said to her, "These two counterfeit sixpences were found close to where I arrested you "—she said, "Yes"—the one found on her was of 1887, and the two found by the witnesses are of 1886—I found a key on Croft, which I took to 74, Tilson Street, Peck<lb/>ham; it opened the front door; I went upstairs, and met the prisoner Worms at the top—Cooper was with me, and I had placed officers back and front—Worms said, "You can't come up here; go down. What is your business?"—I said, "I am an Inpector of police; stand where you are "—I went into a room at the top of the stairs—there are three rooms downstairs and three up, and an ante-room half-way up—the door of the back bedroom was open; but a key which I found on Croft fits that door—we found in that room these coining implements (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Worms into the room, and said, "What is your name?"—she said, "Sarah Worms"—I said, "Where do you live?"—she said, "5, Manor Place, Walworth"—I said, "What are you doing here?"—she said, "I have come here to see after the children, a cousin, a relation of the woman"—I said, "What woman?"—she said, "Clark or Miles came to me last night"—I said, "What is her name?"—she said, "Langollen or Langston "—I said, "Where does she live? "—she said, "I don't know where to find her, I have got her address at home; the woman said Mrs. Miles wished you to go and see if the children have got any food; I had Alice Clark with me, she is the woman's child"—I said, "Are you related to them?"—she said, "The female has chared for me "—I said, "Do you know anything about the man?"—she said, "I know the man who lives with her, I have seen him six times "—I left her in charge of Sergeant Cooper, and shut the door and questioned the girl Draper, after which I went back to Worms, and said, "You came here, you first tried to push this door open, and then got the key and unlocked it, then you called the girl to empty the solution out of these jars and helped her to do it; you are well acquainted with Draper and with his woman and their doings; I shall arrest you for being concerned with them in possessing coining implements and aiding and abetting in making counterfeit coin "—she said, "I know I knew them, but I had only just come when you came here "—I packed all the things in a box and took them and the prisoner to the station—the pri<lb/>soner said, "I knew they were in prison, two men came and told me what they were in for, but you will find the woman's address at my house"—I went to 5, Manor Place, the address Worms gave, and entered with a latchkey found on h«r, and with another key I entered the parlour and took away certain things, among which was this correspondence:—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commissioner, of 179, Queen's Road, Peckham; I had the letting of 74, Tilson Road—a person named Howard called about it, and I let it in February to Henry Gibbs—I got a reference, and wrote to Mrs. Worms, Manor Place, Walworth, and in reply received this post-card: "During the time Mr. Gibbs lived with me I always found him very satisfactory.—S. <hi rend="smallCaps">WORMS</hi>, February 9th, 1891 "—I accepted that, and handed the keys of the house on 13th February to Mrs. Collins, who said she was Mrs. Gibbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living at 74, Tilson Road, Peckham—Croft is my father; his name is Draper—we went into this house five weeks prior to March 13—my father lived in the name of Henry Gibbs—Collins lived with him, but she is not my mother—prior to that my father and I and Collins lived at 3, Martha Place, Kent Road; she had two children there, they were taken to Tilson Road—there was a room at Martha Place which I was not allowed to go into, it was kept locked—Worms was there sometimes, and she used sometimes to go into the room which was kept locked to see my father when he was working there—I have not seen her come out of that room, but they only occupied two rooms, and I was in the other, and she was not there—the room where the things were was their bedroom and workroom—there were two rooms upstairs and two down; she went upstairs, and I followed her up—the downstair rooms were a kitchen and a parlour—I have seen Sarah Worms there three times, but never seen her go into the middle room—she sometimes remained half an hour when she came—she came in shortly before Inspector Fox came, and I asked her if she had seen mother and father; she said, "They are in the hospital, let us go upstairs "—we went up, and I took a key which was in the parlour door, and tried to open the workroom, but could not; I tried again, and Mrs. Worms tried, and then I tried again, and it opened—when we got inside she told me to get a pail, and empty the water out of the jars which were up in a corner—while I was doing that she emptied the jars into a pail, and put her finger to scrape the sand out—I helped her to pack up some of the things, and put them in the little bag which I brought up from downstairs—I packed up some long pieces of iron, and some of these earthenware things, and put them in a basket for her to take away—there were screws on the battery cells, she helped me take them off, and we put them in the bag and the basket—I asked her again if she knew where father was, she said, "I don't know, that is all"—she said the two children would have to go to school, and I should have to go into a home, and that I should not see father any more—I went to the front room, and turned the boxes out, and heard the front door slam, and Mrs. Worms told Alice to go and see who it was, and shut the front door—Alice was helping us—I heard Mrs. Worms speak to the men who came upstairs, but could not hear what she said.</p>

I find here 25 pieces of counterfeit coin, 11 florins, 11 shillings, and 3 sixpences; also some good coins of different dates, all which have evidently been used as pattern pieces, from which moulds have been made—they all bear signs of having been in plaster of Paris, and the dates of all these counterfeit coins correspond with those on the pattern pieces—the edges of the counterfeit coins are not properly done—here are a few fragments of moulds—this one found on Mrs. Worms has a <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to it, which is afterwards broken off—I can swear that this is part of a mould, but I cannot connect it with these coins—this is a very small portion of a florin, and here is part of the graining of the coin—all these articles are used in the manufacture of counterfeit coin—these three bad sixpences correspond in date with the good sixpences found—here are some pattern half-crowns, but nothing made from them—the wrapping-up is done to prevent them rubbing, and they are taken out one by one as wanted.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Brunswick Street—I have been living with, the prisoner for some years—I have been getting my living as an unfortunate walking the Strand and Fleet Street—on the morning of 17th February, about one in the morning, I was in Fleet Street near Fetter Lane, speaking to Lovell, a commissionaire employed at the Tele<lb/>graph Office, whom I had seen from time to time, when the prisoner came from the other side of the road and made a blow at me and pushed me back, and my hat fell off; he struck me, and said, "I will do for you, you b—cat "—he and Lovell had a row together, I don't know what' the words were; I walked away—a constable came up and pushed me—the prisoner came over and joined me, and we went home together; we had two cups of coffee on our way home; we got home about two, and I went to bed—he began jawing—I said, "For God's sake don't go on jawing, come to bed;" I went to sleep—I don't know whether he went to bed or not, the last I saw of him he was in his shirt; we always burn a lamp at night—I felt something rather sharp, I put up my hand and felt blood, and said, "What have you done? "—he was standing by the side of the bed in his shirt, with a razor in his hand; I tried to take it from him, and in doing so I cut both my hands—I said, "For God's sake, Tom, what have you done? "I was bleeding, and I saw the blood on the bed—he said, "Oh, I must. have been mad"—I put the sheet round my throat, and told him to go and call Mrs. Passingham, who lives in the next room, and said, "Take me to the hospital"—I heard him go and knock at her door—when I woke up I found my throat was cut—I heard him say to Mrs. Passingham, "Come in, for God's sake, my wife has cut her throat;" she came in, and he repeated that I had cut my throat—I said, "No, Tom, you have done it"—Mrs. Passingham went out of the room, and I put on my petticoat and boots, and went to the hospital in Waterloo Road; the prisoner took me there—on the way he said, "For God's sake say I did not do it"—he was crying; he was the worse for drink; he is as good a man as ever broke bread, only that he drinks rum—he had been drinking on this night; when sober he has been a good man to me; but when he drinks rum he is mad—he used to work at a ginger-beer place last summer; he is always in the hospital—I was an inpatient in the hospital for three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Royal Hospital, Waterloo Road, on the morning of 17th February, about twenty minutes past six—the pro<lb/>secutrix was brought there—I saw her in company with the prisoner—she had a wound on her throat, and on examination I found more than one incision on it; one running obliquely upwards from the left side of the neck, about four and a half or five inches long, commencing at the lower part of the neck on the left side, and terminating just on the lower side of the chin on the right side; the second wound running transversely from the left side of the throat, and terminating on the right side of the middle line; that was across the other wound; this second wound notched a muscle running up the neck, and was in close proximity to the deep blood-vessels of the neck—both wounds were equally serious—they were such as might have been inflicted with a razor; they were two separate cuts—she had two cuts on the right thumb, a cut at the base of the first finger, and one in the palm of the hand, a cut on the left thumb, and a slight scratch on the left arm; there was also a cut on the chin; that was a curved cut, downwards, about an inch and half to two inches long, and about a quarter of inch deep—that was quite distinct from the two wounds already described; that might also have been inflicted with a razor, as were the others—after I had finished attending to the wounds the prisoner asked if he should see her; I told him to come at five in the afternoon, and then he could inquire how she was getting on—I did not hear of him again till I heard he was arrested—the woman remained under my care until the 12th or 13th of March; she got gradually better, and in the end quite recovered; her life was at no time in danger—in my opinion the wounds were not self-inflicted; the wounds on the fingers were most likely caused in clutching the razor to take it away from another person.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 3, North Row, Walworth—on Friday night, 6th March, I was outside a coffee-house in East Street, in company with Bull and Griffin—I saw the prisoner come across the road and snatch Bull's pipe out of his mouth and run away; Bull ran after him—they were friends—Bull shoved him and regained his pipe—Brown jumped up and knocked it out of his mouth again, and it broke in pieces; Brown then ran down the court where he lived; Bull ran after him, but could not catch him—afterwards he went across to the coffee-shop, and Brown came up and used filthy language, and ran down the court and dared Bull to come after him, and said if he moved another inch he would dash his brains out, and he picked up a long piece of iron and threw it at him; they were about nine yards apart; it struck Bull on the head, and he fell down insensible—I picked him up; he was bleeding from just over the temple; Brown ran down the yard.</p>

About a month ago I saw a man at Bethnal Green named Bryce; he asked me if I could get him some stuff; I said I would try; on the day this case was stolen I asked the porter, Norman, to let me have it; he did let me have it, and helped to put it on the van; I drove away. After I had got some distance I broke the case open, took the silk out and put it into two sacks. I gave the case away to a stranger who was passing by. I then drove on to Wright's, at Bethnal Green; he was not at home; I saw Mrs. Wright, and handed her the two sacks; I have had no money for it"—he was charged, and made no reply.</p>
