I have known the prisoner two years; I was brought up to a glasier; I followed my business till within these two months; in Whitsun holidays the prisoners and I were playing at skittles at the Cheshire Cheese in Parker's-lane, and were talking of the robbery of one Check a carpenter in Drury-lane, for which a man had been hanged; I said I should like to read the sessions paper about it; Viner said if we would go to his master he would lend it us for nothing.</p>

Mr. Harper; we all three went to this man's house for it; Viner and I staid at the top of Brownlow-street, and Norbury went in to borrow the paper; he staid about five minutes and then he brought out something in his apron very heavy; I did not know what it was at that time; he bid me lay hold of it; I did and took it across Drury-lane down King-street and through the Two Sugar Loaves a publick house, into Parker's-lane to my own lodgings; Norbury went with me; Viner left us when he saw Norbury come out of his master's house; he said he would have nothing to do with it, and ran away directly; when I came to my lodgings I opened them and found they were musical plates; there were forty-one or forty-two of them, and there were these two copper-plates on the top; I took notice of them and know them again by the figures; Norbury and I staid in my room all day and melted down the pewter plates, and then we took the pewter to one

I said my dear I am going home; said she, you had better go home with me; I said no, I objected to it, but I consented at last to go to some tavert with her; from thence she persuaded me to go home with her; we went to bed, and by and by the prisoner Price came up stairs; she called her sister and asked who she had got with her; the other said a gentleman; the prisoner said then I shall be deprived of my bed; I said no my girl you shall not, I will get up and go somewhere else; I offered to get up; she said no if I would give her something to drink she would sit up; I gave her a shilling; she brought some shrub, I drank some of it; I saw her sit in the chair before I went to sleep; when I waked I missed my watch, a French crown piece, about eighteen shillings in silver, my shoe and knee buckles, and a pocket book which contained notes to the amount of between four and five hundred pounds; and I lost a ticket of an annuity for eight pound a year for my life; I have since discovered that they destroyed them going to Gravesend; when I waked there was no one in the room; I stopped till the watchman came round at half past three o'clock I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. What man?</p>
               <p>Wilde. I do not remember the man again.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Did not the prisoner himself tell you that he did pawn the watch?</p>
               <p>Wilde. No.</p>

               <p>Wilde. I do not know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Wilde. I do not know that I remember taking the watch of him; I have seen the man since he has been in custody, not before.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is a part of your business not to know the thieves that come to pawn things with you, it would spoil your trade if you knew them again?</p>
               <p>Wilde. It is no interest in the world to me not to swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Court. But it helps the trade very much, exceedingly so.</p>
               <p>Wilde. No person is to foreswear himself; it was a youngish man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the man or not?</p>
               <p>Wilde. It was a young man somewhat like him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part does he resemble the man?</p>
               <p>Wilde. He does not resemble him in dress; the man I had the watch of was dressed well.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Is that your watch?</p>

            . On the 26th of July, about two o'clock in the morning, on the other side Temple Bar I saw fourteen or sixteen girls of the town on a fish stall; Bailiss and King came up to me and desired me to give them a glass of wine; I told them it was too late for wine or any thing else, and desired they would let me go about my business; they told me they had had but a glass of gin each of them for the night and were almost ready to faint, and again entreated me to give them a glass of wine, and they would carry me to a reputable house; I went with them to the Ship and Dolphin tavern, which has been since christened the King's Head tavern; one of the girls knocked at the door; the waiter opened it, and we were shewn into a room on the left hand; I called for a pint of red port, the waiter brought it and went out of the room immediately; they used some indecencies which I resisted; then Bailiss clapped her hand on my thigh and said here is money; they were feeling about my waistcoat and breeches; upon that I took my purse, containing the money, out of my breeches pocket and put it in my side coat pocket; they then drew their chairs nearer to me and clapped their hands round me, and Bailiss got the purse out of my pocket; as she drew it out I heard the money chink, and saw her give it to the other girl; I wrenched myself from them and said this is the most barefaced robbery I ever saw, and called the waiter and told him I had been robbed, and desired him to call his master; the waiter said it was a house of reputation and that he would not call his master for any such fellow as I was; I said I was robbed of five guineas and a half, and desired him again to call his master or the watchman, or somebody; he said d - n you, you scoundrel, you do not look as if you was worth five guineas and a half in the world, and he would not go to call his master; the girls then said if I made a noise they would murder me; upon which the girls made up to the waiter and seemed to give him the money, but I did not actually see them give him the money;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070009"/> as soon as they had so done he called them whoring bitches and said he would get a constable; he went out and I saw no more of him till he came in with the constable; then one of the girls asked me where my purse was, I said in my side pocket; she said where, I said here, shewing her my pocket; she said it is not there now; I said no, and pulled out some books, and said on the table for her to feel; she put her hand in, as my hand was in my pocket, and put the empty purse into my hand; I said if she would give me the contents I would make her a present of the purse; when the constable came the girls were searched, but no money was found upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Bailiss. Did not you say when we went into the house that you had no money, and that if you called for any more than a pint of wine you should have nothing left to give the waiter, and when the constable came in you believed you said the waiter was an honest fellow, and you would reward him next day; but the constable said he was a blackguard and it was necessary to take him to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Nelson. It is totally false.</p>
               <p>Q. from King. Did not you say if I would give you my company, you had no more money now, but would give me half a guinea if I called at the Union coffee house next day?</p>
               <p>Nelson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Smith: Did not I fetch a constable when you told me you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Nelson. No, not at first.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the same man keep that house now?</p>
               <p>Nelson. Yes.</p>
               <p>- Swift. I am a constable; I was sent for to the Ship and Dolphin on the 26th of July, about half after two in the morning; the watchman called me; the prosecutor said he had been robbed by the girls of five guineas and a half; I believe Smith let me in; I searched the girls but found nothing upon them; I asked if any body else had been in the room; he said nobody but the waiter; I said I dare say if the waiter has been in the room the money is not now in the room; I stripped the girls to their shifts and searched the chairs and round the room, but could not find the money; I rung for the waiter and searched him, but I found nothing but some silver on him.</p>
               <p>Bailiss's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was standing by Temple Bar; the prosecutor came and took King by the hand and said he would give her a glass of wine, and bid her bring me with her; we went to the Ship and Dolphin; he said he would only call for a pint of wine, because he had no more money; that if he called for a bottle he should have nothing to give the waiter; when we had drank the wine he called the waiter and said he was robbed of five guineas, and bid him call the watch; I never saw any more money than what paid for the wine.</p>

               <p>King's Defence.</p>
               <p>He said he had no money, but if I would give him my company, if I came to the Union coffee house next day, he would give me half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>This gentleman came in between two and three in the morning with the women, and called for a pint of wine; in about five minutes he called me and said he was robbed of five guineas; I went out and brought in three watchmen; he said before the watchmen I was an honest fellow, and he would reward me next day.</p>
               <p>Smith called two women who gave him a good character.</p>

The inhabitants of the house do not bear the best of characters; we could not tell which were the thieves; so we took up all the men in the house; it is a lodging house; Perkins appeared to be the master of it; they were all in the house in different apartments; they all said they did not know any thing about the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you sent to them upon this occasion?</p>

               <p>Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. As this was done in the dark and you could not see this man, how do you know it was this man as there were two of them?</p>
               <p>Fry. Because the man was at the end of the barn with me all the time; when he heard the people coming he got from me, it was then peep of day.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear it was not another man?</p>
               <p>Fry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you just now and you said you never saw the man till this matter was over?</p>
               <p>Fry. Not till they brought him into the yard; I am sure there was none but him.</p>

               <p>Q. Well but who did the hat belong to?</p>
               <p>Fry. I did not see the hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wronged man, woman, nor child of a pin or pins point in my life; I was asked if the man was gone off; I said yes, I dare say he committed the affair, I must suffer for; she knew the man was in the place, before I came; in he was a broad side of her.</p>

               <p>Marshall. I was, but almost senseless by the blows I received; when I came to myself they were gone out of the house; I went out at the door, there I saw Shaw; he stuck me behind the ear which brought me to the ground; when I went into the house I was so stunned with bruises, I do not know how long I might be before I came out again; I met a watchman, I told him I had been robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment; I went with the watchman in search of Shaw; first I found him in Russell-street with some women; before I could get the watchman to him, he got away; we met him afterwards coming out of King's Head court and secured him; I am certain it is the man that robbed me.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and said he had been robbed, and that he would show me the man that robbed him; we went to Russel-street; we could not find him, and I left the prosecutor; soon after that he came to me again, and said the man was in King's Head court; I went with him to the Sun in King's Head court; I saw Shaw coming out of the house with a glass of gin; the prosecutor said that was the man; I took him to the round-house; the man who keeps the Sun came soon after and brought Liddyman and Wigley; they were both in liquor; Shaw said if we would let him out for half an hour he would find the man that had the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober or otherwise?</p>
               <p>Payne. I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober. I never saw him before that time; he seemed flustered; whether that was occasioned by the robbery and the blows I cannot say; I have no reason to say he was drunk from what I saw of him.</p>

I am a single man; the prisoner worked for me by the day; I locked up my outer door. I have a closet within my room which I usually leave open; in that were the velvet breeches, and all this money was locked up in a chest; as soon as I returned from church I found the box of the lock of the room door burst open, and lying in the middle of the room; several things that were in the outer room in the drawers were taken away; being surprized to see the door shut of the inner closet, which I always used to leave open, raised my suspicion, and upon enquiry I found that the box had been forced open with a chissel, which I found was my own chissel; I enquired after the prisoner and he was taken by Mr. Clack.</p>
               <p>- Clack. I met with the prisoner in Berkshire; I passed by him at first; seeing him so fine with a pair of velvet breeches, I did not suspect him to be the man, because Marshall had not described him to be such a man; but afterwards I returned, as he otherwise answered to the description given me by Mr. Marshall; when I attempted to stop him he threatened that he would cut me down in case I offered to take him; that I had no right to molest him; but I was determined to secure him; he ran into a field, and afterwards a cross the road to another place; at last I did secure him, and brought him back to a house where he had a bundle, which he claimed as being his own; for the people of the house said there was a bundle; I asked the prisoner whether that bundle belonged to him; he said it did; that bundle and the prisoner I secured. (The bundle containing the breeches, three of the shirts, the cotton stockings, and a waistcoat, part of the things mentioned in the indictment, and about six pounds in money, was produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the men, are you sure they are the persons?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Mills and which is Pugh?</p>
               <p>Gilson. That is Mills and that is Pugh ( pointing them out); I saw them as I came down the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before they robbed you?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was it?</p>
               <p>Gilson. It was about half after seven o'clock on the 10th of August; on the 20th of August I took a walk that way again, and near farmer Wellings' I sat down under a bush, and saw two men at a little distance; I knew them to be the men that robbed me; I followed them to farmer Wellings'; I told the story to the farmer's servant on horseback close by; there were several people had been walking that way; they urged my pursuing them; the farmer brought me a horse and sent the two men with me on horseback, and we pursued and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the two men you took were the men?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes, very sure; I knew them at the first fight, and communicated it to this gentleman, and they retired on seeing me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Mills. What colour clothes had I on at the time?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Brown colour clothes.</p>
               <p>Mills. Was this the coat?</p>
               <p>Gilson. I cannot speak positively; it was a coat nearly that colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he it on both times?</p>

               <p>Gilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the face of the men?</p>
               <p>Gilson. Yes; I looked at him sharply while he was searching me, for which the other threatned me, but seeing him with the other in the same field and in the same dress that first caught my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his face make no impression upon you?</p>
               <p>Gilson. It struck me as soon as I came up; I am satisfied he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. from Pugh. Had I these clothes on when the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Gilson. He was in clothes very much resembling these.</p>
               <p>Mills. We have witnesses to prove we had different coloured clothes then; but they are not here.</p>

               <p>Edward Hall. I went to fetch a mare for Mr. Wellings; there was a hue and cry after these footpads; I saw the two prisoners going across the fields; this gentleman pointed at them, and said they had robbed him; we all three rode after them; I was the first that overtook them; I stopped Mills first; said he, what do you stop me for? I said I don't know; said he I will not be stopped by any body; I said I would blow his brains out if he did not stop directly; the gentleman came up and said these are the two men that robbed me.</p>

(They were produced and all the articles were deposed to by the prosecutor.) We did not know where the goods were lost from till we took Clarke; when he was taken he asked if there was any evidence; I said I did not know; then he said he would tell where he took them; he said he took them from Mr. Frosser's show glass; his expression was that the Old Gorge was asleep when he went into the shop.</p>

               <p>Smith. I believe they had drank some ale; Lequint seemed much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you examined whether your doors and windows, and every thing were fast?</p>
               <p>Smith. I fastened the windows the night before myself, and the cellar door was double locked; I was the last up in the house, and saw that all my doors and windows were fast; one of the watchmen has a crow and a chissel, with which they wrenched off the catch of the cellar lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an area before the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, the cellar is even with the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves when you found them in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Smith. Nothing; I found there a dark lanthorn, a tinder box, and steel (producing them.)</p>

I was not in the cellar when the man said there were thieves; I went down to his assistance; I stood on the flap of the cellar window, and there I saw this chissel lie upon the pavement in the street at the edge of the window; the chissel and the crow were hanging in the cellar; I found these before the prisoners were taken.</p>

            . I am a constable: I had directions to take the prisoner up; I took him about eleven o'clock in Mr. Calvert's yard, at his work; Mr. Squire was with me; we took him to the tap-house; Squire searched him in my presence, and took a guinea, a half crown, and some halfpence from one of his pockets; I went with him to his lodgings in Tooley-street; there he owned the box was his, and out of that I took that painted box with the money in it; we had left some beer at the Horse-shoe in Tooley-street; we returned there to drink it; I gave him a caution; I said young man this is a serious affair; I beg you will take care what words you make use of, for I doubt this affair is such that may affect your life; upon this the prisoner sat in the box, and Squire, and the others that were with him were at some little distance; then he told me that he had been guilty of it; that he had got over the stable or stables upon Sunday about one o'clock; that he got-over buildings till he got to the compting-house; that there is a window in the compting-house that looks into the back yard, and that after he had taken out a pane or two of glass, he opened the casement and got in at the window; that after he got in he found an old chissel or adze, and broke open three or four desks and a box, and that out of the several desks and boxes he had taken thirty-nine guineas.</p>

About seven weeks ago I missed a sum amounting to more than forty shillings in silver out of the till in the bar; the prisoner saw me put it into the purse first, and then afterwards into the till; this was at eleven o'clock at night; in a few minutes after the prisoner went out, I missed the purse and the silver. Last Saturday the prisoner's master, Mr. Fletcher, came to me, and said he thought his boy had defrauded him of half a guinea, for he had more money than he could have honestly come by; his master and I sent over for him to my house; upon being charged with taking the money, he said he had taken the purse and the money; that he had reached his hand over the bar and unlocked the till, the key being left in the lock, and took out the bag and money, and left the key to do the like again.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any promises made him?</p>
               <p>Williams. There were none; his confession was made free and voluntarily; the prisoner's master returned me a guinea and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>- Fletcher. I suspected the prisoner by his spending more money than he ought to do; I spoke to him about it; his account was that it was given to him; he told me he had the half guinea which I found upon him of Mr. Williams; that he went to change a guinea at Mr. Williams's, and that Mrs. Williams by mistake gave him change to the amount of a guinea and half; I found the key of the till upon him; when I shewed the key to Mr. Williams, he said it was the key of his till; the prisoner confessed taking the canvas bag, and said he had never counted the contents when he was charged with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about returning them if there were?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. He said he would return them; I told him he had got my all; he said he was in distress; I told him what I had he was welcome to; then said he this is not all, and I think shook the purse; I said, then search my pockets and welcome; he turned back again and put his hands across my breeches pocket; I had about three-pence halfpenny in my pocket, which he felt; he put his hand across my waistcoat to feel for my watch; he did not put his hand into my pocket, nor ask me for my watch.

This man that was robbing me, said to his partner, d - n your eyes, if you use the young man ill, I will shoot you dead; I begged him not to let my partner be hurt; he said he should not; he said go on, if you turn again I will shoot you, if you don't you shall not be hurt; I walked gently on; that was all that passed between the man and me.</p>

               <p>Dobbs. I believe I asked him if he remembred what sort of a purse it was, and so did Justice Addington; he said it was either a purse or a linen bag, and that he threw it away; I took out the purse I had in my pocket, and asked him if he knew any thing of the purse, and whether it was like the purse I had in my pocket; he said he had done it away.</p>

            , Esq; I was attending the last execution of the convicts at Tyburn on the 19th of August; when the ordinary of Newgate had been some time in prayer with the unhappy convicts, a person came up to me and informed me that Madan, one of the convicts, was innocent, for that a person had been in the press yard, and declared that Madan was innocent, and that he was the person who had committed that robbery; I immediately asked the ordinary whether he had heard any thing of it; the ordinary informed me he had; in less than a minute another person came up, and said the man who had made that confession was among the crowd, and that he wished to take leave of Madan, and to ask his forgiveness; these words were hardly spoke before the prisoner at the bar appeared; he was instantly conducted into the cart, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070034"/> took leave of Madan; I immediately asked him if Madan was innocent; he answered he was; I then said is it true that you are the person that committed that robbery; he answered, yes; while this conversation passed, his back was to the convict Madan; I then desired him to turn about and make that declaration publickly looking at Madan; he refused to turn about, but again said that Madan was innocent, and then he said that he himself was not the person that committed the robbery; I told him that having once confessed it, it was my duty to order him into custody, which I immediately did.</p>

               <p>Beckenham. I do not think he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you took sufficient notice of the shorter man to know him again if you was to see him?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I knew him so far as to prosecute him and he was convicted.</p>
               <p>Q Was you here at the trial of Madan?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, he was cast upon my indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon you to say that you swore to the other man positively that you knew his face?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070035"/>Beckenham. He appeared very much like the man; the coat that I lost was upon Madan's back at the time of his being taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see only two men?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. No; they pushed me about the length of this table before they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. They were a good while with you?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. Yes, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of Madan's face?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I took particular notice of the men, their appearance, their size, and make, but could not see a great deal of their face.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think upon looking at that man?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. He might be there for what I know, but he does not look like the man that came before me.</p>
               <p>Q The question is, whether you believe that to be one of the two men or not?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I do not believe he is one of the two men, because the man that came to me first was a very lusty man, and the other was considerably shorter; Brannon is taller than this.</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I believe Brannon is something taller, but there is but very little difference.</p>
               <p>Q. You do believe this is not the man?</p>
               <p>Beckenham. I believe so.</p>

            . Have you seen Brannon in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. Yes, after the last time I was before the Justice I came to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What say you as to the difference in height between this prisoner and Brannon?</p>
               <p>Dobbs. There is not a great deal of difference in the height; Brannon is a lustier man; there is a causeway at the place where we were robbed; the man might have some advantage in that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you promise him any favour?</p>
               <p>Pullen. No, he took me to Mr. Skinner's and we got the spoon again; I paid eleven shillings and threepence for it, (produces it); I bought another spoon as much like it as I could, in order to replace it because it was broke.</p>

             or order; that is the bill that is now produced; I looked at it and told them that as it was payable to Swyer or order, it required an indorsement; upon this Nangle took a pen and indorsed it, and the other man, before he indorsed it, whispered to him; and he was present when it was indorsed.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the indorsement?</p>
               <p>Barrett. That indorsement was wrote by Nangle; Nangle was the man who offered it in payment; I paid the difference in cash, and each of them took a parcel of the goods I had sold them; they were done up in two parcels; Mr. Pierrepoint called upon me that night, and I paid him that bill in part of an account we settled between us; it was Nangle who immediately bargained for the goods; but the other interfered so far as to say whether they were bad or good, or he liked the quality of them; I afterwards apprehended them both; I met Nangle on the 26th of July, and another man with him; I sent for my apprentice; the person I sent had fixed them, and when the apprentice came he agreed in opinion with me, that these were the two men; I apprehended them; at the time they were taken they were loitering about near the Bank; I sent for my apprentice before I took them that I might be sure of the men;

            . I am apprentice to the last witness; I remember the prisoners coming to the shop; it was in the afternoon; they cheapened some goods; they would not have them cut off til l they had first shewn the note to Mr. Barrett; Love said shew the gentleman the bill to see whether he likes it or not, before we have any thing cut off; Mr. Barrett took the bill and said it required an indorsement; Nangle took a pen and ink and wrote

             upon the back; some words passed in a whisper, I could not hear what they were, but Mr. Barrett had before that told them it required an indorsement; then Mr. Barrett made a bill of the goods and put them up in separate parcels; each of them took a parcel; Love went out half a minute before Nangle; my master sent for me about the 15th of July to the lottery office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the post bill that was produced by the two prisoners, and tendered to your master?</p>
               <p>Twiddle. (Inspects it) I am sure it is, because there is a particular blotch in the name I can speak to it by; my master sent for me in order to see if I knew the two prisoners at the bar after he had met them in the street; I went to Richardson and Goodluck's office; a man that I had put upon watch asked me if he was to stand there; I said yes; there I asked where my master was; I beckoned to him at a little distance off, then the man came and said the men were just at the other end of the lottery office; I saw them there, and a third person with them; I was then certain of Nangle's person, and I am sure of it now; they were apprehended and taken to the Manston-house; I never saw the men till they came to my master's shop to buy the goods there; they came some time between five and nine in the afternoon, I cannot be positive to the hour; the men were near a quarter of an hour in the shop; I was behind a compter on the other side of the shop; Mr. Barrett stood behind the opposite compter; Mr. Barrett gave change for the bill; they just weighed the money, but I believe they took some guineas that were light, because they were in a hurry.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Biggs; the two prisoners came to our shop; they looked at some goods and bought some, and they presented a bank post bill for fifty pounds; having some suspicion of it I desired my master to let me go out to get it changed; I did not mean to change it; I went out and returned, and said I could not get it changed; they said it did not much signify, they were going into the city and would call for them as they came back; I went after them, I did not keep them in my eyes all the way; coming by Mr. Barrett's shop I saw them in the shop; I watched till they came out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070038"/> again, and then I asked Mr. Barrett if he had given them change for a bill; he said he had; I told him my suspicions about it; he said they had indorsed it to him, he thought there was no danger of losing the money; I watched them to Whitechapel Bars, from thence to Leman-street; I saw them go into a house called the English Hotel; I told Mr. Barrett of it; I am sure they are the same men; they are not in the same dress now they were then; each then had a bundle under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q to Vernon. When these bank bills are issued payable to order, do the Bank pay them without an order?</p>
               <p>Vernon. No, not without a proper indorsement from the party to whom it is made payable; if a bill comes, and the person to whom it is payable cannot be found, which is sometimes the case, they then require a particular receipt.</p>

            . I am a surgeon: I know Nangle; I saw him on Wednesday or Thursday some time about the 27th or 28th of June; I am not certain of the day; I have known him in Liverpool; I met him in Bishopsgate street; I went with him to the Red Lion and London Hospital, Whitechapel; there was one Donnelly with us; a man accosted Nangle as soon as we got into the house; Nangle had some parcels made up in paper when I met him, and the man that met Nangle asked him if he had bought the goods he spoke to him about; Nangle said he had, and produced them; Nangle gave the man the goods, and he asked how much they came to; Nangle said ten pounds; the landlord was present in the room at the same time. The man who was waiting at the publick house produced that fifty pound note, and Nangle gave him a twenty pound bank note, and the rest in cash; it was between three and four o'clock when I met Nangle; the man then went away. I do not know to whom it was payable, but I believe one Swyer or Sawyer, or such name; (it is shewn him). I believe that bill is the same; the master and Donnelly were in the room at the same time. I have known Nangle two or three years ago at Liverpoole. I have not seen him till this particular time; I am sure it was on Thursday; I think it was the 28th. The parcel was opened; there were some muslin and some handkerchiefs in it.</p>

My wife and I went into Smithfield on the 31st of July, about three in the afternoon, and returned home at half after ten at night. When I went out I double locked the door; on my return I found it on the spring; I borrowed a candle of my next door neighbour, and went up stairs; I found my first room door broke open; I had the key in my pocket; I came down; the watch was going by; I brought him in, and we all went up stairs together; I found my book-desk and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070046"/> the drawers broke open, and the books and drawers left about the room; we went up two pair of stairs; there I found my chest of drawers broke open; the locks of the drawers were broke open, and the drawers broke almost to pieces, and my clothes taken out. On the Monday following, I was told by a young man, that the Kentish Drover, in Long-lane, Smithfield, was a likely place to find my things as, and advised me to search there; I went to my Lord Mayor next morning, and got a warrant to search the prisoner's house; in the one pair of stairs room I found two silk handkerchiefs, an India callico handkerchief, a white linen handkerchief, a worked muslin apron, and a callico apron; I asked them how they came by them; Mr. Pullen said he did not know any thing about them further than that the callico handkerchief was given to him; we found them in two different drawers, and some among the soul linen; we took the woman before my Lord Mayor; she denied some time knowing any thing about them; afterwards she said they were left there by one Jack, she did not know his other name, for two shillings. The prisoner keeps the Kentish Drover. (The goods were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . On Sunday the 21st of August I was informed that a suspected person had been seen to carry some bundles into Star-court Shoemaker row; Mr. Clarke and I went there; after waiting there some time I saw the prisoner go into the house with something under his arm; we went into the house and asked for Mr. Robertson (who I knew before); the woman of the house called out Robertson two or three times; Robertson not coming down, Mr. Clarke took a candle and went up stairs; I heard a bustle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070048"/> soon after; I went up and found Mr. Clarke had got hold of the prisoner; we found this bunch of picklocks (producing them) in his pocket; the room the prisoner lived in there, with a girl, was locked; I opened the door with one of these picklocks.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lived there?</p>
               <p>Heley. The landlord of the house, whose name is Nash, told me so; in the closet in that room I found these things; (produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix); he said he knew nothing, of them; there was a box in the room under the bed; I asked him whose box that was, he said it was his; we broke it open and found in it a dark lanthorn, a tinder box and matches, a brace of pistols loaded; we put him in the round house for that night; the next morning the prosecutor came to Sir John Fielding's office to advertise the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not my lodgings; I went to see the girl that lodged there, as I might go to see any other girl of the town.</p>

               <p>Nash. No, he was out; I saw a person in green clothes bring in a bundle about as big as if it contained two suits of clothes; the girl said he had brought his clothes from his father's; took no further notice of it; I had no suspicions of this.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of this young woman?</p>
               <p>Nash. I really forgot; her christian name is Susannah; I forget her other name; she went away the day after; she used to go by the name of Robertson.</p>
