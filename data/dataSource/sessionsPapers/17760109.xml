The keeper of the inn told me the coach would set out for London on the next morning the 12th, and would arrive the same night at the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross. I sent on Wednesday the 12th to the Golden-Cross for the bags; the messenger informed me that the parcel was not come, though there was a parcel in my name entered in the way-bill. On Thursday the bags were found by some workmen at a house in Aldersgate-street: the bags were cut open, and the goods were taken out; but there being some of my cards left in the bags, they brought the bags to me; upon this I wrote a list of the contents of the bags, which I carried to Goldsmiths-Hall, and had hand-bills delivered about, offering 20 l. reward for the discovery of my property: then I went post to Oxford; I found my parcel booked there. Upon the Monday following the prisoner was stopt by a pawnbroker; my pocket ledger, containing some bills, was found upon him, and some of my goods were afterwards found at the Castle on Smallberry-Green. The saddle-bags contained goods to the value of about 372 l.</p>

I said I did not; then he asked again whether. I thought I should know him if I saw him again? I said no, for fear of the consequences; then he bid me not say any thing, or it would be worse for me. Upon leaving me, he put into my hand a ring, wrapped up in a paper; I never opened the paper till I came to lord Essex's; the paper was there read, and it appeared to be a receipt for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. for the ring, dated that day week: by the description I had given of the men to the chairmen about lord Essex's, they knew the prisoner, and he was taken up: he was carried to Mr. Coward's, a public-house; there he confessed the robbery, and desired me to take the money the poplin was worth, and the half guinea; he told me that he kept the Marquis of Granby, a publichouse, in Drury-lane; and rather than give me any trouble, he would make me satisfaction; I refused it: Mr. Coward advised me not to take the money, for I might be prosecuted for compounding of felony: the prisoner put down two guineas at the time he made the offer.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A very poor woman, my husband is in service.</p>
               <p>Had you any thing from the man that picked up the pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say it was a lucky thing, when he produced the ring and receipt, and whether it was not taken notice of at that time? - The receipt was not produced, nor given to me till after I was robbed: there were watchmen at the ends of the street, but I did not call out, nor alarm any body, because they threatened to carry me to the dead wall if I did: I went to lord Essex's and shewed the receipt and ring, and I laid there all night.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was brought to my house upon the 27th of December, about eight or nine o'clock: the chairmen charged him with robbing Mrs. Ship; I said I would send for her, for I have known her for many years: while the man was gone to fetch Mrs. Ship, the prisoner took out a guinea, and offered to leave it in my hands, in lieu of the poplin, and he said he would find the poplin the next day if he could; he offered to leave that guinea if I would set him at liberty: the prosecutrix came immediately; there were then eight or ten people in the room, many of them were strangers to her, she directly pointed out the prisoner: she said Mr. Williams I am glad to see you; the prisoner said he would pay her for the poplin; he asked her what it was worth, and offered her a guinea, he afterwards offered her two guineas, and I believe the poor woman would have taken it if I had not persuaded her, that if she did she might herself be indicted for compounding felony; and she did at the same time mention being robbed of half a guinea; and farther, that he had forced a ring and a paper into her hand.</p>
               <p>What character does the prosecutrix bear? - I have lived where I do now fourteen years; I believe she has lived there ten years; her husband is groom to lord Orwell; she takes in washing, she is a very honest, industrious woman. The chairmen mentioned in the prisoner's presence, that he offered them a guinea a piece to let him go when they were upon Hay-hill, and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. After he asked me if I should know him, he said my name is Williams, I am a carpenter in Mount-street: I called him Williams at the time I came into the room.</p>

I was at Mr. Coward's; he offered a guinea, and said he would get the poplin again; I heard him say he kept the Marquis of Granby's Head in Drury-lane: when we were upon Hay-hill, the prisoner said he was a man of property, and if we would go to his house, he would treat us: he desired we would go to a company he had left; we went with him towards the place he had mentioned; then he turned round and wanted to go towards New Bond-street: he acknowledged he was the man, and said it was the first offence he had been guilty of.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner in Berkeley-square: he said he was a man of property, and kept the Marquis of Granby's Head in Drury-lane; he said he had just left the Coach and Horses in Dover-street, and he would convince us by the company he came out of, that he was not the man; goi ng through Berkeley-square to Dover-street, upon Hay-hill, he turned down towards Grafton-street, and then offered to treat us if we would let him go; we would not: then he owned he was the man; he said this was the first fact, and he offered us a guinea each; indeed he afterwards offered to double it if we would let him go, which we refused: we carried him to Mr. Coward's in Curzon-street, May-fair; he desired we would not expose him, so we carried him into a back parlour; then we sent for Mrs. Ship: there were, I believe, ten people in the room when she came, yet she pitched upon him directly: the prisoner offered to pay two guineas, and to return the poplin next morning: he laid down the two guineas; he had likewise two shillings and some half pence.</p>

               <p>I heard a great alarm of murder on Sunday morning the 15th of October: I opened my window and saw two men scuffling together, but they were at such a distance that I could not distinguish one from the other; I thought they were drunken men, and was going to bed again, but I heard the deceased cry out murder; then I called for the watch, then the person that had murdered him ran away; the deceased got up and ran after him a little way and fell, he got up again and fell just opposite my window; and said</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! he has killed</p>
               <p>"me; I am a dead man, I am a dead man:" a gentleman called out of Mr. Blinkow's one-pair of stairs window to the watchman to stop the man, but he did not; the man went down Bloomsbury-court; he had no hat or wig on, and his head appeared to me very clean shaved.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What distance were they from you when you first saw them? - I imagine about ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Was it pretty light? - No, it was not light, it was just beginning to be break of day.</p>
               <p>- BLINKOW sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning the 15th of October I was awaked with the cry of watch; I got out of bed and threw up the sash, I sleep in a two-pair of stairs room: I saw the two men scuffling together near Mr. Pratt's stable door, I looked upon it to be a drunken sight, and paid no regard to it; in the scuffle they came nearer to my house, they fell in the middle of the kennel, the deceased fell undermost; the other then disengaged himself from him and ran away, leaving his hat and wig behind him: when I saw him running without his hat and wig, I imagined it was something serious, upon which I called to the watchman, who was coming along the side of Bloomsbury-market, to stop that man, he was then running away; the watchman attempted to cross the way to meet him, upon which he turned short and ran down Bloomsbury-court by my house; then I heard somebody ask the deceased what was the matter, he told them that a man had broke into the stable, that he attempted to secure him, and he believed he was a dead man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - My house is the corner of Bloomsbury-court: the deceased died about eight in the morning: I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090015"/> first at his master's house, he was taken from thence to the hospital.</p>
               <p>What distance was you when you first saw them? - Mr. Pratt's stable is about fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Did, you see the hat and wig on when first you saw them? - I did not observe then, but I observed he had not a hat and wig on when he went away; when I saw them first it was but just break of day, and at that distance I could but just discern that they were two men, they in the scuffle came ten yards nearer me.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of October, as near as I can guess as to the day, a little before six in the morning, I heard the cry of murder; I threw up the sash of the window and looked out; I saw two men in the kennel together, near Mr. Pratt's coach-house; one of the men cried out murder very much; he said the man had robbed his stables: in the scuffle they both got up together.</p>
               <p>How far was it from Mr. Pratt's stables when you saw them first? - Pretty night, as near as I can guess; they had another fall together, and were some time down; the murderer got loose from the man; when he got to the corner of Bloomsbury-court, he turned and looked after the deceased; the deceased had got up and fell down again; I called the watch, and a watchman, who was at the further end of the market, made the best of his way to the court; the watchman got to the end of the court just as the murderer did; the murderer set off down the court, and the watchman gave an alarm with his rattle; I saw nothing of him after he got into the court: I called to a young man that was assisting the deceased, to take up the man's hat and wig, which he had left at the corner of the street; in picking the hat and wig up, he found an instrument which we supposed the murder was committed with. The deceased was carried away on a shutter.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed a little before six o'clock by the cry of watch and murder; I then jumped out of bed, took my coat and ran to the place, where I saw the deceased lying on the ground; I went and asked him what was the matter with him; he made no answer for some minutes, but groaned; he said afterwards,</p>
               <p>"I</p>
               <p>"am a dead man, I am a dead man, he has</p>
               <p>"murdered me, he has murdered me." I laid hold of him, he sprung out of my hands, and run about two or three yards, then he staggered and run his head against the kerb-stone of the pavement; I lifted him up and set him on the pavement, and let him lean his head against my breast; then I asked him how it happened, he said,</p>
               <p>"I found a man in my</p>
               <p>"master's stable, I went to detect him, and he</p>

               <p>Did he say what the man was doing in the stable? - He did not: by that time some people were assembled round him, one person unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat, and there we saw the wound he had received; all the belly part of his shirt was full of congealed blood; he lay there some small time, and then they put him on a shutter and carried him into his master's house in Southampton-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday morning, the 15th of October, I was waked by my wife (she had been at the window) she told me Mr. Pratt's coachman was murdered; I jumped out of bed and went to the window; I looked to my right-hand and saw the deceased leaning on Holland's breast; I turned my eye to my left-hand and saw Israel Dearing coming up the stable yard; I desired him to take up the two hats and the wig that lay on the ground, and bring them to my door.</p>
               <p>Where were they lying? - Against Mr. Pratt's coach-house, as near as I can recollect, one was the deceased's and the other belonged to the person that had murdered him; I examined them both very strictly: I dressed myself and came down immediately, and I went up to the deceased and unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was full of blood, there was likewise a great quantity of blood in his breeches; about three quarters of an inch above his left pap, there was a wound, out of which the blood gushed very much; I went immediately into Great Russel street for Mr. Younge the surgeon, I stayed there ten or eleven minutes till he came down; in the interim they had carried him on a shutter to his master's: Mr. Younge came with me to Mr. Pratt's, we found him on a shutter, he ordered him to be put in a chair, he examined the wound; I asked him if he thought it mortal, he shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090016"/> his head, but at that time gave me no answer, but desired the deceased might have a little hartshorn and water given him; I thought he was a little refreshed, with that I asked him if he knew the person that had used him so; his answer was No, says I, where did you find him, In my master's stables: the watchman brought in this instrument (producing a small bayonet bent at the point, made to fix upon the end of a stick) I shewed it to the deceased, and asked him if that was the instrument with which he had been wounded, he said, Yes; it was bent by his fall upon it. Mr. Younge wrote an order for him to be admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital; he was carried a little way in a chair, but being weak through the effusion of blood, he fell and broke the glass; they were obliged to take him out of the chair and put him into a coach, in which they carried him to the hospital; I saw no more of him, but heard he died about eight o'clock that morning.</p>
               <p>Do you know who picked up the instrument? - A little boy, who took it up and gave it to the watchman; we don't know who the boy is, here is a person here that saw him pick it up.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. What condition was the instrument in when given to you? - The watchman had wiped it with his coat, but there was a little blood on the tip of it, I put my finger to it and found it blood.</p>
               <p>ISRAEL DEERING sworn.</p>
               <p>As I was going up Holborn, about ten minutes before six o'clock in the morning of the 15th of November, between Bloomsbury-court and Southampton-street, I heard the cry I thought of murder; I went up Southampton-street, and when I came to the corner of Silver-street, by the gateway, i saw a man runing and he fell, and as I came up the gateway a person at a window desired me to pick up a hat and wig, and the coachman's hat, which were lying on the ground; in about two or three minutes after that I saw a little boy pick up that weapon.</p>
               <p>How near to the place was it where the hat and wig were lying? - About five or six yards from the place where I took up the hat and wig; it was near Mr. Pratt's stable door; one of the watchmen took it of the boy: we took the deceased to Mr. Pratt's house, a surgeon came, he probed the wound; but hearing there was a weapon, he ordered it to be got before he could tell which way the wound went; in about ten minutes the weapon was brought, and he looked at it and returned it to somebody; I left my name and departed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy take up the weapon? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he give it you? - He offered it me; I had the hats and wig, and my stick; I could not take it, and he gave it to a short man, a watchman, who shewed him the weapon close to his face; as he sat in the chair, he said, Hum, hum, we could not tell what he said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a barber: upon the fourth or fifth of October the prisoner brought me this wig to make an alteration in it, it was not then deep enough in his neck; I am certain this is the wig he brought to me; I did alter it, and here is the alteration in it now.</p>
               <p>Have you shaved the prisoner any time since the alteration of his wig? - Yes, in the course of the week following.</p>
               <p>Do you know what day of the week you shaved him? - I believe on Friday in the next week.</p>
               <p>Did you shave the hair all off? - No, I left some hair on each temple, and likewise a little in the neck.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Craven-street, Soho, or Hog-lane; it is called by both names.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - I do not know that I ever saw him before he brought the wig to alter.</p>
               <p>Then you have no acquaintance with him? - None at all.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it he brought it to you, the fourth or fifth of October? - In the afternoon of one of those days, by day light.</p>
               <p>Was it left with you? - It was made longer from the forehead to the neck.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner wear during that time? - His own hair, with curls.</p>
               <p>When was the wig fetched back again? - At six in the evening, and then I cut his hair off.</p>
               <p>That wig could not be wore with the hair? - With the hair which I left it might: he was very fearful of catching cold, he said, or he would have been shaved then; I did not shave it at first, but cut it off, as we generally do, when people are afraid of catching cold; I cut it pretty close.</p>
               <p>You never saw him afterwards? - I have met him several times, from the affair happening, before he was taken up, and have given him the time of the day, but he never made any answer to me.</p>
               <p>When was he taken up? - Last Wednesday was a week I believe; I did not hear any thing till Wednesday of it.</p>
               <p>Are you certain the prisoner is the man? - I am positive.</p>
               <p>- CONYER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a peruke-maker, and live in Newtoner's-street, Holborn: I know the wig to be the prisoner's, I am positive he wore it, I dressed it twice; I took notice, the first time I combed it for him, of a particular riband in the inside, I never saw such a particular thing in a wig before, which made me take the more notice of it; the prisoner took a lodging in the house I lived in, in Newtoner's-street, Holborn, No 8, for his mother and sister to live in; to the best of my remembrance it was the same day this murder happened, but I cannot positively swear to the same day or the Monday afterwards, that a note came to Mrs. Williams his mother; I saw the note, it was desiring her to send him a great coat, a pair of breeches, a hat and a silk handkerchief, which I imagine came from the prisoner: on the Monday or Tuesday night the prisoner came in with a bundle, but what it contained I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you keep the house? - No, I have only a little shop there.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the house? - Mrs. Lilly in Parker's-lane.</p>
               <p>You dressed the wig twice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what days? - No; the first time was about the 8th or 9th of October, I believe, but I cannot speak to a day; he kept rabbits there; he used to come at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, and was there generally most of the day.</p>
               <p>As to this note you know nothing of it? - No more than that such a note came.</p>

               <p>Did not you give him some hopes, that he would not be hurt? - No, none at all; he then told me they went into Castle-street, and stole two fowls out of a shop, which they sold for a shilling a piece; that then they came to this shop, and that Mosey was the person that broke the window, and took the handkerchief out.</p>
               <p>How did you know who he meant by Mosey? - By Saunders's account; he said, the name of one was Archy, and the other Mosey; he gave a description of them, and said, they lived in a street in St. Giles's; he shewed us a house, but we did not find them there; then he said, they used a public-house, the Coach and Horses, High-street, St. Giles's: I went there, they were not there; I left him with my brother constable, and while he was making water, Saunders run from him; I was not far off, I pursued him and took him; we confined him in the watch-house, and then went to the Coach and Horses again; there we took Mosey and Archy, the other two prisoners: there were several girls; one of them said, Mosey, will you have any Gin? I said, that is one, be quiet and we shall have some more: then Archy rose up, and said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes, Mosey, will you have any</p>
               <p>"Gin?" We had a full description of Archy; then we laid hold of them both.</p>

            , Esq; upon the 28th of December my master's doors were locked very safe; the goods mentioned in the indictment were stole out of the room over the stable adjoining to the dwelling-house; I was at the play: I came home about ten o'clock; I found every thing safe then; when I went up into the room, between seven and eight o'clock the next morning, I found my box broke open: I lodged in the house; the door of my room was standing open, the tiles were pulled off, and a lath cut. I met the prisoner accidentally on the second of January in Piccadilly with my cloaths upon his back; I never saw him before; I took him before justice Wright, I found these things upon him (producing a pair of stockings and a handkerchief) I have recovered besides, seven pair of stockings, two shirts, three neckcloths, a pair of breeches, a waistcoat faced with blue sattin, which things he told us of at justice Wright's, and that another man took some of the things; we went to the prisoner's lodgings, and he attempted to jump out at the window; we found the breeches in Monmouth-street, where he had sold them, and the man said, he had sold the coat; the prisoner told us, he had sent the rest of the cloths to a Jew; I never recovered them.</p>

I understood that to be the money he had given her to pay the rent; she said, my dear Joe, do not kick me, nor beat me, for I did not spend it; he said, where is the woman's money, a number of times: you bloody bitch, I will knock your bloody liver out, and your bloody melt;

             and my wife were in my apartment at the same time, the partition between the rooms is only lath and plaister; I heard her fall down, and she shook my plates; Fox and my wife hallooed out to him; he gave some saucy answer; I told them to hold their tongues, that it was a customary affair; after that he went down stairs: I heard her moaning when I awaked at about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Was she lying upon the bed to your opinion, at that time? - No, upon the floor behind the door; a woman came up in the morning, and a girl; I went in and put the deceased upon the bed, with her head against his legs; some hair was pulled off her head, and lay in various parts of the room.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the hair of her head? - The hair matched with her hair; I wanted her to speak, but she could not.</p>
               <p>How long before this beating had you seen the deceased? - In the morning of the day he beat her; she washed for a good many men, she was then about her business as usual; there appeared to be nothing the matter with her more than usual; she was no way ailing that I know of.</p>
               <p>How long had she lived with the prisoner? - I have heard him say four or five years; when I returned up stairs again on Christmas day, at about one o'clock, I saw her again; the prisoner was not in the room, she was upon the floor again, I lifted her upon the bed; she lay just at the back of the door, that we could hardly get in; the bed is near the door.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090041"/>Do you think she slipt off? - No, I think she was not able to move; I think she must have been pushed off.</p>
               <p>Did you lift her up on the bed again? - Yes; she was as bad before; I did not not see any change in her; I observed upon the floor, blood and hair, and her cap; she lay without a cap, and was all bloody in her mouth, and all over her, and her hair all in strings clotted with blood or something.</p>
               <p>Was there blood upon the ground near where her head lay? - Yes, besides hair, and upon the chairs; she died I believe the day after.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think you say she was a woman of a weak constitution? - She was a woman of a thin body.</p>
               <p>Sickly? - I never saw any sickliness.</p>
               <p>Did not she use to drink very hard? - She used to drink to be sure.</p>
               <p>Do you know what sort of liquor she used to drink; gin or beer? - She might drink both.</p>
               <p>Did not she often get drunk? - I have seen her drunk, not very drunk; she was capable to come up to her own apartment, and do her business, as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she was drunk that evening? - For what I know she might.</p>
               <p>Had you seen her a little before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she speak plain? - She did.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. When you took the woman up, and she lay near the door, and you put her in bed where this man lay, did she speak to you? - She would not speak a word.</p>
               <p>And you are sure she said, my Joe, do not kick me? - Yes, quite plain as I speak now; he said, d - n your eyes, you bitch, as I mentioned before.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness, we lodge in the next room to the prisoner; I heard him say he wanted the money; that she had not paid it to Mrs. Carr, that is our landlady; he beat her and said he would cut her bloody life out, and her bloody melt out, and d - d her for a bloody bitch; she said nothing, but my dear Joe, pray don't, my dear Joe, don't; when he took her up and threw her down he shook the very tables in our room.</p>
               <p>Had you heard the blows or kicks before that time? - Yes, several times; then he went down stairs; I never heard her speak more, only she moaned: I called to him once or twice while he was beating her and begged for God's sake he would not beat her; he bid us be d - d and keep our own apartment. I heard nothing more pass that night, but I went down at about a quarter after seven in the morning; I told my landlord and landlady, that I did suppose Bull had killed his wife, for she lay in a deplorable condition; for I had opened my own door and saw her weltering in her blood, with her hair all about her ears; I did not open his door, she lay and moaned in such a manner it terrified me; that was Christmas day in the morning: the prisoner was out when I looked into the room, he did not come home till a man came for his shirt; I said to the man, I should be glad if you would go and fetch Bull home and take that poor woman off the ground; the prisoner came up along with him, and he gave the man his shirt; she was then lying upon the floor, and the prisoner took no notice at all of the body.</p>
               <p>Did any body speak to him about it? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Did your husband go in with you? - I was not there when he lifted her from the floor, my husband went in about nine or ten o'clock, I did not go in then; I saw her the next day, Tuesday morning, she would have spoke to me, but she could not: she died on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the deceased? - She had been there four or five months I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you intimate with her? - I am very seldom at home.</p>
               <p>I believe she used to get drunk very often? - I do not think she had wherewith to do it.</p>
               <p>Have not you frequently seen her drunk? - I have seen her intoxicated with liquor, but not to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Whenever she could get money to buy liquor she was? - When she got money for washing, he always took share of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090042"/>When the man came for his shirt Bull came back again voluntarily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You desired the man that came for the shirt to fetch the prisoner, that he might take the poor woman off the ground? - He stept over her, and took no notice of her; he desired the man to appear if any thing should be wanting; and he said he would be greatly obliged to him, for the folks would think the bitch had killed herself with drinking of gin.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Did not she lay as you have frequently seen folks lay that are drunk? - I do not think that she was.</p>
               <p>Did you observe blood about? - Blood came from her nose and mouth, and there were several spots of blood about the room, and her hair was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Did you see her when she was put upon her bed? - I saw her in her bed, when my landlady had stripped her cloaths off upon Tuesday morning.</p>

               <p>She passed as his wife? - Yes; she turned her head to me as well as she was able, and made a noise, but could not speak; her face appeared bloody all over, and her hair all about; there were either three or four locks of hair upon the ground; and underneath the chair where she fat, there was a quantity of blood.</p>

               <p>Did you say any thing to him what you was going about? - I did not speak a word to him; but I am apt to think he heard me there; he did not stay ten minutes in the room after me; the constable came and went with me and

               <p>Was this before the woman was dead? - Yes; as soon as I returned, I went to see the deceased again; Doran had lifted the body upon the bed before I came: I got the overseer to come then, and the apothecary: the apothecary opened a vein, and she bled; he thought she would die; I thought possibly if I took her cloaths off she might survive: I was obliged to cut them off, and about her body there were a vast many marks, from her hands to each shoulder were marked; her hip was very black, and upon one side of her head.</p>
               <p>Did she speak afterwards? - She would have spoke if she could; I told her Joe was confined, she tried to speak, but could not: she died upon Tuesday between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon: Upon Christmas day I was called to see the deceased between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I called by chance upon the apothecary who attended her; he was going down along with the two overseers of the parish to see this woman; I found her speechless: I was informed of the manner in which she had been treated; I examined her I found she had three bruises upon her arm, that was all I saw that night; on the next morning I called again in order to see her, and I was then told that she had more bruises, two of which made their appearance then about her body, and I found an appearance just upon her hip; the skin was discoloured: I examined her head very closely then, in order to discover<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090044"/> whether any wound was there upon her head, it being day light then; I did not find any wound on her head, I suspected there might be; then a man produced some hair that had been torn from her head: I found afterwards upon a strict examination, that the blood had come from her nose; I did not at that time find any place discoloured on the head, and I examined it very closely; I thought the wound that made its appearance might have come from a concussion of the brain or a fracture, and then blood would have come from the ears or mouth; I made a particular examination into that, and as I said before, I found it came from her nose; I did not see her afterwards till the coroner's jury fat, I attended then, and that part which appeared slightly bruised in the hip, made a great appearance; it was very large and much discoloured, there was no kind of wound, there will from a small bruise appear a great discolouration; there was no wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not some internal injury happen by a violent bruise of the external parts without any wound appearing? - It might, provided it had been in the abdomen, but this was upon the hip bone; I thought it would be necessary to examine the head further, and I observed a small slight mark or bruise just upon the temple, but so slight that it hardly made any kind of appearance.</p>
               <p>How long had she been dead then? - Two or three days, I believe; it was so trifling that I had not observed it before, though I closely examined it, till that night; I examined the side, but the only bruise she had was upon the hip; there was an account given the first day that I came, that her arm was broke; I examined it very closely then, and also before the jury; but it was not broke, it was greatly bruised indeed; I did observe to the people when I was first fetched, that the woman had been treated very ill, and I made no doubt but that she must die, for she was dying when I called.</p>
               <p>You have heard the account, that she was thrown down or fell down by blows with great violence upon the floor ; I do not find by their accounts that she ever rose from that fall: might not there be a concussion of the brain that did not shew itself in any external appearances by blood, either from the mouth or ears? - I had the honor to be brought up at Bartholomew's hospital, and have seen many concussions of the brain and fractured skulls; but I very seldom saw a concussion of the brain but some bad circumstances had followed, of a retching or the like, and I do not find that she retched.</p>
               <p>The witnesses never heard her stir from the place after she was knocked down, and she was found upon the spot where she was knocked down the next morning? - The blood I saw lay at the feet of the bed.</p>
               <p>From the consequence of being thrown down, never rising more, and being found the next morning speechless, should not you have concluded there must be some internal hurt that you could not perceive; was her head opened? - So slight was the bruise upon the part, that I never saw it till the coroner and we were coming away, and she had no bad symptoms to induce me to open it; I should certainly have opened it else, to see if there was any extravasated blood between the dura mater and the pia mater.</p>
               <p>Might not some shock have been received in these nice vessels? - In the hospitals we have opened the parts and known a concussion and fracture, and have not found any symptoms.</p>
               <p>Jury. The woman said she found her lying upon her forehead, the surgeon says it was upon her forehead? - Rather upon one side of her head.</p>

            . How was the woman lying when first you saw her in the morning? - She lay along upon the ground with her face upon her hand.</p>
               <p>To Mr. JARVIS. You have attended to the whole of this evidence; I take for granted this woman describes how she lay, how she fell as all mere suspicion: I should be glad to know whether you attribute her death to chance, to accident, or to violence? - Upon the examination of what I informed your lordship, concerning her arm and her hip, as these seemed to be the principal kind of bruises; her arm was very much bruised, yet I should not imagine that this could be the occasion of her death, because they are not in parts sufficient; had they been in the abdomen, or the stomach, it would have been different; we all know that broken arms do not occasion any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090045"/> persons death without mortification; the bruise on the temple seeming in fact so slight and she not having had those symptoms that generally attend fractures and concussions of the brain, I cannot tell how far the brain might be injured.</p>
               <p>Court. As to what symptoms she had he went out and left her all night? - I only go by appearances.</p>
               <p>From what you observed of these external marks, you do not think that they could occasion her death so immediately? - No, had she received any wound any where in order to have traced to open the body, I could have been more certain, but as to bruises we seldom open at hospitals upon that account without symptoms of a concussion of the brain or a fracture.</p>
               <p>Mr. HARDING sworn.</p>
               <p>One of our overseers called upon me and took me with him to see the deceased upon Christmas day, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I found her upon the bed in her cloaths very cold; she had no cap on and was in a wretched condition, and I thought in a dying state; we endeavoured to make her speak, to acquaint me how she came to be in such a dreadful situation; she could not speak; I then asked for assistance to endeavour to bleed her, her arm was contracted and quite cold, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could extend it, it was cold and stiff; I took five or six ounces of blood from her; I then spoke to the overseer and wished that he would send for a little wine, that we might see if she could drink; he sent for it; it was with a great deal of difficulty that she swallowed about half a spoonful. I saw there was blood just by the door, not a great quantity, I suppose about a couple of ounces; then I examined her head to see if there was any rupture or bruise, if there had I should have sent immediately for a surgeon; but I found none, the blood I perceive had ran, as I take it, from her nose and had gone into her hair, and had stuck it to the side of her temple; I opened the cloaths; she was not undressed, she had a coarse apron on that was exceeding wet, and all her cloaths were wet and very damp; I bid the woman pull the wet things off, the overseer giving directions to have care taken of her: I left her for that time. Mr. Jarvis called upon me accidentally, I asked him to go with me to see this poor woman; he went with me, I found her much in the same situation I left her in; we were informed she had many bruises and was very much hurt; we examined and I did not perceive any bruises then, but upon the left hip, upon the arm, and upon the temple, all upon the left side; these contusions I thought did not appear sufficient to occasion her death.</p>

               <p>Did you see her after she was dead, before the coroner's inquest? - Her nose and upper lip had bruises as if she had either fell or had a blow upon them; Mr. Jarvis and I were both together before the coroner.</p>
               <p>You have heard Mr. Jarvis's account? - Yes, but I would observe one thing: one of the witnesses says her right arm was black; now that was a mistake of the evidence, for my bleeding her and tying her arm made it black; for it was not so when I bound it.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Would that cause a blackness from the finger's end to the shoulder? - I do not know that it was so; I do not know but it might, it was much swelled; I was obliged to untie it myself in the evening; the arm swelled from four o'clock till I came at eight at night.</p>
               <p>Court. You observe by the account, that she was knocked or beat down at seven o'clock on Sunday evening; that she was permitted to lye there all night upon the floor; do you impute the death to the violence and usage she received, taking the whole circumstances together? - If the woman had received no hurt I verily believe she would have been alive now.</p>
               <p>Do you mean if she had not been left in her wet cloaths all night upon the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You think that an ingredient that might cause her death? - I verily believe her lying upon the floor in that situation was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>To Mr. JARVIS. What do you say to that? - I made an observation before, that I did not suppose the bruises that I had seen were the cause of her death; but I am afraid the ill treatment might.</p>
               <p>Therefore not having immediate assistance, you think the violence she received and the ill treatment, and leaving her in that situation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090046"/> might occasion her death? - I should be sorry to say otherwise.</p>

               <p>The death of the poor woman is certain; the manner in which she has died you have heard the particulars of, and you are to determine upon the evidence, how far you think the prisoner at the bar has been the occasion of her death: I desire you not to let any acts of cruelty, which I am sorry to say, have appeared in the evidence, prejudice you against the prisoner at the bar; but to consider it coolly and dispassionately, and try from the whole of the evidence, whether you are satisfied in your mind and conscience, that the prisoner, under all the circumstances, has been the occasion of the woman's death. In order to from that judgment, you will consider, in the first place, what state of health she was in before this happened; the witnesses give you an account, she was what you would call a puny woman, a woman not of a robust constitution, as one of the witnesses, Mrs. Tudor, says she looked upon her to be very well, only she was not a woman of a strong constitution; but she saw her that day about her business, the others saw her that day, they heard no complaint whatever; and therefore to all appearance she was well till this fact happened: none of the witnesses saw the prisoner beat her; but you are to consider, under the circumstances, whether the evidence thus given, is not sufficient to satisfy you that he has beat her, and to what degree. Three people, (one a stranger, who happened to be in the next room, who knew neither the prisoner nor the deceased) all correspond in that account; they all of them tell you that they heard him beat her and kick her; they heard her thrown down, as they describe it, with violence; they all heard her expostulating with him, calling him her dear Joe, and entreating him, for God's sake, not to beat or kick her any more: the dispute, you see, arose, and the cause of his acting in that manner was, as far as we can find, imputed to her having spent the money he had given her to pay Mrs. Carr; the witnesses were asked whether she was supposed to be fuddled then or not; they say they did not see her, but she spoke plain. Mrs. Doran goes further still, and she says, hearing the cruel manner, as she apprehended, in which he was treating this woman, she called out to him and he damned her, and bid her mind her own business, and keep her own apartment; they all three swear that they never heard any thing more said after she fell down, and that he went down in a little time after; and now you find by the account of Miller, who seems to come as his friend in some respect, that after he had been home again, he came back to him and never returned all night; so that if she did receive violence, if he threw her down in this manner, if she never rose afterwards, he certainly went and left her in that state in which she was found on Monday morning; how she was found then the witnesses have told you, and I shall not repeat it: you hear then what evidence there is of violence, both the surgeon and apothecary, though they did not think the appearances of violence were such, that they themselves were immediately the cause of her death; yet they tell you they found her in a wretched condition; the apothecary says, her arms were almost stiff at the time he attempted to bleed her, and she was in a dying state when he first saw her: Mrs. Tudor tells you, she thought she was dying at the time she saw her, she never grew better, you observe, but worse and worse to the time of her death; and then the material thing to be considered is, as these bruises did not in themselves seem timport, any thing fatal from the external appearances of them, whether taking the whole transaction together, beating her in that manner, if you are satisfied he did do so, throwing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090048"/> her down in that manner, if you are satisfied with the evidence respecting it; leaving her in that situation, never taking the least care in the world, which must all be taken as one transaction, was the occasion of her death; how it can be accounted for I shall not intimate, nor speak the least with respect to my own sentiments of the occasion; but you see a person very well before this happened, in a dying state, the very first time she was seen after it happened, you are to judge from thence whether it was or was not the occasion of her death: one thing does occur to me; that is, if he was satisfied from the violent beating, or ought to be satisfied from the violent beating she had received, from the violence she had received in throwing down, that she was in a state at least that deserved care and attention, or that something should be done for her, and went away and left her in that state without any care or attention, and by that means was, as the apothecary thinks, the occasion of her death; in point of law, taking the whole circumstances together, the acts that he did, and the omission of what he ought to have done are to be considered as one transaction, and if you are satisfied all together were the occasion of her death, he is guilty of the murder: if he had went away with a flight degree of injury that had been given her, from which there was no probability of any harm happening to her, and there was no negligence whatever or cruelty in leaving her in that condition and not attending to her; if you could think that, then perhaps, so much negligence is not to be imputed to that act as should be considered as an additional circumstance to make him guilty; I mean wilfully in his own mind of the occasion of it: I am sorry to annex to it an observation, that when he came the next day and was desired to take her up, he walked across the body and did not give her the least assistance; then if from thence you can inter an intention from the beginning of doing a mischief to her, you may be satisfied perhaps with respect to the whole of the transaction, as to the occasion of her death; however you will take it into consideration, and if you are fully satisfied in your conscience that he has been from the whole of the transaction the occasion of her death, then you will find him Guilty; on the other hand, if a doubt remains in your mind about it, though you would be very desirous that the death of a party should be attoned for, yet you will take great care, while we are lamenting the death of one innocent person, that another innocent person may not be in danger of suffering.</p>

               <p>"he was a rascal and a scoundrel; why did not he give the waiter six-pence and he would bring him some snuff?" and said,</p>
               <p>"if he had any manners, he would not teaze him for snuff, while he was in conversation with other gentlemen." The discourse then dropped, and Mr. Hunt went to the door to make water, he came in and walked about the kitchen, and then came into the bar again; he went to sit down, and then the deceased challenged him, and said,</p>
               <p>"he should be glad to decide the affair with him;" the deceased clapped his hand upon his sword, which was under his left arm, but did not then draw it;</p>
               <p>"very well, said Mr. Hunt, if you must have satisfaction, I shall decide it where you think proper." Porter the prisoner said, if you mean to decide it, you shall decide it here, you shall not go out of the house to decide it; yes, said Mr. Roupell, they shall decide it here; and he took one candle, and Porter the other; Mr. Roupell then went out into the passage, and stood till Hunt and Smith came; Hunt and Smith then came out of the bar, and Porter got before them, and went up stairs first, then Hunt and Smith followed, and Rou pell followed them; then I went up out of curiosity to see the affair, I was not called; they had their swords drawn before they went into the room; the deceased drew his sword first; Hunt had his in the scabbard; Hunt then drew his sword; they put themselves in a poster of defence against each other; they made several pushes at each other, but neither of them were wounded; Mr. Hunt then drew back, he appeared to me to be rather daunted, and said to Mr. Smith,</p>
               <p>"Smith, what necessity is there for you and I fighting;" he spoke very coolly to Smith, but Smith answered very abruptly,</p>
               <p>"d - n you, I shall resent it;" Smith held the point of his sword slanting towards the floor, and Mr. Hunt rose up and made a lunge at him towards the right side, somewhere against his ribs.</p>
               <p>Was Smith off his guard at that time? - No; he was not, he held his arm in a right line from his body, but his sword was rather bent, which made it appear to incline downwards; Mr. Smith made a lunge at Mr. Hunt, but missed his aim, and then they closed in with each other; when they closed in, Smith's sword passed by Mr. Hunt's right side; Porter then put down the candle, interfered, and took Smith's sword out of his hand, and flung it into the next room; I went immediately and put Mr. Hunt's sword into the scabbard, and left it upon the table; Hunt and Smith were then parted, and both their swords taken out of their hands; Smith pointed to his wound, and said, see here; there was a little blood upon the outside of his waistcoat; he called Hunt a d - d rascal, hit him a blow upon his lip, and made his lip swell and bleed: Hunt then took his sword, and Porter, Roupell, and he went down stairs, and left the deceased and me in the room, and I saw his colour change amazingly; I told him, if he would please to come down, I would lead him down stairs; he came out of the room with me, I came out first with the candle; I asked him when he came out of the room to stop a minute, till I picked his sword up, which was in the next room; he leaned upon the bannister, and instantly fell down; I went down stairs and told the company I believed the deceased was mortally wounded: I got some water and sprinkled it in his face, and it seemed to refresh him a little, but he did not speak; I then came down again and told the company, which were Mr. Hunt, Mr. Porter, Mr. Sheepcut, and Mr. Jennings, that the man was motionless; the company immediately: got up, and Jennings strongly desired that a surgeon should be sent for immediately, Mrs. Roupell said it was only a slight wound, and that she would take up some salve and dress his wound; that it was nothing but drunkenness.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they at this time drunk or sober? - They appeared to me to be intoxicated; Mrs. Roupell, Mr. Hunt, and Mr. Porter went up; I went to Salisbury-street for a surgeon, but he was not at home; I then went for an apothecary, Mr.

             the apothecary came; he probed the wound, and decleared it not mortal, but he said it was highly necessary to sent for a surgeon; one came, I went in with him, we found Hunt and Porter bringing the deceased down to the one pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090050"/> stairs; they put him into the room, he stretched out, and rolled about the carpet very much: Hunt seemed much concerned, and asked the apothecary what was best to be done with him, the apothecary advised them to take him to St. George's Hospital; Hunt said, no; I should like to take him to the Westminster Infirmary, as I should like to have it done more private; Hunt said to me, let us lift him up and put him in the coach, and take him to an hospital immediately: in bringing the deceased down stairs, he begged to let him sit up a little; we then brought him down and laid him in the passage; there was a mob about the door; a surgeon was going by, and asked what was the matter, he came in, looked at the man, and declared he was a dead man, and that it was needless to move him; he died of the wound about an hour and a quarter after he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. from PORTER. Whether I did not fetch, or attempt to get a surgeon? - You did; while I went to Salisbury-street for a surgeon, I met you coming down while I was going up Catherine-street; but he had never a surgeon with him.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When the deceased, Smith, was asking Hunt several times for snuff, what was Hunt a doing of? - Engaged in company with other people.</p>
               <p>What about? - Playing at dice.</p>
               <p>Then Smith was repeatedly interrupting him for snuff during the time he was at play? - Yes; while at play with these other gentlemen.</p>
               <p>You say when Hunt went out to make water, he was challenged immediately upon coming in? - Yes; he dropped the discourse, and did not speak a word to Smith, but Smith challenged him.</p>
               <p>Were there any opprobrious names given at that time? - No; a challenge was given by Smith; Hunt answered him very coolly, I shall decide it wherever you will.</p>
               <p>Directly, they went up stairs? - Yes; almost instantly.</p>
               <p>You said before, Hunt did all he could to get a surgeon? - He offered to take him to an hospital; and do all in his power to serve him.</p>
               <p>Did not I say I would pay him all the expences to get a surgeon immediately? - You did.</p>

               <p>"d - n you, if you are a gentleman, give the waiter six-pence, and let him go and bring you some snuff;" he still kept frequently asking in the course of a minute or two perhaps, for a pinch of snuff; Hunt, as he was losing his money, was a little out of humour, and upon his teazing him said,</p>
               <p>"d - n you, you deserve to have your head broke:" soon after the company refused playing any more with Hunt; Hunt went out and returned in about a minute; I moved from where I was, and sat next to Mr. Sheepcut; I said to him, as you are a winner, I would advise you not to play any more; while I was talking, the deceased, Hunt, Porter, and Roupell went out of the room together: I did not hear any challenge given; I did not know what they were going out of the room about; in a few minutes after the waiter and the maid came into the bar, and said one of the men was wounded; I directly said, then why don't you go for a surgeon; I ordered the waiter to go for a surgeon, Porter immediately came into the bar, and said the deceased was wounded; I bid him fetch a surgeon; he directly went out for Mr. Howard; he came back, and said he could not find him; I made use of some warm expressions, and asked him what business he had back till he brought a surgeon with him; he went again and a surgeon, a foreigner, came in, I believe, with him; he said he had been to see the deceased, had probed him, and he was a dead man; Hunt seemed extremely unhappy at hearing it, and walked up and down the bar or the kitchen; I then told Hunt I was unhappy in being there, and likewise that the accident had happened, but as it had happened, I must take care that he was delivered into the hands of justice; he seemed quite satisfied: the constable and watchman were sent for, and he went with them.</p>

               <p>Many more gentlemen would have attended, but they thought these were sufficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Asbhurst, after having with great accuracy summed up the evidence to the Jury, concluded to the following effect:</p>
               <p>This, gentlemen, is the evidence that has been given on one side, and the other; now it will be proper for me to tell you that in point of law, wherever death happens in consequence of a deliberate duel, at a future time and not immediately upon the quarrel, that in the eye of the law is murder; but if two men fall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090052"/> out, and having their weapons with them, fight immediately with those weapons, or if in the heat of passion they go instantly and fetch their weapons and fight a duel immediately, if death happens in consequence of that, the law makes such an allowance for the frailty of mens passions, that it does not suppose that malice in the act, which is necessary to constitute the crime of murder: then, gentlemen, you will carry back your attention to the facts that have been proved in the present case: it has been proved by the evidence of the waiter, and likewise by the evidence of Mr. Jennings, that this quarrel was sudden: the first challenge you find came upon the part of the deceased, Smith, though that indeed is not absolutely material, in order to distinguish whether it does or does not amount in law to murder; for upon which ever side the challenge or provocation comes, if they fight in the heat of passion, and upon equal terms as to weapons, in that case it is not material in point of law from which side the provocation comes; but the law looks upon it in that case to be no more than manslaughter; but it is still a circumstance more favourable for the prisoner; when the challenge comes upon the other side; the quarrel arose in this case, from the deceased teazing the prisoner, not the prisoner teazing the deceased; they were both a little in liquor, though to be sure the law does not allow that as an excuse; the deceased upon that gave him a challenge to fight him; you find this was so sudden and so instantaneous, that Jennings happening at that time to be at the other side of the room speaking to Sheepcut; he tells you he was not there above a minute, while he was talking to him the challenge was given; the deceased, Hunt, and the two others went out of the room, and went up stairs; and so short a time was it about, that he did not so much as hear the challenge given, or so much as know what they were gone about; therefore, that shews that they did immediately go up stairs upon the quarrel to decide it, and that with such weapons as they had then about them, for they were both furnished with swords: now the only circumstance I ever entertained any doubt about was afterwards cleared up; I thought from the evidence of Carrick at first, that Smith at the time this wound was given, was off his guard; for he said his sword was pointed towards the ground; but afterwards he explained that, he said his arm was then in a right line from his body; and that the sword happening to be a little bent, gave it the appearance of an inclination downwards; but, in fact, he was then on his guard: it does appear to me, from all the circumstances, to be nothing more than the crime of manslaughter; there is not that deliberate malice which is necessary to constitute the crime of murder; therefore you will find him guilty of manslaughter only; and, I think, you cannot find him guilty of more: this is only as to the case of Hunt; as to the case of Porter, to be sure where a man is present, and in any respect aiding and assisting to a murder, that makes him what the law calls a principal in the second degree, and if murder does happen in consequence of it, if the principal is guilty of murder, a person so present, aiding, and assisting, will, in the eye of the law, be likewise guilty of murder; but if the principal is not guilty of murder, then the other of course cannot be guilty; and if you should be of opinion to find Hunt guilty of manslaughter, as there cannot be an accessary in that, you will then acquit Porter.</p>

               <p>I went to the summer-house; I saw the prisoners there.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else? - No: when I got over the back pails into the garden, I peeped through the window and saw them in the summer-house; Minion was sitting by the fireside; Harris had a pair of scissors and some metal in his hand, which he was clipping; then I immediately burst the door open upon them; Harris directly presented a blunderbuss to me, I drew back directly; then he came into the garden, and Minion after him; Minion hit me with a garden rake; we had a fight, he knocked me down with it; then Harris threw away the blunderbuss, and went over the pails; after Harris was gone over the pails, Minion and I had a fight for two or three minutes together, he had a garden rake in his hands; he got away from me and run over the pails, and I after him; and I never lost sight of him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice what there was in the summer-house? - I did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. You say you saw Harris with an instrument in his hands; a pair of scissors or a pair of shears? - A pair of scissors; he was clipping the metal.</p>
               <p>In what form? - In long slips rather more than an inch wide.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>What is your employment? - An officer in Whitechapel court.</p>
               <p>Are you in any other office? - No other duty but that.</p>

               <p>What may that office be? - To arrest people for forty shillings, and under 5 l.</p>
               <p>I understand you attend some justice's office besides? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you execute warrants sometimes? - No; but if I hear of any coiners, I go after them, if it is fifty miles, to take them.</p>
               <p>Then you have an enmity to coiners? - I have suffered a good deal by them myself.</p>
               <p>Who gave you information to go after these men? - Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Was there any thoroughfare to this summer-house? - None at all; it stands at one corner of a wall; there is a gate forwards and another backwards.</p>
               <p>How did you get to the summer-house? - I got over the pails; that was the only way I could go to them that they should not see me.</p>
               <p>There was another way to them? - A gate opposite the summer-house and a path: they would have seen me if I had gone that way.</p>
               <p>Which window was it you looked into? - The window forward; it was the height of my breast.</p>
               <p>Were there two windows or only one to that room? - The door is in the middle, there is a window on each side.</p>
               <p>Do these windows front the path of the first gate? - Yes; the windows were open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090057"/> above, but there was a half blind where Harris was at work, but I could see over that.</p>
               <p>That blind was put to prevent people seeing, but it did not prevent them? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the blind or window was not above your breast? - It might be a little higher; I looked in for a minute or a minute and half.</p>
               <p>Then nobody saw you? - Not till I made a push.</p>
               <p>Nobody was upon the watch to see if any one looked in? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there a pathway any one might walk in and a gate? - Yes, but it was locked and had iron spikes upon it.</p>
               <p>Could they have come back along that path without getting upon the gate? - There are two gates to the summer-house, one before and one behind; the gates were both locked.</p>
               <p>How came you to know that the fore gate was locked? - I tried and found it was fastened before I got in the back way.</p>
               <p>If that gate had been open you would have gone in that way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And if you had gone in at that gate you would have gone fronting the summer-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I went to this summer-house on Friday the 15th of December with Gregory; I was on the outside the pails while he went over into the garden; I waited at the back of the summer-house about a minute and a half; he beckoned to me, I went over the pails; when I came to the summer-house, I saw the two prisoners come out; Harris had a blunderbuss; there were six or eight slugs in it; when he came out he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your body," or some such thing,</p>
               <p>"if you come near me,</p>
               <p>"I will blow your brains out," and he waved it about with his hands; Minion came out after Harris with a rake in his hand; we were in the garden the space of a minute; Harris attempted to jump over the front pails: he hung by some spikes that were there and tore his breeches and his hand; the spikes or long nails were about an inch and half long in the front pails, and Mr. Cooper and

(The witness produced the several articles.)</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Mr. Clarke, explain to the Court and Jury the use of the several things that are here produced.</p>
               <p>This is a flask in which any metal is cast, it is just in the state as when, first made; the shillings that now lie upon the sand are good shillings laid for the purpose of making impressions: here is a channel made of sand, and through that the impressions are fed by the metal; the flask casts about fifty shillings at a time.</p>
               <p>Does it appear to you that this bad money that is produced was cast in that flask? - First, here is the spray, as the founders call it, what they make the channel from, then here is the exact form in the base metal, which is what remains after those moulds have been filled up; here is a good shilling now lying in the flask, and here is a counterfeit which has been cast from it; there are in this parcel several counterfeit shillings resembling the good shillings in the flask; this is a crucible, there is metal now in it, it appears to be a mixture of silver and copper, by aqua fortis and water, they are purged, and the silver comes upon the surface; the counterfeit shillings want rubbing and filing to clean them, to make them represent shillings; and it appears that these counterfeit shillings have been cut off by scissors; there is sand paper here that is used to fine and clean them: when the moulds are made and the shillings turned out, the flasks are secured together in the screw press, which keeps, them firm, and of an exact thickness.</p>

I lost four of them; they introduced the thing by cutting of cards.</p>
               <p>How did they get the notes from you? - The 10 l. and 15 l. notes, Jones came up to me and griped my thigh in such a terrible manner, that I thought he would twist it off, and they forced the notes out of my hand: after I had been concerned with them at cards two or three times, I thought they were bad men, and wanted to be clear of them; I said I would not be concerned with them; Jones said I had two bank notes in my pocket, and desired me to pull them out, I did; they said I should be concerned again, and made me put them down on the table; Jones took them out of my hand and put them on the table against my consent, and they forced me to cut the cards; as soon as I had cut the cards, Gratrix took up the notes and cards, and ran away with them, and Jones followed him.</p>
               <p>What money was laid down besides yours? - They laid down their money.</p>
               <p>Were the notes taken from you with your consent or not? - Not the last to the amount of 25 l. were not.</p>
               <p>How came you to take them out of your pocket? - I hardly know what I did.</p>
               <p>How much money did they get from you in all? - 49 l. 4 s.</p>
               <p>Did you part with the last notes by your own consent, or were they taken from you? - After I took them out of my pocket I was all in a flurry, I hardly knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Did they take away the notes with your consent or not? - The last two without my consent.</p>
               <p>I want to know how it was to be determined by the cutting? - If I cut a higher card than a five, then the party concerned with me was to win, if under five, Gratrix was to win.</p>
               <p>Did you draw a higher or a lower card? - A lower.</p>
               <p>Did you cut for the 10 l. and 15 l. notes? - Yes; after they were forced down on the table.</p>
               <p>Tell us how the notes were forced from you? - By Jones forcing them out of my hands and putting them on the table; I had my hand with the notes in it in my pocket, he persuaded me to pull my hand out, and then he took hold of my hand, and forced them out of it, and put them down on the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you shall cut the cards."</p>
               <p>Where were the notes when you cut the cards? - On the table; as soon as I cut the cards Gratrix took up the notes and cards, and ran out, and Jones followed him.</p>
               <p>How did they get them out of your pocket? - He persuaded and hurried me.</p>
               <p>How did he get them out of your hand; did you hold them fast? - I did not hold them so fast as to tear them.</p>

             brought me a pair of buckles, he asked me eighteen shillings upon them, I put them into the scale and weighed them; they weighed about four ounces; I said they were old-fashioned buckles and only fit to cut to pieces, I could not lend more than sixteen shillings upon them; I looked at the stamp, it appeared very perfect, and by that stamp I thought they were silver; I have been twenty years and upwards in the business, I did not doubt in the least that it was the proper stamp of the company.</p>

               <p>I keep a public house in Fleet-street: the prisoner used my house about three weeks before this affair happened; I understood he had been offering to pawn a pair of these buckles, and was stopped; Moore came into my house afterwards, and said,</p>

               <p>Did he say to whom he had given these buckles to pawn? - To Trotman; when I found Trotman was tried for this last sessions, I thought it my duty as an honest man to send for a constable, and charge the prisoner, which I did; he was examined next day before alderman Plumbe.</p>
               <p>Did you see this mark upon the buckles? - I did: I should really have thought them a pair of silver buckles, and that it was the hall mark; he said,</p>
               <p>"I go of a night, sometimes I flap my</p>
               <p>"hat and sometimes cock it; sometimes I wear</p>
