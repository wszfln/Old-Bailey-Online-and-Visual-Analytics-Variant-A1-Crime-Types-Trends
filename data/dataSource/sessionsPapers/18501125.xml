                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-place, Brompton, and am in the employ of the British Museum. On 6th Nov., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come into the saloon—I watched him, and saw something projecting from his pocket behind—he passed from the saloon to the new gallery, and put his hand behind him and looked up at the ceiling, which caused the impression to be more perfect, and I saw the appearance of an inkstand through the cloth of the coat—I spoke to Hayes, a fellow-servant, the prisoner was near enough to hear what I said—I told Hayes to watch him, and not to allow him to put anything away, as I was going for a policeman—as I was going away the prisoner said something about an inkstand, and he said, "Where is Mr. Ling<lb/>ard"—we took the prisoner into a side-room, and he told the policeman he had no pockets—this is the inkstand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it was taken from</p>

Shelver told me he believed the prisoner had an inkstand in his pocket, and recommended me to see that he did not make away with it while he went for a policeman—it was said loud enough for the prisoner to hear—I went to the prisoner, and saw something projecting from his pocket—he took out this inkstand, and asked me if my name was Lin<lb/>gard—I said, "No, where did you get that inkstand?"—he said he found it in some bye-place—it has the mark of the British Museum on it, and Mr. Lingard's name—the prisoner said at the station that he found it in a bye-place, and then that he found it on a stool or seat on the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff to John White Cator, of West Lodge, Enfield. On Thursday, 24th Oct., he had a hundred ewes, and one ram in a field—I counted them between seven and eight o'clock that morning; and again on Saturday morning about seven, when there was one missing— I searched and found the skin and entrails, and two unborn lambs in a ditch—it was fresh killed, and was skinned very neatly—the sheep were all marked with a round hole, and an "M" in it, and a dot on the right shoulder—I gave the skin to the police-sergeant—on Friday, 1st Nov., I went with Watkins to Mr. Goodson's, who sent Stafford to us—Watkins asked him what he knew about the sheep which was lost from Mr. Cator's—he at first said he knew nothing about it—the policeman said, "Yes; you do, you have heard something about it"—he said no he did not, for a minute; and then said, "About a month ago I went into a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi> to have a pint of beer, and heard three or four railroad-men say there were some very good sheep on West Lodge, and he thought there would be some of them lost this winter"—the policeman asked him if he would allow him to search his house—he said, "Yes"—Mr. Pennyfather who was there said, "Stafford, just go and put my horse into the cart before you go"—he said "Yes," and went to do so—in a few minutes I went out, and could not find him—I and the policeman ran as fast as we could to his cottage—it was between nine and ten in the forenoon—Wakins asked the female prisoner whether Stafford had been in—she said no; he had not—he said, "Are you sure of it?"—she said, "I am,</p>

               <p>—he has not been in here since he went out in the morning"—Watkins told her to dress herself, for they wanted to look into the house after some mutton which was lost from Mr. Gator's—she said she thought if we went over the other side of the hedge we should find something in the field—Watkins stepped out on the threshhold, and she tried to close the door against him, but he got in, and we searched the house—there were some mutton bones on the table—he asked her where she bought her mutton—she said at a butcher's at Enfield—in a room up-stairs I found one leg of mutton, one shoulder, one neck, one breast, and two pots of suet tied down—the bones on the table were from the neck, and I think the shoulder—Mrs. Stafford said a blackberry-man from London, named Sam, brought them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. On 2nd Nov. I examined four joints of mutton at the station, and the skin of a ewe—I could not judge whether the joints belonged to the skin, they were so dirty, and had been cut up while the mutton was hot, but a portion of the udder was left on the joint, and a portion was deficient on the skin, but they were very dirty and I could not match them.</p>

On that Saturday evening I was in Mr. Rayraent's—I saw two shillings and some halfpence brought into the parlour—I bit one of the shillings, and found it was bad—I afterwards saw Watson outside the bar, and Mr. Rayment was inside, and he was holding Watson by the collar—I then received another bad shilling from him—I kept them both in my hand, and gave them to the policeman—I bit the first shilling, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it down on the table—the boy took it back.</p>

On 16th Nov., I was on duty in Lower Thames-street—I saw the three prisoners in company near Darkhouse-lane, about six o'clock—they stood talking two or three minutes—that is about a hundred yards from the public-house—I am quite sure Clayton was the woman—soon afterwards I was called to the White Hart—I found Clayton there, and she was taken into custody—she had this mug in her hand—I asked where she lived—she said, "The second turning up Botolph-lane"—I asked her the number—she said she could not tell—I said, "We will go and see the number"—she then said, "I don't live there"—I observed that the mug was cracked—I asked her again where she lived, and she said, "In Back Church-lane"—I said, "This is a long way to come for beer?"—she said, "I was out, and I bought this mug this evening to take the beer home"—I said, "You were unfortunate to break it the first evening?"—she said, "Yes, I broke it against a post"—I noticed that the crack was an old one.</p>

I was at Lampton, in the parish of Heston—about ten minutes to eight o'clock I saw a fire towards Hounslow—I went, and found a rick burning in Mr. Doubleday's brickfield—just as I got there I met Mary Ann Bowles—I received information, and went with sergeant Scotney, about half-past ten at night, to Lampton, where the prisoners lived near each other—we took them to the brickfield, took their shoes with us, and made impressions by the side of some foot-marks there—they corresponded in size, nails, and tips—these are the shoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the nails agreed in the difference between the rows—I did not count them—we compared a great many marks of two persons coming and two going away—we traced them right up to the hedge against which the rick was built—they came from the Lampton-road to the middle of the field, and then one went one way and one the other—there were marks from the road to the rick, and from the rick to the road again of two pairs of shoes—a bonfire was burning in that field when I got there; it was 150 yards or more from the straw rick—it did not make a great deal of light—it was made of wood and brushwood—there was no effigy or Guy Fawkes—there was a little wind, but not much—it blew from the rick to the bonfire, or partly so—a good many persons were round the bonfire when I got there, and a good many had got up to the rick, which was nearly all on fire, it was so dry—the side next to the bonfire was the least burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the accountant of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway Company. I produce the cash-book of the Company—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I have looked through the cash-book—it was usually kept by the prisoner, I should say solely, from the time I took up the books of the Company—I find here an entry, in his hand<lb/>writing, of 17th Jan., 1848, of a payment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to a shareholder of the name of John Duncaft—I find by the examination of the books that Duncaft was entitled to interest at that time—interest warrants are first arranged alphabetically, according to the persons entitled to them; they are subsequently numbered consecutively, but the numbers never appear in the cash-book—this entry indicates that an interest warrant has been issued to a party who was entitled to it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is Duncaft's interest warrant, paid by the bankers—it is No. 29—there is an entry in the cash-book, on 12th Feb., of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to John Duncaft—this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), issued to Wingate, is the warrant applicable to that payment, paid by the bankers, and cancelled by them—(<hi rend="italic">this was numbered "113," and was for the payment of 4l. 9s. 10d. interest on the deposits on calls from 1st July, 1847, to 1st Dec.; the receipt was, "12th Feb., 1848.

I find an entry in the cash-book, in the prisoner's handwriting, of another sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid to Wingate; that is for interest upon calls from 1st July, 1847, to 1st Dec, in the first year; and it would be payable at the beginning of the following year—there could not have been two dividends payable to Wingate between 1st June and 1st Dec, 1847; nor could there have been two interest warrants issued to Duncaft or Wingate for the same time—the entry in the cash-book of the first warrant to Duncaft corresponds with the warrant—the entry of the second, on 12th Feb., applies to Wingate, and is entered in the cash-book to Duncaft—the cash-book is made up from the pass-book, it should be a fac-simile of the pass-book—the pass-book would pass through the pri<lb/>soner's hand—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the pass-book</hi>)I find here an entry, on 17th Jan., 1848, of the payment by the bankers of Mr. Duncaft's interest—the entry is, "Jan. 17th, Duncaft, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—on 12th Feb. there is an entry of "No. 113, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—on 16th there is an entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as paid to Geo.

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> If an entry was made of a number in the pass-book, the prisoner would know to whose name to enter it by reference to a document that would be made at the time the interest warrants were issued, where be would see that 113 was a warrant issued in the name of George H. Wingate—when the bankers' pass-book is made up, the warrants are returned to the office, and would be in the hands of the clerks in the office when making up the cash-book—it is their business to do it from what is called cancelled vouchers, and the cash-book is checked by those cancelled vouchers—in the many pass-books that have come into my hands, I have found it almost invariably the case that they add up the amounts from time to time—(<hi rend="italic">it was stated that the pass-book was balanced up to 20th Feb</hi>).—I should say that the warrant for Duncaft's interest for 17th Jan. is signed by Mr. Meyer, the secretary, as far as I am able to judge from having seen a great deal of his writing—from the character of the writing, I should say it was filled up by the prisoner—the name "John Duncaft," and the "No. 29," and also the figures—the body of the receipt, I should say from the general character of the writing, is made up by John Duncaft, the person to whom the warrant is payable—that is what I understood to be the practice at that time—I do not know Duncaft—it is not the prisoner's writing—I believe the body of the receipt of 12th Feb. to be in the prisoner's handwriting—that purports to be signed by Meyer—I should say the date "12th Feb." is in the prisoner's writing—the word "five" is very much like his, and the "8" in 1848—part of this is printed, and part is written—I have my doubts about the signature, I cannot speak positively about it, from its general character, I should say it was his; I should be sorry to swear positively it was his—I have no doubt as to my opinion—my opinion is that it is the prisoner's signature—I believe the body of the warrant of the 18th Feb. to be in the prisoner's writing—it purports to be signed by Meyer, the secretary—the written part of the body of the receipt I believe to be the prisoner's writing: I speak more positively of that than the other, from the general character of his writing which 1 have met with—I think the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is his, and the signature also.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see him write, and see what he had written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did on the occasion I have spoken to, at the latter end of June, when he was making out this interest calculation—I saw what he had written at that time—I cannot cull to mind any other time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you formed your judgment on what you saw on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And from what I have seen him sign—I have seen his name signed in a letter-book</p>

               <p>—I have not seen him sign it—I have formed my judgment of his writing from comparison—I have gathered that that which I have com<lb/>pared, was his writing from knowing that he used to make up the cash-book—I understood from Mr. Meyer that it was the prisoner's duty to make up the cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pay such attention at the rime you once saw him write, so as to form in your own mind a notion of his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did; it was a list of names that I then saw him write—it was under the letter "D," I think.</p>

               <p>it was not his province to do so—I was aware the man was very ill—I have no recollection of the prisoner saying to Mr. Roy that it would be attended with danger to his life if I took him—he mentioned casually to me that the man was very ill, and he thought it was a long journey for him—he died the day after he arrived at Edinburgh, before he could be examined—I never heard the prisoner tell Mr. Roy that he would charge him with having killed him, or anything of the kind—I know nothing of any directions given by Mr. Roy with reference to the income-tax—I do not know whether the income-tax is deducted in the interest warrants—I have not heard any conversation between the prisoner and Mr. Roy on the subject of the income-tax—I do not know that the prisoner charged Mr. Roy with having made false entries in the books, and appropriated considerable sums of money to own purposes—I'never heard that he made such a charge formally to Lord Lonsdale—I have never heard that from Mr. Roy, or anything of the kind—the prisoner told me that he had written a letter to Lord Lonsdale—what the exact statement was, I cannot say—it was not about the appropriation of moneys or the falsifica<lb/>tion of books; it was complaining of his being discharged—there was something said about the reasons for that, but not about falsification—there was something about the income-tax—the prisoner left I think in July, which was about three months after writing the letter—I did not see the letter—the prisoner produced a copy to me, and said he had written it to Lord Lonsdale—I do not know that an inquiry was instituted into Mr. Roy's conduct—when the prisoner was told by Mr. Roy to take the book to the secretary, I have no recollection of his saying, "O, then that is the reason why there is always a blank between the name of the chair<lb/>man and the last minute"—I believe he was perfectly aware of the reason for its being put in, and everything about it, as well as Mr. Roy—he made no remark to that effect, to my knowledge—he might, I do not recollect it—I did not hear him demur to going with the book—he took it.</p>

               <p>Feb., is the prisoner's writing, and the receipt I believe to be his writing—the signature, George H.

I should say distinctly is—it looks like it—it is his style of handwriting, decidedly; the top part is, but the bottom is certainly not, to the best of my knowledge—the top part of the warrant of 18th Feb. is like his writing—I could not exactly swear it, hut I should say it looks decidedly his style of writing—to the best of my belief, the bottom part is not the signature—I do not see that the filling-up of the receipt resembles his—it is a little stiffer than the other—it is decidedly not his style of writing, but the signature I should say decidedly was not his writing—I speak with confidence to the filling up of the receipt not being his—I do not speak so confidently to that as to the signature, because there is a little more firmness in the handwriting; that is the only difference—the signature is clearly not his writing; I say that from knowing his writing, by corresponding with him, and so on—I had had a letter from him perhaps about twelve months before this—I used to go now and then to see him at the Whitehaven and Furness Railway Company's, while he was clerk there, and I have frequently stood over him while he was writing—I cannot say whether the writing to these receipts appears feigned or not; that is rather difficult to say—I have been to see the prisoner while he lodged at Naylor's—I did not come here with Naylor to-day—I do not think the capital "H" in this signature to the receipt is like his writing—it is unlike it; it is not his style; his "H" is a stiffer one—I do not see any similarity between that "H" and his—this cash-book I should say decidedly is his writing, and you see there is the difference of the stiffness and style of writing—this entry of Duncaft's on 17th Jan. looks like his; it is the same style of writing—I think the entry of 12th Feb. is like his—I do not see any peculiarity in the figure 5 there—the figures 5 in the warrants I should say are not the same as that—I see several 5's in this page of the cash-book where the top part is not exactly touching—the figures 5 in the corner of the warrants are entirely different, one being so carefully written, and the other in so different a style.</p>

I have frequently met him within the last twelve months, and I have seen writing of his within the last twelve months, something between six and twelve times—to the best of my belief, the body of the receipt of 18th Feb. is not in the prisoner's writing—I should say it is not at all like his writing—the 5 is not as he makes his 5—according to my knowledge of his writing, the signature "Geo. H. Wingate" is not his—he does not make his "H" in that way—I have not paid particular attention to the formation of his letters, but certainly this does not appear to me like his writing—the upper part is the prisoner's writing—the "H" in "Geo. H. Wingate" there is as he usually writes, but not the other—if he wrote a letter to me, it would be written in the style of the upper part—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper handed to him by Mr. Parnell, folded down</hi>) to the best of my belief, this is not his writing—(<hi rend="italic">opening it</hi>) I should still say it is not his, neither the filling up nor the signature—the body of the receipt of 12th Feb. is decidedly not his writing—it appears to be the same handwriting as the body of the warrant—I should say the receipts to both warrants appear to be in a feigned hand—there is a distinction between the handwriting on that of the 18th and that of the 12th—one appears to me not written in the same hand as the other—if there is any likeness at all to his, it is in that of the 18th, but I do not consider there is any at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Well-street, in the parish of St. John, Hackney. On 30th Oct. I had an outside flap-door, leading to my cellar from the street, open till half-past nine or ten o'clock at night—it had been open the whole day and evening—I went to bed about half-past ten; my shop and premises were all safe—there is a trap-door lead<lb/>ing from my cellar to the shop; that was shut down, but there is no fastening to it—my canisters and different things were safe in their places in the shop when I went to bed—I came down about a quarter-past six in the morning, and found a canister near the flap in the shop, and eight other canisters in the room adjoining the shop which had all been emptied—I also missed about three pounds of tobacco from the jars in the shop—about half a dozen pounds of sugar, three pairs of scales, and a table-cloth—there is a back-door leading to an outhouse, and another door from the outhouse to the yard; those doors were both bolted when I went to bed, and I found them both unbolted in the morning—that would enable a person to get away from my premises—a person could not get into my premises by the trap-door leading from the street to the cellar, after it was shut, because it was bolted inside—a person could have got in while it was open and secreted himself in the cellar, which is very large, there might have been half a dozen persons concealed in it—a person secreted in the cellar could get into the shop through the trap-door—it was merely shut down—the prisoner was in my service about a year and a half ago, and was acquainted with my premises.</p>

I know Mary Bowling by her coming to our house after her brother James Bowling—I have seen Martin, but do not know him—on 16th Oct., in the evening, Mary and James Bowling came to our house to say James would not come to work in the morning—he has been in the habit of working for my husband—they were in liquor—they went away, returned almost directly, and Mary gave me a brooch, a thimble, and a sovereign, to take care of for her—her brother was there, but I cannot say whether he saw her—I afterwards delivered the brooch and thimble to Finnis—these are them—( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the following Saturday Mary and her brother called on me, about ten o'clock in the morning—Mary said she came for the sovereign, she had been locked up, had been fined 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had pawned some things, and wanted the sovereign to get them out again—I offered her the other things; she said she did not want to have them—she left them, and took the sovereign—the prisoner James did not come to work the next day.</p>

In consequence of information, on 19th Oct., about five o'clock, I went with Jarvis to the King's Arms, Brook-street, Ratcliffe—I found Mary and James Bowling and a sailor there—I told Mary I wanted her for robbing Mr. Tomkins, of Leadenhall-street —she said she knew nothing about Tomkins, I must bring him to her, she would not go—we then took her into custody by force, (she made great resistance,) and took her to the station, where I saw Jarvis find 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this bunch of keys(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)on her, one of which fits a chest of drawers in Mr. Tomkins' bedroom—I went in the evening with Mr. Tomkins to No. 3, Compass-court, the prisoners were not there then—we went again on the Sunday-morning, at half-past one, and I took the three other prisoners into custody, and also Ann Mahony, who has been dis<lb/>charged—I asked them if they knew anything of a box belonging to Mary Bowling—they said, "No"—I then searched the house, and found these ornaments and trinkets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the top of a hamper on the ground-floor</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Fiskin, of 4, Wood-street, Cheapside, lace-merchant. On the night of 19th Oct., I went to Pearce, Allan's, and Stone's, Waterloo-house, with a parcel of lace—the house was shut up, and as I returned I met Williams, who said, "It is a nice even<lb/>ing"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he asked me to go of an errand for him—I said no, I had a parcel—he said well that would not matter, if I would go he would give me sixpence or a shilling—I did not know him before—I said I would go, to oblige him—we were then going up St. Martin's-lane, and he said he would wait at the Star and Garter—I went in with him there, and he said, "Go to that stationer's in St. Martin's-court, and ask for Mr. James, he owes me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he is my brother; if you take the parcel, there may be a dispute"—I was going to leave it with the girl at the bar, and he said, "We need not trouble her," and I left the parcel with him—I returned shortly after—he was gone, and the lace also.</p>

On Saturday, 26th Oct., I met Furzman in Drury-lane, and told her I was about to take her into custody for being concerned in stealing some lace, which had been pledged at a pawnbroker's in Lambeth—she had a basket in her hand, and told me where she lived—I took her to the station, examined the basket, and found it contained 200 pieces of lace—I asked her where she got it from—she said from Mrs. Ryan, her landlady, No. 6, Queen's-place, Great Queen-street—I went there, saw Ryan, told her what Furzman said, and she said she gave the lace to Mrs. Furzman, to dispose of it in the best way she could—I searched Furzman's room, which Mrs. Ryan pointed out, and found a piece of lace, and sixty-nine duplicates, one of which relates to lace pledged at Mr. Dicker's, Lambeth-marsh, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Furzman was not then</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer, attached to the Post-office. The prisoner was a clerk in the Inland department—it was part of his duty to sort letters—I received instructions on the morning of 14th Nov., and stationed myself, at a quarter-past seven o'clock, in a place where I had a full view of him—I saw him sorting letters at the Great Western division—he took up a handful of letters, put them into his left hand, and sorted them according to their destinations—he continued doing so till a quarter-past eight, when he shuffled some letters, put his left elbow on the table, and I saw him working some paper, which appeared like a letter, between his three fingers, into the palm of his hand, holding some letters between his fore-finger and thumb—he then got up, and went out of my sight with some letters in his left hand, and one swinging in his right hand—the three fingers of his left hand were closed—I communicated to Forbes—I was soon after called into Mr. Bokenham the president's office, and found the prisoner there—Mr. Bourne, a president, was also there—it was from twenty minutes to half-past eight, directly after this transaction—Mr. Bourne said to the prisoner, "I suspect you have got a letter about you, Mr. Cunnington, and the officer must search you"—he said he was willing to be searched, he had nothing about him—I searched him, but found nothing referring to this charge—I saw some letters lying</p>

               <p>on a desk opposite, and told Mr. Bourne there was a cash letter among them—the prisoner could hear what I said—Mr. Bourne then examined the letters, and under the last letter was this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the state it is in now, open, but apparently crumpled up—the seal was not broken—I then took the prisoner into custody—the letter was opened before the Magistrate by his direction, and was found to contain one shilling, a six-pence, and a pawnbroker's duplicate—a person handling the letter could feel that there was money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the managers of the General Post-office. On 14th Nov., in the morning, Peak said something to me, and I saw the prisoner passing from the front Inland-office into the tick-room with a few letters between the thumb and finger of his left hand, and some paper in his hand with three fingers closed upon it, and one letter in his right hand—he passed me in the middle of the front office—I went round one of the large tables there, and met him at the tick-room door, to make more sure whether he had anything in his hand—I again saw the letters and paper in his left hand—he went into the tick-room—I made a com<lb/>munication to Mr. Bourne, the president.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the General Post-office. The prisoner has been a clerk in my department about eighteen months—on 14th Nov. I received instructions from Forbes, and went to the tick-room door, and saw the prisoner there talking to Lugsden the tick-clerk—I then returned to the Inland-office, and remained there till the prisoner came out of the tick-room half a minute afterwards with a letter in his right hand, and others in his left, held in the ordinary way of sorting between the finger and thumb—he said he had been to the tick-clerk, or to the tick-room, to ascertain if the letter in his right hand was registered, the word "registered" being written on the top of it; I saw that—I said, "I wish to speak to you, come with me"—he went with me into Mr. Bokenham's office—I took the letter, and was speaking to him about it, till</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250045"/>
               <p>Peak entered the room—he retained the letters in hit left hand—I took them from him, or he gave them to me, I cannot say which—I placed them on the table, about the time Peak came in—I said "I have reason to believe you have a letter secreted about you;" he denied it, and said Peak might search him; he was searched and there was nothing—Peak said, "I am certain he had a letter, and it must be amongst these," pointing to the letters on the table—there were fourteen; I turned them over one by one, this one was the last; the seal was not broken, only this small fold was on it then; the envelope is too big, and is folded over the letter—Peak said, "That is the letter he had in his hand"—it bears the General Post mark of 14th Nov., and the Portsmouth stamp of Nov. 18th —it would be in the Great Western collection, being directed "Mr. Whit<lb/>taker, 28, Charlotte-terrace, Morristown, Devonport, Devon," and would have come into the prisoner's possession that morning, in his lawful employment—it would be his duty to sort it to the Devonport division—if he found a letter with the word "registered" on it, it would be his duty to show it to the officer of our division, who is generally walking about superintending the sorting; and in the event of not finding him, to bring it to me—I should take it to the tick-clerk, to ascertain if it was registered—the prisoner had no right to do that; I was on duty, and he had to pass my desk to go to the tick-room—it was not really a registered letter, or the word "registered" would have been written on it in red ink; inde<lb/>pendent of which it should have had six extra stamps on it—a person conversant with the Post-office would know that it was not a registered letter—it is wrong for a clerk to carry letters from the sorting-place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should yon have gone to Lugsden with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might, but I should have seen that there had been no fee paid on it, and that the postmaster's writing was absent—sometimes they omit the word "registered" and put the stamps, and then the president writes it himself, having ascertained that it is registered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who would put the six stamps on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably the postmaster; there has been a change recently in the registration fee—if the prisoner had brought it to me, or to the senior of the division, they could not have told him positively that it was not registered—we are very particular, and we might have referred to the bill—I should have said, "Go on with your duty"—I should have gone with it to Mr. Lugsden, and brought it back to him if it was not registered, to sort in the ordinary manner—it was quite necessary to make the inquiry, in case the servant of the Post-office bad kept the fee—the prisoner was in the Secretary's-office first—I do not know for how long; clerks are not usually promoted from one department to another—it is most likely I took the letters from the prisoner's hand before they were put on the table—Peak took this letter from me, he did not lay hold of it first—it had the appearance of being doubled in three before Peak touched it, and I told him not to make it worse—the letters were unsorted, and all of the Great Western division.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the General Post-office. On 13th Nov. I was directed to watch the prisoner while he was sorting the letters of the Great Western division—I was in a small room near him—about twenty minutes past eight o'clock he proceeded to sort, and sorted all out of his hand, and rose up from the table with his left hand closed, and went over to a table a yard or two behind, and spoke to a clerk there—I went close by him, and saw him pressing heavily with his right hand upon his left, which was on the table—shortly after he went across the two offices, and went in a direction towards the water-closets, I noticed that his left-hand was closed—I went into the adjoining closet—I could see from one to the other very well—I saw him sit down, take a letter with a red seal from his left coat pocket, open it, take it out of the envelope, take some<lb/>thing out of the letter, I could not see what, and put it in his right hand—he then read the letter for a minute or so—I could distinctly see the letter, and I read the words, "Rochester, Nov. 12, My dear father,"—after he had looked at it, he tore it in four pieces, and put it down the pan behind him—it is an open seat; the pressure of the person on it causes the pump to act, and the letter would go down into the trap—a person named Russell was with me—on seeing this I made a communica<lb/>tion to him—I remained there till Blackburn the plumber came—no per<lb/>son had entered the water-closet before he came—he examined the closet on which the prisoner had sat, and I saw him take out these four pieces of paper, and the envelope which bears the postmark, "Rochester, Nov. 12."</p>

I was in the Ship public-house on this evening, and saw Arnold there—he was behaving very improperly indeed—the prisoner came in—Arnold began using bad language, and the prisoner wished him to go out, and said if he did not he should turn him out—he went into the tap-room and had some beer—he came out again, took hold of him and shook him, and put him out of the door by his left arm—I think they were both drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the workhouse of the East London Union. On the evening of 4th Nov., about seven o'clock, the prisoner and another man knocked at the workhouse door, and asked for a night's lodging and relief—I told them I had got no relief for able-bodied paupers—I then shut the door—they knocked again within five minutes, and asked if I meant to give them a night's lodging—they then asked me to give them some bread—I told them I could give them no bread, unless I gave it out of my own pocket—they said, "Then keep it and be b——d,</p>

               <p>and if you don't let us in we will break your windows"—I desired them to go away—they refused—I shut the door—in about two minutes some one came and told me they were attempting to break the windows—I went out and told them to quit the yard—they refused—I said I must remove them by force unless they went quietly—they still refused—I then laid hold of the prisoner, and attempted to eject him, and put him down the yard—he resisted—I got him into the passage—he then struck me several times, as I thought with his fist on my side—after I got lower down the passage I found the blood trickling down my drawers—I called out for help, and Dawson, the other porter, came up, and I then fainted—I was confined to my bed for several days—I am sure it was the prisoner that stabbed me—I was not struggling at all with his companion.</p>

I was called to see Clift on the Monday evening—he was bleeding from three wounds; two under the left arm, and a third in the left hand—they were stab-wounds, about half an inch deep, and an inch and a half broad—this knife would produce such wounds—if the knife had been sharp, no doubt he would have been killed—it is very blunt, and could not hurt him very much.</p>

I went to the spice warehouse on 6th Nov.—I found the prisoner detained by Madge in the gangway—I asked what he was—he said he was a lighterman, and he was come to look for his mate, and they were come for some pepper—I told him lightermen had no business there, and he, knew it—he said he came to look for his mate—I took him in the constables' room and searched him—I found some pepper in his left-hand jacket pocket, and some was inside his shirt—I asked him where he got it, and he told me it was the sweeping of a barge—I told him he was in custody, and I asked him what barge—he said one of Mr. Gunner's—I asked him where she was; he said at the West Quay—I asked him to go and show me the barge—he said it was no use, he did not know where she was—I then went into the warehouse, and saw a bag of black pepper cut, and good part of it had run out—I took a sample of it, and it corresponded exactly with what I found on the prisoner—the bag appeared to have been fresh cut—I then went in the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Hotel de 1' Europe, 15 and 16, Leicester-place. The prisoner was in my employ up to 19th Nov., when he left, having given me notice on the 12th—he asked me if I would allow him to leave his box for a few days, and I did so—on 22nd Nov. I met him in Leicester-street, with three men, and I said I was sorry to see him in such company, and desired him to come and fetch his box at once—he followed me with his companions to the house, and the waiter brought up the box, when my wife, in the whole presence, said, "Stop that box; I have reason to suspect this man, I will have it searched"—the prisoner objected to that, and called help from his friends, and placed the box off the premises, and said, "It is out now," and struggled to get it away—I helped to pull it inside, and his friends said the best thing he could do was to call, "Police!" and "Murder!"—the police were called, and arrived—the box was then in our possession, inside the bar, and the police</p>

               <p>shut the door immediately, and the prisoner was shut out—the policeman asked me what was the matter—the prisoner was let in, and I said I wished to have the box searched—the policeman said, "you can find no objection to your master's searching your box; if you know it is all right, why should you object?"—he said, "I do not wish it to be searched here, it must be searched in a proper place"—I did not know what he meant, and said, "You had better have it searched quietly; why should you object?" he said, "My character"—I said his character would be as good as it was before, if everything was right; he had better have it searched, it would not go further: and after a little conversation, he acceded to it—he was asked for the keys, and said, "I have not got them"—I said, "Where are they?" and he said, "I will go and fetch them"—he went out of the house, and in a few minutes came back without them—he then went out again, and came back with them—he uncorded and unlocked the box—he pulled out a coat, and under it lay a cruet-stand of mine—he said, "Halloo! who puts this here"—I said it was better known to him, and said I would not drop the matter, he must go to the station; and told the policeman so—while in my employ, it was his business to clean the plate twice a week—this cruet-stand was not in use then, it was put by for the winter season, because there is not enough business to employ them all.</p>

               <p>old. On Wednesday evening, 6th Nov., about seven o'clock, I was at home, and heard the prisoner speaking outside in the court—I went down after my father—he asked my father if he was one of the party that lived in that house, and then he made himself an answer, and begged his pardon, he was not—as I was coming out of doors, he said, "Here is one;" and he made a blow at me with a knife—I stepped back, and escaped—my father took hold of him to stop the blow, and he turned at my father, and struck at him with the hand; the knife was in it—it cut him, and I saw him bleeding from the head and face afterwards—I was not hit—I laid hold of the knife, but could not get it from him; my father did—I got a little bit of skin cut off my thumb, but nothing of any consequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Spring-gardens, in the same court as the prosecutor and prisoner. I am a labourer—on the evening of 6th Nov. I was coming from my door, up the court, and saw the prisoner coming from his own door—he asked me was I one of the party last night—I said, "No"—he said, "Oh. I beg your pardon, you were not"—Spillan then came out of his door, there were a few words between them, and then Spillan's son came out—the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and he attempted to stick young Spillan with it; he escaped, and Spillan caught the prisoner round the neck, I suppose to save his son; and then when I saw the knife going to work, I went back—I heard Spillan cry out, "Murder!" that he was stuck with the knife, and I saw his face and clothes all over blood.</p>

I was called to Spring-gardens, and found the prosecutor bleeding from the face—I went to the prisoner's house, No. 7, and charged him with cutting and wounding Spillan—he said he had done no such thing, that he had been knocked about the head with a stick by the prosecutor's son, and he had witnesses to prove it, at the same time pointing to the stick which he had by the fire-side—I received this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Spillan—there were some clots of blood on the top of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 6th Nov. Spillan was brought to the London Hospital, where I was the house-surgeon—he had five or six small wounds on his face, one on his hand, and one on his thigh, a mere skin-wound—two of those on the face were rather deep, but of no great magnitude—he lost a good deal of blood, the parts being very vascular—such a knife as this would cause the wounds—they were very slight.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 98, New Bond-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On Saturday night, 26th Oct., I left home at half-past eight o'clock—I returned about twenty minutes past two, on the Sunday morning—I went in-doors, with a latch-key, and went up-stairs, to the first-floor landing—there was a light burning, which if usually left for me—on opening the drawing-room door, as I usually do if I am out late, and looking in, I heard something fall on my second-floor, which is over the drawing-room—I immediately called out for my servant, to know if it was her—I had no answer—I then rang the up-stairs bell, and called out, "Thieves! there is a thief in the house!"—I then opened</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250075"/>
               <p>the bedroom door on the first-floor, and immediately heard somebody Walk across my room up-stairs—I then went down to the street door, unbolted and opened it, calling, "Police!"—I kept the door open, and returned four or five steps up-stairs, so that I could see across the staircase, and I immediately saw the prisoner running down from the second-floor to the first-floor—I ran down very fast, thinking he was coming to the door—I shut the door, and kept it shut, calling out, "Police!"—I fancied there were two or three persons in the house by the noise, but I only saw one person—I remained outside the door, calling, "Police!"—the policemen came up, and we went into the house, with my latch-key—there was only my female servant in the house, and her sitter, who had come on a visit to her—when I went into the house with the policemen, I examined the premises—I found the landing window had evidently been opened just before—there was a little catch at the side of the window, and that was up, and the window was a little open—a person inside could lift the little catch up, but not outside—the window looks out on the leads at the back premises, and goes over to a large table-yard which leads into Blenheim-street—a person from that yard can get to Woodstock-street; they adjoin—I then told two policemen to run round the corner, thinking that was the only chance the persons had of escape—the prisoner was then gone—he was brought back shortly after, in custody of the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure he is the person you saw in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite sure—when I saw him in the house the light that I spoke of shone in his face, it was just below him—I did not go so high as the window on the landing when I first went up—a person from that; window could get on the leads, it is level; and from there to Blenheim-street—there was no sign of breaking on that window; but there was another window, about six feet below that, where they could have got in, which was not fastened—that opens on the leads, on a sort of skylight—it leads to the bedroom on the first-floor—I believe that had no fastening—I had not been in that bedroom that evening before I went out—I cannot tell whether the window was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Pembroke-place, Vauxhall-road, and am the accountant and manager of the Pembroke Loan Society, which is held at the Forester's Arms, Vauxhall-bridge-road. On 2nd April I received this application (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for a loan of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months, by John Pennington—he offered as security Mr. Fearns, of 3, Grey Coat-street, Horseferry-road—I made inquiry about Mr. Fearns, and was satis<lb/>fied with his security—I called on him, but did not see him—I called three times, the two first by myself, and the third with a policeman out of uniform—after I had made the inquiry, the prisoner called, and asked if I was satisfied with Mr. Fearns' respectability—I told him yes, but I had not seen him; that if I could get an appointment with Mr. Fearns, and see him sign the promissory-note, he should have the money—I had then called twice on him—two or three days after that the prisoner called at my house, and asked if Fearns had been—I said he had not—he said he expected he would have called as he was going out of town that evening, and had promised to call on me on the way to the railway, he would go and endeavour to meet him, and send him as quickly as possible—he then left, and in about three minutes a person called, said he was Mr. Fearns, and signed the note, "James Fearns," in my presence—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I wrote it out, and he signed it—two or three minutes after that, Pennington came and asked me if Mr. Fearns had been—I told him he had—he asked if he had signed the note; 1 said, "Yes," and he said he supposed he could have the money—I said I should have to go to the treasurer for the money, I was in a hurry then, and I should be ready for him on the following morning—he said he could not come the following morning, and pressed me to let him have it that night—I said if he could not come the following morning, he must say the morning after that—he came that morning—I had made inquiry in the interim, and told him as I had not seen Mr. Fearns at his house, it was considered necessary I should call and see him there, and ask him if he had signed the note, and he had better accompany me—he said "Very well," or something to that effect, and I went there with him—we saw Mrs. Clarke, the servant, and I asked if Mr. Fearns was there—she said, "Yes"—I asked if I could see him; she asked us into the parlour, where we both went and sat down, and she went up to Mr. Fearns with my message, that I wished to see him—I sent my name up—Mr. Fearns sent down word that he would be much obliged if I would send up my business—I then took the note from my pocket and sent it up to Mr. Fearns; I requested the servant to show it, and ask him to send word down whether it was his signature—I think I sent the form up also—she brought word back that it was not his signature; upon which the prisoner said, "If it is not Mr. Fearn's signature, he must have authorised some person to write it"—I sent another message up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250081"/>
               <p>to know whether he had authorised any one, and desired the servant to say what she had heard Pennington say—she brought back word that Mr. Fearns had not authorised any one to call on me, or write his name; it was not his signature, and that Mr. Pennington knew he had refused to become his security—I had the note in my hand then, and I think Pen<lb/>nington looked at it—I told him he could not have the money, and he asked me for the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he had paid in the first instance as inquiry money—I told him he could not have it, and we separated.</p>

I remember at some time at the end of July taking a parcel from Mr. Death's to 34, Coleman-street—I believe it was cards—there was "Campbell" on the door; I cannot recollect the rest—I went day after day—I saw a person I supposed to be a clerk there, not the prisoner—I think I left the parcel; I said, "I have brought the goods from Mr. Death's;" and he said, "You can leave them, if you please"—I did not leave them; I brought them home again—I did not ask for the money the first time I went—I took a bill with me—I brought them away again, because master told me not to leave them without the money—a few days after that I went again with another parcel—I went day after day, three or four days—I did not leave the parcel, because master told me not, till I saw him—at last I saw him, and said, "Please, sir, I have brought the goods from Mr. Death's"—he took them, opened them, and said, "Tell Mr. Death my clerk will call this evening, and give another order, and pay for them"—I opened the bill, and showed it him, and then he said that—I left the goods because he <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> me to do it, and said that his clerk would call and pay—Mr. Campbell said, "You had better take the bill," and I took it back, but neither the goods nor the money—I saw Mr. Campbell write the letter produced—I delivered it to my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The last time I was there, when I left the parcel—I cannot exactly say how many parcels I have left there; it was two or one, not three—I took this order for the goods, which I took this bill for afterwards—I saw Campbell twice—when I said I had not seen Mr. Campbell when I took the parcel, it was not true; it was not the first time that he <hi rend="italic">gammoned</hi> me—he got the goods then, by-saying, "I will give you a little note to take back"—I had not got a receipted bill then—I have been about seven months in Mr. Death's employ—he has not disharged me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brush-manufacturer at 2, Blackman-street, Borough. At the latter end of Oct. a person called on me for a list of prices, which I gave him—he gave me this card, "R. M. Campbell and Co., Chandler's Warehouses, 8, Billiter-street"—my brother called on Campbell and Co. and got this written order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know nothing about it myself—in consequence of that I supplied some goods, made out this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it to my brother to take with the goods and get paid—he did not bring back the goods—there is discount at the bottom of this bill; I sold these goods for cash—I knew nothing of Camp<lb/>bell and Co., selling for cash I never look for a reference—I went the next day to 8, Billiter-street, and found the office closed—I went several times and tried to see Campbell at the office, with "Campbell and Co." on the door—I went, perhaps, four times before I saw him—the office was closed all one day and open the next morning, and I saw a lad there—when I saw Campbell I asked him whether he intended paying for my goods—he said, "No;" and said something about it being a credit transaction—I said it was no such thing, I should either have my money or goods—he said the goods had been sent away—the bill amounts to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my brother has been obliged to go to Cork—I made inquiry, and in consequence of what I ascertained, I went with Fenning to Camp<lb/>bell's place in Billiter-street, and told him I did not wish to have any more trouble about it; I was determined not to be cheated, and if he gave me my money or goods I would have done with it, but if not, I should arrest him—he said he would not let me have either; dared me to do my worst, and said he would turn me out of the office, he was going home—he locked the office up, and I gave him in Fenning's custody for defrauding me—he afterwards showed me the invoice—I afterwards made the charge at the Mansion-house—my brother, Amos John Varian, was there examined, I think—Mr. Goodman took his evidence—after he had been examined Campbell asked him some questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Oxford and Cambridge stores, Oxford-street. On Saturday evening, 9th Oct., between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner was in my parlour; I heard the bell ring, and my servant went in; she came out and made a communication to me—I went in with Carrughi, and saw the prisoner lying on a woman, with his arm on her bosom, and her hand on his thigh—the table had been removed from its proper position in front of them—I put the table in its place, and the prisoner called me a d—d scoundrel, and other filthy words—I said, "I will tell you what it is, if you cannot use better language, the best thing you can do is to drink up your grog and leave the house"—he said, "I will do no such thing; I have paid for what I have had, and I will do what I choose in your house"—I said he must leave the room; he declared he would not leave until he chose, and he should do as he liked in my house—the woman got up, approached me, put her fist in my face, and said, "You b——y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>, I will put you out of the room myself, and punch your head"(I did not know either of them before)—I said, "I see what you are by your language; if you don't behave yourself, I shall certainly put you out of the house"—she repeated the language again; I laid hold of her gently by the sleeve, I neither touched her arm or any part of her; I took her to the door leading to the passage, and desired my man-servant to put her out—I used no violence whatever; if any damage had been done, her dress would have been torn—the prisoner got up stealthily behind me, I neither saw or heard him; the first notice I had was a severe crash on my head with a large glass—he then <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> it into my head, and the third time he threw it at my head, which smashed the glass to atoms; this is the foot of the goblet—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is no vestige of the rest—I was stunned, and nearly overpowered by loss of blood—he was not con<lb/>tent, but when I turned to close with him, he inflicted several severe blows on my head with this stick ( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my clothes were saturated with blood, I could scarcely see—that is the only public parlour I have.</p>

On 9th Nov., in the evening, I went to Mr. White's, and found him about to go into the parlour—I went in with him, and saw a female sitting opposite me, and the prisoner lying down on the bench, with his body lying over the female, and his arm round her neck—Mr. White removed the table towards them—they both said, "What do you remove the table for"—Mr. White said, "it is time you should behave yourselves a little, and the sooner you drink your grog and go about your business so much the better"—the</p>

               <p>prisoner said he had paid for the grog, and they had a right to stop as long as they pleased—Mr. White said, if they stopped there they were to behave more decently—the woman got rather angry at some words which I could not catch particularly—Mr. White said, "Come, I know you, and the sooner you go out of my house the better"—she got up, stamped with her feet wildly, and said, "You say you know me, you b——y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>, I will punch your head, and turn you out"—Mr. White said, "This won't do," took her very gently by the arm, and showed her out of the room—the prisoner was sitting quiet, but all at once he took up a glass nearly full of gin and water, and I could see by the action that he was going to throw it on Mr. White; he got out into the passage, and I heard the splash of water, and blows struck—I went out as quick as I could, and saw the prisoner strike Mr. White on the head with this broken glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), he was bleeding profusely—he then struck him two or three times on the head with a stick—I tried to assist Mr. White, and Cobbett was scuffling to secure the prisoner; a policeman was sent for, and he was given into custody—he appeared sober, but much excited—at the station he said he had not done with Mr. White yet, he would swear his life against him—no one struck the prisoner in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to James Holford, Esq. of Hol<lb/>ford-house, Regent's-park, in the parish of St. Marylebone; he is now in America. On Sunday night, 13th Oct., previous to going to bed, I went round the house, I left it perfectly safe, and went to bed between ten and eleven—I sleep over the banqueting-room—about twenty minutes to two o'clock I heard a noise in the banqueting-room—I got out of bed and listened at the window—I looked out on the lawn, and heard a dog barking, and saw what I thought was the shadow of a man or a tree, I lifted up the sash and it moved—I awoke the footman and groom—I armed myself with a double-barrelled pistol, with a bayonet affixed—I gave a sword to the groom, and a gun loaded with ball, shot, and slugs, to the footman—we all three went down—the sashes of the banqueting-room window do not quite come down to the ground, there is a step about two feet six inches deep—the banqueting-room doors have nine or ten squares of ground glass in them—there are no shutters to them—I could see a light through the doors in the banqueting-room, but could see no one—I went round to the stable, at the west wing, and awoke the two coachmen—I took the gun from the footman and gave it to Thomas Hall, one of the coach<lb/>men, and gave a pitchfork to the other—I sent the coachmen to the south side of the house—I took the north side, at the other end of the banquet<lb/>ing-room, with the others—just as I took my station I heard the report of a gun on the south side—the light had then left that end of the banqueting-room—I went round to the south side, and saw a man running from the direction of the banquetting-room—I followed him—he threw himself under a thorn-bush; I saw it move, and fired at the lower part of the bush—the pistol missed fire, and I heard a voice from the bush say, "Oh don't, for God's sake, don't shoot me"—I could not tell whether there were any more persons in the bush—I fired again—I should expect the shot would have taken effect on the right side of the man's head; I saw his hat and fired a little below it—I then went to the assistance of the other servants, who were crying out very loudly—I there found Dyson in custody—I had passed him before—the police came—I found a candle near the gravel walk, with a piece of paper round it—a portion of one of the vases, which contained flowers in the banqueting-room, was shown to me broken off—there are on the' candelabra some ormolu birds, and also on the vase, and also a cup cover—I saw the window that was examined by Lockerby—it was fastened the night before.</p>

I examined Mahon at the police-court, and found several marks on his right hand, which I consider had been produced by shot—there were three holes inside his right hand—they did not appear recent—my opinion is that they must have been more than a week old; it may be a fortnight—I also found a cut on the left hand, about an inch in extent—a spike of this description might probably have produced it—it did not appear to me that it could have been produced by the bite of a dog.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live in North-street, Manchester-square. I was living with a surgeon in the Haymarket. On the evening of 28th Sept. I was in the Bayswater road, about half-past ten o'clock, with my brother, James Atcheson, and Richard Denny—we were walking slowly down the road, towards Notting-hill—we walked by the railing of Hyde-park—we passed the two prisoners, who were standing still—two or three minutes after we passed, Richard Denny stopped to light his pipe—the two prisoners came rushing up, and Smith snatched the pipe from his mouth—Denny pushed him off and asked what he did that for—before we passed them, we had seen the two prisoners walking arm-in-arm, and pushing one another about, as if they were tipsy—that was on the Bayswater-road—after Smith had snatched at Denny's pipe, the policeman came and separated us—we crossed over and walked a little way—we then crossed over again towards Kensington-gardens—we overtook the two prisoners again in four or five minutes—we did not see them till we got very near them—Cody then said, "Now then, you b——rs, us two will fight you"—Denny said no, he would fight the little one, meaning Smith—Smith then ran and hit Denny in the mouth—there was no other blow given—the policeman came and separated us again—we crossed over, and walked slowly up Albion-street—when we got opposite the mews in Albion-street, the two prisoners rushed out of the mews—they said, "There is the b——r that wants to fight"—on that Smith came over and struck Denny in the mouth, and Cody knocked him down—Smith began to kick him on the face and ribs—I ran up and said, "You coward, to kick him like that when he is down"—he said if I did not go off he would serve me the same—my brother and Ateheson went up the street, and Cody was following them up—my brother is younger than I am—I was left alone with Denny—Smith ran towards the others—Denny was lying senseless—I tried to lift him up, but could not—both the prisoners came running back, and as they came across the road I heard Smith say, "Now I will stab half the b—rs"—they came up where I was assisting Denny, and Cody gave me a blow across the eyes—I directly put up my hands before my eyes, and then directly I felt a hard blow in my groin—I felt a shooting pain, and in less than half a minute I felt the blood running down my legs—I cried out that I was stabbed—I reached a step of a door and sat down—I felt faint—a gentleman came to me, and I was carried to Mr. Morgan's surgery in Albion-place—I had my wound dressed, and I was carried in a cab to the Middlesex Hospital—I had no knife in my hand during that evening—I did not see a knife with either of our party.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eighteen years of age—I am learning the business of a coach-painter—on the night of 28th Sept. I was in the Bayswater road, in company with Edward Batchelor and several others—I think there were five beside myself—Atcheson and Peacock were as big as myself—we were taking a walk—while we were walking along, we saw the prisoners walking arm-in-arm, and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>, and shoving each other about, imitating drunken men—we passed them for about two or three minutes, and then we heard them running after us; and Smith tried to snatch the pipe from my mouth—I asked him what he did that for—he said it was a walking match, walking for a wager—they then said, "Give us none of your <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi>, or we will show you how to fight"—the policeman came up and separated us—he sent our party up Albion-street, and the others went on—that was the second time the policeman came up—I, and our party of five, went up Albion-street; and when we got opposite Albion-mews, Smith and Cody rushed out of the mews-Smith hit me in the mouth, and Cody hit me on the side of the head—I fell down on the ground, and they both began kicking me in the mouth, on my head, and in my ribs—their violence stunned me, and I became insensible—I do not know what took place for some time—the next thing I remember was going to the surgeon with Batchelor—I had no knife with me—I did not see any knife, or any weapon of that kind—I had not struck anybody at all—I did not use my hands at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the New Inn at Portland-town, in the parish of St. Marylebone—Radley was my potboy. On 26th Oct. I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock—I left the place quite secure, I fastened it myself—Radley leaves my premises at ten or half-past—I did not go into the tap-room that night—I had a little puppy, which I missed on the Friday night—I always went into the tap-room to let the dog in there at night, but he was not in the back-parlour, and therefore I did not open the tap-room door, and cannot say whether the window was open or not—the dog was about the house next morning—I do not know what time Radley came that morning—on that morning I missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a shelf in the bar—there was a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and the rest was in shillings and sixpences—I last saw it at twenty minutes to one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Erwood, of 3, Tottenham street, Kingsland, in the parish of Hackney. The prisoner Erwood is my daughter, she is nineteen years old; she lived with me. On Monday, 11th Nov. I went out about three o'clock in the afternoon, leaving no one in the house—I locked the first-floor front room—on my return I let myself in, I had taken the key of the street-door with me—I found the door of the front room up<lb/>stairs burst open, and three boxes were gone, which I had left in that room when I went out—they were locked, and contained four gowns, two bonnets, eighteen handkerchiefs, four shawls, a table-cover, a sheet, a parasol, a necklace, five petticoats, two bed-gowns, three nightcaps, some Orleans stuff, a shift, some aprons, and other articles—I do not know Wright—my daughter had slept in the house the night before—she did not come home that night; I had not seen her since nine in the morning—next day I saw both the prisoners in custody at a coffee-shop in the Harrow-road—I went with the officer, and when I entered the room, I said, "Dear me, Sarah, what have you done with my things?"—she said "The officer has got them"—the value of the property I lost was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I saw Daniel, who was acting as time-keeper to a lot of men repairing the sewers in Whitehall-gardens—I spoke to him about a dog of my master's, which I had lost—he made an appointment to meet me at a quarter to nine o'clock that evening, at the Swan Tavern, by Westminster-bridge—I went there, and he came in about ten minutes to nine—in about a quarter of an hour Denhar came in—he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. -worth of brandy and water; I had some of it; and then he and Daniel tossed with regular money for another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth, and then for another—it was brought, and I certainly put my lips to it—after that Daniel wanted me to put his watch and mine down, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I had got to pay for the feed of my dog, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Denhar was to put down the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then became insensible, and cannot say whether I agreed to it or not—when I came to myself, I found I had lost the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and my watch—I was then at the Swan, and the prisoners were still there—they told me to keep quiet—I said I should like to redeem my watch again—they offered if I gave them 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that I should have it back again—that was about twenty minutes to ten the same evening—I must have been insensible about ten minutes—I was very stupid—I had not drunk anything besides a little spirits and water—I gave the prisoners my address—Daniel said he was a total stranger to Denhar, and he promised faithfully that he would seek after the watch,</p>

               <p>and meet me at the Horse Guards at eleven in the morning—I said, "You know where I live; and if you redeem my watch, I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he was to redeem his own watch and mine too—he never brought me my watch—I never saw either of them again till they were in custody (<hi rend="italic">looking at a halfpenny with a copper cap to it</hi>)—I cannot say whether I saw anything of this in the course of the evening—I thought they tossed with the same coin as I did, a common penny—I could not swear it was this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Pimlico. On Saturday, 2nd Nov., I was in New-street, Covent-garden, looking in at a painter's shop—Daniel came up to me, and said something about the bill that was in the window—I answered him, and he said he had been waiting there ever so long to see a person about some work—I walked with him through Covent-garden market, and down Long-acre, St. Martin's-lane, and Pall-mall—he asked me to come in and have something to drink at a public-house at the corner of St. James's-square—we went in—he called for a pint of ale, and I drank with him—while we were there, a man came in, who pretended to be a German—he told me he was a German, and he appeared to be one—it was not Denhar—he said something to us about two fine geese which hung up in the bar, and said he had been out on the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> all night, and wanted something to eat—this was between twelve and one o'clock—he did not appear to be acquainted with Daniel—Daniel said to him, "I am going out, and I will show you a place where you can go and get something to eat"—he said he had only just come to town, and did not know where to go—I went out with them—I forget the name of the street they went to; it was somewhere towards Rupert-street, I believe—they went into a public-house there, and I drank the share of a pot of ale with them—the German called for it; and Daniel directly said to him, "I will toss you who shall pay for it, and I will bet you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I beat you"—they tossed with this capped penny (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not know at that time that it was capped—Daniel won several times, each time he tossed—they then went on tossing for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., half-a-crown, and so on—after the German had lost several times, he went out; and while he was out Daniel showed me this capped penny, and said, "See here, I am sure to beat him every time"—the cap has the king's head on it, and the halfpenny it fits upon has both a head and tail, so that you may have a head on both sides if you like—the German came back, and they tossed again with the same thing-Daniel still won—he wanted me to bet on the game—I would not, and he asked me for the loan of some money—I told</p>

               <p>him I had not' got any—he persuaded me, by some means or other, to go and pawn my watch—I pawned it for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave him, and he went on tossing with it, making up 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and then the German won for the first time—they did not stop a minute after that—they promised to give me the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back again—Daniel proposed to meet me in St. Martin's-lane on the following Saturday—he did not mention the Welsh Harp, but the German proposed to meet me there—I went, and there saw Denhar, the German, and two more, but not Daniel—it was at the Welsh Harp public-house, close to the Adelaide Gallery—there was no tossing going on there—I did not stay—I promised to go home and fetch some money for them—I had told them, previous to the German coming, that I had no money with me—Denhar did not ask me anything about money; the other two did, and I went away, pretending to go for it, and went to Scot-land-yard, to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of John-street, Portland-town. On 11th Nov. I was in Oxford-street, looking at a blind man reading with his fingers—Daniel was there, and asked me if I thought the man was not <hi rend="italic">shamming</hi>—I said I thought not, and went on, and he kept up with me, talking—he gave the man a halfpenny—I went with him to a public-house in Edward-street—he called for a pint of porter—in about ten minutes Denhar came in—they appeared to be strangers to each other—Denhar was talking to the landlord about Feargus O'Connor and Ireland—he then began to talk to Daniel and me about it—I said I must go—they began quarrelling about Ireland—I left, but they kept in my company, and the quarrel lasted all the way to Leicester-square—I went into a gin-shop at the corner of Leicester-square with them, and drank two glasses of gin with them, which Denhar called for and paid for—they then began to toss for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Denhar won—they tossed eight or a dozen times for six-pences and shillings—Daniel won every time—I staid there half an hour—I did not toss—we left, and went to another public-house kept by Mr. Slade—Daniel asked me if I would put my watch down for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Denhar could hear it—Daniel showed me two penny-pieces, and said he could not lose with them, as he had won every time—I said I would not give him the watch; but he said, "If you lose I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I put it down on the table—Denhar said it was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Little Queen-street. On 11th Nov. about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Strand—Daniel came up and spoke to me—I briefly answered him, and walked on—I per<lb/>ceived he was following me—he overtook me in the market, and asked me several times to have something to drink—I refused, but at last con<lb/>tented—we went into the Rising Sun—Denhar came in—we had some gin and cold water—they tossed for some cigars, Daniel won—in about ten minutes we all went away together—I was going home, but they asked me to go with them to another public-house—we went to the Duke of Wellington, Spring-gardens, and had some gin and cold water—they tossed who should pay for it; Daniel won—he asked if I had any money—I said, no—he wanted me to stake my watch for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against Denhar, which I declined—he asked why I would not—I said, "I would rather put it into my pocket"—before that, he had showed me this penny with a cap over it, and said, "Look here! this is the way I do it; if you stake your watch for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I was in a public-house in Wapping, on 21st Nov.—I was the worse for drink—the prisoners were there together—I did not know them before—I was there with them, to the best of my knowledge, about twenty minutes—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I treated the prisoners, and then left—they followed me to the bottom of Gravel-lane—M'Allen attacked me, and put his hand in my right pocket—he had seen me take out some money at the public-house—I held his hand in my pocket and sung out, "Police!" and Gilligan came across the street—he caught hold of me in a rough sort of manner, and we all three fell together— M'Allen got his hand away from my pocket, and a lot of my money fell about the street from my pocket and his hand—two policemen came up—they took the prisoners—I picked up two or three shillings—this knife was found on one of them at the station, it belongs to me; it was in my right-hand trowsers pocket with the silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen. Q.</hi> Did not you state that you had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I changed it, and drank from six o'clock till I met with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen</hi>. You were lying outside the public-house, and I said, "Don't let the man lie there, he will be taken up;" and you said, "If you will take me to Poplar I will pay you."<hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not—I gave you a treat in the house to half a gallon of half-and-half to get rid of you—I did not treat you in King-street, to my knowledge—I did not go into another house and call for a pot of beer and not have money to pay for it—this took place on the pavement—I did not say it was on the iron grating.</p>

On 21st Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners and Coghlan struggling—I heard a cry; I went up, and they all three fell together—Coghlan was drunk; the prisoners were quite sober—they were both on Coghlan—they got up when they saw me—I saw some silver on the ground; I picked up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners began to pick up the money—they said Coghlan was drunk and fell down—he said, "They have robbed me, I give them</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-police-constable</hi>,31). I was walking down Old Gravel-lane—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw three per<lb/>sons struggling—I ran across—before I got there, they were all standing up—I saw Oliver holding the prisoners—Gilligan dropped four shil<lb/>lings and two sixpences; I picked them up—I took M'Allen, and in going up Gravel-lane, I saw him chuck a shilling and a halfpenny upon an apple-stall—I found on him eleven shillings, a halfpenny, and a counterfeit shilling.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gilligan's Defence</hi>. I was going down to Gold's-hill, Shadwell, and saw Coghlan lying on the pavement, with his face covered with mud, and a mob of people round; some said, "Don't let him lie there;" we picked him up, and took him on; he said, "Come along this way, I have got a friend lives here;" he crossed over Dock-hill, and when we got to Cooper's-bridge, he took out his money, and said, "I have got plenty of money here;" I said, "Put it in your pocket;" he put it between his pocket and his trowsers, and it fell down; I picked up some, and his knife, and he hallooed out "Police!" the policeman came, and he said I put my hand into his pocket; I offered him his knife, and he said he did not want it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen's Defence</hi>. We saw the prosecutor outside the door; he could not stand; he said, "Take me to Poplar, I have got a friend there;" we took him round under a lamp, where there are hundreds of persons passing by; he was senseless drunk; he did not know what to say; he charged this young man with robbing him, and when we got to the station, he charged me; I am as innocent as any person that was not there.</p>

On 11th Nov., about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw Potts there—something was under the seat he was sitting on—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> do you know where to sell an old meter?"—I said, "Next door"—he said he had been there with it, and Mr. Waters would not buy it—I said, "Mr. Bartlett will buy it, just below"—he said, "You know him better than me, will you go and see?"—I went, and he said he would buy it—I went back, and told Potts—he took the meter there—Mr. Bartlett rubbed his hand on it, and said, "Knell, this belongs to the Company; I would not buy it for a guinea"—I told Potts to put it back in the same spot where he had it from—next morning I saw the prisoners together—I</p>

On 11th Nov., Knell came to me—he went away, and came again afterwards with a meter—I saw a badge on it—I rubbed it, and found it was the property of the Chartered Gas Company—I refused to buy it, and he took it away—in a minute or two afterwards Potts came, and asked me to buy the meter—he said it was given to him, and I might as well buy it as anybody else—I said I dared not, as it was the property of the Chartered Gas Company, he had better take it back to where he had got it, or else to the Company's works, and they would probably remunerate him for his trouble—I think he said if I did not buy it some one else should, but I will not be positive—I met him again next morning, and he asked me if I would buy it—I asked what he had done with it—he said he had got it at home, that he had, or meant to, knock the badges off, I cannot say which—the Company do not sell meters.</p>

Abraham Wildey Robarts is the head partner; there are others—I am in the country department—the prisoner was cashier in that department—it was his duty to receive payments for country banks, and to sign checks for the amounts—I believe these checks of Courts' to be in his writing, and in two cases the filling up as well as the signature—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has entries of mine—by looking at it I am able to say that I was there on 18th Oct.—I do not remember seeing a clerk from Dixon's that day—no one was receiving money in the country department that day but me and the prisoner—I received money from about twelve o'clock—if the prisoner received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day on account of Stuckey, Wellington bank, it would be his duty to place it in a drawer near me, with a ticket of the particulars on whose account it was received, and for what bank—money received is always placed in the same drawer—it would be my duty to enter from that drawer the particulars of the country transactions—I keep two books for convenience—I find no account of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received for Stuckey's bank on 18th Oct., or at any time—the prisoner was on duty on 19th—if he received 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Bristol bank, and fifteen guineas for the Cheltenham bank, it would be his duty to place them in the drawer—I find here an account of the fifteen guineas received from Messrs. Coutts, on account of Mr. Southwood with the Cheltenham bank—here is the ticket I copied it from(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the prisoner's writing—I find no account of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in at the same time from the same house—no other person was doing anything as to the receipt of money in my depart<lb/>ment after twelve or one o'clock on 19th Oct.—we sometimes have a clerk from another department to assist after twelve o'clock, when I go to a different part of the house, but all the entries on the 19th are in my writing—we have an agreement balance every twenty-one days.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many clerks are there in that department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eleven; every clerk who receives money, puts it into that drawer—it is open—the country office opens at nine, and I come in a few minutes before twelve—sums of money would be put into that drawer by the other clerks between nine and twelve—it then becomes my duty to enter the sums—I find them in the cash-book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Weir, who lives in Windmill-lane, Stratford, in the parish of West Ham—I know the prisoner—on Monday evening, 4th Nov., I was in the back kitchen about eight o'clock—there is a door which opens from that to a street by the side of the house—I had a gold chain round my neck—there were two seats and a key, and a ring attached to it, and a silver watch—I had a brooch in my gown—I had the candle in my hand—I walked to the safe to get out the supper—the side door was ajar—I did not see the prisoner—he came in, and came behind me—he said, "You b——, you shall pay for all"—he took hold of me by the throat, took the brooch from my gown, and the watch and seals, and chain from my neck—the chain must have broken—I did not hear anything fall, but they were all gone from me—the prisoner had the watch in his hand, and he was going out—I screamed "Murder!" and my husband stopped him, and took the watch from him—I afterwards</p>

               <p>saw the two seals, and key, and ring found against the side door, and the prisoner's cap; it must be his cap, no other person was there—there was no cap lying there before he came—I have seen the watch and chain, and other things since, but I have not seen the brooch—they were worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Monday evening, 4th Nov., about eight o'clock, I was standing at my front door—there is a door from my back kitchen which leads to a bye street—I heard my wife scream, and I ran to the side-door—I saw the prisoner coming out, I laid hold of him, and took from him my wife's gold guard-chain and silver watch—he had them in his right hand—I called, "Police!" and endeavoured to detain him—he resisted, and tried to get away—I laid hold of him, and struggled with him—we both tumbled down together—he at last got away, before the police were there—I examined the back kitchen, and found near the door the two seals, and key, and ring, which my wife was in the habit of wearing—my wife had a brooch that night, which has never been found since—I saw a cap near the door—I do not know whose it was—I know the prisoner—this is the watch, and guard, and seals, and key, and ring—they are all my property.</p>

On 5th Nov. the female prisoner and another woman came to my shop and asked if I purchased old silver—I said, "Yes;" and the prisoner produced these pieces of silver spoons—I examined them, and told her I had no doubt they had been stolen—she said her husband had found them in some wash—I took the pieces and told them I must inquire further about them, and they must call the next day—the part with the initials was so bent that I could not see them—I bent it right, went after them, and gave them into custody, and gave the pieces to Benton, who I had sent for—the female prisoner gave the name of "Jury, of Chingford."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bull; I live at Woolwich, and occasionally let lodgings. On Tuesday night, 22nd Oct., the prisoner was brought to my house about half-past nine o'clock, by a person who lived next door, where she had taken supper—she asked for a lodging—I asked her if she was a stranger in Woolwich—she said, "Yes," that she had come from London with her husband, who was gone to Burrage-grove to sit up with a brother who had died—I showed her up to a room—she had the room to herself—there was a chest of drawers there containing wearing-apparel, a purse containing a sovereign, and a half-sovereign, and another purse containing my certificate, and the receipt for my rent—I had put those things in the drawers the day before, and locked them up—the prisoner did not come down in the morning, and I went up about eleven, and asked if anything was the matter—she answered that she was getting up—I went down-stairs for I dare say two hours; she did not come down—I went up again at half-past two—I knocked, and told her she must open the door, which she unlocked, and let me in—the stairs do not open to the street, but inside the shop—no one could have gone into that room that night or day without my knowing it—there are three or four locks before you get in that room—a gentleman named Howe lodged in my house, and William Lawrence, a carpenter—my husband is at sea—when the prisoner let me into the room, I asked her what was the matter that she had been there all day—she said she had been waiting for her husband to come from the Burrage-grove, and he had not come, and she had not any money to pay for the bed—there was a bundle on the table; I asked her whose it was—she said it was hers—it was wrapped up in a handkerchief of hers—I told her she must leave the bundle till she paid for her lodging—she hesitated a good bit, and then asked if it would be safe—I told her it would be quite safe for her to leave it with me—she said she would go to the Burrage-grove to her husband to get money to pay for her bed, and come back for her bundle—when she was gone, I examined the bundle; I found it contained a number of my things, which had been in the drawers, but not the purses—the locks were all broken—I missed the two purses, and the sovereign and a half, two pairs of trowsers, a waistcoat-piece not made up, a petticoat, and two towels—they were not in the bundle—I have never seen them since—the window of the room the prisoner was in, opens to the street; it is on the first-floor—no one had occupied that room after I had seen the things safe the day before—I told my uncle—he gave information—he had been stopping in my house for three weeks—I saw the prisoner again in about half an hour after she went away, in the street, coming back to my house—my uncle brought her back—a policeman came in, directly after her; I do not think she saw him—I was present when she was searched at the station—she was wearing a petticoat of mine, and the shift was rolled up like a bussel behind her—she might have had the trowsers on when she left—I neither saw nor heard any other person in my house—I slept in the back parlour—the lodgers are there still—these things ( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine.</p>

On 27th Oct., at a quarter to six o'clock, I left the barrack-room, leaving my clothes and money safe in my box—I returned at half-past eight, and found my box broken open, and three handkerchiefs, a sovereign, half-sovereign, half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and four penny pieces gone—the prisoner slept in that room—he was absent when the roll was called, at half-past eight—next morning I went with Walker to a brothel in Wool<lb/>wich, and found the prisoner there, in bed, and my three handkerchiefs in his coat-pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Thornton-hall, near Bedale, in Yorkshire; I was in the eleventh batallion of Artillery. Hart was my servant six weeks—I left the regiment, I left Woolwich, at the end of Aug.—I remained a short time in London, and then went to Thornton-hall—before leaving, I told Hart to look after my baggage—I after<lb/>wards wrote this letter to him, and I received this reply (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—to the best of my belief, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)letter is Hart's writing; I never saw him write—I never received the property I had left behind me—it was never sent to me in Yorkshire, and, in consequence, I wrote to Captain Cannon—my property consisted of a chest of drawers, containing clothes, a gun and case, a pistol, saddle, a portmanteau and trunk, a carpet bag, some arm-chairs, and furniture of all descriptions, worth about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe this letter to be Hart's writing, in consequence of the answers it gives, I cannot conceive how anybody else could have written it—I never sent any servant from the Euston Hotel, to Hart for the things, and I never gave any servant of mine an order to Hart to deliver the things—all the orders I gave are contained in that letter of 21st.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quarter-master-sergeant of the 11th battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich. Hart was a gunner and driver in that battalion—I remember Captain Dodsworth leaving about 30th Aug., and I received directions to place his baggage in the store, of which I have the control—I received the packages, consisting of three large boxes, a plain deal case, a gun-case, a bag, and other packages—they remained in my possession till 2nd Oct., when I delivered them to Hart, who said he was going to send them to Captain Dodsworth, in the country—he said he was going to take them to his own house, and I lent him a hand-cart for that purpose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250174"/>
               <p>—on the 12th I heard that Captain Dodsworth had not received the baggage—I went and found Hart in the barracks, and told him Captain Cannon wanted to see him—he went with me to the captain, who asked him what he had done with the baggage—he said Captain Dodsworth's servant had called for it on the previous Tuesday; that was 8th Oct., with a light van, and taken it away with him to London—he was asked if he knew him to be Captain Dodsworth's servant—he said he did not know him; that he had brought a note from Captain Dodsworth, desiring the bag<lb/>gage might be given up to him; that Captain Dodsworth was residing at the time at an hotel in Euston-square—Captain Cannon asked him whether he knew the man—he said he thought he should know him—Captain Cannon said to me, in Hart's hearing, perhaps the baggage might be deposited at the hotel in Euston-square at that time, as it was as short a time, and directed me to write to the landlord of the Victoria Tavern—I did so, and received an answer—Captain Cannon asked Hart if he knew Captain Dodsworth's writing, and if he believed the note to be in his writing—he said he believed it was his writing; and the man gave such a description of the difficulties under which Mr. Dodsworth was labouring, that he had no doubt it was right—Captain Cannon asked him what had become of the letter—he said he could not tell; it must have been torn up by the children, or the man must have taken it away that took the baggage away—he said he followed the man with the things some distance, to see whether he would take them by railway or water to London; but it being near his stable-hour, he was obliged to leave, and go to duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Spring-place, Wandsworth-road, Lam<lb/>beth. On 2nd Nov., I went to bed at a few minutes past eleven o'clock; I had fastened my doors and windows—I am satisfied every thing was perfectly fast—the next morning I came down at seven—I saw a light in the back-parlour, and found the window-shutters had been forced open, and the window was open—I missed sheets, counterpanes, and other things, which had been in the front-room, and which were brought into the back-parlour—I went to the station and came back—I then missed a writing-desk, which had been standing on a dining-table in the back-parlour—I had seen it safe the night before; and the counterpane, sheets, towels, an apron, and a watch—the watch was in my writing-desk, the other things were in the boxes which were under the the counter in the shop—they had been brought into the back-room, I had seen them safe the night before—any person could get from the back-parlour to the shop, without breaking any locks.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 77). From information I received I went to the prosecutor's house on the 3rd Nov., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—I found some thieves had got over a fence five feet high, and then in at the back-window, by forcing the bolt and shutters, and forcing up the the window—that fence divides the premises of the prosecutor from a public thoroughfare—Spice was with me—I left the premises, and in a waste piece of ground I saw Webb walking to and fro, with a bag in his hand, and there was a load of gravel or sand—the fence divides the premises from the high-road which runs at the back of the premises; and the sand-heap was in an open piece of ground in front of the house—there is a road between the house and the waste ground—I was in plain clothes—I saw Webb go and sit down on the heap of sand, and he had a bag, as it appeared to be, under his arm—I went into the Wands-worth-road, and there I saw Wells—he went and joined Webb——they remained a few minutes, and then went away together, followed by Spice—I then went to the sand-heap, and examined it, and found the property which I now produce, tied up in two large bundles, covered over with the sand—I let it remain there for a few minutes, but some children being in the neighbourhood, began to run over the sand, and to remove one bundle—I then took the two bundles away and put them in the toll-house—at half-past five in the evening, just at dusk, I went with Spice, and took the same property back to where I found it, and covered it over with sand—we then went and watched for a few minutes, standing under a large wall—we then saw the three prisoners go up to the heap—we were thirty or forty yards from them; it was dark—I could see them by the gas light</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250184"/>
               <p>—they were all at the sand, in a stooping position over the heap, at the spot where I had put the goods, which I had placed in the same part they had been in before—I then saw them all come away together, and Webb was carrying the property which was then all in one bundle in a sack—I could not see who put it in the sack, as they all stood round—when they came down to where I was standing, I caught hold of Webb, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said nothing, but dropped the sack—I took him and the sack to the station, with the assistance of another officer, and Spice took the other two prisoners—I examined the bundle, and found this desk, this watch, and all the property named—it was what I had discovered in the morning, and concealed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of Angler's-terrace, Peckham. On Sunday morning, 10th Nov., between one and two o'clock, I was in the Kent-road, near the corner of Trafalgar-road—I had a purse in my right pocket with ten half-crowns in one end, and six in the other—I had some halfpence in my pocket distinct from the purse—I saw the prisoner loiter<lb/>ing about the corner—just as I was about to enter the road she came up and took hold of my right arm—my right hand was in my trowsers pocket, and my left hand holding an umbrella—she persisted in accompanying me—I was going homewards—I turned up the Trafalgar-road—she made some remarks which I can scarcely charge my memory with—after I had crossed the canal bridge she asked me for money—as far as the bridge there is a carriage road, some houses on the right hand, and a great many on the left, and lamps; after that, it is a bye-road, and a footpath, there are no houses for a considerable distance—I made no request to her whatever—I did not acquiesce in her company, on the contrary, I wished to get away from her—Iwarned her that I was going home—I asked her to leave me in the first instance—I warned her that I was getting nearer and nearer home—I am a married man, and I thought it would be discreditable to be with her—she said she would not leave me without I gave her some money—that was a considerable distance after I had passed the bridge—I gave her some halfpence, all I had in my pocket, except what was in the purse—I thought it was only halfpence, but on making a calculation I found I had 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her a sixpence amongst the halfpence—at the moment I gave them to her, a policeman showed his light across the field—I said to her, "There is a policeman, now you had better go"—she did not go immediately, she continued where she was—I stood just for one minute, pointing to the policeman—she left me a minute afterwards, and within two minutes after, I discovered the loss of my money—I recollect having seen it about an hour before, and I had felt it not two minutes before—on finding that my money was gone I turned round immediately to the prisoner, and said, "You have taken my purse"—she had got but very few yards from me—she said, "I hope God may strike me blind and dead, if I have"—I told her she must give me my purse, it contained my children's victuals—I begged her to give it me—she seemed to pay no attention to anything I said, except repeating that she had not got it—I persisted that she had, for I knew a very short time before, it was safe in my pocket—at length when the policeman was approaching, she thrust the purse into my right hand—I immediately perceived that the money had</p>

               <p>been taken from one end of it, but was left in the other—I found the six half-crowns had been taken from one end, the ten were left in the other— I found a hole about the centre of the purse, where there had been a slight hole previously, but it was increased—the ring had passed beyond the hole, so that there would be no rent where the money was—I said to her, "You have not given me all the money"—I told her she had got 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my money, that I had had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and now I had only got 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "Give it me"—she persisted that she had not got it—the policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—I had not had any service whatever from her from which she might have supposed she was entitled to any money.</p>

               <p>between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor in the Peckliam footpath—the prosecutor said, "You have robbed me"—the prisoner said she had not robbed him—I asked him; he said she had—I asked her, and she said she had not—he gave her in charge—she said she was innocent, and he ought to be ashamed to lock her up—he told me she took a purse, containing sixteen half-crowns, from him, and she gave him back the purse, containing ten half-crowns, and six were missing—she was searched by a female, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver was found on her, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I searched the spot where the money was lost; I found nothing—there is water there—I said to the prisoner, "Has there been any connexion taking place between you and the gentleman?"—she said, "None whatever."</p>

On Saturday, 2nd Nov., I was at the premises till six o'clock in the evening—I was the last in the house—I locked it up, and took the keys with me—I had locked the outer and inner doors, and had the keys with me—the inner door leads from the front-room into the back-room—the front-room down-stairs and the back-room up-stairs are what I occupy—in the back-room down-stairs, were these taps, some sponge, and other valuable things—there is no way to the back-room but through the front-room—when I returned on the Monday morning, I found the outer door still fast—I unlocked it, and went in—the lower front-room has a window, which was open—it was shut when I left on Saturday—I saw a parcel of chips lying under the inner door—it had been cut, both on the door-post and opposite the lock, to facilitate the admission of an iron bar—the door was open, and the fastening was lying by it—I found an iron bar lying in the passage—I compared it with the indents—they cor<lb/>responded I missed from the back-room twelve dozen taps, which I had received from Mr. Hickman—I saw them on the Saturday, about six o'clock—it is my opinion that these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the same taps, with the name filed out—there are marks of a file—those taps I left, had the name of "Doulton and Watts" on them.</p>

I saw the prisoner at my master's shop with one of these taps as a sample for my employer to look at—I rather think he said how many he had got, but I do not remember—he said he had a quantity of taps for sale—I think he called several times during the day, to know whether Mr. Bliss approved of them—he called on Friday and saw Mr. Bliss, who said he would purchase them—I was present and advised Mr. Bliss to purchase them, as they would suit us—he agreed to purchase six dozen, at seven shillings and sixpence a dozen—two guineas were paid for them, which is a fair value—we could purchase the same articles new for a halfpenny more each—I do not know whether we have ever bought taps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250191"/>
               <p>like these—we have had new taps from Birmingham—I consider they might have been purchased at seven; shillings and sixpence, or eight shillings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

The prisoner was in my employ two months—on Saturday, 16th Nov., I missed the key of a cupboard, had it forced open, and missed my watch and guard, which I had put there on the Thursday—I went to the workshop where the prisoner was, told her I had lost them, and sent for Goff; he came, and asked her if she knew anything of my missing my watch—she said she had heard of it but she did not take it; she had never seen it—she afterwards said it was all false what she had said, she had taken the watch and given it to the young man she was keeping company with.</p>

On Saturday night, 2nd Nov., I fastened my door at half-past nine o'clock—I sleep on the ground-Boor front—on Sunday morning, about half-past six, I heard some one come on the step of my door—a short time afterwards, I heard some one scrape their shoes, and put a key into the door, and not knowing the door was unbolted I felt no concern—I called my servant, heard another attempt, and heard the latch open, and a person walk in, and go up the hall towards the staircase—I went towards the stairs, and saw the shadow of some one about a yard and a half from the front parlour door—I called my servant again, very loudly, and the party turned round and went out, slamming the door—I cannot say who it was—I was agitated—there was no one but my servant and me in the house—the prisoner was afterwards brought back by a policeman—he is not a lodger of mine—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 65). I know the prisoner—I have seen him several times—on this Sunday morning I saw him start from home, in White-horse-street, New-cut, and followed him and another party to Stamford-street, Blackfriars-road—I saw him go to the door of No. 27 or 28 there, and fumble at the key-hole, and try to open it—he did not open it, and walked away, looking at all the doors till he got into Tennison-street, where I saw him go to Mrs. Duke's door, No. 20—he scraped his feet, stood for a minute or two at the door, while some parties were coming by, and after they had passed he opened the door, apparently with a key, and walked in—I ran down Sutton-street, and when I came back he had run out, and run to Commercial-road—he returned to the house again, but did not go in—he went up to the door, apparently to try it again, and then ran away again down the Belvidere-road, where I took him, and took him back to the house—Mrs. Duke sent her servant to the station-house with us, where I searched him, and found two keys on him, one of whichopens Mrs. Duke's door—I was forty yards from the house when I saw him go in, and I ran round Sutton-street, to get as near as I could without passing the door, as I was afraid it might be open—I left some one watching.</p>
