                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Mullins Flory, he lives at Harmondsworth, and keeps a beer-shop. On Thursday, 17th April, the prisoner came there about seven o'clock in the morning—I knew him before—he remained there till between five and six at night—he had gone out in the meantime, between three and four, and was away about half an hour—he came back, and went away between five and six—I went to him at a quarter-past six, and saw him in bed at his mother-in-law's, where he lives—I went to him alone because I had missed my husband's watch from the ledge by the side of the staircase, in the bed-room, by the bed—I had seen it there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120006"/>
               <p>about twenty minutes past three in the afternoon, and missed it about a quarter or twenty minutes after five, soon after the prisoner went away the second time—during the afternoon, the prisoner and Maizzilla Hare were in my house, and no one else, from twenty minutes before three till five—I saw Mrs. Hare and the prisoner go up-stairs between three and four; they were gone four or five minutes, or not so much—they came down again—the prisoner followed Mrs. Hare down—this is the watch—Hare lodged at my house—when I saw the prisoner in bed I asked him if he knew anything of my husband's watch, and he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Hare. I was lodging at Mrs. Flory's. I recollect the prisoner coming there that day—when I came down-stairs, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he was in the tap-room—I went up-stairs to work in my own room—when I came down once or twice I saw him there—I came down between three and four, and we drank together—he then began in rather an unfair way, and I ran up<lb/>stairs, to get out of his way—I ran into Mrs. Flory's bedroom, and he ran into the bed-room—I left the room in about a minute, and ran down first, and as I ran I saw the watch—I did not notice it when I ran up—the prisoner came down in about a minute after me—he went out at the back<lb/>door, and came in again at the tap-room door in about a minute—he staid a few minutes, and then he said he thought he should go and have some tea; and before we had done tea the prisoner came back—that might be in about twenty minutes—he brought some eggs—he took them out of his pocket and put them on a plate on the table—Mrs. Flory and I were sur<lb/>prised that he could go that distance in that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was he gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps twenty minutes; I knew the watch was kept in the bedroom before I went there—the prisoner did not come down-stairs with me—I passed him in the room, and I went into the tap-room—Mrs. Flory came in at the back-door at the time the prisoner came down-stairs—he followed me down-stairs, but not directly after me—I ran down as quickly as I could, to get out of his clutches—I had been drinking with him, but not <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> or playing—he had been taking liberties with me, and I ran up-stairs—I closed the cellar-door after me—I ran into the bedroom, which I thought was a very improper place for him to come to—there is no door to the bedroom—I believe I am married—I live anywhere that I can get a living—I have lived at Mr. Flory's since</p>

On 19th April, the prisoner came to my shop with another man who had a cap on—I did not take particular notice of the man—the prisoner asked for half an ounce of tobacco—he put down 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was a farthing more—he said, "Well, you must give me change for a sovereign"—he put down a good sovereign—the other man said, "Don't change; I have got some coppers"—he then took the sovereign up—he then said, "Never mind, give me change," and he gave me a bad sovereign—it was much lighter than the other—the one he gave me first was a good one, I am certain—when he gave me the other I went round the counter, and the prisoner and the other man ran off different ways—I ran and took the prisoner—I had the sovereign in my hand all the time—the prisoner wanted to snatch it from me, and the policeman caught hold of his arm.</p>

He was one of the unhappy patients in the Lunatic Asylum, in which you were a keeper, and it was suggested that a person in that condition was an incompetent witness. The Court, however, after taking the matter into their serious consideration, were very clearly of opinion that it was not a ques<lb/>tion which went to the competency, but to the credibility, of the witness, and that if the witness was in a fit state at the moment to give his evidence in. an apparently correct and proper manner, his evidence was to be considered by the jury, who alone were to pronounce whether they thought it a safe thing to act upon his testimony. The jury upon that occasion did think it was perfectly safe (and I believe the Court were of that opinion) to act upon his testimony as to what he saw with his own eyes, and they convicted you of the manslaughter with which you were charged.—Sentence, One Year, to commence from conviction."</p>

On 16th Oct., 1850, the prisoner opened an account with me for lace goods—the arrangement between us was that it was to be balanced every week—that continued so till 25th Nov., about which time his wife made an application to me to make it a monthly account—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and the statement his wife had made was communicated to him—I told the wife that before opening the monthly account we should wish to know something of who the partners were, and the answer was that they were Joseph Frederick Wiffin, who lived at Brentwood, and William Wallace Whyte—the account was opened, and I believe the two first months were paid—about Feb. last about 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due—I made several applications for payment, and several excuses were made, and appointments made to pay money—on one occasion the prisoner came and wished me to draw on him—I refused to do so, and the account went on for another month—I ultimately drew this bill on him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he wrote the acceptance, "J. F. Wiffin and Co.," on it—in my presence—frequently when I have pressed for money he has stated I had no occasion to be afraid; that Wiffin, his brother-in-law, was a highly respectable man in the country.</p>

I am a plumber and glazier, and reside at Brentwood—the prisoner is married to my sister—I was never in partnership with him—he had no authority to accept any bill for me in my name, or otherwise—I did not know of his carrying on business in the name of Wiffin and Co.—the postmark of this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is 1849—it refers to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I was answerable to a loan society for him shortly after he married my sister—I have had to pay a small portion of that—I was on good terms with him—I have never seen any of his bill-heads—I have a brother named George, who resides, I believe, in Middlesex-street, Somer's-town—he was in business with the prisoner—I have been at the prisoner's place of business twice in the last six months—there might have been a name over the door, but I did not notice—no communication has been made to me by the prisoner since this transaction—his wife came to my house last Tuesday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the prisoner a Scotchman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He always told me so, and that was his introduction to my family—he had no friends in London—I have only been to his house twice—I do not believe that he was under the impression that he might trade in my name; he never asked me to allow him to use my name—his wife took the most active part in the business—we have not visited for the last fifteen months—my brother George lived with them—about last February my sister showed me a bill headed</p>

               <p>"G. Wiffin," and told me my brother had been getting it printed—I did not at the time say, "Lucy, I do not wish the name Brent wood to appear"—she told me she and her brother had had a few words, and he had even had bill-heads printed with his own name—that is the only circumstance that has come to my knowledge of their trading in the name of Wiffin—he never had any authority from me to use that name—I cannot say whether he might have been deceived into that belief by any circumstances—I am not aware of any—my mother was once up in town for a week—she did not stay all that time with the prisoner—she staid two days with three relations—I dare say my brother George was there four months—Mr. Morris sent a letter to me, and told me he should hold me responsible for the debt, and threatened to sue me on it—he did not threaten to indict me for a conspiracy—the first I heard of this matter was Mr. Morris coming to my house—it is my firm belief that when the prisoner gave this bill, he intended to pay it—I never saw anything wrong in the prisoner—whatever business he was carrying on, I believe he was doing it to support himself and wife—his wife has not been to Brentwood for fit<lb/>teen months, until the other day—I only paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the Loan Society.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">thought that would scarcely be sufficient, unless the Jury were satisfied that he assumed the name with the specific object of putting off bills in that name, and that this was one of those bills; the carrying on business in that name might be for the purpose of creating a false impression with a view to obtaining credit; that would perhaps support a charge of false pretences, but not one of forgery.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">left the case to the Jury upon these two questions; first, whether the prisoner when he accepted the bill had reasonable grounds for believing that he had any authority to do so; and, secondly, whether he assumed the name of "J. F. Wiffin and Co." with a view to defraud the parties with whom he dealt, by issuing false Bills of Exchange, of which this was one. It would not be enough that he assumed the name for purposes of fraud merely, but they must find that he contemplated the acceptance of bills; this among others. In his opinion there was no evidence upon which they could safely come to the conclusion that the original use of the name was with a view of doing the parti<lb/>cular act charged.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper at the West India Docks—the prisoner was a sampler at No. 11 warehouse—there is indigo there, and other articles—it was his duty to stab the bags, to ascertain their condition, and to draw samples, about half-a-pound weight, and place the samples in a blue paper similar to this, with the name of the ship, and the dock number of the seron—the prisoner had been in the docks fourteen years—he was in the habit of taking out samples of indigo and cochineal to the brokers. On 2nd May he was engaged in sampling indigo of the same description at this produced for Petrie, and Pasteur, and Lewis, and Peek—there were fifty-three serons belonging to Petrie, and forty-two to Lewis and Peek—they were the selling brokers, not the consignees—on the day afterwards I went to Petrie's and saw a number of samples which had been drawn by the prisoner—they had marks on the outside wrapper of the dock number of the seron—I then went to Lewis, and found forty-two samples of indigo, bearing the marks of those that had been sampled on their account—they commenced it No. 670 and ended at No. 711—here is the entry-book which was kept by Burd.</p>

When the sovereign was missing he did not come home—I met him accidentally in Oxford-street, four days afterwards—he went home with me, and never left my place afterwards—the next morning, he offered to go with me to his master, but I said it was not necessary, as Mr. Baker seemed perfectly satisfied—I had thought it necessary to call on his master, as my son did not come home—his master said he had sent him for change of a sovereign, and he bad not returned—I said I would make it up when I could get a situation—he consented to take the prisoner's younger brother at a shilling a week leas than he paid he prisoner—he kept his brother four or five days, and then discharged him—I went on the Monday following, and asked what he discharged him for—he said a dreumitance had occurred that he could not keep him—I then repeated my promise that I would pay him the sovereign—I did not specify any time—the boy was afraid to return home, or to his master's—when I met him, he was in a most deplorable state; he had parted with his coat and shoes to support himself—I never said I would prosecute my child.</p>

On Saturday, 5th April, between one and two o'clock, I left the service of Mr. Skurry, of 7, Denbigh-place, Pimlico, and received half a sovereign, three shillings, and fourpence in halfpence, for my wages, which were 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I received them monthly—I removed my two trunks the same day, and took them to 1, Ann-place, Kensington-mews, Knightsbridge, where I had a friend living—she was not at home—I left my boxes there, and pro<lb/>ceeded across the Park to see a friend in Lisson-grove; but I altered my mind, as I had not seen them a long time, and thought I might be dis<lb/>appointed, and find them out—I turned back, and sat down in the Park some time; but as I was going through Knightsbridge, between seven and eight in the evening, I went up to the female prisoner, who was selling things there, and asked her if she could be kind enough to tell me of any respectable person where I could lodge for one night, as I did not wish to be out late—she called a woman, named Mrs. Jewell, and told her to take me home, and provide for me, and make me comfortable, as I could sleep with her—I went with Mrs. Jewell to 2, Exeter-place, which is near Sloane-street—I had my tea there with Mrs. Jewell and the male prisoner; after that, I sat conversing with Mrs. Jewell—after some little time, the man left the room—after that, I asked Mrs. Jewell to allow me to go to bed, as I felt very sleepy and tired—she told me I could go, and I laid down on the bed in my clothes—there was a little boy in the bed—it was then half-past eleven, as near as possible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120046"/>
               <p>—there was only Mrs. Jewell and the child in the room; Mrs. Jewell remained in the room while I was awake—it was the kitchen, and there was a fire—when I was between asleep and awake, I felt a hand feeling me—I felt irritated and frightened, and looked up, and saw it was the male prisoner—I was going to give an alarm, and he told me if I gave any alarm, or showed any resistance, he would smash my b—brains out—my purse was in ray pocket when I went to bed—I did not observe Mrs. Jewell standing in the room at the instant, for I was irritated, and very much frightened—there was a candle in the room—the male prisoner took the purse from my pocket, and concealed it in his bosom; I saw it in his hand—he then went and stood behind the door—the female prisoner then came to the door—she could not exactly get in, as he was standing behind it—he said, "Halloo!" and she instantly burst the door open, threw in her basket before her, flew at me, and struck me violently in the face, gave me two black eyes, and she called me all the b—w—she could possibly name—she was coming to strike me again—I put up my left hand to defend myself—she found she could not do exactly as she wished, and she turned round and seized Mrs. Jewell, who was close behind her, by the hair of her head, and jammed her backwards and forwards—she stood almost exactly between the two door-posts—she shoved her down on the floor, and pushed her knees into the pit of her stomach—her left hand was still entangled in her hair—she dragged her up from the floor again by main force, and her left hand seemed <hi rend="italic">dislocated</hi> from her hair, and she threw her down with full force on the back of her head—her head made a dreadful noise against the floor—I never saw her move afterwards—the female prisoner was beating her two or three minutes—the male prisoner was standing close to her all the while—he stood still, he did not say anything, and never offered to prevent the female doing it—the female prisoner used low language to Mrs. Jewell, the same as she used to me—I gave an alarm, and the landlord and two other persons came in—as soon as footsteps were heard coming, the male prisoner commenced beating his wife—I walked out as quick as possible into the street, and made a complaint to two young men, who were standing outside—I left my bonnet and cap behind me—at seven o'clock I went to Mrs. Miller's, where I had left my boxes.</p>

On 28th April, about half-past eight o'clock, I was at work in the office—the prisoner came in and said he had ten quires of paper over, which he should make money of—I said, "The paper does not belong to you; do not take it out," and he said, "I have got a person named Blake, who knows where to sell it"—I said, "If you take it out there will be a bother about it"—it was then lying on a bench—I do not know whether this is it—I went out of the room, came back infive minutes, and he was gone, and the paper also.</p>

On 28th April, about nine o'clock in the morning, I called on Mr. Burrell, and was too soon to see him—I went to a public-house—the prisoner came in; I had seen him about three times before—he said he had had a very bad loss, Mr. Burrell stopped 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for spoiled work and paper; that he offered it to Mr. Burrell for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., who told him he had better sell it where he could—he went out and returned with a parcel wrapped up in an apron—I went out with him, and the paper was sold for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a butcher's in Leather-lane, by a lame man, while the prisoner stood outside—I think this is it—I lifted up the apron and saw one corner of it—I saw no money pass, but they went into a public-house together, and I informed Mr. Burrell.</p>

In March she ordered a carpet, and desired that her room might be measured for it—I measured it, and on 22nd March I took a carpet for her approval to the direction she gave, 17, Chapel-place, Vere-street, Oxford-street—I saw her there on the day I measured for the carpet—a female opened the door, and I left the carpet in the hall with her, and did not see the prisoner—it was in a roll, not made up—I called for it on the Monday morning at ten o'clock, and found the house empty; it was furnished when I went there on Saturday—I went again next morning and received this address from Darlow, who lived on the second-floor—it is "17, Southampton-street, Pentonville"—I went there, and found the house occupied by respectable people, who had occupied it some time, and who did not know the prisoner—on 14th April I went with a policeman and found the prisoner living at 72, Harrison-street, Clerkenwell, in the name of Ready—I told her I had called to fetch away the carpet; she said she had not got it—I gave her in charge—she then said it was in the back room, and the constable then fetched it out—I measured it at the station and found rather better than twenty-one yards—there had been twenty-four and</p>

On Sunday morning, 28th April, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Brunswick-buildings with fourteen or fifteen of the most notorious thieves and prostitutes—a man named Smith was very riotous, and J took him into custody—I had a female in custody for assaulting me, and was taking her to the station with another constable—the prisoner, who I had never seen before, came behind me, and struck me a vio<lb/>lent</p>

               <p>blow on the hack of the neck with his fist—I let go of the female, and laid hold of the prisoner—he went very quietly for 200 yards, till he came to a dark place in Brunswick-street, where he resisted violently, and put his hand into his pocket and pulled out something with which he struck me two or three severe blows on the breast—he was in custody—he struck me a vio<lb/>lent blow on my left arm, and it immediately fell powerless by my side—he then struggled severely, but I retained my hold with my left-hand, and got him to the station, where I found my coat cut in six places, and blood flow<lb/>ing from a wound on my left arm—I went to University Hospital, and found I had other wounds—I have my coat here, to show the different cuts—I am suffering from the effects of it yet.</p>

Six other persons were brought to the station with the prisoner—I saw him pass something behind him to a woman named Smith, who dropped it into a bucket—I went to the bucket, and found this knife—the prisoner said that was not the knife he did it with, he threw that away at the corner of Coram-street.</p>

On 28th April, about two o'clock in the morning, Burton was brought there—there was a cut on his left arm, a little below the shoulder, which went through two coats, and his under clothing, to the depth of half an inch—it would produce the sensation of the arm being powerless—there was also a small superficial wound on his right breast—a sharp pointed knife would do it—this knife would not in its present state—it is rather too blunt—all the cuts were very clean.</p>

Collins had to deliver parcels at different places—before he started, my clerk asked him, in my presence, how many trusses he had; he said, "Sixteen"—he was made to unload his cart, and count them, and there were seventeen—he had first to deliver five trusses at Mr. Addington's, the lower end of St. Martin's-lane—his course would be Farringdon-street, Fleet-street, and the Strand—it would be out of his way to go through Queen-street—he afterwards told me he had met with an accident, and lost a truss—I asked him which way he went; he said, "Chancery-lane, Carey-street, and through Lincoln's-inn, the side nearest the Strand (that is the opposite side to Sir John Soane's Museum), and Queen-street;" that he went to Messrs. Bull and Wilson's with one truss, and missed the truss there—that is in St. Martin's-lane, the end nearest Holborn—he said, when he stopped the cart, he noticed a person dressed in black, with a pipe in his mouth, walk towards it; and when he came out again, he was gone, and he missed the truss—I asked him if he had spoken to a policeman; he said he had not</p>

               <p>seen one, but he bad been to Bow-street—I asked him why; he said Mr. Kempson, of Bond-street, who the truss was for, made him go there—the truss contained three ends of cloth, 108 yards, and was worth 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a yard long, or a little more, and was in a whitey-brown wrapper—next day Turner came to my yard, and taw a number of carts come in, and afterward Collins came in, and he identified him.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Bailey, the curator of the Soane Museum, which is on the further side of Lincoln's-inn-fields—on 4th Oct., about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on the third-floor, cleaning windows—I saw a cart and a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing opposite—the three prisoners were in the cart—Dormer lifted a Urge package, done op in whitey-brown sacking, oat of the cart, and put it into the call—Collins was sitting in front of the cart, looking round partly towards Dormer—Dew was on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the parcel was put in, Dormer got up on the box, and went off, and the cart went on towards the City—next day I went to Mr. Blomfield's, and saw several carts come in—I saw Collins, and picked him out without anybody telling me.</p>

Dormer came, and knocked twice at the door, about two o'clock; Mrs. Warden opened it—he did not go in; he spoke to her for a minute or two at the door, and went away—in ten minutes or a little more Dew drove a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> up—there was no passenger in it—he took out a roll with a loose brown wrapper round it, and carried it into the passage, and then a second parcel, which I should say contained two rolls—the sister-in-law tried to carry the second, but could not, and the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> carried it—I heard her say, "He," or "they will be here presently"—Dew said, "Yes," and drove away—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Dormer came, and went up to Mrs. Warden's apartments—while Mrs. Warden was speaking to him in the shop, a person like a porter came—I think he had a knot—he carried away something in the shape of a bed, tied up in a patchwork quilt—Mrs. Warden was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in arrear of rent; she paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. There is tea in the warehouse, No. 9—on 9th May I saw the prisoner, who was a labourer there, going from the docks earlier than usual—he passed me, and I saw something bulky in his pocket, asked to look what he had got—he said his lunch—I took him into the gate-keeper's box, and found 5 lbs. of tea, some in his hat, some in each pocket, and some between his shirt and his skin—I asked him where he got it—he said he bought it of a man on board a ship.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of No. 9 warehouse, West Quay, Lon<lb/>don Docks. The prisoner was employed there on 9th May—there was a quantity of tea in chests there, which had been landed there the day before—after the prisoner was taken, I found one of the chests had been opened by violence, and tea missing—I have compared the tea found on the prisoner with that in the chest, and have every reason to believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me at work that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not looked at the book, I placed you at work to mark goods as they came out—the ship's name is <hi rend="italic">"Mitchell"</hi>—there were forty men at work at it—there was <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> on board in bundles—I missed you at half-past nine o'clock, and found Dicker doing your duty—I did not step into the cabin and have a glass of grog, there has been none on board these three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The witness has just stated there was <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> on board the ship, I can prove there was no such thing on board; I can prove by the bill of lading there was not one particle of <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> in the bill of lading or invoice there was <hi rend="italic">kyar</hi>-rope; I have been four years employed by that honourable and honest Company, the London Dock; I have got a wife and five children I was fourteen weeks out of employment, and oat of those fourteen weeks I had seven days' work; when he apprehended me with the tea, I bad met with a party like a sailor, who said he had got a little tea to dispose of, and if I would purchase it, it would prove to my welfare; I said I had got no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120072"/>
               <p>money; he said, "Never mind, if you can make a good sale of it, I will entrust it to you, and give you 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pence for yourself; and consequently I consented; I had neither handkerchief, cloth, or anything else, and I put it about my body; I went and got very tipsy, and this constable of this honest Company, which is robbing the British merchants of England by wholesale, came and seized me, and said it belonged to them; I am a poor man with a wife and five children, and have had only seven days' work. In coming from Canton or Hong-Kong to London, a great many chests of tea would be broken, and they fetch the chests out in dozens, by heaps, and by numbers, and if the parties think proper they are put into bags and taken away: there is no superior officer, but away the man runs with them on the truck, and away the tea goes on the ground, and then this man comes and says the tea corresponds; the tea, as I said before, is already broke, then it goes to the warehouse, sixty or seventy yards, over rough stones and smooth stones, and Mr. Chandler and the others have a share in it, and that is the honest Com<lb/>pany. If I give the foreman a glass of grog he says I am an <hi rend="italic">out-and-out</hi> worker, and I get work next day, but a man with a large family is not able to do this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 25, Orchard-row, Stepney. I know the prisoner—I lived with him between four and five years—I never lived with any one else; one Friday or Saturday morning, five or six weeks ago, the prisoner made me get up and dress myself about five o'clock—he beat he and kicked me, and made me go to the Minories with him—it was very wet—he told me to stand against a baker's shop-door, three or four doors before you come to a court—he then went down the court—I went to the corner of the court, and saw him climb over a wall, and disappear—I then went and stood against the baker's door for about three-quarters of an hour—the prisoner then came to me—he had five coats tied up in a bundle, and had a pair of black trowsers on over his own, and a small shooting-coat on—he held out his hand, which bad gold and silver in it, and said, "I have got something less than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he told me to go home, and he went away—I reached home first, and he came home about eight—we lodged at Mr. Turner's, 9, Princes-street, Church-street, Shoreditch; when be came over the wall, and brought the coats, he had not his own coat on, and when he came home at eight I asked him where his own coat was—be said he had left it behind—he brought home with him a pair of black cloth trowsers, and made me cut a piece out of the side of the leg and stitch them up, so that they should not be known—after they had been so altered, he wore them—I afterwards went to a policeman on duty to complain of the prisoner—the policeman did not come to our lodging—he went to the prisoner's sister's house and opened a box, and took out the trowsers; I was there—I went and pawned the trowsers, after the policeman had seen them, at Mr. Fawcett's in the Commercial-road, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that box belonged to Esther Phillips—I had borrowed it of her—I pawned them, because the prisoner's sisters were following me to take them away from me—since that, a knife has been shown me by a policeman—I had seen the prisoner with it, and seen him use it several times—a coat was shown me by the policeman—it is the prisoner's—I had darned it in several places.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a sailor. On Wed<lb/>nesday morning, 14th May, past one o'clock, I left the Three Crowns—shortly afterwards I was standing in a court, talking to a girl—I had changed a sovereign in the public-house—I wrapped a half-sovereign up in paper and tied it, with a half-crown, a sixpence, some shillings, and coppers, in the corner of my handkerchief, which I put into the waistband of my trowsers, which fitted very tight—the prisoners came up and spoke to the woman, rendering her away from there—Wall struck me on the face—the woman went on one side, and they did not strike her—Renney struck me on the back of the head—I staggered, and one of them laid bold of the handkerchief—as I fell, one of them kicked me—they both <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> at the handkerchief—the sovereigns were out of the waistband, and could be seen—I held one end of it—one of them gave me a desperate blow on the head, of which I have the mark now, and I was obliged to let go—a policeman came up, but the last blow stunned me, and I saw no more—my shin and elbow were cut.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 322). I was on reserve duty at the station on the night of 24th April. I remember a drunken person being locked up, about ten o'clock—I was sent by the inspector in order to quiet him—while there, I beard Carter speak to Daley—(I can swear to their voices, for they had been some time in the station before they were locked up)—Carter said, "It was them <hi rend="italic">bloodies.</hi> that <hi rend="italic">cracked</hi> about the cigars, that <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it for us"—Carter asked Daley how he thought they should get on in the morning—Daley said that they should be <hi rend="italic">fulled</hi> safe, meaning, that they should be committed for trial—Carter asked Daley what he thought they should be done to then, and be said, they should be <hi rend="italic">lagged,</hi> meaning, that they should be transported—he asked, who bad the spectacles, and Carter said, <hi rend="italic">Pudding,</hi> which I found was a nickname that Tuck went by; they then got talking about the money found on them—Carter asked Daley how he had so little money on him—he said he had been <hi rend="italic">blowing</hi> it all the after<lb/>noon, meaning, he had spent it—afterwards, Carter and Tuck were talking together, and Tuck said he should not care if he did not get more than a <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> for it, meaning three months; Carter said he should be very sorry to have to do a <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> for what Tuck had done—I then happened to move, and made a slight noise, and Daley hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Nish!</hi>" that means, keep quiet.</p>

I live at 1, Factory-row—it is let out in lodgings—the prisoner and his wife occupied a small back-room there, furnished—on 2nd May he came borne about half-past six o'clock, by the back-door, with a box—there is no way in at the back, but there is a side-door level with the front—the prisoner's wife was in my room at the time, and he called her to help him up with the box—his wife said, "Whose box is it?" and he told her it was his sister's box, and that she would be there directly—he took the box into their own room—the door was left open, and my door was open also, and I heard his wife say, "Are you sure of that, Charles?" and he told her to mind her own business, and not to trouble about his affairs—after that they went out together—when the prisoner had come in he had a hat on, and when he went out be had on a cap with gold lace—I heard them come home at near ten, but did not see him—I think he was then in liquor, by his way of talking and coming up-stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, of the London and Blackwall Railway. In consequence of information from Miss Hughes, I went up by the next train, to look after the prisoner—on the Saturday morning I went with sergeant Smith to 1, Factory-row, went into the prisoner's room, found him and his wife there, and this box at the foot of the bed—there was no direction card on it—I asked the prisoner how the direction came off the box; he said he supposed it got rubbed off—his house is about 400 yards from the Stepney station, and better than half a mile from the Shadwell station—it is on the Blackwall side of the Stepney station.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you the husband of Susan Maynard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I agree with her in saying that in coming to this place it is as near to come by the back as the front—if he came under the railway-arch, I think it would be the same—sergeant Smith went to the front-door, and I to the back; and Essen was with us at the front, to identify the box and the prisoner—Smith went in first—he is not here—he is not bound over—the prisoner told me he had been expecting a box from his sister; and seeing that there was a direction on it in the name of Hughes, and being directed to Stepney-green, he supposed it came from his sister, who he was expecting from the country, and he took the box, but he intended taking it back the next morning—the box had not been broken open—whether it had been unlocked, I cannot say—it was locked when I found it—the prisoner had two keys, which did not fit it, and they were returned to him—Smith tried the keys, and the prisoner said they would not fit—I did not try them myself—they were latch-keys, apparently—I believe his wife had on her bonnet and shawl when we went—the prisoner had just got out of bed, and was not dressed—it was just before seven o'clock in the morning—he said his wife was going out to get him something to drink, as he had had too much over night—she did not say she was going to the Blackwall Railway, nor that she had been there; he did not say she was going—he said he intended to return the box that morning.</p>

In consequence of that letter I went by the Ben Jonson at Stepney, at five o'clock, but did not see Roberts—I saw the prisoner while I was waiting—he asked roe if my name was not Harriet Newman—I said, "Yes"—he asked if I was not waiting for Richard Roberts—I said, "Yes"—he said if I would come with him, he would take me to Richard Roberts—I asked him the reason that Roberts did not come himself—he said he was ashamed to come himself; and I said be might well be ashamed; I followed the prisoner down by the Ben Jonson—he then stopped and beckoned a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> from the stand, took hold of my arm, and told me to go with him—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> came up, and took hold of my arm—I screamed, and told him I would not go with him—three men and a woman came up, and asked what they were going to do with me—the prisoner said it was nothing to do with them, I was his wife—they got me into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> Day got in with me—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> got on his seat, and drove on very fast—after a little while, Day held my hands while he put a handkerchief over my mouth—I recollect nothing more till I found myself on a sofa in a large house, which I have not been able to find—I saw a young woman sitting opposite me, who asked me if I was any better—I said I did not know I was ill—she made a communication to me, and gave me a knife—an elderly woman came in, and told me I must stop there all night, and gave me a glass of something, and told me I must drink that, and then I should be better—I drank some of it, and directly made an attempt to come out; but the old woman stopped me—I held the knife up to defend myself—the old woman made a noise, and three gentlemen came running down-stairs—I was then in the hall, with the knife in my hand—two of them came up, spoke to me, and forced me back again into the room—in the struggle, I cut one of them over the hand with the knife; it fell from my hand, and the old woman put me on the sofa again, and said I should not leave the house—they tried many times to get me up-stairs, but I continued to resist—one of the gentlemen put a watch and chain round my neck; I threw it on the ground—one of the gentlemen called Day into the room, and told him to go and bring a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my senses then seemed very much stupefied,</p>

               <p>but I could distinguish Day's features—he came in again and said, if I was quiet he would take roe to my father—I then left the house, and went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Day; I asked him the reason he took me there—he said it was only for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> with his chaps—he said nothing more till he got me into a very dark street, where the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped—Day got out, and said he would walk the rest of the way home with me—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove off—he walked a small distance, put a direction in my hand, and told me I must find my way home the best way I could, and left me—I found the use of my limbs was leaving me, and set myself on the step of a door—I have no notion what time it was, and know nothing more till I found myself in the hospital—when I was in the house, the young woman told me if I was a respectable woman she would advise me to go out of the house—the old woman told me I must make myself happy there for the night, for I should be made a lady of—some of the men asked me to do what I felt improper to be done—I saw Day again on the Saturday night following—there were a number of persons there, and I pointed him out, and described his clothes—corduroy trowsers, a black coat, a black neckerchief, and a cap, I don't remember of what kind—he was not dressed so before the Magistrate, nor at the beer-shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Free Hospital. I examined the prosecutrix on the 1st April, at ten o'clock—I found her very weak, as if she had been taking drink of some kind the night before—she could not move her limbs well—that state might arise from ordinary spirits,</p>

               <p>or from any drug: she was under my care from Tuesday till Saturday before she was quite recovered—I gave her an emetic at first, which weakened her very much—she was in a debilitated state, but was not really ill—my medi<lb/>cine was not such as would be the effect of keeping her in the hospital till Saturday—such a state might be produced by extraordinary intoxication; I examined her person the same morning—there were no signs of recent inter<lb/>course, and not the slightest mark of violence on her private parts or on her body.</p>

I know the prisoner—on Tuesday morning, 1st April, he came to me before ten o'clock to pay me for some washing—he asked me if <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> was at home—I said, no, he had been taken out that morning by a policeman before seven, for a young girl had been put in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> had the chloroform given to her, and was in some hospital, and I was almost out of my mind, and did not know where to go—he said, then he was in a pretty mess, like him, for he had had a girl in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and did not know whether he should get into a row, or whether he should be punished: but he did not care—I told him that was not the case, for my son was at home—he said he was very tired, and he had not slept in his mother's house for four years till that morning, when he knocked them up, and sat in a chair till breakfast-time—he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 18, John-street, Limehouse-fields. I have known Harriet Newman seventeen or eighteen years—she is about twenty-three years of age—I have written several letters for her—two years ago I wrote letters for her—I wrote one or two letters for her in the latter end of Feb. or the beginning of March—I know that, because I removed in those months—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one to the prosecutrix</hi>) in the month of March—Harriet Newman came to me early one morning before I was up, and told me she wanted a letter written—she dictated this letter herself; and when I asked her the reason, she said, "Oh, Mrs. Woodfield, it is only a <hi rend="italic">lark;</hi> Richard Roberts and myself are going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> amongst us"—she told me I was to write it in a very large hand, a man's hand, for if her young man Richard Roberts's hand would be known, and it would spoil the <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—I know nothing about their being unhappy, and wishing to be happier—I also wrote these two directions by her desire (<hi rend="italic">the directions found in the prosecutrix's hand</hi>)—I did not ask her the reason—Robert Coachford opened the door to her—she brought the writing-paper in her hand on that occasion—while this investigation was going on, I saw her a dozen times—I told her it was a very serious thing, and begged of her not to go on the last day of his being remanded—I said I would let it rest while it remained at the Thames, but if he was committed, I should feel it my duty to speak; she replied, "If you <hi rend="italic">split,</hi>" these are her own words, "I am a rained young woman"—I said, "Then you don't mind ruining the young man?"—she went with me, and showed me where Day's grandmother lived—that was within a week of his last hearing, somewhere about the Monday or Tuesday that he was going to have his last hearing at the Thames on Saturday—I had asked her mother to allow her to go with me to the grand<lb/>mother's, which she did, but the grandmother was not at home; she had gone to see her grandson, at the House of Detention—I saw the aunt—the prosecutrix was not with me then; she was waiting at a public-house close by; she did not hear what passed between me and the aunt—when I first knew her, she lived at Rhodeswell-road, near Bow-common—I have a daughter, who is much younger than her—when I first became acquainted with Newman, my daughter was somewhere about seven or eight years of</p>

               <p>age, I really cannot say: but she is nineteen now—one of these letters which I wrote for the prisoner has a kind of rusty appearance; I wrote it for her one morning, I bad no ink in the house, and borrowed my landlord's, which had coperas in it—I told Mr. Lewis, the attorney for the prosecution, the contents of the letters before I saw them, and have a witness to prove it—I did not know Day or Richard Roberts before this transaction—I never wrote a letter at Day's request, nor any of his family—I did not know where he lived till I was shown.</p>

Roberts," by the desire of Harriet Newman—she said I was to write it for a <hi rend="italic">lark,</hi> and one was to be written to her father—she did not tell me what the <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> was to be—it must have been in March, on account of the moving—I had written other letters for her; two or three years ago I wrote a love-letter for her—I am in the habit of writing letters for people—they pay me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; but knowing Newman so many years, I took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the two—I have given information for the defence, to counsel—I came with the person who took out the subpoenas in this Court, to show them where to come—I have seen my own witnesses; I have not been with every one of them, to learn what they could tell—I did not want any learning; I only wanted to come here to speak the truth, and wanted every one of the witnesses to do the same—I have seen them all here to-day—I did not see one of them before they were examined before the Magistrate—it was after the committal that I was concerned for the defence—I did not know the prisoner was in custody till he had had his second remand; they kept it all from me—I thought it was very cruel for her to appear against Day; but I did not appear before the Magistrate, because I did not want to ruin the young woman—I said, "I have known you from a baby, Harriet, and I will not <hi rend="italic">split</hi> against you, unless you prosecute this young man"—the mother said she would sell her things to prosecute him; and I said, "Mind you don't sell them to prosecute your own child"—I did not make that statement before he was committed, because I never expected it would come to a committal—in spite of all I said to her, she persisted in prosecuting, after she found Day's people would give no money—I was not at the police-court at the last hearing, nor near it—I first told what I have told you to-day to Mr. Lewis, and have a witness outside to prove it—he paid the most polite attention to all I said—I have never been insulted by him—I did not appear before the Magistrate, because I tried to save both the guilty and the innocent—I have known Newman seventeen or eighteen years.</p>

                  </hi> I am gardener to Mr. Joshua Pedley, of Forest-gate, West Ham. He has potato clamps in his ground—I know the prisoners; they live in premises adjoining my master's—about the 15th of April there was a large quantity of Regent potatoes clamped on my master's ground—on that day I saw the coachman pick some of the potatoes and put them into sacks—he made up five sacks—we left work that evening at six o'clock—I law the five sacks safe; they were put into the clamp, and covered with straw, and then with mats—next morning I went to work at six—about seven we missed two sacks of those that had been sacked up, and about three sacks of the loose potatoes from the clamp—two of the sacks which had been filled the night before, had been emptied, and the empty sacks left on the full ones—there were foot-marks which we traced from the clamp across the orchard to the corner of John Peck's garden, to the edge of a ditch; but I did not go across the ditch into his garden—Manning, the police-sergeant, compared some shoes with the foot-marks—I went with Benton to Peck's premises—I saw two sieves and about three-parts of a sack of potatoes in a shed adjoining his house—I went to a clamp in his garden, and found about two sacks and a half of potatoes there—they were exactly of the same sort as my master's—these are some that were in the clamp, and these are some that were in the shed—they are both exactly the same sort as were in my master's clamp—</p>

                  </hi> I am coachman to Mr. Pedley.

On 16th April, I went to the clamp in Mr. Pedley's garden, and saw footsteps from the clamp across an orchard, and from there to a ditch that led to the prisoner's garden—that was about two o'clock in the day—the footsteps appeared fresh, as if made the night before—I did not cross the ditch which divides the gardens—I could see very plainly that a plank had been put across—there was the impression on both sides very plain, immediately at the point to which I traced the footsteps—I found a plank in the prisoner's garden—I measured it with a piece of stick, and then measured it to the impression; it exactly corresponded—I searched Peck's premises—I found the two sieves of potatoes, and three parts of a sack—the officer then found the others in a clamp—I took John Peck, jun.—I told him the charge—he said they were all grown there—I took the father, and told him what he was charged with—he said that he grew them all—I took him back to his own house—I showed the potatoes to him, and said, "These are the potatoes I allude to"—he then said he bought two sacks of his eldest son—he was then taken into custody—I afterwards examined the</p>

                  </hi> I am a farmer, and live at Bowditch. I bought a horse and a mare—the prisoner was with the man I bought them of—on 25th April, about the middle of the day, he passed by my house—I saw the hone and mare safe that evening in the yard; the gate was shut—on the following morning, between five and six o'clock, the horse and mare were missing—they were brought back to me by a policeman—I am certain they are mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 38.) On 15th Feb., in consequence of something, I went with a man named Owen to a house at Marsh-end, New<lb/>port Pagnell, Buckinghamshire—I saw a person named Griffin in the house—I searched it—I found a great many articles of all descriptions in the shop, five pairs of boy's braces, seven pairs of men's—they were shown to Mr. Thomas—I found two waistcoats in a box, which were shown to Furmer—on the following Friday I went to William, about two miles and a half from New<lb/>port Pagnell, and saw Abbott at a house there—I asked him if be knew George Pearson Barrett, he said he did—I asked him if he had heard he was in trouble—he said, "Yes;" I asked if he had had a letter from him; he said he had—I told him I was an officer, and he need be very careful what answers he made me, as I should have to use them against him in another place—I asked him what goods he had had from Greorge Barrett at different times—he said he had had no goods of him—I asked him if he meant to say he had had nothing from him—he said, "I had a couple of handkerchiefs, and a pair of braces, nothing else,"—I said I must search his house, as there were a great many things that had been stolen by Barrett which had not been found—I asked him if he was not a hawker, and if he did not carry a pack—he said he was not, and he did not carry a pack—I searched a bedroom in his presence, and found in a watch-pocket, at the head of the bed, this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced)—</hi> I opened it, turned to Abbott, and said, "This is a stolen watch; it is one of three watches stolen out of a truss of goods"—he said, "My brother Wil<lb/>liam, who is dead, had it of George Barrett;" his sister, who was there, said, "Yes"—he said he was sorry for what he had said to me before about not having more things of Barrett, that he had told me a lie, and if he had known what it was coming to he would not have done it, and that he would tell me all the dealings he had had with him—he mentioned about a dozen persons to whom he had sold goods, and said he would go with me to them, and render me every assistance he could, and he was sorry he had not done so in the first instance; and that he had sold lengths of cloth, tweed, gown-pieces, and some coats to them—he said Barrett was his brother-in-law; that he was not a hawker, for he did not dispose of the things, he did not take them</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Enoch Barrett been in the Company's employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known him there about five years, but he has been longer than that—he had received a gratuity from the Company for good conduct, in Jan. last—it would be necessary for him to be at his post, at the switches, when the train was coming out—his hands would be employed, and his feet also—there is a guard to the goods-trains, an engine-driver, and a fireman—I cannot tell who was the guard on that night—I have endeavoured to ascertain, but could not—there is not more than one switchman on duty at the same time at that place—a person named George Wood was the other—he is now employed on another part of the line—I cannot say that he was not switchman at that time—if a train is delayed for any considerable time, the guard would have to make a report to the station-master—the guard would never leave the train he has charge of—his seat is in the last carriage—he could not command a view of the whole train—I do not know the number of carriages that were in the train that night—I never knew of a goods-train with so little as three carriages, or even ten or twenty—the reports were made verbally; they could be made to the head manager, Mr. Hawkins—I heard of the loss of this parcel immediately after<lb/>wards—I do not know that any inquiry was made at to who was the guard on the train that night—the first inquiry was in the hands of Carpenter; it did not come into my hands till 13th Feb. this year.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The goods-trains generally consist of a vast number of carriages, do they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are very heavy trains—it would be easy while one man stopped the train, for another to take a parcel out—that train sometimes stops at Hay ward's-heath, when it has goods for there—if there were no goods for Hayward's-heath, it would go right through—there is another short train, which takes the intermediate stations.</p>

Between five and six o'clock, I saw some persons come out of a beer-shop—two of them, Lynch and Walsh, commenced fight<lb/>ing—I went up to them, and persuaded them to go away, and be quiet—Lynch said, "If you come near me, I will break your b y jaw"—I went towards him, and he struck me a violent blow on the left jaw with his fist, which staggered me—I then took him into custody, when he kicked at my privates, but caught my thigh; 141, Congdon, then came up to my assistance, and I took hold of Lynch on one side of his collar, and Congdon on the other, and tried to get him to the station—the prisoner came up while this was going on, stood in a fighting position, with his right hand clenched and bent towards roe, and said, "Loose him, loose him! will you?"—he then struck me with his fist under the right ear, which staggered me to the ground, and caused me to lose my hold of Lynch—when I got up again, I found the prisoner in Congdon's custody—I went to assist him, and the prisoner struck me several foul blows with his fist in the pit of the stomach—he then took hold of Congdon's staff, and tried to take it from him, but did not succeed; he then tried, several times, to take my staff away—we conveyed him a little further, under the railway-arch, when Congdon received a brick or stone, which struck him in the back of the head, and knocked him sense<lb/>less on the ground—I still had hold of the prisoner; I was then so disabled in my arms, that I could not hold my staff, and a brick caught me on the left arm from some person, which caused me to release the prisoner—he then took hold of my staff with both his hands, twisted it out of my possession, and hit me several blows with it over the head and neck, which caused my hat to come off—I then said, "Don't hit me over the head"—he said, "You b—r, I will kill you;" and he struck me over the left side of the head, which caused a wound, and knocked me senseless to the ground—I remember no more till I was taken to the hospital.</p>

On 2nd May, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in plain clothes in George-street, Richmond—I saw Newman pass along at a quick pace towards London, with a bundle—I overtook him at the railroad-bridge, and asked him what he was in such a hurry for—he said he was going to Turnham-green—I told him I was a policeman, and I wished to know what was in the bundle—he said, "Some dirty linen"—I asked what sort of linen—he said he did not know—I told him to open it—he opened one half of the bundle, and instead of showing me linen he showed me part of a gown—I told him to undo the rest of the bundle—he refused—I took the bundle, and told him if he would not untie it he should take it to the station—he would not—he said if he must go to the station I should carry the bundle—at the station I opened the bundle, and found in it some bread and meat, some soap, a gown, an apron, and some tart—I asked him how he came by them—he said he got them up the town, but he would not tell me where—I went and made inquiry—I found the other prisoner, and took her into custody—I went to her master's house, and asked if such a person lived there, and Heath came forward—I asked her if Thomas Newman had called at the house—she said, "Yes," he bad called that afternoon—I asked her if she gave him anything—she said, "Yes," she gave him this bundle, with some victuals, and what was in it—she wanted to see her mistress; and she said, "Oh pray, policeman, you are not going to lock me up?"—she saw her mistress, and she fell on her knees, and clasped her hands together, and said, "Pray, forgive me!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son and clerk of John Hogarth. Amongst the consignments of iron we have at our wharf, we have same—Blenarvon and some Coltness iron—there is no other place within two miles and a half of our house to which Coltness iron is consigned—it comes in ships from the works, and comes to our wharf in barges—after it is stacked it cannot of itself fall into the water—we had several cargoes of Coltness iron landed lately, and from two or three of them we found a deficiency—as we were landing it we weighed it, and when the whole was landed we found a deficiency between the quantity consigned to us and that we received—the barge does not generally lie off our wharf more than half a dozen hours before the iron is landed—it may lie one day—we knew of this iron being landed, and we missed some, according to the bill of lading—we missed some of the Blenarvon iron after it was stacked, but not of the Coltness iron—I should think the Coltness iron must have been taken from the barge or from the wharf—it had been all landed before we weighed it—we landed 200 or 300 tons, and it might have been a week before it was weighed—during that time it was lying in a loose state—it could not have tumbled into the water—a week or ten days previous to Kennett's being apprehended I went to Cox's shop, in the Broadway, Rotherhithe, 400 or 500 yards from our wharf—it is more properly a long shed—it contains rope, and rags, and iron—I was passing by the door, and I saw a quantity of pig-iron, which I knew a person carrying on the business that he does not deal in—it is iron from the mine, which has never been worked—anybody cat tell that this is unwrought iron—it is cast in the mining in pigs, and brought here in pigs, and then put into the furnace and melted—I went into the shop—Cox was engaged with a customer—I walked round, and I said, "Mr. Cox, I believe we have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120154"/>
               <p>robbed of this pig-iron"—he said, "Stop a minute; I will speak to you"—I said I was in haste, I could not stop; I would call again—I told him not to sell it till he saw me again—he knew me—we used to buy old iron of him—he knew the character of the iron—he has been frequently on our wharf—I then left him—after Eennett was taken, I went to Cox's again with the policeman—I asked Cox what he had done with the pig-iron I had seen pre<lb/>Blenarvon in the shop—he said he had sold it—I asked him where he had sold it—he said he did not know that he was obliged to tell me; it was very unpleasant for him to tell me who his customers were—I had an officer with me in uniform, and he said, "Well, Cox, I have a man in custody for stealing some iron belonging <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Hogarth, and I must see the iron"—Cox said, "Will the afternoon do?"—the officer objected, and said he must see it at once—Cox then asked him to let him go and put his hat on, and he joined us in about five minutes at the Europa Inn—Cox had told me in the shed that the iron was over the water—I asked him if we should take a boat—he said, "Oh, no; it is on this side of the water"—he then took us to Mr. Hart's foundry, in Cottage-grove—we looked over his stock, and found llcwts. of pig-iron all broken in pieces—there were no whole pigs—some of the pieces had the brand on them, and some had not—I examined it carefully, and hare not the least doubt of its being our iron—the greater part was Coltness iron, but there was some Blenarvon with it—I believe they were our property, and taken from our wharf—some portion of it was taken to my father's wharf, but not this part that is produced—this brand is not our own brand; it is the brand of the works; but all that has been sent to London this year has been consigned to us—when I found this iron, Cox said it was the same iron that I had seen at his place, and that he had sold it to Hart—I asked him of whom he had bought it—he said, the greater part of Powell, of the dredging-machine, and that he had bought from 2cwt. to 3cwt. of the man we had in custody, and the entry would be found in his book, under the name of "Smith"—I said, "The man we have in custody has given the name of 'John Kennett,' and has given no address"—(Cox had not seen Kennett at that time, to my knowledge)—I do not know Powell—I know the dredging-machine; it is in various parts of the river—it has been lying at Horsleydown, about a mile distant from us—I told Cox he ought not to have sold the iron when I told him not—he said, as I did not call, he thought he bad a right so to do—about a week or ten days elapsed between my calling on him and my going again with the officer—he said the man he bought it of, told him he got it from the mud in front of Hogarth's wharf; that he had only bought of him on two or three occasions, and the last time he told him not to bring any more, he would not buy it—he told me he only sold one lot of pig-iron to Mr. Hart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron-master, in partnership with Thomas Howard, carrying on business at the King and Queen iron-works, Rotherhithe—we have iron come alongside our wharf in barges—I had missed some heavy pieces of iron cut off the ends of bolts, in consequence of which I went with inspector Monaghan, on 5th May, to the prisoner's shop, which was about 300 or 400 yards off, a marine-store shop—he and his wife were there—I asked him if he had bought any heavy pieces of iron—he said, "No,"—the iron he had bought was lying about the shop—I saw several pieces of light iron, hoops, and nails—I saw Noakes search a heap of iron behind the counter, and pull out this end of a bolt (<hi rend="italic">produced)—I</hi> said that was the description of iron we were in search of; it was underneath; he was several minutes before he found it—he continued to produce pieces of heavy iron—I said, "That is my iron," and asked the prisoner when he bought it—he said, "On Friday last;" and he did not know the name of the parties, but be should know them again; that he objected to it, and they said it was all right, he was perfectly safe; it was their perquisites—I asked him if he had a book, and he brought a few leaves of an old book—I found 2 cwt 20 lbs. of iron, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; which I believe to be mine.</p>
