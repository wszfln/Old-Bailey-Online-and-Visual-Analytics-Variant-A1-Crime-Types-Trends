            . The prisoner occupied a shop on the ground floor, a little room which joins that shop, and a kitchen under his shop, on the basement story. This model (examining it) is a correct plan of the premises. The premises occupied by him have no communication whatever with my dwelling-house, nor any other part of the premises. While they were building there was a communication from his kitchen to mine, but that was stopped up four years ago, before the building was complete: it was a doorway, and was stopped up on my side, by a brick wall as thick as the party wall, except the width of the door. The door between his shop and parlour has six or eight panes of glass in it. On the night of the <rs id="t18241202-1-cd3" type="crimeDate">31st of October</rs>

                        targets="t18241202-1-off1 t18241202-1-cd3"/> I and my family were all in bed by ten o'clock. Between half-past one and two I perceived a slight smoke in my bed-room; my wife awoke me - she is unable to attend here, being near her confinement. I attributed the smell to our night lamp being badly trimmed, but it gradually increased: I opened my bed-room window, and got into bed again; I had then been awake half or three quarters of an hour. A few minutes after half-past two, finding the smoke increase, I opened my room door, proceeded to search the house, and found smoke in every part of it. I went into my drawing-room, which is over the prisoner's shop; there is no carpet down - I ran across the floor; I had no shoes on, and I think I made sufficient noise for any one to hear below. I spoke to my family as I went into the different rooms. As I ran over the house I heard the shutters of the prisoner's room forced into the street; they are outside shutters, and fell completely into the street. I called to my family to hasten down, for Haley's premises must be on fire; we all left the house, and proceeded about fifty yards, to Mr. Illman's house, in Argyle-street; he took the family in, and I returned in two minutes, and perceived smoke issuing from over Haley's shop door, which is at the corner of Argyle-place and King-street. I also saw smoke ascending from the area grating in Argyle-place. I told two men to break the door open, and I ran for water, and on my return I found the shop door open, and saw fire burning in one corner of Haley's shop, over the covered way of the kitchen stair case; there was very little fire but much smoke - it was soon put out; there was still a very heavy smoke, but I could not tell where it proceeded from. I took some firemen with me, and went to examine my drawing-room floor. The ceiling of his shop is not plaister, but the joists are covered with wood, and is plugged, and the drawing-room floor is wood. I returned to the shop in three or five minutes, and observed a heavy smoke coming from the kitchen, up from the stair-case door, and from a hole which somebody had cut in the floor. I called to know if any one was below, and was told that two men were - it was half an hour before I saw anything but smoke, and in that interval I had gone to Mr. Illman's, and was backwards and forwards repeatedly, during which time I saw nothing of the prisoner. When I was over at Mr. Illman's, a person ran to say the fire had broken out again; I went to the premises, and saw fire issuing through two distinct places in the shop floor, close to the stair head, but five or eight feet below the place where I saw the first fire, for that was over the stair head, not inside it; I saw none inside the stair head - it was about a yard from it: I ran to assist at the engine, and in three minutes saw fire burst out through the shop window in Argyle-place, in every direction; the fire did not issue through the floor till half an hour after the fire on the top of the stair head was put out. The shop window frames were burnt out. Supposing the floor to be an inch board, about half or three quarters of it was burnt on the upper surface; the flame having come through the two holes. I saw the wooden ceiling of the shop on fire - the shop walls are partly wainscoated; the other part was only whitewashed, with shelves against it. The wainscoat extended to the ceiling; it was burnt inside, but not through. The kitchen stair-case was burnt, and nearly all of it fell in.</p>
               <p>Q. In January last had you any dispute with the prisoner - A. In November preceding I had; he has been in the house three years; we both went into the premises together, and in November 1823, we took our lease, and a day or two after we had signed the lease, the prisoner knocked at my door about eight o'clock in the evening, and demanded to see me; I heard violent language, and went down, and in consequence of what the servant said, I went to Mr. Thompson, next door, and went with him to the prisoner, and told him that his conduct was improper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020004"/>- his wife pulled him in doors, and I saw no more of him. I saw him next morning, and told him his conduct was improper in making a disturbance at my door, and I hoped he was sensible of his error - he said he was not, and I made a complaint at Marlborough-street; a warrant was issued against him. I went to his shop with the officers two or three times, but could not find him; he afterwards confessed his error, and I declined proceeding. I have seen his wife dressed in a brown bombazeen gown, but never in silk; her dress was plain, and consistent. I think I could even define her dress, for she was so particular in wearing three gowns - I scarcely ever saw her in any others. I saw her daily, and must have observed if she had frequently worn silk. The prisoner <rs id="t18241202-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">dealt in wood, oysters, fruit, and green grocery</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your business - A. A wine merchant. I ship to various parts. My stock on the premises is worth about 20,000 l. I do not call the prisoner a fruiterer - he is more of a green grocer; he served some very respectable families, and I have heard him mention a nobleman who dealt with him; I saw his wife when she was in her business, and have seen her on Sundays, but not when she went out. He paid 52 l. a year for his premises; I had not received his rent. I awoke my family before I walked over the drawing-room floor. The first fire I perceived was over the stair head; there is a press bed under the same stair head, and under the stair case is a closet; whether the fire which came through the floor came from that closet I cannot say. There were bundles of fire wood over the stair head - I saw smoke issue from there, and a little fire. After the second fire was out the prisoner came and stooped down by my side, as I was looking down into the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. On Sunday night, the 31st of October, I was at my station opposite to the prisoner's house; he came to me about ten o'clock, and said, "Watchman, it is a wet and cold evening, here is sixpence for you, go and get yourself a glass of stiff grog;" he had at times given me 3 d. for calling him, but never gave me money before for grog. I remained on my beat, and as I was calling two o'clock, in passing his shop and parlour window, I heard their child crying, in the parlour where they sleep, and on my return, between two and half-past, I heard somebody speaking very loud in the parlour. I went into my box at a quarter to three o'clock, and in two or three minutes heard their parlour shutters falling on the pavement - I went over, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and his daughter, Mary, standing inside the parlour window - his wife screamed, and said, "Watchman, for God's sake - there must be fire somewhere, for we are almost suffocated." I put my head towards the window, and saw a glimmering light, apparently by the bed side; Mrs. Haley said it was a rush light, and I believe it was so, but I could hardly perceive for the smoke. At that instant an infant in its night gown was put into my arms; I stepped into the middle of the street, and did not see Mr. and Mrs. Haley come out. Four or five watchman had collected on hearing the shutters fall. I went for the engine, and sprang my rattle; three engines came. The alarm ceased, and some of the neighbours went to their beds, and in half an hour there was another alarm. I saw the flames burst from the shop window - it was soon extinguished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had given you money several times before - A. Yes, 3 d. at a time, for calling him. Six penny worth of grog would not make me tipsy - I did not get it; if I had gone for it, it would not have kept me off my beat two minutes. The first alarm I heard was from the prisoner and his wife; I did not see either of them after they gave me the child; his wife was not dressed: he was in his shirt, and I think had drawers on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There were several watchmen there who could have got into the room - A. Yes, my Lord. No fire had broken out then: it was not discovered for full ten minutes after the shutters were forced down. I believe some firemen were there before the fire was discovered.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Marlborough-street and Argyle-place, about a quarter to three o'clock, with Fowles, another watchman, and perceived a smell of smoke or wood burning; we went to Argyle-place, and before we got to the house we heard the shutters fall, and on arriving opposite to the prisoner's window, in Argyle-place, I saw smoke coming through the shop door, and up the area grating; I gave an alarm, and perceived the prisoner getting out at the window, in his night cap and shirt; I saw his wife and child standing in the room, behind him. I ran for an engine, and on returning attempted to break open the shop door, but could not: I assisted the fireman in taking the shutters down; the door was opened from within by somebody, but the smoke being so strong the fireman could not go in; he went in once or twice: the smoke abated, and I followed him in again, and saw fire at the top of the frame work, over the stair-case - I assisted in putting it out, and found that it was fire wood, and apparently old fruit baskets had been burning. I still perceived smoke, which appeared to originate from below, and about half an hour after I saw fire coming from below - the engines came and extinguished it. I saw the prisoner there - he appeared distressed. I did not see him take any part in putting it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him when the fire over the stair head was being put out - A. He was at the shop door; he had drawers and shoes on. The first fire was easily put out. Several people and firemen were present. The shutters could not be got down without the inside pins being unfastened. I saw the prisoner in the shop eight or ten minutes after I entered the shop, and I saw his family in Sharrow's box; they only had a few clothes just slipped on.</p>

            . I belong to the London Union Insurance Office. On this morning, about three o'clock, in consequence of an alarm I went to these premises; I saw smoke coming out of the crack of the door, and the shutters; I was going to break the door open, but the prisoner opened it - he had a lighted candle or rush light in his hand; I think it was a candle; he was in his shirt and night cap, and I believe had drawers on. I could not go into the shop for the smoke and heat of the fire. I went to the window in Argyle-place, and broke it open with my pole-axe, to clear the room from smoke; I got into the shop, and unfastened the shutters of that window, inside, let out the smoke, and perceived fire on the top of the stair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020005"/>head - I raked down the fire wood and orange boxes, which were on fire, and extinguished it; it appeared to me that all the fire in the house was put out - I left the house safe, as I thought, and went to acquaint our foreman, as is usual. I did not examine the top of the stair head, to see if it was burnt through or not. I had not seen any smoke come from below. I was not there at the second fire. There was a bedstead in the stair head, an old quilt and a bed were on it, but there were neither sheets nor blankets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much water put the first fire out? A. There were a dozen or two pails thrown on it. The fire would more than fill a bushel basket. The firemen had links in their hands, which make a smoke - there was a smoke when I left, but I thought it was from the links.</p>

            . I am engineer of the County Fire Office. I was informed of the fire and took an engine; I got there about three o'clock, and assisted in putting out the fire over the stair head; it was nearly out when I got there - about half an hour after that it was quite out. I attempted to go down stairs upon seeing a smoke. I tied my handkerchief over my nose and mouth, and went down three times before I could get to the bottom, in consequence of the smoke; two holes were cut in the floor to let it out. I then went down backwards and threw a pail of water at the cupboard door under the stairs, as I felt that the heat proceeded from that direction - I went up stairs; Westwood and I then crawled down with a link, and when we got to the cupboard door it was buttoned - I could not unbutton it. Page lowered us down a pole-axe, which I wrenched it open with, and a great body of fire rushed out with a great noise; it forced me backward, and as soon as I recovered myself I escaped up stairs, and the blaze followed us; it burnt about twenty minutes before it was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now being acquainted with fires what is your judgment - were these two separate fires, or did one communicate with the other? A. The stairs were between the two fires - there was no fire on the stairs; in my judgment they were two distinct fires. The fire in the cupboard must have been burning some minutes. I do not conceive that there could be any place, by which the fire below could communicate with that on the stair head, or I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stair-head, as you call it, is a sort of closet, inclosing the stairs from the shop? A. Yes; the top of it forms a shelf; the fire was on that shelf, and rather more over the shop than the kitchen closet. I cannot say whether the closet was wainscoated or bare walls.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge what there was in the cupboard below? A. No, my Lord; there is no doubt but the fire had been in the cupboard for a considerable time; I cannot say how long. If it had been combustible materials it would very soon have burnt out. I could not turn the button of the door because it was so hot I could not hold it; but I think there must have been another fastening.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Royal Exchange Assurance. I got to the premises before Smart, and saw the fire over the stair-head - it burnt quite through the back part of the wainscoat. I looked at the press-bed place - there was nothing in it but the bed, and that was on fire; there were no blankets or sheets; it did not appear that any one had slept there - it seemed shook up. I continued on the premises, and went down stairs with Smart, about half an hour after the first fire was put out. I cut the holes in the floor to let the smoke out.</p>
               <p>Q. When the ticking was on fire, was the fire being raked from the stair-head? A. Yes; the fire might have fallen off the stair-head on to the ticking. As far as my judgment goes, I think the fire on the stair head, and in the cupboard, were distinct fires.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The wainscoat at the back part, was burnt through - could, therefore, a spark drop down between the wainscoat and wall, into the kitchen cupboard? A. I do not conceive that it could, for the wainscoat is close to the wall; there was not above three or four inches of the wainscoat burnt through.</p>

            . I am engineer to the Royal Exchange Insurance office, and was present when the first fire was put out, and about twenty minutes after some of the skirting-board was taken away, by the bedstead, and we found an effusion of smoke issuing from the wainscoat. It appeared to me to be two distinct fires - there was a counter in the shop and some fixtures.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There must have been fire behind the wainscoat, as the fire came from there? A. I conceive that it came from below. I did not go below. If part of the wainscoat was burnt through, fire might drop below, and set fire to any thing there.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and was employed by Mr. Thompson to assist in building these premises. I have examined them since the fire; there is no hole through the stair-head enclosure; the wainscoat above it is nailed close to the wall. It is not possible for any thing to drop between them. I am not certain whether the wainscoat goes down further than the bulk of the stair-head. It is impossible for fire to fall from the top of the stair-head, or from the wainscoat, into the cupboard under the kitchen stairs; it must fall on the stairs before it could fall to the cupboard. I cannot conceive any means by which the two fires could have communicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you undertake to swear that it is impossible? A. I conceive it quite so. I made this examination on the 1st of November, by desire of Mr. Thompson. The stairs above the cupboard were not burnt - part of the shop floor was burnt, but whether it was burnt through I cannot tell, I will not say that there was no space through which fire might not fall.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say that the wainscoat above the stair head, was nailed to the partition - A. Yes; to the wall, between the two houses - I could perceive no space between them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the wainscoat nailed to the wall all along? A. Yes; my Lord, there are two nails in the space of four or five inches; wood is placed between the bricks, to nail it to. I have not examined the place where the hole was burnt, to see if there was any space - if there was, anything would fall on the stairs; the cupboard is only plaistered, and the plaister is all sound. If water had been poured down the place it would not have gone into the cupboard; the wharping of the wainscoat by the fire might have drawn the nails out.</p>

            . I live in Argyle place. The premises in question belong to me. Elrington and Dundee hold a lease under me. I built them myself; and examined them after the fire: it is very improbable that fire could have fallen from the hole which was burnt behind the wainscoat, into the kitchen cupboard; but it would be difficult to say that it is impossible. The basement is a nine-inch solid brick wall, but higher up there is a set off of two inches on each side; the wainscoat only extends to the floor of the shop; the staircase is lined with boards, to keep the plaister from being broken. The bottom of the kitchen cupboard is fourteen feet from the top of the stair-head; the cupboard is plaistered up to the stairs. I was called down one evening about the prisoner making a noise before Mr. Dundee's door, and told him it was extremely improper: he called him a swindler, or something of the kind, and complained of his taking the shop over his head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was the prisoner apprehended? A. I believe on the Thursday. I suppose the parties had not made up their minds that there was sufficient suspicion to take him before. The solicitor for the prosecution was out of town at the time of the fire.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Since the execution of the lease has not the prisoner offered to pay you the rent on account of Thompson, but not on account of Dundee? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had you any conversation with him, in which he said any thing of Mr. Dundee? A. Repeatedly. I have endeavoured to prevail upon him to give up the premises without litigation; he said, on one occasion, that if all his family went to the workhouse, he would spend every sixpence he had in contesting the point, and that he considered Mr. Dundee his greatest enemy, or a very great enemy. The last interview I had with him was on the 27th of October, when he tendered the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He, at the same time, expressed a determination to keep the premises? A. That was at other times; there were four quarters rent due besides what he tendered; we had distrained for three quarters, and it was replevined.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and was employed by Mr. Crombie to levy a distress on the prisoner's goods in July; my clerk made an inventory of them; I compared it with his goods on the Wednesday after the fire, when I was directed by the Insurance Company to assess the damages. I saw the prisoner, and asked if he would give me an inventory, to the best of his knowledge, of the goods which were destroyed; he said I was in possession of the inventory taken under the distress. I shewed it to him, and asked if it was correct; he said it was; I asked if he claimed any thing besides; he said, No; nor so much; for he had sold some of his furniture to carry on the lawsuit - (the replevin.) I asked why he sold his furniture when he had 95 l. in the house; he said that was part of the produce of the goods he had sold. The value of the furniture in its perfect state, without fixtures, is 20 l. I asked him for an inventory of the wearing apparel; he said he must go to his wife and get one, which he afterwards brought me; he said the wearing apparel was in the kitchen closet under the stairs, in a hair trunk, and had been consumed. I examined the closet particularly, and could find no remains of the trunk, or any ashes of such articles; there were the remains of a quantity of old stockings and shirts; one of the firemen took them out - they were in a very bad state from wear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after the fire was this interview? A. On Wednesday; he had delivered an inventory at the Office before. I think he could replace the furniture in the same state as before for 20 l. I think if there had been six silk gowns burnt there would be some traces of them - there was no trace of the trunk or any thing.</p>
               <p>A list of the wearing apparel given in by the prisoner, was here read: it consisted of common articles, except one silk gown, two poplin ones, and two of bombazeen, lace caps, and a cloth and silk pelisse; and stated that his daughter had lost about the same articles.</p>

            . I am engineer to the Beacon Insurance Office. I examined the closet on Monday morning, and found some shirts and stockings burnt half through; the feet were all worn out, and the shirts much worn at the back; they were about the centre of the cupboard. I found no remains of a hair trunk, nor any silk or woollen; there were ashes of stockings. I stripped down part of the wainscoat, where it was burnt, and could see no space for any thing to go behind. I cannot say that it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean that you do not think it likely? A. No. There had been a great deal of water thrown into the house, and a great many people had been in. I saw the prisoner after the engine had done playing, and asked where his property lay; he said, "All in this closet," and that he had lost his pocket book from the small room; I could not find it. I asked where his policy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020007"/>was; he said, down in the hair trunk in this closet - I went there, and found it, with the remains of two account books, but no trunk. The floor of the closet was burnt quite through. I found the policy in a drawer of the counter. The cupboard runs under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the trunk to be in front, the rush of air would have caused it to burn more than what was under the stairs? A. I think there must be some remains of it.</p>

The prisoner directed me to a door place in the kitchen, and said that there was access to Mr. Dundee's premises, and the fire might have occurred through there, and that he might set the place on fire as well as anybody else. I found the door was nailed up, and there is a brick wall on the other side.</p>

In November, 1823, I remember the prisoner calling one evening and abusing Mr. Dundee very much - he d - d him, and said he was a scoundrel and villain - that he had been kicked out of a dozen regiments, for bad conduct, and that he would knock or kick his brains out if he met him.</p>

            . I am husband of the witness Priscilla Redman, and have known the prisoner ten or eleven years - his children were in the habit of coming to our house, and staying for a day or a week together. I had not spoken to him for the last twelve or eighteen months, but the children still came. On Saturday evening two of his children, John and Mary, came to go with me to Streatham Wells on the Sunday, but it turned out wet, and Tom came on Sunday afternoon, with Mary, his eldest daughter, to fetch them home; but they did not wish to go, and we desired them to stop, as it was wet - Mary left the children, as my wife said she would take them home on Monday. When I used to see the prisoner's wife she used to dress creditably. I think I saw her in a silk gown two or three years ago.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter, and am sixteen years old - I keep my father's books, and make out his bills; the bills are generally made out on Sunday evenings, to deliver on Monday. I sleep in the shop, and sometimes in the kitchen; some of the children sleep in the shop, and some in the kitchen. On the night in question I slept in the bed in the shop; nobody slept in the kitchen, as the children were at Mr. Redman's - I had gone to fetch them home that afternoon; my brother Thomas went with me, but it being wet Mrs. Redman said they had better stop, and she would bring them home next day. I got home between five and six o'clock, and was making out the bills in the kitchen. My father and mother went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and left me up, making out the bills, and about half-past ten I put the bills and books into the closet under the stairs; I put them on one of the shelves - it has no fastening, but a wooden button; there was a large hair trunk in the closet, which had part of our wearing apparel, and 95 l. in Bank notes in it - I saw the notes in the trunk on the Saturday - several customers had paid large bills just before, in July and August, and some in September.

            , and several other respectable persons deal with us - their bills are 2 l. 3 l. and sometimes 4 l. a week; Mr. Coke's bills are 4 l. or 5 l., and sometimes 7 l. a week - they have fruits and vegetables which are out of season. My mother had a silk and a poplin gown, two bombazeen ones, a black silk and a cloth pelisse - a large silk and two cotton shawls, and some sheeting in the trunk. My father had a suit of black and blue clothes, shirts and stockings, in good condition. I was about as well clothed as my mother. I was awoke by a suffocating smell, which made me almost insensible; I could not tell the time. I felt round the shop, and pushed open the door where my father and mother slept; I fell down two steps, and screamed out: my father went and opened the shutters - the two little children were in bed with him; one is three years old, and the other between fourteen and fifteen months; my father called the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020008"/>watchman; my mother handed the child to him - my father went out with the little boy - the children were in their night clothes. I was naked all but my shift - my mother had her night gown on; the watchman helped us out. I had perceived no fire, only the suffocating smell; we went into the watch box opposite; my father came over with us, then returned, and when the shutters were down I saw him inside the shop, running about. Mr. Jupp sent his son with clothes for us, and took us into his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the closet besides what you have mentioned - A. My mother put some old rags and linen in as a store, in case the children had burns - it was in a basket under the stairs at the back of the closet; part of my father and mother's wearing apparel hung on pegs in the closet. Wood and old orange boxes were kept on the staircase enclosure; there were some sieves and bottles over my bed.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What is the size of the cupboard - A. It is large and high, and runs under the stairs, and has two shelves; the hair trunk was a large one - it had a lock and handles at the end; our apparel was not put in separately; the money was in a red pocket book at one corner, at the bottom of it. On Friday, the 19th of November, I was in the kitchen and saw a bit of the hair trunk - it was the part near the handle - I picked it off the floor - my mother saw it. - I might be five or ten minutes before I could find the door of my father's room. I never said it was half an hour; the piece of the trunk was left in the kitchen. I did not know that the officers had been searching for the remains of the trunk; my father burnt a rushlight or candle that night; when I forget to fetch a rush we burn a candle; the 95 l. consisted of 5 l. and 10 l. notes. I had not counted them, but my father said there was 95 l.; there is glass to the door of my father's room, but I was too much flurried to notice the light.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your mother's silk gown new or old - A. New; the poplin gown was nearly new, and both the bombazeens, and the black silk pelisse was nearly new; she had bought the silk gown five or six months before, and the poplin twelve months, but did not wear them much; she bought the silk in Titchfield-street, and the silk shawl at Mr. Brown's, in Parliament-street. I had a silk gown, a poplin, and three bombazeen gowns; we had a chest of drawers, but they were sold six or seven months ago; we sold a mahogany bedstead and table and other things at the same time, as our bills did not come in fast enough, and my father wanted a great deal of ready money - we had two hair trunks, one was in the parlour.</p>

I looked round and saw him going up the ladder from the bottom of the dock. I asked him why he had been in the dock - he gave me no answer. I saw a sheet of copper in his hand, and sung out "Thief, here is a man stealing copper;" he ran away, and Mr. Hope stopped him. I saw him heave the copper down a sawpit - I jumped down and picked it up. I gave it to the steward - he was quite a stranger.</p>

            . I was in the dock-yard, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards the gate followed by Richards; he had a sheet of copper which he threw into a saw-pit. I took hold of him, and the boy jumped into the saw-pit, and took out the copper - it may be worth 5 or 6 s.</p>

I went to my stable and found it locked; and when it was opened, I saw the meat on a truss of hay in the loft, slightly covered with hay. I left it there, and saw him about twenty minutes after, coming home from market with the horse and cart. I told him to get out of the cart and take the mare away - he went to the stable, and I followed him with an officer. I found him in the hay-loft, and called him down. I then told him to fetch the piece of meat down: he said, he would not; and I gave him in charge, and went to the loft; the meat was not then where I had seen it before, but the prisoner went up and found it behind three trusses of hay a little further off.

I said, I could not wait an hour; he said, "Then wait ten minutes;" and as he did not return, I went home in about twenty-five minutes. I did not see him again that night, but I saw him afterwards at a friend's house where he came to take a lodging for a gentleman.</p>

I was at home when the prisoner came to take our lodgings; my husband's statement is correct; after he and the prisoner had been gone ten minutes or half an hour, the prisoner returned, and asked me to let him have 9 s. 6 d., as they were in want of some silver to pay the porterage of the gentleman's luggage; that Mr. Goddard did not happen to have any silver in his pocket, and had told him to run back to me for some. I am quite certain he said it was for Mr. Goddard to pay the porter. I gave him 2 s., which was all I had. I did not see him again.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 10th of November, while I was executing a search warrant at a marine store shop in Bethnal-green-road, the prisoner brought in some blinds and other things, for which he wanted half a crown; I was looking through a door between the shop and back parlour: the mistress of the house seemed rather confused, and tried to put him out of the shop. I then went after him, and said I would give him 1 s. 6 d. for the things: he said, "Oh! I know you, you are one of the officers of Worship-street, and I am done;" I said I should wish to know where he got the things - he said he got the blinds from a gentleman named Pitcher. I said I would go with him to his house, and as we were going he said, "It is of no use, what I told you is a lie - they are the property of Mr. Ramsey - if you will let me go I will give you the blinds;" I said I would not for 5 l.; he then said he would give me any sum to let him go.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Wreford. Mr. Dunstan told me to take some parcels to Mr. Turner; I cannot say how many there were of them. I went about half-past four o'clock on the 13th of November, and went straight to Mr. Turner's door; I did not get off the cart till I got there. On Monday, the 15th, I was told by Mr. Turner that these two parcels were missing.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court. My father is a bricklayer's labourer. Mr. Turner's house is at the corner of our court. I saw a tilted cart at his door on the 13th of November, about four o'clock - the prisoner and three or four more were there. I saw the prisoner step up the step of the cart, and take a parcel out - he gave it to another, who gave it to a third, and it got to the prisoner again; he then walked by me, and asked what I was looking at - I said nothing; he gave me a blow in the face, which made my mouth and nose bleed; I had seen him before, and knew his person. The parcel was about twenty inches square.</p>

I looked after him that night, but could not find him. I apprehended him on Monday morning, at the George public-house.</p>

I took him into a public-house and searched him. I found a glass in his hat. I sent my brother officer to Leather-lane to find the woman, but he could not.</p>

I followed him to see what direction he took; he was going towards the interior of St. Giles's. I asked him where he got it; he said, it was his own. I said, "I ask where you got it?" he said, from a man in Oxford-street. I said, "What man; where can I find him?" He then said, "I will tell you all about it. I am a very poor boy, my father and mother have left me, and I stole it."</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pocknell. On the 8th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was shutting up the shop, there was a gang of five or six persons round the window. I did not notice the prisoner, but as I was turning out of the shop with the shutters, I missed the brawn from the window; a person might have reached it from the outside before the shutters were closed. I ran down St. Martin's-lane, and saw three persons running. I called Watch! and a gentleman collared one of them; he struck him in the face and got away: while I was running towards Charing-Cross, I was knocked down by some one, but I cannot tell who. I afterwards saw the brawn at the watch-house, and the prisoner in custody. I am sure it was my master's.</p>

I did not distinguish either of them. I got beyond St. Martin's Church, and heard the cry of "Watch!" and "Stop thief!" on the other side of the way, where there were four or five persons in company running; the prisoner came by me with the brawn under his arm; he said, "Halloo! out of the way." I pursued him to the bottom of the lane; he crossed opposite to Northumberland-House. I saw him lay the brawn under the rails. I went up to him, and said, "My friend, this don't look well." I called Watch! and laid hold of him, while a person who was with me took up the brawn; the prisoner said, "For God's sake let me go, and do not say any thing about it." The watchman came up and took him. I went to the watch-house, and heard Mr. Pocknell claim the brawn.</p>

I collared him, and charged him with having stolen the handkerchief - he denied it, but I saw him shuffling at his left hand inside coat pocket, and insisted on knowing what he had there; I pulled his hand out, and the handkerchief was in it. I was taking him to the watch-house when the constable came up.</p>

I was proceeding along the Strand, when my attention was directed to the prisoner and another person, making an attempt at Mr. Godfrey's pocket. I was on the opposite side of the way, and was about to proceed across to inform Mr. Godfrey of it, when I saw the prisoner crossing with the handkerchief in his hand. Mr. Godfrey turned round, followed, and collared the prisoner in the middle of the road. I saw the handkerchief found in his hand, which was drawn from behind his coat.</p>

I felt it being drawn out of my pocket - I turned, and saw the prisoner near me, apparently in the act of gathering it up in his hand; I collared him, and said, "You scoundrel, you have my handkerchief;" he said, "I have not;" I said I was sure he had. At that time two other men, who were in company with him, came at my back, and pressed against me, but as they saw me determined, they ran away; the prisoner said "I suppose those men have stolen it;" I said I was sure he had it, as he had not had time to pass it to any others - I then pulled his hand and his coat, and wondered where it could be, when a gentleman, who came up, found it on the ground, at his feet. I have not the least doubt of his being the person who took it.</p>

            . I gave the watch to Ryley last Thursday night, about eleven o'clock; the prisoner had come to the eating-house where I live, and asked for a basin of soup, and in a few minutes a man joined her, and pulled out some silver, (I believe 15 s.;) he asked her to have the money for the watch; she said she would not take less than 18 s.; she knew he wanted to rob her; she then said to me, "Will you keep this watch for me till the morning." I thought it was not properly come by, and I called in Mr. Ryley.</p>
               <p>JOHN LETT. On Thursday night last, about seven o'clock, I was at the Red Lion, public-house - the prisoner was there, and said she thought she knew me; I got talking with her for some time, and we went on towards my home. I went to a room with her - I had had my watch in my hand just before I went in; she left the room, and said she would come back again in a minute. I put my hand to my fob, and missed my watch; I went out but could not overtake her. I saw her put something into her bosom. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We went into the room together. He gave me his watch to keep till the next night, and said if I would meet him on Westminster-bridge he would give me 5 s.</p>

I put my clothes under the pillow; there were two sixpences, and a snuff-box in the pocket of the waistcoat, a handkerchief in my coat pocket, and my hat was on the shelf. I awoke about seven o'clock and he was gone, and my things also, except my coat and one of the tops of my boots - there were two men and their wives, and a child in the room - they were not there when we went to bed - the prisoner came again about five o'clock in the afternoon - I said, "What have you done with my clothes?" he said, he had taken them to my brother's in Smithfield. I have no brother in London - he then went to bed, and said, I should have them in the morning - he pulled my clothes off himself, and I called for the watchman and gave him in custody - when we got to the watch-house, he said, I should have my clothes in ten minutes if I would give him 5 s., which he had paid for what we eat and drank the day before.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another person - they had got the cask as high as their knees, and seemed to be lifting it on the prisoner's shoulder. I went and took the prisoner, saying, he was the person I had been waiting for: he said he was pushed in - he was then taken before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>MARY FORSYTH. I live at Aberdeen, in Scotland. On the 4th of November I was at Miss Gordon's, who lives at Mr. Thorn's, in <placeName id="t18241202-42-crimeloc221">John-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

I missed the purse, and money at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th; I had left John-street at ten o'clock - I immediately went to my lodgings in Duke-street, to search, but could not find it. I did not go to John-street. The prisoner was <rs id="t18241202-42-deflabel222" type="occupation">servant</rs>

On the 4th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was at my sister's, and saw her find 16 s. or 17 s. in the coal scuttle, on the first floor landing place; I asked the prisoner what she was doing with the money in the coal scuttle; she said it was the change of a sovereign which she had received from her mother, and she had bought her child a hat with the rest. I sent for a constable.</p>

            . I am an officer. I and Westcoatt were fetched to Miss Gordon's about six o'clock - I went up into the drawing room: Miss Gordon said a lady who had slept there the night before, had sent' to say that she had lost her purse; they shewed me the silver which was found in the coal scuttle. I asked the prisoner how she became possessed of the money - she said that on Tuesday, when she came to her situation, her mother gave her a sovereign - that she had been to her mother-in-law at Somer's-town, that morning, and she had given her a half-sovereign. I then took her up to the attic, and searched her box, and found a wedding ring, apparently new; she said it was hers. We went into the kitchen, and found a sovereign and a guinea on a hand basket on the table - any one in the kitchen could see it; she said she knew nothing of it; there was a little servant girl in the house, who also had access to the kitchen. I asked her a question on the 9th of November, after she had been in custody; Westcoatt had been with her before that.</p>

            . I had been with the prisoner when she was in confinement. I made her no promise or threat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw her on the 5th? A. Yes; and had her stripped and searched by a female turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did not you say "Well, Yates, don't you think yourself a pretty creature? I have been to your mistress, and make no doubt but you will get over it if you confess the truth?" A. No; I said I had found out that she had passed a sovereign at Mr. Atkin's, for a gown and shawl - she made no answer. I then said, "You have been to purchase a bonnet at Mrs. Lacey's, in Oxford-street, for 32 s. and left a sovereign there." She said, "Yes." I said nothing whatever to induce or frighten her to confess. I then asked her "Have you left the 5 l. note in the same kind of way as the sovereign?" She said "No." I said, "What have you done with it?" She said, "Why the ring you found in my box I bought at a silversmith's in Monmouth-street, and paid 11 s. 6 d. for it." I asked what she had done with the change. She said, "Where you found the money last night, there you will find the remainder, for I threw it down in the kitchen," I went to the kitchen but could find no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you regularly employed at Marlborough-street? A. Yes; for nearly four years, and was at Bow-street before that. I frequently ask questions of prisoners, when I think I have a clue to a robbery. I said nothing to her about telling the truth.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS re-examined. On the 9th of November I asked her what she had done with the change she received out of the 5 l. note, when she bought the ring - she said "You will find it where you found the sovereign and guinea." I said "I cannot find it there - have you not left it in the purse, and put it away somewhere." She said, No, that she had thrown it into the dust hole. I went to her mistress's, and, after stirring the dust about, found a purse which I produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was six days after the first examination? A. Yes; what I said to her was in consequence of what I heard from Westcoatt.</p>
               <p>MISS FORSYTH. The purse is like mine, but I cannot swear to it. I had never minutely examined mine. I called at several places on that day.</p>

I returned a few minutes before eight - I unlocked the door - we went into the kitchen for a light, and found the clothes all over the kitchen - they were all right when I went out. I missed some lace, ribbon, and three pieces and a half of Irish cloth, from the shop - it was Urling's lace - I cannot state the value of that or the Irish, but the ribbons were worth 8 l.

            ), these are mine. I had only bought them on the 13th. I know one piece by having cut three yards off it - and another I cut one yard and a half from - another I only bought four yards and a half of, and cut one and a half off. The papers, which had marks, are taken off them. Here is another piece, which I bought in Holborn, to trim a cap; and a piece of white, which I bought at a different place - here is a narrow piece, which I bought at the warehouse, and two pieces of brown, and one piece which I bought for an order. Here are other ribbons; I can partly speak to them all - here is a piece of lace which I bought in Holborn; and the handkerchief they are tied in, is exactly like a piece, of six, which I lost; it is new now, and not hemmed. None of them have my mark now, but are all similar to what I lost - the value of the ribbons here is 5 l. or 6 l.; all that I lost cost me 8 l., and I lost a great deal more lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you lived in Leather-lane long? A. No; I know that it is in St. Andrew's parish; our part is not in the city, or we must take up our freedom. I left nobody in the house - we went to chapel, and took the servant with us. I saw the goods on Saturday night, and had not been out on Sunday morning; we just went down the lane in the afternoon, but it rained, and we returned - the servant was at home then. My mark is taken off every one of the things, - here is one piece which I marked S, on the block, but it is scraped off - the rest were marked on paper. I know nothing of the prisoner - we left the house a little after six o'clock. I cannot say whether there was sufficient light then to discover a man's features.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker. I have a piece of sand-paper which was found in the bundle with these ribbons. Shires gave it to me. I had been making the fixtures of Jones's shop, and left it there a week before the robbery - here is the word "feet," written on it in my writing - it is not so plain as when I first saw it, and it has the dust of the wood on it which I was working with - I know it by the colour of the dust.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at Bow-street, when it was much plainer than now, that you could not swear to it? Yes; but when I looked at it, it was as plain as the alphabet. I said I did not wish to swear to it; I was rather in a flurry, not having been before a Magistrate before; but when I examined it it was very plain - I was sure of it. I know the dust as plain as the writing. I told the Magistrate I could not swear to it - I had not noticed the dust then - here is a piece of the wood which I had been working on.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 18th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Goswell-street-road. I knew him before, and said, "Lot; I want you;" he said, "My name is not Lot." I said, "Your name is Cartlidge;" he said, "No, you mistake me." I said, I should take him to Bow-street - he asked what I took him for. I said, on suspicion of a robbery which took place at Margate. I left him at the office, and afterwards took him to the Queen's-Head public-house, and there searched him, and found all the property produced in his right hand coat pocket - he said, they were what he had bought - the piece of sand paper was in his pocket, with the ribbons and lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say who he bought it of? A. No - he said nothing about one Lowndes. I never recollect the name being mentioned. I swear I never heard it mentioned. I saw Howell before the Magistrate, and asked him if he could identify the writing - he said, he could not - we were ordered to make haste before the Grand Jury, fearing they would break up; and his name was not put on the bill, because he could not identify the writing - he said, next morning, it was very clear to him that it was his writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him in the office who I had them from; and Mr. Smith, at Bow-street, took down the person's name, and the public-house where I said I had bought them. Shires was present at the time. I stated to him that I had not had them in my possession a quarter of an hour, and that I had them of a person named Lowndes - that I had not wholly purchased them; but had paid part of the money down, as I thought I could find a customer for them. Lowndes told me he had bought them at a sale on the Friday before - Mr. Smith and Ellis were present at the time - it was at the public-house that I told him most of this; and as to my committing the robbery, I had been out of the way three days, for fear of being arrested for a debt which I owed to one Murray.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES re-examined. When I searched him, he had 1 s., and a few halfpence; he said, he had a sovereign, but I did not find it.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Peter-street - the public-house is Nos. 16 and 17. I keep a sheep's head shop; and have known the prisoner sixteen years. I always heard his character to be that of an honest upright man. I know no other character of him - he dined with me on the 17th of October, about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock, and did not leave my house till a quarter to eleven, when I went with him to the Bull's-Head, where he slept; and he breakfasted with me in the morning. I took the lodging for him, as he said he was in debt, and wanted to keep out of the way for two or three days, as he was in fear of being arrested.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go out at all on Sunday afternoon? A. No; I and my wife were there; nobody else; we all three staid at home. I was taking a pipe and some porter with my friend Cartlidge, till tea time; and after tea we had some more - he was never out of my place for five minutes - I do not think it was half five minutes - he was out of my presence for about three minutes; but I think he went down into the cellar. I have lived four years in the house, and have been twenty-seven years in the neighbourhood - we did not go to church.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Sunday, the 17th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and breakfasted with us; and dined with us at a quarter-past one - my husband accompanied him to the next house about a quarter to eleven o'clock in the evening - he was not out of my sight from dinner time till then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he left the house after breakfast? A. He went out about twelve o'clock, and returned before one - we sat in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never out of the room? A. I might be in the shop; but never went out of doors - my husband fetched the porter from Chisholme's - there is no back door to the house - he could not go out without coming through the shop - he breakfasted with us on Monday; and staid till half-past ten o'clock. I heard of his being taken up next day - we did not go to Bow-street - we were not sent for - we did not know where he was till the Saturday following. I heard of his being taken up next day; but did not know where he was till Saturday, when he was in Coldbath-fields.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BARTRAM re-examined. I heard of his being taken on the Tuesday; and on the Saturday I saw him at Newgate - his son came to tell me he was there. I went to see him - this was on the Saturday following the Sunday on which he dined with me - he said, he was fully committed. On the Sunday before, he dined with me, I think a relation from Whitechapel, or my niece, dined with me - I cannot say which - Saturday is a busy day; but I went to him about twelve o'clock, which is a leisure time with me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. He was taken before the Magistrate on Monday, the 18th of October, and again on the 20th - he was fully committed on the Friday week; not before - he never stated that he had been at Bartram's.</p>

Morell is the landlord, but did not live in the house - it is let out in tenements - my father had two rooms on the third floor. On the 12th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting at work in my mother's front room - my mother went out on the landing-place, and called out, "Caroline! Stop thief!" I ran out of the room, and saw the prisoner running down on the second floor landing - I ran after her; my mother was on the top landing, the prisoner could hear her call. I pursued, calling Stop thief! the street-door was on a spring - she opened it, and it banged too again of itself. I opened it, and saw her running in the street, and pursued, calling Stop thief! and only lost sight of her in turning the corner down Union-street - she was not out of my sight for a moment, and was still running. I saw her turn into Wells-street, caught sight of her again immediately, and saw her come down two or three steps from a leather cutter's shop in Wells-street. I caught her at the corner of Mortimer-street, and asked what she had taken from No. 20, Great Titchfield-street; she said she knew nothing of me, and if I thought she had taken any thing, I might search her. I wanted her to go back, and while I was talking to her, Mrs. Graves came up, and wished her to go back; she went within a door of our house; a woman came up, and said in her presence that my things were thrown into a leather cutter's shop, and the apprentice came up - I left her with Graves, and went to the shop, and Mrs. Bruce gave me my things; it was a puce silk dress, a poplin skirt, and a shawl; which I knew; I had seen them that morning, in my box - they all belonged to me. I had made the silk dress for a lady; it was in my care. The box was in a back room, on the same floor, as we were sitting - the door was not locked. They are worth 6 l. altogether. When I came from Bruce's I saw the prisoner at the corner of Monmouth-street, and followed her a long way; the street keeper and constable came up, and took her. The house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone.</p>

I asked twice whom she wanted; she made no answer: I asked her a third time, and she said she wanted a person, but I do not recollect the name she mentioned; I asked what she had got under her arm; she ran down stairs as fast as she could - I called my daughter, who ran down after her: I called "Stop thief! stop that woman." Graves lodges on the second floor; he ran also, and I followed him. I saw Mrs. Taylor, (who lives on the first floor,) with the body of my daughter's gown.</p>

            . I was in Wells-street, between three and four o'clock, on this afternoon, and saw a woman running very fast up the steps of a leather cutter's door, and pull a bundle from under her arm, under her shawl, and throw it into the passage: it was loose, not tied up - one of the things appeared green; she ran down the steps, and down Wells-street. I stood at the shop, and saw some things picked up in Bruce's passage, in about two minutes; it was the same things as the woman had thrown down. I saw the prisoner afterwards in the prosecutrix's custody, and am sure she is the woman.</p>

            . I live in Titchfield-street, with Mr. Sherrin, in the same house as Clarke. On the afternoon of the 12th of November, between three and four o'clock, I was in the second floor back room, somebody rang the bell - I went down, and found the door open; the prisoner was in the passage, pretending to wipe her feet: I am sure of her person - she passed me, and went up three pairs of stairs. I went into my room, and in ten minutes I heard Mrs. Clarke call out - I went out, and caught a glimpse of the prisoner's shawl as she passed the staircase window; she had a blue shawl on. I went out, and saw her turn the corner of Union-street and Wells-street, and saw her taken by Miss Clarke and Mr. Graves. I am certain of her; we got her round into Titchfield-street: a man came up, and said that was not the woman; I said I was sure it was - he said, "It is not, let her go;" she was not let go.</p>

I had been there from five or six o'clock, in the bar, with the landlord - I had some wine with him, and drank some liquor also, and was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk. I left the house for the purpose of supping at an a-la-mode beef shop, at the end of Ship-yard: and when I got nearly to the cook shop, a man called out "Charley, give us some gin" - that was

             and the prisoner Edmunds, were the other two. I knew the prisoner by sight, but not to know much of him. I have known Bennett some years - I knew Davis from his apprenticeship. I was not in the habit of drinking with either of them - I may have had a glass with Davis. I said "I shall not give you any." Edmunds directly said "Then d - n him, we will have what he has got;" he immediataly struck me on the head with his fist - he gave me two blows on the head - I staggered against the wall; he immediately put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out all my money, except a sovereign. I immediately called out Watch! and said to Edmunds, "I know what you are after, you intend to rob me;" he took seven sovereigns, and some silver out of my pocket; when I called Watch! part of the money fell out of his hand on the pavement - it happened close to the a-la-mode beef shop; Mrs. Marlow, the landlady, came out - his hands were then in my pocket; be put the money which did not fall, into his pocket, and was stooping to pick up the rest. Marlow said "What are you doing with that money, my man, it is not yours;" he replied with an oath "What is that to you, if you don't go in I will serve you the same;" he picked the money off the pavement, struck me another blow on the head and ran off - Jane Hoby was standing by at the time. I did not see her till he had robbed me. Davis stood close by, but did not interfere - Bennett stood close to us also, and on seeing him, I endeavoured to lay hold of him; he struck me a blow, which I returned, and knocked him down; he got up, and we had a struggle, during which time Edmunds and Davis got away - Hoby laid hold of me by the neckcloth, and said to Bennett "Now run off as fast as you can:" he immediately ran away, and as soon as I could extricate myself, I struck at her - my foot slipped, and she got off. I told Mrs. Marlow what I had lost, and shewed her the sovereign which was left in my pocket; the second blow which Edmunds gave me, knocked me down - my pockets were rifled between the two blows. I was knocked down by Bennett afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Edmunds struck you, and took your money? A. Yes; Hoby was not near me then to my knowledge. I have always given the same account of this. I told the Magistrate and Grand Jury,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020022"/>that neither Bennett nor Davis did anything till afterwards. I was at the time in the employ of Messrs. 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person326">Hanson</persName>
             and 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person327">Duncan</persName>
            , of Bonverie-street, and had received the money the night before on their account. I was at the office next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not pay it over? A. It was not indispensably necessary. I had 30 s. a week. I had passed the previous evening at the Apple-Tree, in Cursitor-street, and left there perfectly sober. I might have drank three glasses of gin, and a pint of ale or more; and I had a glass of rum at another shop. I received nine sovereigns and 6 d. for my masters. Mr. Duncan was not in the way next morning; and I had to receive 12 s. from him for overwork. I always settled with him. I spent about 30 s. of the money. I dined at an a-la-mode-beef shop in Holborn, on the day of the robbery, between three and four o'clock, and did not go to the office again. I was drinking with Johnson, and a man named Friend. I might drink six glasses of gin, and two bottles of wine with them. I paid for some ale. I paid 15 s. or 16 s., including the wine. I was not drunk. I was at three or four public-houses that day - before I went to the Green Man, public-house, I went to a house to get a bed; but could not. I believe it was to a bad house - nobody was with me. I was not sober enough to go to the office. I laid my head on the table. I had a little sleep up stairs. I was not turned out because I was drunk. I have not been to the office since; but have been writing for my master at home. I saw Mr. Duncan next morning, and told him I had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Q. I think they said, that unless you convicted somebody of stealing it, they would transport you for embezzling it? A. They did not say that exactly - he said, he must know whether I had been robbed or not, or he would take me before a Justice. I complained at no office till after that; for I was not well enough. I have done business for Mr. Ford, a law-writer, several years ago - we had some misunderstanding about money, which, he said, I had not accounted for. I understood one McLain was in our company that evening; but I did not see him. I had him apprehended, as he had admitted that he stood by, and had part of the money. I went to Bow-street two days after the robbery, but Edmunds was not taken for six days. I was taken into custody about the money, while they sent to inquire of 
               <persName id="t18241202-46-person328">Mrs. Marlow</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew all three of the men? A. Yes; and told Mrs. Marlow their names. I have always said, that I knew them all - my examination was taken down at Bow-street, and I signed it - it was read to me.</p>
               <p> Q. You say, in your deposition, "I got up; and the female prisoner came up and held me by the collar, till Edmunds and the three men ran away; and in the last scuffle the strange man got off. I know Edmunds and Davis; but not the third man?" No Answer.</p>

I put my hand up to keep it from me, as much as I could, and I think the balls must have gone over my head.

I took hold of it when he first presented it, to keep it off, and my hand was black with the powder.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he going to load it with? A. He was going to take something out of his right hand pocket. I tried to get the pistol out of his hand, but he knocked me down, and beat me on the head with it. I was taken to St. Bartholomew's hospital for the wounds I received on the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him with the pistol, you turned it out of the way? A. I put my hand up.

I cannot say whether there were any balls in it.</p>

I went into Bucklersbury, and saw the prisoner violently beating this woman.

            . I am a City marshal. I saw the prisoner in the watch-house after he was in custody, and asked him if the pistol was loaded with ball; he said No, for he could not get ball; that it was loaded with shot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not his words "I could not get ball, but I have got shot?" A. No; he said it was loaded with shot. I was about half an hour with him - he appeared inebriated, but besides that, from his appearance, I thought him insane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What led you to think so? A. Merely from his manner and expressions. He said he was extremely happy in what he had done - that he felt quite easy in his mind in having attempted to destroy her; he only wished it had taken effect. He spoke but little, only when he was spoken to; he was not at all violent in his manner, but sat down quietly in the corner of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MARY DEVOLL re-examined. I cannot say whether the pistol is the same, or like it - I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How much of the eleven years have you lived with him? A. Not long at a time - he sold my furniture several times, and I was obliged to leave him. I never went by any other name but his, and my maiden name, Mills, and that was at his request.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever gone by the name of Clayton? A. Yes. I was married before I married him; it was his wish that I should go by those names. I never passed as Barnett. I lodged with a man named Wells, and people, who chose to make a mistake, called me Mrs. Wells - I lodged with him, but did not live with him. I never heard of the prisoner's hanging himself. He told me about three years ago that he was going to a situation at Brentwood; I got his things ready; he got into a coach, and said, "I am going into the country, you will not see me any more," and with that took out a knife and stabbed himself. I have every reason to believe that he is not in a right state of mind, for he has been confined as a lunatic.</p>

            . I am a baker by trade; but have not followed business for some time on account of ill health. I know the prisoner; he came to my house sometimes; and on the 24th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he came to my stall in the New Kent-road, and asked if I could go home, for he had some things to shew me at my house. I went with him; and under a tureen on the sideboard, I found this bill-case, with its contents - he took the bills and stamps out, and shewed them to me - there was a 1 l. Swansea note among them; and the prisoner said, if I could get it changed, he would give me 10 s. I asked where he got the property - he said, he had robbed Mr. Bowyer - that he got in at the public-house; and on the privy, made a spring and got over the wall; and got in, and was obliged to remain there all night, till six o'clock in the morning, when the watchman went off duty; as he could not get back the same way, the public-house being shut<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020024"/>up - he did not say at what time he got into the house; but said he went to the public-house between nine and ten o'clock on Tuesday night. He counted over 25 s. in half-crowns and shillings; put it into his pocket, and told me to change the note, and burn the papers, and he would meet me - he went away. I said, very well; but immediately went to Mr. Bowyer with the bill-case and papers, and told him they could find him at a cheesemonger's in Old Kent-road, where he lived.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He lodged at your house? A. No; I was not at home when the bill-case was brought - he seldom came to my house - my son was not taken up about it. I went out about a quarter before seven o'clock on that morning.</p>

            . I am the last witness's son. On the 24th of November, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my master's yard, in Thomas-street, Lock's-fields, and gave me this bill-case and canvass bag; he told me to take them in to my father for him to look at. I could not go then; but I went at eight o'clock (breakfast time) and put them under the tureen till my father came home - the prisoner told me to put them there. I went to work at half-past eight o'clock. I asked him no questions about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known him long? A. No; only by his coming to and fro to his brother's, when I was on the turnpike-gate. I am eighteen years old. I am sure I did not give him the things. I was not accused of it.</p>

            . I am a City officer - Mr. Bowyer sent for me about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of November. I found Salmon, senior, at his house, and went with him to Old Kent-road; waited there till about half-past seven o'clock, when he pointed the prisoner out to me. I followed him into a shop, and took him, and found a canvass bag, with two half-crowns, 19 s., and two sixpences upon him. I told him to be cautious what he said as it would he given in evidence against him, and told him the charge - he said, the devil was in him - he could not tell what induced to do it; and that the money was Mr. Bowyer's property.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Thomas Darke Allen and Thomas Shepparson - Cooper was in their service - his duty was to shut up the warehouse, and keep the keys. On the 23d of November, as we were shutting up, he said he had lost one of the screw nuts of the door shutter, and must go into the lower warehouse, where he cleans the shoes, to a bag of straw, and look among the rubbish which he had put into it, to make it look larger - he went down, and I did not see him again that evening, and cannot say whether the nut was found. I kept the keys that night, and at half-past six o'clock in the morning I let him into the warehouse - he opened it, and I went into the lower warehouse. I saw the straw bag in the place where he cleans his boots and knives - he came down and fetched his broom, and went up again. I went away, returned in a short time, and the bag was gone. I suppose Cooper was in the upper warehouse; he came down to clean his knives - I did not speak to him about the bag; he could have taken it from the lower warehouse without my seeing or hearing him. I spoke to Wood about it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where are the rough linens usually kept? A. In the warehouse below, a few yards beyond the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time in the morning did you see the bag? A. About twenty minutes to seven o'clock. There are five apprentices, one warehouseman, and Cooper. The bag is kept between the two lower warehouse; I was in one of them; the other apprentices were in bed. Wood came down nearly at seven o'clock, after the bag was moved.</p>

             On the night of the 23d I had the key of the lower warehouse, and gave it to Landale at ten o'clock. I was not up when Cooper came in the morning; he told me overnight that if Landale should ask for the nut to say he had found it. Landale spoke to me in the morning about the bag, after Cooper had been below - I had observed nobody else go below; persons might have gone down without my seeing them.

On the 24th of November I was desired to watch these premises, which are in Cheapside, and about ten minutes before seven o'clock! saw Coday go into the house; I could not see who opened the door - he came out in about a minute, with the bag of straw upon his back. I followed him to Noble-street, Falcon-square, and there stopped him, and asked what he had in the bag; he said, "Straw;" I said, "Have you got nothing else;" he said, "Not that I know of." I searched the bag, and found these two pieces of Irish, about the middle of the straw; he said he did not know they were there; I asked who, or where, he got it from, I do not know which - he said he did not know, but he would go and shew me. I took him to the Compter, and then went and took Cooper. The linen weighs 18 lbs. or 20 lbs., and the straw about 16 lbs.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Oxley. On the 15th of November, in the morning, this coat and waistcoat were safe in my room, hanging behind the door, when I went to market - I left the prisoner to mind my stall, and when I returned I found he was gone. I went home, and missed my coat and handkerchief; I had not sent him for them. I saw him again last Saturday - he said he would take me to where I could get them; he took me to George-yard, Whitechapel, but I did not find them.</p>

About nine o'clock on the night of the 20th of November, I saw her in Leadenhall-street, and followed her to Little George-street. She did not see me - I saw her hustling about her clothes, and in a few minutes she came round the corner towards me, with this scarf in her hand. I asked what she was going to do with it - she was confused and said she hoped I would forgive her - she was going to pawn it, as she wanted a few shillings. I told her to go home, which she did, and I sent for an officer. She was about a month in our service.</p>

On the 16th of November, I went up stairs, and on coming down I saw the prisoner in the shop, looking at some caps; she approved of one, but thought the price too much, and that one with less work would be more suitable. She said she was in no hurry, and would look in again; she went out, and my daughter told me that she missed a cap. I went out and saw her crossing the road, about thirty-five yards off, and turning round, as if undecided which way to go. I beckoned to her - she turned, and went in an opposite direction, quickening her pace. I went and told her to come back to my shop. She said "You cant want me." I said "My daughter wants to speak to you." I then saw something compressed in her hand; she then gave the cap to me, and said "This, I suppose, is what you want."</p>

I missed some of them the beginning of last month; the pit is in a field near our garden - the field has a hedge and is about twenty yards from the road - the prisoner buys and sells vegetables - he keeps a horse and cart. I told Mr. Gunner that I missed the potatoes on Friday, the 12th of November - we went to the pit; there might have been half a dozen sacks taken or more - we traced the foot-marks of three persons from the potatoe pit over the hedge; and towards the road we found some tracks of a cart wheel - we followed the tracks, and they led us to Twickenham Common, and right into the prisoner's yard - we found his cart there - we could not discern any footsteps along the road by the side of the cart; this was about eight o'clock in the morning - we got a search-warrant; and about nine o'clock my master, I, and the constable, went with the warrant - the prisoner was at home. I saw the potatoes found in a little place adjoining the stable; there were twenty-six bushels; he said, he had bought them. I thought they were master's. I believe them to be his; there was some straw about them loose, and some whips of straw; there had been some whisps of straw with master's potatoes, which had been put in the holes of the sacks, and had fallen into the pit - we found some pieces of string, which I am certain had been used to tie Mr. Gunner's sacks. I had not observed any pieces of string in the pit before. I had ordered the man to cut the string in the evening when it was dark, and I did not see any in the pit; the cart wheel had what is called a cut-tire; the width of the rut in the road agreed with that which the wheel would have made; we found breaks in the rut, which the cuts in the tire would have made; they measured two feet seven inches. I am satisfied it was the same cart which had been on the road; there was a place which showed where it had turned on the road, near the potatoe pit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is this the high road leading from Teddington to Twickenham? A. Yes; there are a good many carts on that road. I did not go beyond his house to trace any further - I did not go into the premises till we had got the search-warrant: the cart was traced up to his gate, which is close to the road; we saw the cart at eight o'clock, but did not get the warrant till nine. The tire of the wheel is not broken, but is in different pieces, such as most old carts have - the wheels of old carts are mostly of the same breadth; there was not any mark which showed that the tire had been broken, that I know of - oat straw is generally used with potatoes; these potatoes were champions, which is a very common sort. I have known him some time as living at that house, and know a man of the name of Love, who works for him.</p>
               <p>WM. GUNNER. I am a farmer and live at Teddington. The business is carried on for the joint benefit of my brother Richard and myself; he is underage; the property belongs to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020028"/>us. These potatoes were in a pit, with some straw; they had been shot out of sacks - the sacks were not tied when I saw them. There were seventy or eighty sacks of them in the pit. Carpenter came to me - I went with him, and we traced some footsteps over my own field, and two others, about 2 or 300 hundred yards to the road; they appeared to be the steps of three persons, and in the road we saw the track of a cart, very plain - there had been much rain in the night, and there were no other marks so early in the morning. The cart had come from Twickenham to our premises, turned round, and then led us to the prisoner's premises. In his shed there were two carts, but the one which had been used was the outside one; I examined the tire of the wheel, and compared it with the marks in the road; it corresponded so exactly that I believe it to be the same; the tire was quite wet, and bright; if it had been all night without going out it would have been rusty. We got a search-warrant, and went to his house; I described the potatoes to the constable before I saw them. I have not the least doubt that they are mine. I found among them some oat straw, and some string; the pit is under a walnut tree, and we found some walnut leaves among them; these circumstances make me more certain about them; there were some whisps of straw, such as had been put in holes in the sacks. He said he bought them between five and six o'clock on the evening before, of a man, coming across the common, with a cart - that he called to him, "Mate, what have you got there?" he said potatoes; the prisoner said he would buy them if he could, and he bought them at 5 s. 3 d. a sack. I said if he could produce the man he bought them of I should be satisfied; he said he did not know where he came from, nor who he was - that he had a lad who helped him to unload them. I had been at my potatoe pit on the evening before, after four o'clock; it would have taken three persons more than an hour to have got that quantity of potatoes out, and taken them to his house. The road is very public. We were selling those potatoes at 7 s. a sack at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father living? A. No. I am one of the executors under his will; my brother, Richard, is thirteen years of age. My mother is executrix - she and Richard live at home with me. We growed the potatoes. I carry on the business, for the benefit of myself and Richard. The potatoes have a remarkable thin smooth skin; they are not champions that I know of: but I do not pretend to know the different sorts; they may be called champions, but I should not call them so. I think they are a little more round. Carpenter has been in the habit of growing potatoes some time - he knows them pretty well.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Gunner. I live in the field. I had worked till dark the evening before the potatoes were stolen; I left work at five o'clock - they were all safe then. My cottage is twenty or thirty yards from the pit: three men could not have come into the field, before five o'clock, without my seeing them; there were some whisps of straw among the potatoes in the pit, which had been put in the holes of the sacks; these strings are some that I had given out of my pocket, because they had not got enough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the potatoes belong to the ground? A. Yes; the ground is Mr. Gunner's - the potatoes had been put into the pit on the 11th of November, in the evening, near five o'clock; they are early champions - they are like my master's.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Twickenham - my beat is at a place called Cross Deck. I know where the prisoner lives, and the field where the potatoes were stolen from; my beat is half a mile from it. About two o'clock in the morning I saw a horse and cart, and a man, going towards Mr. Gunner's farm. - I spoke to him, but did not know him; he did not answer. The horse was a black one, and the man had a straw hat on. I saw it but once. I had seen the prisoner many times before, and have seen him wear a straw hat - his horse is black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him in the course of the week? A. Yes; he sometimes wore a straw hat, and sometimes a black one; it was quite moonlight. I could tell a black horse from a dark brown one, and I could have seen his feet if I had noticed them.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's employ for about 3 weeks, but not at the time he was taken up - I was then at the house of Mr. Harris. The prisoner got me to mind his business while he was away; I helped him on the day before, at Twickenham common, between five and six o'clock in the evening, to unload some potatoes - I do not know the man he had them of, but he was coming along with them, and I was standing by Harris's corner, and Mr. Master's said, "What are you loaded with;" he said, "Potatoes: I am going to take them to town, to try to sell them;" the prisoner said, "What do you want a sack for them?" he said 6 s. The prisoner said, "That is as much as I sell them for." The man then said, "I will let you have them for 5 s. 3 d., as it is a wet night." Masters asked me to go and help unload them, that they might get them in as soon as possible, being a wet night - the man had some sacks, and some oat straw over the top of them; they were put into Master's little shed, next to his stable. The man said there were twenty-four bushels, and the prisoner gave him two sovereigns and two shillings for them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where do you live? A. At Twickenham Common. I work in gardens, or do any thing I can get to do. I worked about a year and a half for Lord Waldegrave. I left there about two months ago - he lives at Strawberry-hill; my father is a gardener at Lord Waldegrave's. I was at Mr. Harris's, having a little beer with my brother. Masters had not been there, but while I was standing at the corner, he called to me - his house is about a hundred yards from there. I know where old Mr. Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020029"/>lives, but I do not know the potatoe pit; the man had a long frock on; and a straw hat, with a white ribbon, or some ribbon round it. I did not notice his neckcloth - he was a middle aged man, and did not say where he came from. I was on the top of the cart, and took off the straw - it took us about a quarter of an hour to unload them; there were eight sacks; the man, the prisoner, his wife and myself unloaded them - there were three carts in Masters's shed, but the cart the potatoes were in, stood outside. I slept with my brother, at my father's house. I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock; the prisoner's horse is a black one, with a bit of white round one hoof. I go with his cart every day - his name is on it. I was at work next day in a garden, and Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Gunner fetched me. I have seen the prisoner at Clerkenwell - he never sent me to look for the man he bought the potatoes of. I should know him if I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Why did you leave Lord Waldegrave? A. Because he went to France. I had been at Mr. Harris's all that afternoon; the cart was about six yards from the corner, so that I could hear every thing that passed - my brother was inside the house - the prisoner deals in potatoes, and it is very common for him to buy them in this way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the cart driven to? A. To the prisoner's stable door - it was unloaded within a yard of the shed where they were deposited. I have never been desired by the prisoner, or his wife, to look after the man he bought them of. I told them I should know him again. Mrs. Masters gave the money to Mr. Masters, and he gave it to the man - the cart went into Masters's yard. I had not been there that afternoon; the cart went a short distance down a road opposite Harris's, and then returned: it was a great deal larger than Mr. Masters's. I did not notice the tires of the wheels when it had delivered its load, it went back again - it came in a contrary direction to Mr. Gunner's.</p>

On the 7th of October, about five o'clock in the morning - (I had come from Chelsea the night before, and was going down in the country that day.) I had been up all night, and was a little intoxicated. I had had a friend with me, but he had left me before this happened - my watch was safe in my pocket a quarter of an hour before; a man at the <placeName id="t18241202-66-crimeloc353">Ship, public-house, in St. James's-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

I did not see the prisoner there, but the man who knocked me down - there might be six or seven people in the tap-room. I went out, and went to bed; but when I was knocked down some persons helped me up, and took my watch, but I cannot tell who it was. I went to Bow-street before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. What had you drank? A. Some brandy and water. I had had three or four glasses. I will not swear I did not take five; when I was knocked down, I believe I got up myself, to the best of my recollection. I came away from the Ship, public-house, about five o'clock in the morning. I appeared before the Magistrates once. I believe the prisoner was brought up before I was sent for.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Northumberland-mews, and am a manufacturer of mineral water. I was at the Ship, public-house, on this morning, about five o'clock. I was quite sober - I had been to the Surry Theatre, and when I went home, I could not get in. I walked about till about five o'clock, when I saw this house open, and went in. I saw Mr. Rattray in the tap-room - he had a watch, for the chain and two seals hung out; he was disputing with a coachman: they went to fighting, and in the struggle, (being a little in liquor,) he fell upon his face on a bench, on the right-hand side going in: the prisoner stooped over the bench, and under pretence of lifting him up, took his watch out, and went away immediately. I had noticed the prisoner there with a woman before the robbery. I said "Sir, you have lost your watch:" he put his hand on his fob, and said "I have." I said "The man is gone out:" the landlord was at the other side of the bar. I went to Bow-street, and saw two men there; they said we had better come again at eleven o'clock. I went again and gave the information. About a month afterwards, as I was coming from Chelsea, I saw the prisoner standing looking at the soldiers relieving guard at St. James's. I saw two persons coming down the street, and gave them information - they took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were there? A. Six or seven. I was perfectly sober. I saw the fight, and saw Mr. Rattray knocked down; the prisoner pretended to pick him up, but when he got him up half-way, he left him, and two other persons helped him up. I was before the Magistrate four or five times. I was asked if I knew the prisoner before - I said I did not. I never said I would not swear to him till I had seen the prosecutor. I lived with a 
               <persName id="t18241202-66-person421">Mr. Badger</persName>
             - he employed me to collect money for him, which I did - it was but a few shillings. I gave it to him. I was to have half for getting it. I did not abscond with any. I have lived with a Mr. Briant. I went for him to canvass for subscribers for a map of Northamptonshire that was to he published. I returned with the map and the order book. I went again to Essex, but did not return the book and map to him; when I returned from there, I was not arrested on a charge of felony, I positively swear.</p>

            . I am one of the conductors of the patrole at Bow-street. I received information of this robbery from Mr. Simmonds and Mr. Rattray together. Simmonds gave me the information, and a description of the prisoner, which corresponded. I was present when he was apprehended. Simmonds swore positively to his person, and said, if he saw him twelve months after he should know him - the watch has never been found; he was brought up several times before Mr. Rattray came to town.</p>

I had an umbrella in my left hand. I felt some one at my right-hand pocket. I turned round suddenly, and missed it, I saw the prisoner close upon me; he looked rather confused, and ran across the road to the opposite side of the way. I pursued him, and took hold of his collar; he was alone. I accused him of having taken it; he said, he had just picked one up; if it was mine I might have it. I then lifted up a blue apron which he had on, and discovered my handkerchief with my initials on it, and the mark of the Steam Washing Company; he resisted very much; but I got the assistance of a person, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. Oxley called on me on the 12th of November, and said his shop had been broken open, and the prisoner was lying on the shavings; we went there, but he was gone - we found him, with a duplicate upon him. I asked if he had sold the saw; he said No, he had pawned it not far off - he said if his master had paid him he should not have done it. The door of the workshop had been broken with a chissel, or a large knife.</p>

            . I live in Lower Brook-street, with Miss Emma Wilbraham. On Saturday last, the 27th of November, her trunk was taken from behind her carriage. I was on the box - it had been strapped on, with a chain and belt. The carriage was coming into town from Cheshire - we had changed horses at Barnet - the trunk was safe before we got to Whetstone - we missed it when we got to Colson's hotel. The chain has not been found, but the straps are found, and they are cut - I did not see the prisoner at all. There are five gowns in it.</p>

I saw them take a trunk from behind the carriage when they were about five yards from me - they drew it over to Brunswick hotel, and one of them knocked or rang at the door - they then assisted each other in putting it on the prisoner's shoulder, who was one of the two persons who took it from the carriage. I jumped from my box, and followed them. I never lost sight of them - they went together into Hanover-square - I then stopped the prisoner with it on his shoulder - he threw it down, and pointed to his companion, who had ran away. I took him back to the Brunswick Hotel - he was not known there - and was taken into custody. I left the trunk at the hotel - it had a brass plate, with the name of Miss Wilbraham upon it - he said the man who ran away asked him to carry it - I said I should not let him go after him. I gave information to a relation of Miss Wilbraham's, in Stratton-street. The prisoner then said it was no interest to me, and I might as well let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, at Marlborough-street, that there was only one person at the carriage. - Witness. No; I said as I have now.</p>

He passed me - I went after him, and stopped him - I asked what he had in his basket - he was then in Harford-street, May Fair - he threw down the basket, and said lead, which he had brought from a building just above, and if I would go back he would show me. I asked him if any person gave him the lead - he said "Yes." I went to Mr. Burgess's with him. I then asked the prisoner where he was going? he said, to Wardour-street, where his master lived.

On the 1st of November, about half-past five o'clock, a young man, of the name of Norton, came in, and asked for a skein of silk, and while I was getting it, the prisoner came in and asked for a penny-worth of buttons. I said I did not make a penny-worth, he had better have half a dozen, which would came to one penny farthing. Norton was still engaged with the silk, and the prisoner went out, saying he would come in again for the buttons. These pieces of cloth were in two bundles in the window, near the prisoner. I got the buttons ready for him - he came back and I gave them to him - I said "I have to give you a farthing," (as he had left three half-pence;) he said "Never mind, that will do another time." He then went away - a gentleman came into the shop soon after and said, "Have you lost any thing" - I looked in the window and the cloth was gone. I saw him again next morning in custody, with four pieces of cloth - one of them had a mark of 1 s. 6 d. on it, in my husband's hand-writing. I am sure it had been in the window shortly before the lads were in the shop - the cloth would have brought us in between 3 l. and 4 l.</p>

I took hold of the door, and he took hold of it, and pulled it open - he took hold of a saw, and attempted to strike me with it - I defended myself with a stick, and in the struggle I lost one of my teeth.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Ford, who keeps a pork-shop, No. 8, White's-alley. The prisoner came to our shop on the 12th of November, and asked if I bought waste paper. I asked him what he wanted for it; he said he had sold some at 2 d. per pound; I put his bundle of paper into the scale, and it weighed 12 lbs. I bought it of him for 2 s. I asked him where he came from; he said from Mr. Taylor's, Printers'-court, Shoe-lane, and that it was the perquisites of the boys, for cleaning out the office, which was to be pulled down for the new market, and that the money was to be divided among the boys. The overseer came on the following Wednesday, and I gave him the paper.</p>

I said I did not want to have any hand in it - he said I was a fool; he took some of it at dinner time himself, and gave me half the money. After that, he gave me some to take, and I took it and sold it - I gave him half the money.</p>

I went up to one of them, and Alloway said it was not him, but the other; I went up to the prisoner, and charged him with it; he resisted, but was secured; he denied it all the time.

I watched, and saw them go close behind a truck, which the prosecutor and another were drawing. I saw the one (who is not in custody) take the coat out of the truck, and throw it on the ground. Jones took it up, and tucked it under his arm. I crossed the way, and let them go down Ram-alley, and they met again in Bishopsgate-street. Jones had then got the coat on, and his hands in the pockets. I let them walk together some distance; then went up to Jones, and said, "You have got a coat on that don't seem to fit you; where did you get it?" he said, he had picked it up. I said, "I know you did; but who threw it down?" he denied all knowledge of that - Chapman ran away. I took Jones to the watch-house, and then apprehended Chapman in Long-alley.</p>

I took it up, and put it on; and when I got into Bishopsgate-street, the officer met me and stopped me. I told him I found it in Sun-street - we overtook the truck. I said, "Perhaps that is the truck which it was dropped from" - the officer called out "Mate, have you lost any thing;" one of the men said, "I have lost a coat."

I put my hand to my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone. I turned, and saw it on the ground, and the prisoner near me. I made a catch at his collar, but missed him - he then crossed over, but was brought back again in two or three minutes - he was out of my sight for a short time; but I had such a view of him, that I could not be mistaken in his person.</p>

I saw the prisoner make a sudden move, and saw a silk handkerchief in his right hand - the wind blew it up, and I saw it distinctly - he put it behind him to another person, but they saw I noticed them, and dropped it on the ground. I said to the gentleman, "Have you not been robbed; this chap has just picked your pocket?" the prisoner then crossed the road, and seemed not to know which way to go - he then ran off, was pursued, and brought back again.</p>

I took the 1 s. 6 d. which he gave me, and put it with the 9 s. on the table; he said, if I did not stop with him, he would swear a robbery against me, as he saw what money I had; he then took me down stairs, and gave me in charge - he has since sent me word, that if I would send him the 10 s. he would not file a bill against me.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife; he complained of missing his pocket-book, but did not tell me there was any money in it, as he did not wish to fret me; he said there was a 57 l. bill in it, which could be recovered. Last Sunday afternoon I looked into the prisoner's box, which was open, and found in her pocket a purse, containing a 5 l. note. I got an officer, who shewed her the note; she said it was her own - that she had had it five years, and received it from her former mistress.

            . I am surveyor to the County Fire Office. On Tuesday, the 12th of October, the day after this fire, I visited the prisoner's premises, and saw him there; I asked him if he could in any way account for the fire; he said he could not account for it. I have since taken a regular survey of the premises; here is a correct plan of the shop - it is about two hundred and thirty-five superficial feet: the length from the front to end of the original wall of the house is twenty-one feet three inches; besides a small part taken in behind, which is five feet and a half - the breadth of the front is fourteen feet eight inches and a half, clearing the walls. The back at the further end is fifteen feet seven inches, that is the breadth of the whole building; there is a staircase.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he could not account for the fire, did he state any thing else? A. He said he had been having some candles in, and observed to the man who brought them, that there was an unpleasant smell, and the man said he thought it must be the gas, and that shortly after the tallow-chandler's man left, he was behind the counter, and the fire rushed out of the cellar stairs, and he jumped over the counter and hurt himself; and that he lost his senses. Rather more than a fortnight after, he called at the Fire-office, and delivered in his claim - I saw him - he said there that it broke out in the cellar - that there was a hogshead of kitchen-stuff at the foot of the stairs, a barrel of pitch, a barrel of lamp-black, and a carboy of turpentine on each of the barrels. I understood him on the hogshead also. He said he had a few articles up stairs- 10 lbs. of ginger, 6 lbs. of pepper, and some colours. I saw him again a third time, and he stated, that Mrs. Egward,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020037"/>who lived at No. 22, had come in shortly before the fire, and said she smelt turpentine, and he told her he also smelt it. He stated that he had been down twice in the dark, to see where it proceeded from, but could not see any, and the last time he went down was while Mrs. Egbert was in the house - that he had been having candles in, and the tallow-chandler's man went into the cellar with him, and held the candle while he (Clark) removed the casks to see where the leakage or smell proceeded from - that his own boy, at the time the fire broke out, was gone over the way for a lantern, and that he was alone in the shop when the fire broke out. When I saw him on the premises he said he considered that he was insured for 1000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two papers handed in by the prisoner, at the office, as the particulars of his loss? A. They were (examining them). I have summed up the number of barrels, and different things enumerated in them - there are ninety-seven hogsheads, and barrels, of different descriptions, and one hundred and thirty gallons of pickles. I was present when Mr. Beaumont questioned him about the pickles, on the 29th of October - he said they were his own making - here are 469 1/2 gallons of oil, 17 1/2 gallons of ketchup, 27 cwt. of white lead, 9 cwt. of kitchen-stuff; the hogsheads and barrels are merely charged as such, and their contents charged afterwards. The amount of his claim for stock only, is 660 l. 5 s. 10 d., and 50 l. for furniture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where misfortunes of this kind happen, a man must make his claim from memory, if his books are gone? A. Yes; the house was burnt down to the ground floor. He describes some casks as barrels, some as hogsheads and firkins. When I examined the premises I found a room had been built over the yard - he said he had built it since he took the lease - a person recovers nothing for good-will or loss of trade.</p>

On the night of the fire, at ten minutes past eight (as near as I can say), I was going to the Cheshire Cheese public-house, for a pint of beer - his house is nearly opposite - there is a lamp on his side of the way. I was between the parlour window and the door of the Cheshire Cheese, and was crossing over to Mrs. Pearson's, next door to the prisoner's, on the right hand side of his house (before I went in for the beer), to look at a bonnet which hung in the window (I had been there in the morning), and, as I crossed, I saw Clark standing at his door, looking up and down, as if for somebody. I was close to the Cheshire Cheese - Clark went in at his door as I crossed the street, and I saw a very great flare of light on the Gray's-inn-lane side of his parlour door, which was the further side from me - the light was in the shop - I stood and looked at it, right opposite the shop door, and instantly saw Mr. Clark put his hand over, and the side by Coldbath-square, was instantly alight - I saw something alight in his hand - it appeared to be a piece of coarse brown paper - he was at this time standing inside his parlour door, close to his shop - the parlour is at the end of the counter. I saw the fire instantly run into what I call his putty shop, which is near the parlour, beyond the shop. I immediately hallooed out very loud "Fire, fire! good G - d! Clark has set his house on fire!" The people instantly collected - I ran home to alarm the people in our house, but I saw Webster running, and went to tell him, but he got into Mrs. Egbert's house, before I could overtake him, and the door was shut. Egbert lives next door, on one side, and Pearson on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate this to any one? A. I told Mr. Bird of it, and I told Mr. Beaumont of it, before I was taken to Bow-street - that was a long time after the fire - I gave no information to the Fire-office till inquiry was made of me - I was summoned to Bow-street next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you a married woman? A. No; Bird is a married man. The prisoner's shop was open when this happened, and the door open - many people are generally passing there - the lamps were lighted, and there was a light on his counter. I believe I was standing between the two windows of the Cheshire Cheese, when I saw him at his door. I do not recollect saying that I was crossing the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Putting Bird out of the question, how long was it after the transaction that you told this to any body? A. I told Mrs. Pearson of it, next morning, but did not tell her the particulars - I told several people next day - I told two or three in at Pearson's, and said it was wilfully done. I did not say I had seen it done - they did not ask me - and Mr. Bird told me not to name it. I did not tell Mr. Beaumont till he had called on me three or four times; he was going to take me before the arbitrators, and then I said I thought I had better tell him the truth, That Clark set the house on fire. I had told him several things before. Mr. Bird deals in guns and pistols - he keeps no stock, but when he has orders he sends to Birmingham - I believe he is agent for some house there - he has not had any thing up for the last six months - he has within twelve months - we have lived in Dorrington-street all the time I have lived with him - he has been discharged under the Insolvent Act, for accepting bills - he was in Whitecross-street - I know a Mrs. Armstrong, but do not know much of her. I never caused a letter to be written to her. I said at the office that I was the wife of John Bird - I do not know whether I swore it. I have been into Clark's shop - there were a good many things about.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you ever gone by the name of Bird? A. Yes; ever since I have been in the neighbourhood; there are particular reasons why he cannot marry me. I did not know that he had a wife till I was informed of it by Mr. Roper, after I went to live with him - there was not a person passing when I stood at the Cheshire Cheese, public-house. I made no secret of its being wilfully done.</p>

            , a saddler; we live on Mount Pleasant, next door to the prisoner. I went to his shop for something a few days before the fire; but cannot say whether I saw him - he came to my house the evening after the fire, and shook hands with me. I asked him to sit down, and then said, "Mr. Clark, can you give any account how this happened?" he said, I was standing behind the counter, counting up halfpence; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020038"/>had tied up 35 s. worth, and was going to tie up 5 s. worth more, and a spark from the candle, I suppose, must have dropped into the saltpetre; he said, it exploded, and hit him a dreadful blow on the side, and how he got out he could scarcely say; he said, "You know, Mrs. Pearson, some time before this, I had very much reduced my stock; but about a month since, I had an immense stock in;" - he had told me, in the course of last summer, that he thought he should he obliged to leave the neighbourhood on account of his ill health.

            . I live at No. 15, Mount Pleasant, exactly opposite to Clark; my husband is a cooper. I was at home on this night, and saw a light through the curtain - went to the window, and saw the back of Clark's shop all in a blaze. I directly saw Clark come out of his shop to the step of the door, with a light-coloured coat and a hat on - he directly turned himself round, went into the shop again, and leaned across the counter near the shop window. I could see his hat through the window, and directly two men came up, pulled away the mops or brooms, and threw them into the shop as if to put the fire out; and the other rolled a barrel into the kennel. I ran down stairs to inform the people, and on my return, a great many persons were collected. I had been to the shop within three weeks of that time for bees-wax, and one pennyworth of ketchup, but could not get them; Clark was not present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The public-house is directly opposite? A. No; No; it is opposite Pearson's - mine is next to the public-house - it is in the narrowest part of the street; when he ran back to the shop, he appeared to be trying to save something.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live at the corner of Liquorpond-street. On the night of the fire, I saw the prisoner in Mr. Burge's parlour - about half-past ten o'clock; he came into have a bed, and was very much agitated; they gave him some brandy and water; and after a few minutes, he was a little composed, but much the same in agitation. I asked him how the fire happened; he said, there was a carboy of turpentine burst in the cellar - that he was going down stairs with a candle in his hand, and a canister of gunpowder, and it blew up. I said, "I should consider that you would be blown to atoms, or that your hands would be very much disfigured;" he made no answer - a friend said, I had better ask no more questions, as he was not in a fit state to answer - he had a blow on his right hand, which was rather swollen - it did not appear black - there did not appear to be any marks of fire on his clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was so agitated he hardly knew what he said? A. He was dreadfully agitated; I do not think he knew what he said.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Mount Pleasant, in sight of the prisoner's house, and am constable of St. Andrew, Holborn. I heard a cry of Fire! and went to it, but did not see him there. I entered, and saw it was impossible to extinguish it. I then went to Egbert's, next door, to assist in taking care of the property. I saw Clark about a fortnight after, and believe the first words I said to him were, "Mr. Clark, I understand you mean to sweat me;" he said, he thought it hard that a neighbour should say any thing to his prejudice, as we had been on good terms before - he alluded to something I had said about him. I said, I respected him as a neighbour, and asked why he did not alarm his lodgers, and get them out - he said, that there was an explosion took place so suddenly from a barrel, or something, that it knocked him down, and he was taken away by two gentlemen, and did not exactly know what he was doing.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and live at No. 22, Mount Pleasant. I saw Clark on the ruins the morning after the fire, and said, "Mr. Clark, this is a bad business;" he said, it was. I said, "Where was you, and what was you about when you first found the fire;" he said, he was behind the counter counting his money. I asked, where he saw the fire - he said, on the opposite side of the shop, next the stairs; his counter is opposite the stairs. I said, "For God's sake, when you went out of your house, why did you not knock at my door and your other neighbours, and alarm your lodgers;" he gave no answer.

            . I live next door to the prisoner, and dealt at his shop. I went there between the 17th and 20th of November, for pickled girkins, and onions - he produced a jar of cucumbers - they were mouldy, as if kept a long time. I said, they would not do - and asked if he had pickles of this year's, for I should be obliged to him to let me have some of this year's; he said, he had none - before I went out of town, which was on the 4th of June, he had been very unwell, and meant to move on account of ill health. I was in his shop about an hour, or three quarters, before the fire - the usual light was in the window; I suppose it was a lamp. I do not think there was any light on the counter. I went for mould candles and soap - nobody but him was serving in the shop. I was kept there five or six minutes, as two or three customers were there. I looked round, and was rather petrified to see the state of it - for before, it being a small shop, when I went in, I could hardly walk for the number of tubs and things that were about, but on this night there was a great vacuity. I had been in the habit of seeing a very great stock there; but there was so great a difference I thought I had mistaken the shop.</p>

I put my wife out on the leads, at the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020039"/>floor back window - then returned to save some of my goods; the fire encreased, and I got out of the front window, and climbed on a sign-board - I was burnt a good deal, and was in the hospital above a fortnight - Clark was in the shop at the time.

Clark came on Tuesday morning, and asked who put me there; I said my master; he came next morning with another man, and a watchman, and began to turn the ruins over. I asked who empowered him to do it; he said he was empowered by the office; he took away two grates, some lead, and feathers, which were partly burnt, and there was a cask of pitch which stood before the door, and a fender and copper.

            . I received charge of the ruins from Cohen. The shop floor was not entirely burnt through, only one spot about large enough for a man's leg to go through. I found some empty casks in the cellar, and there was some pumice stone in a cask, about I cwt. of soap in another, and some treacle in an eighteen gallon barrel; it was about half full - there was also a child's cradle, and some empty casks. I saw no carboys; there was not a chaldron of coals left, Clark said that when they came in there were two chaldron; there was some salt on the shop floor, and some casks with stuff in them, and four or five casks of white lead - they were a little burnt; there were not ten casks altogether; some would hold ten gallons - the largest were in the cellar - some things were moved before I went.</p>

            . Q. While the fire was burning was you at your window? A. Yes. Bird, and a person named Turner were there. I was in the habits of friendship with her then. - I have had no words with her since, but I went for some milk one morning, and she did not speak to me as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. On that night did she not say to you, "Mrs. Bird, what a shocking thing fire is, I can scarcely believe any one can be so depraved as to set a house on fire, for when it begins no one knows where it will end?" A. She did not - the only observation she made to me was, "There is a looking glass going along in the street - if any one should throw a stone, what a smash it will make."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to her, "God bless my soul, I don't know much of Mr. Clark, but he appears to me quite a different man; I should not think he would set his house on fire?" A. I did not. I never named such a thing to her, indeed; she sat in one window, and I in another; she did not come near me; there was nobody else in the room but Bird. I did not tell Turner that I heard Clark call out Fire! I have not heard that Turner has given out that I had this conversation with her. I never applied to the parish for relief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he should be able to prove Wood's evidence incorrect; that his business was continually increasing, which compelled him to enlarge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020040"/>his shop, and increase his insurance; but in consequence of ill-health, his medical attendant advised him to relinquish the business, and he was in treaty for a public-house, at Bagshot, and his wife went down before the fire, to pay a deposit for it - but on the day after the fire, considering he should be unable to re-build the premises, and re-establish the trade, to dispose of it, he sent his boy down to his wife, which would account for his absence - he should prove he had recently refused 300 l. for the lease and good will of the premises alone; it was therefore unlikely he should wilfully destroy them, when he could not recover so much. All he remembered of the case was that, when behind the counter, he perceived flames issue from the cellar, and called out Fire! caught hold of his desk, and took it over to the public-house, returned for his till, when an explosion took place, which knocked him down, and on recovering found himself in Mr. Underwood's parlour. His policy being saved was occasioned by having fetched his cash-box (which contained it) down in the morning, to give his landlord change.</p>

On the night of the fire I was there between seven and eight o'clock - I took twelve dozen of candles there, and while I was in the shop it was in a kind of a smother: I asked Clark what was the cause of the smoke; he said he could not tell, and we both went together, and looked over the shop - it was very full of things. The smell appeared like turpentine and smoke - we could not discover where it came from. I examined three or four carboys. The place was very full of goods: there was hardly a place for me to put the candles down.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were these candles ordered? A. Yes, some days before. I was there after seven o'clock; there was a smoke in the shop then; I was there but a short time, being in a hurry. The shop was all in a smother, but I cannot say whether it increased or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go for any assistance? A. I could not stop - I was not there more than two minutes. I did not tell Clark what the smell was; it appeared as if something was burning. I did not go into the back parlour, nor down stairs. I call it a middling sized shop.</p>

            , oilman, St. John-street: I believe the prisoner is related to him - he deals with him partly, to a considerable amount. I was in the prisoner's house about a quarter to 8 o'clock on the night of the fire, and smelt a very strong smell of turpentine, and asked him what it was - he said he thought there might be a carboy of turpentine burst, for he had had one come in by mistake. I saw three or four carboys in the shop; it was very full of goods. I had to walk sideways to pass; nobody could suppose the shop to be in an empty state on that night. I told him he had better not go down stairs with a light, for fear of igniting it. I staid there about five minutes - there was no search made to find out where the smell came from. I said I thought it proceeded from below, but he had better not go down. He dealt in turpentine, oil, soap, candles, and other things. There was a box of candles just by the door; there was lamp black and pitch there. I went away, returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and the flames were bursting out of the shop. I saw Clark at the Cheshire Cheese in about an hour, in a strong fit - my master was with me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You live with the prisoner's uncle? A. Yes. I first went to the shop about a quarter to eight o'clock, and saw candles there - he said he had had them in that evening. I observed no smother, when I said there was a smell, he said he should not go down to see about it till the morning; I advised him not, as I thought turpentine had escaped, and it would set it on fire; he did not say anybody had been into the cellar. I returned to the shop because a woman told me the house was on fire. I went that evening to tell him we had some herrings in fresh; he dealt in them. My master desired me to go.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it usual to let customers know when herrings come in fresh? A. Yes; he could not go into the cellar to examine without a candle, which I thought dangerous.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's shop for a candle on the night of the fire - I was there five or ten minutes - after I had been there some time there was a great smell of turpentine; the prisoner served me with the candle. I saw the flames while I was in the shop; they broke out at the back of the shop, from the stairs, while he was serving me. He did nothing to cause it that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any lighted paper, or anything in his hand? A. No. I took up my candle, and ran out of the shop. I saw a gentleman run into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went away from the place did you see anything happen to the prisoner? A. Something burst out through the boards of the shop, and I believe it threw him down. I told my father of it as soon as I got home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did you go into his shop? A. Between seven and eight o'clock; I do not think that it was eight, but I am not sure; I had come straight from home - my father had sent me there. I live at No, 15, Great Warner-street; I was not five minutes walking there. I staid in his shop about ten minutes; there was a gentleman in the shop, talking to Mr. Clark, and a person being served with soap. I did not remark the smell to him, but a gentleman said there was a smell, and Clark said he had sent the boy for a lantern, and he would go and see. I was in the shop when the boy went for the lantern.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Clark say when the flames burst out? A. I did not hear him say anything; he was behind the counter, and I stood by it. I saw the flames come up the stairs. I did not see him jump over the counter. I did not see him tying any halfpence up. I do not know the name of the gentleman who was in the shop; he was talking to Clark when the flames burst out. I did not observe a smother over the shop. I do not know the gentleman; he was speaking to Clark about paint, I believe. I did not smell any thing till about five minutes - I said nothing about it, I am sure. The gentleman said there was a smell of turpentine, and Clark said Yes, he had sent the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020041"/>boy for a lantern, to go and see. The gentleman was in the shop when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say a minute ago, that you was in the shop at the time the boy was sent for the lantern - now, how could that be, if the gentleman was in there before you, and yet Clark told him he had sent for the lantern - must not the gentleman have heard him send for it? A. Yes, he did. The boy came up stairs from the cellar, and looked frightened - Clark asked what he had been doing - he said nothing; he told the boy he was afraid he had been doing mischief, and he must go and get a lantern for him to see what it was, because he looked frightened. The gentleman observed this, and while the boy was gone he observed about the smell.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have been asked if he was tying up halfpence, what he was doing before you went in you cannot say? A. No. I went out the moment I saw the fire. I have no acquaintance with the prisoner.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's service - I came to town, having a bad eye - I am a relation of his - I was in the shop, but at the time the fire broke out I was gone for a lantern. Mr. Clark sent me for it for him to go down stairs, to see if there was any thing the matter. I went to Mr. Underwood's, and two or three other places, to borrow one, and just as I got one at the shoemaker's, over the way, next door to the public-house, I heard Mr. Clark halloo out Fire! - I put the lantern down, and ran to see what was the matter - I saw Mr. Clark run over the way with his desk, into Underwood's - he came back again to the shop, and I did not see him afterwards. I went up to the corner, by Mrs. Ings to get out of the way, and, as soon as the fire was over, I saw Clark at Underwood's. He was very bad - I saw the last witness in the shop when I went out. I do not remember any one else being there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are the prisoner's brother-in-law? A. Yes; it is a smallish shop - it was as full of goods as it could hold - it was difficult to pass backwards and forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if there had been a grown up person in the shop, would you not have seen them? A. I took no notice - I run out for the lantern - I do not remember that any body was talking to master.</p>

I felt alarmed about the turpentine, as I thought there was something the matter.</p>

I work in Gray's-inn-lane, and was coming from work about eight o'clock in the evening, and going home by the prisoner's house, and as soon as I came opposite his shop door, my eye was attracted by a flame of light, proceeding from the right hand corner of the shop. I immediately ran into the shop, and cried out Fire, fire! The prisoner then proceeded from the back part of the shop, and met me at the door - he clasped his hands together and cried out, "Oh, my God! Fire, fire! Water, water! or words nearly to that effect. I said secure your papers, if you have any. He then sprang across the shop to the counter, and wrenched the writing desk from the counter and ran into the street. I do not know where he went.</p>

            . I keep the Cheshire Cheese public house, nearly opposite the prisoner's house; my attention was first drawn to the fire by Clark coming into my house with a desk, exclaiming "For God's sake, help, Mr. Underwood, my house is on fire!" I went over to his house, and saw fire in the back part of his shop, near a place where he makes his putty, near the cellar stairs - the shelves of the shop were not on fire. The shop was very well stocked, and so it was generally - I think the stock increased towards the time of the fire. I know that he built over his yard, six or eight months ago, and I should think that it cost him a good deal, for there was a deal of lead work. I do not think that a person could see from my door what was being done in his shop. I suppose my house is a yard and a half lower than the prisoner's shop, and the goods being piled up in his shop would hinder a person from seeing - there are goods in his window. The prisoner returned to his shop - the fire was increasing - he complained very much, when I met him, of having hurt his hands, and I caught hold of him, and prevented his going into the back shop - he was just at the door of the front shop - after he brought over the desk I saw him go back to the shop, and when he came out he complained of having hurt his hands, and I prevented his going in again. I took him back into my house - he complained of his side; and his hands were very bad and bleeding at the time, and he was in a very deranged state of mind - his principal cry was for his lodgers and the boy - he remained in this state three-quarters of an hour, or an hour, insensible - he was distracted, and appeared like a deranged man - he swooned away, and was quite insensible for a long time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020042"/>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Could a person at your door see a person come out of the shop and look about? A. Yes; a person six yards from the shop, and looking in, could see to the end of the shop. I did not perceive any black mark on his hands - a person bathed them for nearly half an hour - they bled, and were much swollen - they were better next day. I saw a few little places in his hands next day, which appeared as if they had been bleeding - there were some places. I do not say that there were many - they appeared to be a scratch or two - two persons took him over from my house about one o'clock to Mr. Burge's - he was somewhat recovered then.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him next morning? A. Yes; I asked him how his hands were - he said, much better.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure a person could see into his back parlour six feet from the shop? A. Not through the window - the gentlemen asked if they could see through the door. I know Mrs. Wood. I did not see her that night.</p>

            . I am an engraver. I was at Underwood's on this night - the prisoner came running in with a desk under his arm. I went out, and saw him in a stooping position, as if he was picking up a desk - he called out, "For God's sake, help! my house will be burned!" I went over, and took up a mop to poke away what I thought was gunpowder in the window. I was in the shop for a minute and a half - the back of it was on fire, nothing else - there were goods on the shelves. I returned about half way between the public-house, and Underwood came over with the prisoner leaning on his arm; I assisted in taking him into the public-house - we sat him down in a very helpless state - he continued so for three quarters of an hour - a person at the public-house door could not see what was doing in Clark's shop - there is a great declivity - there were several other persons in the public-house. I applied vinegar to his temples, and when he recovered, he wished to know if his lodgers were safe, and inquired about his boy - the shop was very full of goods indeed, and the window was full.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose a person stood at the public-house door, and a person came out, and stood at the prisoner's door, could he not be seen? A. Not to be known, I should think. I do not think that a person crossing could see through the door to the back parlour; they might, if the door was open, and they within five yards of it. When I came back to the public-house, I found him sitting down quite insensible, and the maid-servant and a man standing by him. I was a quarter of an hour with him bathing his temples - he did not recover while I was there - he seemed anxious about his boy, and complained of his hand being burnt, and it seemed to me to be scorched, as if powder had gone off in it - he said, some had gone off in his hand, which he went to clear away from the fire - the palm of his hand looked scorched. I persuaded him to put oil to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he was insensible? A. I considered that he had recovered, but found he had not; he told me of the powder blowing up in his hand three quarters of an hour after. I had not observed any thing the matter with it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the house three quarters of an hour? A. No; I went out, and did not see any thing applied to his hand. I was in and out, once or twice for three hours.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder, and work with Smith. I went out, hearing a noise in the street - Mrs. Bird was standing at the door - she said, "For God's sake, Mr. Clark's shop is on fire." I ran over, and saw fire in the shop - it had not burnt the shop; but was ascending form the parlour door towards the shop; it appeared to be getting over very fast towards the ceiling - the fire was all on the right hand side by the parlour door, and appeared to be coming from the cellar. I did not see the prisoner; I do not know him. I saw a man jump out of the second floor window. I got out a few brushes and things, and took them over to Underwood's.</p>

            . I am a waiter. I was at my lodgings, No. 4, Mount Pleasant; heard an alarm, went to the spot, and the first thing I saw, was the prisoner rushing into the shop - he attempted to cross the counter, but something exploded, and knocked him down. I saw that myself - he recovered himself, came into the street, and staggered into the road. I caught hold of him, and asked if any body was in the house - he could not answer at first; but at last said, the lodgers were. I got a ladder, put it to the window, and a man got out. I assisted him down; the body of the fire appeared to be confined to one corner of the shop, on the right hand.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not see the shop in flames? A. Yes; that part of it - he was attempting to cross the counter when the explosion took place - it did not make a particular noise. I was on the curb stone, five or six feet from the shop - it burst like a train of gunpowder, and the flames increased - he fell on the counter, but recovered almost immediately, and rushed out - he appeared almost insensible - he was crying - somebody else came up, and I left him - he must have gone very near the flames to go round the counter.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about two years - there was a treaty about disposing of his shop three weeks or a month before the fire; he wanted 400 l. for the lease and good will; I offered 300 l., which he would not take. I delayed, thinking he would take less, but I would have advanced to 350 l., but no further - this was without the stock or fixtures; his shop was very heavily stocked.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A. In Rawstone-street. I had been in the oil business. I was to take his stock and fixtures at a fair valuation, and pay money down. I am a working goldsmith, and was going to leave that business. The money was left me by a relation; I can show you the stock receipts for it. The legacy was 237 l. 3 per cents., and 250 l. 4 per cents., and I had another legacy in the 4 per cents. I could borrow what else would be wanted. I dealt with him, and had asked if he knew of a business to suit me.</p>

            . I am a traveller for Messrs. Hodson, Brothers, and Co. I was at the prisoner's shop a short time before the fire, and should think his stock worth about 600 l.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you take an inventory of it? A. No. I looked round, as I had a customer to take the business. I asked what his stock would come to - he said about 600 l., and I thought it worth that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that including the good-will? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to say that the goodwill was to be included? A. He said nothing about goodwill; he said that was the value of the fixtures and stock. I have called on him often for orders, but he has looked round, and said his stock was so full he could not order - he said his health was bad, and he must leave the business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you think there might be 600 l. worth of stock and fixtures? A. I should think so. I had a person in view, but did not enter into the particulars, meaning to come down with my friend, who has now taken an oil-shop at Battle-bridge, but the fire happened; I have known him fourteen years, but really do not know his name, except that it is John - he used to live at Selby's over the water.</p>

               <p>Q. The first item is a balance of 99 l.? A. I was rather anxious to serve him, and his things were placed to the next half-year's account; the whole were supplied from December.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Price and Co. who deal in turpentine, pitch, tar, &amp;c. The prisoner dealt with them. I have a copy of his account, from June to October; the amount is between 30 l. and 40 l. - the six months prior amount to about 60 l.; there is more demand for our goods in the spring.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it his practice to sell his stock before he ordered more? A. I suppose so - he did not deal with us entirely; as prices vary, they frequently lay in a larger stock.</p>

            . I am the wife of H. Turner. We live in Red Lion-court, and sell milk. On the evening of the fire I was in Mrs. Bird's room - she and her husband were there - I said to her "What a shocking thing fire is; I can scarcely believe persons can be so depraved as to set a house on fire, for when once it commences no one knows where it will end." She answered "God bless my soul, I don't know much of Mr. Clark, but he appears quite a different man: I do not think he would set his house on fire." She said nothing about a looking glass. I mentioned this to Mr. Swan; Mrs. Bird and I had an altercation since the fire.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where were you when you made this long speech? A. Sitting in her window - there are three windows in her room - she sat in one and her husband in another - we were looking at the fire, and talked about it at different times. Mr. Bird heard the conversation.</p>

            . I live in Hornsey-road. On the 4th of November, about half-past four o'clock, I was passing by the Maiden-head, public-house, Battle-bridge, and saw a poney in a cart, which the prisoner was driving - another person was with him, but the prisoner had the reins. A young man was asking if he would sell the poney; the prisoner said "Yes, for 3 l.;" the man offered 2 l. which they refused. I went up to the prisoner, and asked what he wanted for it - he said 3 l. - I bid him 2 l. 10 s.; he hesitated, and then said, I should have it. I paid him the money - he went into the public-house, and brought out half a pint of liquor. I am positive of his person - they put the harness in the cart, and dragged it towards Tottenham-court-road. I took the poney home, and in about four days, lent it to Day, as his own horse was ill - he was riding it, and it was claimed. I went to Smithfield, and delivered it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I work as a bricklayer, and also as a labourer. I do not call myself a horse-dealer. I have bought four poneys within the last two years. I was in 
               <persName id="t18241202-93-person602">Mr. Stansfield</persName>

             - his garden was robbed, and he said very likely I might have had a hand in it - I was not sent away for it. I saw several witnesses attending for the prisoner at the office - one offered to swear that he was at her house at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you acquainted with him before? A. No, nor the other man. I have since seen the other man in Golden-lane; he ran off, and I after him, but he got away.</p>

I take a walk, and then come in if there is anything to do. I go home to my meals. I was at the King of Denmark two or three hours on the Wednesday.</p>

On Thursday, the 4th of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was at the farther end of our shop, with my back towards the window; I heard one of the workmen tap at the manufactory window - I turned round towards the street door, and saw the prisoner with five pieces of velvet in his hand, which he had taken from our window; I had seen it about five minutes before. I ran to him, and took them from his hand, and asked him how he dared to take them out of the window; he said, "Do you want anything in this way - I am in the fringe line, and should be glad to serve you." He seemed confused, and stammered out something like how dare I to call him a thief; he ran away, and two men ran after him, and secured him. I kept him till Mr. Neale came home, when we sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody. The velvet was about three yards from the door.</p>

I was in the work room, behind the shop, on the 4th of November, about half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take the parcel from a chair, about three yards from the door.

At the back part of the shop a female appeared to be writing; I knocked with my foot on the floor; she turned towards me, and I stated my business, adding also that if she wanted anything in the velvet trimming line, a young man whom I knew would supply her; the lady not appearing to understand me quite perfectly, I took up some velvet from a chair in the shop, and endeavoured to explain to her - when she accused me of an intention to steal the article, and said, if I did not leave the shop immediately she would send for an officer, and give me in custody. I accordingly left, but had not proceeded above a hundred yards, when I was laid hold of by two shopmen, who said I must return with them, which I most cheerfully agreed to.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. George Drake Sewell and Thomas Cross. About three o'clock, on the 8th of November, Ann Wilson came to our shop, and asked to look at some black sarsnet ribbons. I shewed her the drawer - she looked at them a long while, and purchased one yard and a half of very narrow ribbon. I saw her take a piece from the rest, and put it in a corner of the drawer, and as I was turning to put the drawer away, I missed that piece. I mentioned it to a fellow shopman - she then left the shop. I followed, and overtook her about twelve yards off. I said, I wanted to speak to her; and as we crossed the road, the prisoner, Martin, met her, and took something from under her shawl; I could not perceive what. I took Wilson back - Martin was brought in by Dudley; but I did not see her till she was in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020047"/>prisoner on Friday, the 26th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, in Playhouse-yard, Golden-lane, close to an iron shop door - Attfield took him first, and he threw some lead away, but not this. I then searched him, and round his body I found this lead, which was afterwards claimed by Mr. Nixon. I went to the house, and compared it - it matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it cut straight across? - A. Yes; Hackman was taken up, and the master said, he thought he was the worst man of the two.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner near the iron shop, and went over to him. I found this lead under his jacket. Gleed found some more round his body - they were both claimed by Mr. Nixon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he got the lead from Hackman? - A. Yes; Hackman was taken up, but discharged, as there was no evidence against him.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took him in charge. As we went to the office he stated, that he was deficient, but he did not think to more than 2 l. I said his master charged him with the amount of 10 l. - he said, when his master searched his books he had no doubt he would find it was not more than 2 l. I understand he has a wife and six children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day this was found out I went home to tell my wife that it was found out. I booked my bread and sent the money by my wife - she gave it to Mrs. Tilke. My master came to me soon after, and asked me what was the meaning of it. I said I was very sorry for what I had done - he said he should be sorry to hurt me. I told him I would pay him 5 s. a week - it was paid on the following Saturday, and next week he hired a man unknown to me, and on the following Saturday, when I came home, he said there was a man at the door to take me.</p>
               <p>JOEL TILKE re-examined. The 5 s. which I had of him on the Saturday, after I had charged him with the robbery, was for some other money which he had taken - there were 1 s. due to him when he was taken, which I have not paid him.</p>

I went to Ball's with a search warrant, on the 8th of November - he knew me; the door was fast, but I got admission by sending my fellow officer round to the back door - Ball was no at home. I found the pig in the stye. I saw Ball afterwards - he had got across two or three fields, and was getting over a gate to the turnpike-road; he said "Do you take me for some money I owe you?"

            . I keep the house in which the last witness and prisoner live. I let the room furnished. On Monday, the 18th of October, I was going to tea, about four o'clock, when a neighbour came with a violent knocking at the door, and said the house was on fire. I ran up stairs to the top of the house, thinking the children had set it on fire - I looked into the prisoner's room - she was at tea, and said "I have no fire." I then came down to the prosecutrix's room - the door opened easily - the bed, the window blinds, and the drawers, were on fire - there was no fire in the grate - I cried out for the people to save my bed. A man came up with some water, and the fire was put out. The prisoner then sat in my kitchen for about two hours; she said "I will not go up stairs till Mrs. Armstrong comes home, for fear she should say she has lost any thing, as her room has been full of people." Soon after the water came running through the ceiling. She said "I would go and wipe it up but I don't like to go alone." I told my son to go with her, which he did. She then went out, and bought a candle, and when she came back, she said "The loss will not be your's." The man who had put the fire out said, "This has been done on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020049"/>purpose." A bundle was found in my yard that evening, with a cloak and two gowns in it. When the officer came next morning, I said to the prisoner, "Either give the woman the things, or tell the truth;" she said, "I put the things in the bundle, and threw them out."</p>

On the following morning, about eight o'clock, I went to this house, which I heard had been on fire - I went up stairs, and looked round the room - I said it must have been set on fire. I did not see any marks of violence on the door - the lock must have been picked; there was a chest of drawers in the room, and I could see that there had been fire in the top drawer but one. I inquired who was in the house, and they said no person but Mrs. Rhodes and the prisoner. I then took Conner into custody - she denied the charge. I then stepped out, and left her in custody of Armstrong's husband - while I was gone she confessed the theft to Mary Rhodes.</p>

I can say upon my oath, that she had a fire in her room, and she said she would light a candle and leave it, as her husband was very unhandy in striking a light. When she came back she accused me of the robbery - I said I knew nothing about it. The next morning they brought a constable and took me up. They asked me if I would confess it; I said if I knew any thing of it I would confess. When the knock came at the door to tell Mrs. Rhodes her house was on fire, I tried to go down three times, and could not for the smoke. When I did get down the room was full of people, and the fire was put out.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th of November, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, at Westminster, about two miles from Mr. Gerrish's house; he was carrying a bundle, with two pint pots, marked "Three Compasses, Lambeth Marsh," and a quart pot of Mr. Gerrish's. I asked how he came by them; he said he had taken them from different person's doors, and was going to melt them down, and sell them, to get some provision for his wife - he gave me his direction in Pepper-street, but it was a false one.</p>

               <p>JOHN CHARLES CRAMPIN. I entered into partnership with Mr. Bryan Charlesworth, in September last; we had taken the whole of the upper part of the house No. 22, Wood-street, Cheapside. We had placed there silk goods of all kinds, to a very considerable amount; there were 6435 yards of silk amongst them, worth about 500 l., thirty-five pieces of silk handkerchiefs, and other goods - the whole of which were worth from 800 l. to 1000 l.; a part of this stock was stolen from that warehouse on the night of the 26th, or the morning of the 27th of October, to the amount of upwards of 800 l.; we had bills printed offering fifty guineas reward for the discovery of the property, and information was given in the morning at the Mansion-house. On the day after the robbery, my partner introduced the prisoner and Salmon, the Bow-street officer, to me - we had some conversation about the robbery, but very little - the prisoner made no proposal at that time in my hearing. I saw him afterwards on the following Saturday, at his own house, the Dolphin, public-house, on Ludgate-hill; he then said he was in hopes our property would be recovered for us. I cannot exactly state what he said, but I remember his saying if the goods were in the hands of regular thieves, no doubt they would be got for us, for he should be able to get them for us; he did not state any thing about his knowledge of where the goods were; he said he should see the party most likely on the Sunday, that

I saw the prisoner again on Sunday, at Salmon's house, in Tavistock-street - nothing particular was stated then, but! was to call again in the evening. I did call, and Lidbetter was gone. I went to his house, and saw him; he said he had got into a hunt, and we should be sure to have the goods back again. I made no observation, but I felt pleased at it. I asked him if he felt confident; he said there was no doubt of it, and he would be 10,000 l. to 10 l. that we had the goods back, but we must take stock, and let him have the account by eleven o'clock the next morning; the list was supplied to him, containing the exact description of the goods, and the amount of them. I do not remember any money being paid him then, but I paid him thirty sovereigns myself. I asked him what they were for - he said, they were for the purpose of recovering the goods: but I do not exactly recollect what the words were. I think this was on the Monday. I said "If you give this 30 sovereigns to the thieves, perhaps they may run off with them, and we may be that out of pocket as well?" he said "Oh! No, we have got them too fast for that, they can't run off," or something to that effect; he said he should see them on Monday. Ikey Solomons was mentioned, but I do not recollect that he mentioned any body else. I think he said he was to meet Solomons at the Cumberland, or Northumberland Coffee-house, in the Strand. I do not remember seeing him on the Tuesday, but I saw him several times afterwards; he told me he had seen Ikey Solomons, and had shewn him our list - that there was a deficiency in the number of yards in their list, and in the number of Bandahas and shawls; that their list was 1000 yards of silk less than ours - he said we could have the goods back for 450 l. I said it was a great deal of money to give; he said "Don't be too much in a hurry, you'll get them back for less." I asked him for what, and he said about 200 l. I have seen him several times since about the goods; he said he thought he had been misled, and had been upon a wrong hunt, but he should not give it up yet. I heard from my partner that he had sent a bill to our warehouse; this is the bill. (looking at it.) I have seen him since on the subject of it. I asked why he charged 10 l. for services; he said he did not intend to charge any thing, had it not been for the conduct of a gentleman I took to his house. I do not remember that he stated the name of the gentleman. I did not make any enquiry of him about the 30 l. at that time, but I afterwards took a friend with me for that purpose. I then asked what he had done with the 30 l.; he said he had got it, and should keep it till such time as his bill was paid; he went out of the room shortly after that, and we sent for him again; my friend, Mr. Shaw, then asked him what he had done with the 30 l; he snapped his fingers in his face, and said "What's that to you." I have seen him since, and he said, that though his expenses were stopped, he should not give it up - he thought there was something very black in it, and he should like to get to the bottom of it. I shortly afterwards went to a Magistrate to state the circumstances, and then he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have not a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020052"/>very accurate recollection of any phrase used by yourself or the prisoner; your mind was a good deal disturbed? - A. Yes; it was very materially so, but I recollect some things particularly. I wrote down some things that Lidbetter said to me, by the advice of my friends. I did so to make my memory more perfect. I do not know that I have here a copy of what I wrote. I took a copy of it; the original was kept at Guildhall. I would as soon swear from my memory as the paper. I believe he was well known to my partner - who introduced him to me, and I have heard that he used to go to his house to spend his evenings. I have heard my partner say so in Lidbetter's presence. Salmon, and the other officer, took their refreshments there, but I did not know that a bill was going on at Lidbetter's house for the refreshment of the parties who were endeavouring to detect the thieves - it was not by my authority, and I never heard that my partner gave orders for it at Lidbetter's house; but I will not swear that he did not. I never made any charge against Lidbetter of a criminal nature, till he presented his bill for charges at his house - it was presented shortly after the 6th of November - it had been delivered several days before I made the charge. I do not remember that I had been grumbling about the charge of 10 l. for services in that bill; but I had asked the advice of my friends about it. I had not before then said to any human being, that Lidbetter had been obtaining money on a false pretence of getting the stolen goods. I do not know that I should have complained, had it not been for the charge in his bill - he never, in all his conversation, said that the 30 l. was given for the expence and trouble they were at in endeavouring to find the thieves. I have heard him say, that Ikey Solomons was a great receiver, and he had no doubt he had some of the goods. I do not remember his saying, that he knew the thieves who had committed the robbery. In speaking of Solomons or Crowder, I did not understand him to say more, than that they were likely persons to lead to a discovery of the thieves - not a word was ever said about the 30 l. being employed under the direction of the officers, Salmon and Perry, to use all their ability to detect the thieves. I did not tell him when I gave him the thirty sovereigns, to what use they were to be applied. I asked him what he was going to do with it - his answer was, it was to give to the thieves, and I understood that Ikey Solomons was one - it was to get the property back. I did not understand that any thieves were then found or known, but that Solomons was to get the goods back. I have heard him say, that he knew who the parties were; but I do not know what he meant by that - he mentioned old Crowder's name, and said, he had no doubt he was in it. I thought it very likely he might be one of the thieves. I had been given to understand that his son was in the robbery. I know that the officers went to his house - a woman of the name of Beckwith was taken up, in consequence of some letters which came by post - one was directed to a Mr. Jones - it was not through Mr. Lidbetter that the woman was apprehended. I gave the letters into the hands of the city officers. I always thought Ikey Solomons was a receiver of the goods from what I have heard the prisoner say. I did not direct the officers to take him up. I did not know that Solomons was in the power of the officers, and could have been apprehended any day within the last fortnight. I do not think Mr. Lidbetter ever had a knowledge of the thieves. I believe he did all he could for us, trying to do all in his power to bring the thieves to justice, and get the goods - he told me the goods were to be had for 450 l.; I do not know whether I would have given that or not. I said, had we not better give that than lose all our property - my mind was in that state - perhaps I should have done it; but not without consulting my partner - he said, he thought they might he got for less - the officers employed, were Salmon and Perry. I was perfectly satisfied with the good behaviour of the officers - they co-operated with Mr. Lidbetter, and he with them - their bill was 24 l. odd, and we gave them a check for 30 l. I do not know how many days Lidbetter was employed in endeavouring to discover the thieves. I should think, eight or ten days. I did not think from his being a friend of Mr. Charlesworth's, that he would charge for his trouble. It was in consequence of what Mr. Charlesworth said to me, that I handed the thirty sovereigns to Lidbetter. Mr. Charlesworth was examined before the Alderman on this prosecution - the City Solicitor was there advising the Magistrate, and Charlesworth was examined as a witness - he is not here - we are not on friendly terms. I do not know that it was Mr. Lidbetter's request, that Mr. Charlesworth's deposition should be preserved - the prisoner said, on one occasion, that they had got into a hunt, and they should soon find the goods. I did not know whether they had found the thieves or not, or whether any person was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You went to the City Magistrate to ask his opinion, not making any application for a warrant? - A. No; but to take his judgment respecting the bill. I did not take out any warrant - the prisoner was taken in consequence of my going to ask the Magistrate's opinion. I was surprised at his being committed. I was not aware there was such a law in existence - it was not upon my application that he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not Mr. Lidbetter attend on a summons? A. Yes; he was not taken into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were the goods safe? - A. They were all safe on Tuesday night. I left no one on the premises. I took the keys of the two doors. The street door was open which leads to Mr. Jones's warehouse, as well as our's. Mr. Jones's warehouse door was open, and his porter was standing there. I asked the porter if Mr. Jones was there; and he said, No. I went the next morning a little before nine o'clock, and saw our porter, whose name is William - he came to me, and said, "Good God, Sir, we have lost every thing!" the warehouse was stripped of all the best goods - the porter had been there before me.</p>

            . I am a friend of Mr. Crampin's. I accompanied him, on one interview with the prisoner, when he demanded from him an account of the thirty sovereigns - this was at the Dolphin. Mr. Crampin said there must be a dissolution of partnership between his partner and himself, and he desired to have back the 30 l. I do not recollect the exact answer, but Lidbetter said there was a bill of 10 l. or 11 l. which was not settled. Lidbetter said to Mr. Crampin, "If I have got fools to deal with you have not." After that I said "As Mr. Crampin's mind is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020053"/>uneasy about his partnership, I think you had better return the sovereigns." He said "What's that to you." Lidbetter then took Mr. Crampin aside, and shewed him a list which he read to him. I heard something about Ikey Solomons and old Crowder, and a woman who, if she had been kept in custody, something more would have been found out. He said nothing more about the thirty sovereigns, but that he had got them, and would keep them. I did not see him afterwards, till he went to Guildhall, because Mr. Charlesworth wanted more money for Lidbetter and the officers, than Mr. Crampin was willing to allow. The Magistrate granted a summons for Mr. Lidbetter, and he was committed, greatly to our surprise and against our inclination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Mr. Charlesworth at the house when you got there? A. No; he came afterwards - he was present when the demand was made for thirty sovereigns. I do not know whether he concurred in it or not. I cannot tell whether there has been a dispute about it. Charlesworth took no part in the demand of the sovereigns at Lidbetter's house.</p>

            . I was in the service of Messrs. Crampin and Charlesworth. I went to their warehouse on the morning of the 27th of October, and took an account of the property lost. There had been a great quantity of silk handkerchiefs, shawls, &amp;c. stolen. I was not at Mr. Lidbetter's house more than twice. I merely called to know if Mr. Charlesworth was there. I knew that he spent his evenings there sometimes, and was known to Mr. Lidbetter.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I have been there nearly twenty years. In the course of that time I have bad great experience in hunting thieves and finding them. Mr. Charlesworth and Mr. Lidbetter came to Bow-street together on this business. I had occasion afterwards to see Mr. Lidbetter, almost every day for eleven days - we used his house on these occasions - there were never any orders given in my presence, but I took refreshments without paying for them. I have seen Mr. Crampin there several times, in company with his partner. I told them every circumstance as it occurred, relative to the discovery of the thieves. Mr. Crampin never expressed any dissatisfaction at what Mr. Lidbetter had done. Lidbetter never said that he had discovered who the persons were that had committed the robbery. The name of Ikey Solomons and old Crowder, were first mentioned, in consequence of the receipt of two anonymous letters. I heard at the house, where Beck with lived, that she had been apprehended. Mr. Lidbetter, in my judgment, was doing all he could to discover the thieves. I never saw a person do more to discover a robbery - he never represented to me, or to any one in my hearing, that he knew who the thieves were - I heard him say he would use every endeavour, and, if possible, he would find them. Mr. Crampin never charged him with having obtained money to help him to the stolen goods, to my knowledge. There was an appointment to meet at Charing-cross, in consequence of these two letters. We then went to White-street, to endeavour to see Beckwith - we found she had been there, but was taken; but if we went to Crowder's it would be for the service of this gentleman - we had an interview with him. We had an appointment to meet the next day, at another house, to find Ikey Solomons - it was never understood that Solomons or Crowder could do more than lead to information of the goods. I have not the slightest idea, from Mr. Lidbetter's conduct, that he was in collusion with the thieves to get money.</p>

            . I have been a Bow-street officer nearly thirty years. I moved hand in hand with Salmon in this transaction. No course could be pursued more adapted to discover the thieves than that pursued by the prisoner. If goods, of considerable value, are stolen, it is a natural and usual course, to discover the goods, by finding the takers, and I have no doubt that that was Mr. Lidbetter's object as well as ours. He said he would do his endeavour to get at the goods, and then at the thieves. At the time he met Ikey Solomons we were to be by in case we were wanted. Lidbetter had no power to have helped this gentleman to his goods by means of 30 l. - he never pretended or said, that for 30 l. he could help him to his goods. There seems to be nothing extraordinary in the bill running up to the sum it did. I think the charges for brandy and rum, and other things, are not extraordinary. I do not think 10 l. was too high a charge for what he did - if I had been a publican I would not have taken the trouble he did, and walk about as he had, for less than 10 l.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had not Salmon a bill likewise? A. Yes; he had a bill for costs, coach-hire, and travelling expenses, which came to 20 l. odd, and they gave us 30 l., they were so well satisfied with us. We never knew that Lidbetter had the 30 l.; but I think the eating and drinking at his house, and the labour he had, well deserved it. Our bill was quite distinct from his. We got our 30 l. for our trouble in endeavouring to obtain the property.</p>

            . I live in St. Paul's church-yard. I know Mr. Lidbetter very well. I have seen Mr. Crampin at his house once. The subject of this robbery was then brought up - I heard Mr. Crampin and Mr. Charlesworth express themselves satisfied with what Mr. Lidbetter had done; he appeared to me to have done all he could to detect the thieves. I heard Mr. Charlesworth speak of the bill, and he said he thought it was too little - Mr. Crampin expressed himself very well satisfied.

On the 4th of November, between four and five o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop, together; Perkins wanted some childs' socks - I asked them to walk to the end of the shop, gave them seats, and fetched some socks, which I showed to Perkins; they were not the right size, and while I was gone for another paper I looked towards them, and saw Watson knock a piece of sarsnet off the counter, with her hand; I took no notice, but shewed them more socks, which did not suit, and I got a third paper, and shewed to Perkins. I then saw Watson stoop down, and put the silk under her petticoats. Perkins bought a pair of socks, which came to 6 d., and they were walking out when Mr. Limbert desired them to walk into a back room, and as they walked along I heard the silk fall from Watson.</p>

On the 28th of November, I went to bed with my fellow-servant at a few minutes before eleven o'clock - we went up from the kitchen to our bedroom, which is in the passage; adjoining the front parlour; master and mistress went to bed just before us. I fastened all the doors and windows myself. I left a shawl in the kitchen, and a silver table spoon in a basin on the tray, on the dresser, on the left hand side of the kitchen. I was awoke by the dog barking very violently - it was in the passage by our room door, or the street door. I could not tell the time. I quieted him twice, and he laid down on the mat near the stairs - it was a little terrier - there is a long partition of glass, which parts the stairs from our bedroom; and in about two minutes after he had made the noise. I saw a strong light go up stairs, and somebody appeared to snatch the dog off the stairs - it made a noise as if it was snatched up violently - the light then left the passage, and went down to the kitchen. I heard no noise then. I sat up in bed, and at first thought it might be master come down to quiet the dog; but in a minute or two I got out of bed, opened the door, and went down the passage a little way, and saw a full light in the kitchen through some windows on the staircase, and heard some one in the kitchen say "Hush." I went back to my bed-room door, and screamed out "Murder! murder!" I then closed the door, held it firm, and told my fellow-servant to get out of bed and call Watch - she got out, opened the shutter and the window, and called Watch - we both kept screaming all the time - two gentlemen came by, and said they would send the watchman. I could not see them because I was holding the door - the watchman came to the door. I turned my head round as I held the door, and saw a man standing in the areas with his back towards our window - he was taken by the watchman, but not in my presence. I do not know whether the prisoner is the man or not - one gentleman assisted another to get in at the window, and he opened the street door. I followed the watchman and them down into the kitchen - the watchman brought my shawl, and the spoon from the area - the dog laid in the kitchen with its head nearly cut off - a gentleman took a knife from the dresser, and shewed it to me - it was bloody - it was after two o'clock when all this was over - a little boy slept in the kitchen. I went up, and awoke master and mistress.</p>

I saw a light in the passage, and the dog made a shocking noise; after the light left the passage, I heard no noise - it was not there above a minute; my fellow-servant went into the passage, and hallooed "Who is there?" and called Murder! I opened the window, and called Watch! - two young men came, and asked what was the matter - they went away before the watchman came, and I saw a man getting up out of the area - there is a gas-light near the house. I saw him taken; it was the prisoner. I first saw him climbing up from the area with his hands on the rails - there are no steps - the watchman took him as he stood on a stone inside the rails - he said, there was a man down there, for he had been down to see. I am sure the prisoner is the man who I saw down in the area. I saw him taken, saw his face, and swear that he is the man; some gentlemen came up, and told me to open the door. I said, I could not - one of them got in through the window, and opened the street door. I accompanied them down to the kitchen - the two dresser drawers were open; the kitchen door, and the window were both open; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020055"/>were both shut when I went to bed; the shawl and table spoon were gone from the kitchen.

            . I am a watchman; early on the morning of the 29th of November, I was at the bottom of Norfolk-street, heard a shrieking, and on coming up to this house, I saw the prisoner inside the area, on the stone which separates the two houses. I ordered him to come over the rails, and immediately collared him, and told him if he made any resistance, I would knock him down - the parlour window was open, and the last witness stood there. I sprang my rattle - two gentlemen came to my assistance - one of them got in at the parlour window, got a light, and let another in; and in a few minutes two watchmen came. I gave him in charge of one of them, while I went down to search. I went down first with a candle, and found the dog lying bleeding, with his head nearly off; and on the dresser was this dark lantern (producing it;) the kitchen door stood open. I went into the area, examined the coal-cellar - nobody was there; and in the area, nearly under the spot where I first found the prisoner, was this shawl and table spoon. I returned, and took him to the watch-house - the constable searched him in my presence; and on his waistcoat pocket was a small piece of wax candle, a comb, some silver, and a blue striped handkerchief, which appeared to have spots of blood on it, and there were marks of blood on the back of his right hand. I produce the shawl and spoon.</p>

I went down stairs with Newman, leaving the prisoner in charge of another watchman - I was the second or third who entered the kitchen; the door stood open, and one of the windows. I produce the carving knife, which was wet with blood; it laid on the dresser. I found a crow-bar in the area, and on the right-hand dresser I found the door of a dark lantern. I afterwards returned to the house, and found two center bits. The window shutters were broken open, and the crow-bar exactly fitted the marks on them. I have no doubt but that the window was forced open by that crowbar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a rattle spring about one o'clock; a person came up, and I went to this house - Newman was holding the prisoner, and gave him in my charge; two watchmen and some gentlemen went into the house. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house. A candle and 6 s. was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM FRASER. I live at No. 37, Norfolk-street, in the parish of St. Clement, Danes. I was disturbed by the cook coming into our room, after it was all over. The table spoon is my property - it has my initials on it, and had been used by my brother-in-law, who slept in the house that night. I found the house full of watchmen and people. I found the prisoner at the watch-house, and saw blood on the back of his right-hand, and said in his presence, that he was the murderer of my faithful dog.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN EASTON. I know the shawl to be mine - I have had it two months; and know the spoon to be any master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman; if I was to say I was not an accomplice, I should only be adding falsehood to crime. I came to London four weeks ago, and was looking for work; I went into a house, and met a person, whom I thought was a gentleman, and he led me away. I went with him to this house, and I am afraid that if I enter fully into a statement now, it may be prejudicial to the ends of justice hereafter. I was led away by men who are old in crime. I was in the area, but not in the house, and never saw the dog; I heard the noise, but never touched him. I have been affected with a bleeding at the noise, for eighteen months, and that is what caused the blood. I put my hand to my nose, and there was a bit of a mark on my hand. There has always been blood issuing from my nose; the surgeon can satisfy you of that being the case since I have been committed. I throw myself on the Mercy of the Court. My parents live at Manchester, and I have not the means of bringing friends here.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. FRASER. Q. How deep is the area? A. It must be about twelve feet from the curb of the pavement, and there are rails at the top, which makes an addition to it.</p>

I found it at Hatton-garden on the 12th, in possession of Read, and am sure it is mine. I took it home the same night - it knew the stable well - it was bred in that field, and would never leave its company - there were six or seven horses in the same field, and if it was put two or three fields off, he would break through to get to them; it must have been taken through the gate, for I examined the fence all round. I had offered to sell it for 27 l.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Horse Shoe, public-house, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. On Thursday, the 4th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my stables in company with another man; the prisoner rode a black mare, and the other man came driving this black gelding in a cart; the other man (I think) desired me to take care of the black gelding, for they had driven him very fast; the prisoner said, it was of no consequence what stable I put the mare into; they went away, and came back together about the middle of the day, and asked if I had fed the horses - I said Yes; the prisoner himself went and fed the mare with corn, which they had in a sack. I afterwards found the sack in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020056"/>cart - I did not see him feed the gelding; the other man came up the yard at night, in company with Cowderoy. I did not see the prisoner then. Cowderoy had the horse out, and ran him up and down, but said it was too late; next morning, the prisoner and the other man came to the stables, and looked at the horses, and the other man observed, that they looked fresh. I asked him the price of the horse; he said the gentleman he had brought the night before, he dare say would buy it, and did not tell me the price - he said the man was coming up to try him in harness next day. I saw them together next day, (Friday) the other man asked what there was to pay for the horses. I said 6 s. the two, which he paid, and asked the prisoner to lend him 1 s., which he gave me for myself; he then said he had sold the gelding to the gentleman who had been to see it, and desired me to get the mare ready. I asked if the gentleman came for the gelding, who was to deliver it; he said "If I don't come myself, this man will;" meaning the prisoner, who was in the yard, and I believe within hearing - they went away together; the prisoner came back just at dusk with Cowderoy. Read was in attendance, and took them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All the way through, the man treated the gelding as his? A. Yes - I considered him the owner. I have since heard that he is called Charley - he is not to be found.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Brook-street, Ratcliff. On the 4th of November, I was coming down St. John-street, and a man whom they call Charley, asked if I wanted to buy a horse. I had seen him in Smithfield before. I went to look at it, but it was dark. I did not see the prisoner then - on Friday afternoon, I saw Charley in Smithfield - he told me to call at the Castle and Falcon, and stop for him. I went and found him there, and wanted to know the price of the horse; he said he should not say till I had tried it, and said to the prisoner, "Will you go with this gentleman, and shew him the black horse," and that he would stop there till we returned. I walked behind the prisoner, and never exchanged a word with him. Read and his son were there, and took the prisoner; young Read asked if I knew where the other man was: we went to look for him about the market, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All the prisoner did was to do what Charley asked him? - A. That was all; Charley is a horse-dealer. I have seen him at Smithfield a number of times.</p>
               <p>R. EVANS re-examined. Q. The mare seemed much in the same state as the gelding? - A. It was very lame in the fore feet, and appeared to have come the same distance; but it is hard to say, as some horses sweat more than others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The mare had been a good deal worked? - A. Yes; driven hard in the course of her life; the horse being fresh from grass. I should think would not he more liable to sweat - the mare could scarcely stand to eat - they were both very much fatigued.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information, and waited at the Horse Shoe, public-house - the prisoner and Cowderoy came for the black gelding. I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said, it did not belong to him, but to another person. Cowderoy said, the person was at the Castle and Falcon. I secured the prisoner, and my son went with Cowderoy. I questioned the prisoner - he said, he came from Heston - that he had seen the other man before; but knew but little of him - he believed they called him Jem - that he met him in St. John-street early on Thursday morning, with this black gelding, and he gave him 5 s. to let him put the gelding in his cart to try it in harness - he said, he was a butcher. I saw the cart; it had the name of "Hesther, of Heston," on it, and had two saddles on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to ask these questions? - A. I generally ask questions when I take men; it is not altogether to give evidence against them. I did not ask them to trap him. I did it for the good of the public - he told me all this without being asked questions. I only asked where he came from, and he told me all the rest voluntarily. I asked where he met him, and what he was, and what he knew of Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true then, that you only asked where he came from? - A. I asked those questions.</p>

             I went with Cowderoy, but could not find the man. I asked the prisoner before my father came, if he knew the man - he said, he saw him a little before six o'clock in the morning - the horse was brought there, and that was all he knew of it. I found that the prisoner lived at Heston.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When this man came to pay for the corn, the hostler wanted to charge 9 s.; he gave him 6 s., and I gave him one to end the dispute. I told the hostler when I went, that the cart and harness was mine, and that was all - that the collar and black horse were not mine - he wanted to cut my collar, which was on the mare. I would not let him. I had a quartern of split peas, and two handfuls of bran, which I brought from home, and gave it to the mare. I stopped at the Queen's Head, public-house, St. John-street, that night alone, and next morning went to see my mare, and overtook the man going into the yard. I afterwards saw him and Cowderoy together, and he asked me to go and shew him the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT to EVANS. Q. Did the prisoner tell you what belonged to him? A. He did not; the collar on the gelding was cut. I only charged 6 s. for the corn - we had no dispute.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live at Heston. I lent my cart to Charley on the Monday morning, at Heston. I saw him go away with it - he had a chesnut mare, or gelding. I believe the prisoner had a horse at my stables at the time. I did not get my cart again, till it came from Hatton-garden; but Charley might have brought it back, for the prisoner had leave to use it whenever he chose, without asking me. I think he was at my house on Wednesday night. I never saw him and Charley together; my collar and harness always went with the cart. I saw the mare in my stable on Monday morning - it then belonged to one Champness.</p>

I said it was time to go home; they asked if I would have any thing to drink. I was angry at seeing such company there, and said they had better go. Till went first, and then the prisoner. Next morning between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if Till had been there. I said not, and asked his reason for giving my wife things to pawn or sell, and how he came by them; he said "I stole them from my master." I asked what he had stolen; he said a silver milkpot, a silver watch, a gown and scarf; and that Till had persuaded him to do it. I said I should be forced to give charge of him; he said "Tell me the way to Paddington, that I may be off:" but I fetched an officer - he remained in my room while I went, and might have left if he liked. I was not gone above four minutes, and did not tell him that I was going for one, and I left my wife in the house.</p>

The prisoner was down stairs, and did not hear what Till said to me. I pawned a silk gown and scarf for Till, and when I returned gave him 10 s.; he went down, and shortly after brought up the prisoner; they sat down, and shared some money - Till gave him 13 s. and odd - for after I gave Till the 10 s. he produced a silver milkpot and a watch, and went to sell them; he asked me to sell them, but I refused - he went down, and brought the prisoner up in half an hour, and gave him the 13 s., and said he had sold the milkpot and watch for 1 l.; the prisoner said nothing to it. When Cohen came home he seemed angry, and they went away; I told him what I had done. Next morning the prisoner came and asked for Till; Cohen asked why he had brought me the things to pawn, and where he got them from; he said he had robbed his master of them; Cohen went down and got an officer.</p>

George Capper and Co. keep cash at our house, and had considerably more than 261 l. in our hands on the 23d of November - on which day, about three o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque at our banking-house; immediately on taking it into my hands I doubted the authenticity of the signature, but being very dubious at making any demur at a cheque of Messrs. Cappers, I placed it on the book, and entered it for payment, proceeded to the Bank note drawer, and took out 260 l., but I requested Mr. Matthews, another clerk, to look at the signature, and by the time I had entered the notes, Matthews came up, looked at the draft, and said it was all right. I handed the prisoner the 260 l. and while I was preparing the odd money, Matthews suggested a doubt about it. I either asked the prisoner then, or previously, if he received it for, or of Messrs. Cappers; his answer was, for, or of 
               <persName id="t18241202-115-person750">Mr. Purdy</persName>
            , of the Commercial sale rooms; Mr. Matthews went to Messrs. Cappers', to ascertain the authenticity of the cheque. I believe I had told the prisoner that there was a difference in the signature; he was near enough to hear the conversation between me and Matthews, and a few minutes after Matthews was gone, he said he thought, or was afraid that there was something odd about the cheque, and began to state that he was out of employ, and had given the porter at the Royal Exchange a shilling to stick up a bill, but that bill was not written large enough - he had written another; he was stating something further about the bill, but my original suspicions being confirmed, I asked him to give me back the note, which he did. I requested him to walk into a private room; he then resumed the conversation, and stated more clearly about the bill, and that, after the second bill was stuck up, a very respectable person asked him if he was out of employ, and if the bill was his writing. After some conversation they went to the New York coffee house, and after some conversation there, the person sent him to receive this draft. I then asked who he had lived with - he said, 
               <persName id="t18241202-115-person751">Mr. Williams</persName>
            , a tea-broker, of Jewry-street, and that while he was there a very unpleasant circumstance occurred at Messrs. Williams, the bankers. Being aware that 200 l. had been improperly obtained from Messrs. Williams, I said "Do you allude to the 200 l. being obtained from them?" I do not recollect his answer, for about that time the conversation terminated by the arrival of Mr. Matthews. I think he then, or had previously requested, some one might be sent to the New York coffee-house; for he said there was a gentleman sitting there at the time he was sent, and probably he might be there now. About this time, I think, Mr. Matthews and Mr. Capper, arrived - I requested an officer might be sent for - the prisoner still urged the propriety of sending to the New York coffee-house, but I and Mr. Capper thought it expedient to wait till the officer arrived; who took him there. I and Mr. Capper followed; the waiter, who did not seem to have any distinct recollection of the circumstance, except that there had been a person sitting in the place to which the prisoner pointed. He was kept in custody, and examined before the Lord Mayor next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been with you before he said he had received it from somebody at the New York coffee-house? I think nearly five minutes. Mr. Matthews went out at the front door to go to Messrs. Capper, and returned with Mr. Capper, and gave the cheque to me - it has not been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Did you doubt merely on account of the signature, or because you thought the account overdrawn? A. Solely on account of the signature. I think I handed him the money before I asked where he got it. I rather doubt whether I gave him the money first, but have a difficulty in determining which. There was no variation in his account, only the conversation in the private room was rather more detailed - he urged me twice or more to send to the coffee-house - he left the banking house in custody - if any one had been waiting for him they would have seen that he was in custody. I did not give him the 1 l. 18 s. 5 d.</p>

            . I am clerk at Sir John Perring and Co.'s banking-house. I have heard Mr. Vile's statement. From the manner in which he requested me to look at the cheque I considered that he doubted the signature, and as I wished to do it with a good deal of caution, I merely took a glance at it, and thinking that I saw a private mark, which is usually on Messrs. Capper's cheques, I considered it right; but on looking more minutely at the filling up, I suggested a doubt to Mr. Vile, and told him, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had better not pay it - (There had been a complaint of Messrs. Capper having lost a cheque of a different amount). Mr. Vile said, I had better step to Messrs. Capper's, to inquire if they had drawn the cheque, which I did, taking it with me. They live in Crosby-square. I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and delivered Mr. Vile the cheque, and I think Mr. Capper declared it to be a forgery - the prisoner was present and in hearing - I fetched an officer. The amount of the cheque lost was 61 l. 18 s. 5 d. - the figures being the same as in this, except the figure 2, but I think it was payable to Mr. Bashel, or some such name; it was lost in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Glancing your eye over it, you considered it correct by a private mark? - A. Yes; it is two lines on the side of the cheque. I have no reason to suppose, that the prisoner ever saw the lost cheque - there was no understood private mark between us; but most of their cheques were so marked, and have a letter and folio, which is wanting in this.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are you in the habit of paying their cheques? - A. Yes; and believe it not to be their signature; it is a close imitation. I at first looked at it at a distance of full half a yard, and said, it was right; but on taking it into my hands, I immediately doubted.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took him into-custody; he requested me to go to the New York coffee-house with him, which I did; he looked about, and said the gentleman was not there. At the Mansion House he said a person, representing himself as Mr. Purdy, of the Commercial sale rooms, gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 23d of November, in the morning, I went to the Exchange, to have a bill posted for a situation in a counting-house; the porter demanded 1 s.; I went several times in the course of the morning, to see where he had posted it, but could not see it, and at three o'clock the person to whom I had given it was pointed out; he said he had not put it up, not considering the letters large enough - he gave it to me back, and I promised to bring another in the morning. I was reading the bill, and a gentleman asked me if it was my writing; I said Yes - he asked where I had lived: I referred him to Mr. Williams. He said his name was Purdy, of the Commercial sale rooms - that he wanted a clerk, and would employ me; he took me to the New York coffee-house, and questioned me as to my abilities, in the presence of a strange gentleman, and after asking at what time he could see my former employers, he said, "Will you take this cheque to Perring's, get it cashed, and bring the money here;" I went, and received 260 l. - another gentleman came up - they did not like to pay the money; I gave them the address of the supposed Mr. Purdy - the clerk was sent with the cheque; I remained outside the counter for ten minutes, and could have escaped with the money, but I stated how I became possessed of the cheque, and within two minutes repeatedly urged the necessity of sending to the coffee-house. The officer went with me after half an hour had elapsed - there was nobody in the room; the waiter remembered my being there with a gentleman, and that another gentleman was sitting where I pointed. I wrote to Messrs. Perring and Co. to cause enquiry to be made, and they have sent word to the Governor that they had ascertained who the gentleman was, and that he was at my service; it was Mr. Trigoni: it is through the influence of Sir John Perring that he is here. If the porter had stuck up the bill this would never have occurred: it is all owing to his negligence.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Lawrence and Co. Watling-street. On the 23d of November I was at the New York coffee-house. I saw a young man there, but had only a side view of his countenance. The prisoner is precisely the same in stature. A well-dressed person was with him, dressed in a drab coat. I was near enough to hear what passed, but my back was towards them. They came in while I sat there, and commenced a conversation - the elder one said, "You tell me you have lived two years with so and so, "(mentioning a name which I don't recollect). The reply was, Yes. He said, "Pray, at what hour shall I call on them, for a reference as to your character." The prisoner replied, "They are on Change now, but if you go at half-past five or six, you will be sure to find them at the counting-house." The other man said, "Very well; I will go, but, in the mean time, Just step to Perring's with this cheque, and bring the money back." He said, "I will;" and left, and in the course of a minute the person went out also, and I left shortly after - I heard of the prisoner being taken up, and thought it was my duty to come forward.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The person left the room about a minute after? A. Yes; the conversation was in rather a loud tone which induced me to look round once or twice. I was reading the paper in a box near the window, and they stood at the fire - it is a very small room. I believe the waiter was the only person who came into the room; the conversation was in rather a load tone for persons conversing on business - this circumstance did not strike me then, but it has since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it unnecessarily loud, as if it was intended to be heard? A. I think if I had been talking upon business, I should not have spoken so loud - the tone of the elder person was loudest - they called for nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You were the only person there, and could hear better than if others were there? A. Yes; a moderate tone of voice could be heard - it was not a whisper, nor a very loud tone - they were close to each other; they must have seen me.</p>

            . I am a silversmith and jeweller. These spoons appear to be silver, but I would not swear that they are so - (breaking one.) - Yes, they are silver, but of a very inferior sort. I suppose them to be made abroad; we dare not sell such; they have not got the hall mark. I should think them worth 4 s. an ounce; the largest weighs about two ounces; the dessert spoons about half an ounce, and the tea spoons about a quarter of an ounce.</p>

On Monday afternoon, the 29th of November, I went out at a little before four o'clock, leaving my servant Collins in the house; my place was then safe. I returned just at six o'clock; the servant, and several of the neighbours, were at the door. I went up to the first floor, and missed from the sideboard, two silver tureen ladles, and two silver table spoons of mine; also three silver forks, and a gold watch of Mr. Hanson's; all of which was safe there when I went out - the watch had formerly been mine - I gave 25 l. for it, and sold it to Mr. Hanson.

I did not let her out - but exactly at twenty minutes before five, I was up in the drawing-room, and looked at the watch to see the time. The property was all safe then. I went up again at half-past five, to lay the cloth, and it was gone. A tradesman's wife had called about four o'clock, after mistress had gone out, and I latched the door after her, but did not lock it: she waited till mistress came home. I was alarmed on missing the property - went and found the street door half open. I am sure I shut it after letting the tradesman's wife in - it could be opened outside with a latch key.</p>

I pay her forty-five guineas, and have the drawing-room and bed-room; she had had the watch many years; I wanted one, and she sold it to me - she shewed me a bill of it bought of Mr. Hawley for 25 l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave 25 l., for the watch, were you in distress to sell it for 16 l.? A. No; I bought it ten years ago, and considered that watches are greatly reduced, and as Mr. Hanson wanted one. I said he might have it for sixteen guineas, as I would rather go under than over.</p>

               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress, and stated his intention of returning the watch which the prosecutrix had lent him - he had pawned it on hearing of a situation at Gravesend; and the moment he returned, went to the pawnbroker to get more advanced on a sextant, in order to redeem the watch.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR EDGE re-examined. I had lent him 2 s. 6 d. on the Sunday, as he said he could not pay for his lodging till he got a 20 l. note changed. I never lent him the watch - he very much admired a watch of mine, and said it had a shabby key - he left his trunk, containing his wearing apparel, behind.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Sepulchre's. On the morning of the 21st of November, I was in Cow-lane, at two o'clock, and saw the prisoner with the boards. He said he was going home with them to make tables of them - that he had bought them in Old-street for 7 s. I said "You must go to the watch-house with me" - he put them down and said he should not take them any further - I could not get any assistance. I told him to take half of them to the watch-house, and I took the others - we were not far from Mr. Peto's.</p>

            . The prisoner gave me this letter on the 6th of November, to take to No. 27, King-street, Cheapside. I asked him what his name was, and where he lived: he said that was of no consequence, he would meet me at my house. I had seen him once before, when I was in service. I delivered the letter to Mr. Grey, who delivered me the goods; the officer was sent for, and Mr. Grey came to my house; the prisoner was not there, but he came in about an hour: the officer and Mr. Gray were then gone. I told him to wait, and sent my wife for a constable: he could not be found, but the prisoner went with me and another man to Mr. Pritchard's, where he was given in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Having been in a respectable way of business, but reduced to work as a porter, I was employed by a person to go into the City, and deliver this note, and he back by eleven o'clock. I did not like to take the note, as the people knew me; but of any knowledge of its being a false order I am innocent. In the interval I had a job to go to the George and Blue Boar, which was the reason I did not get there sooner: when I heard that they wanted me, I went there readily; the person told me he lived with Mr. Lewis, in Oxford-street, but he had to go to Somers-town.</p>

            , JUN. I am a jiggerman. On the 22d of September, I assisted to load Severn's waggon - it was driven by Williams - a young man came from No. 9, warehouse, and helped to load it - he got up in the waggon; the prisoner Williams was in the waggon first. I noticed that the hogshead in front of the waggon was loaded in a different way to what carmen generally do - it was placed gun wise, instead of across - this would allow a person to pass at the side of the cask to the sample hole.</p>

I saw the waggon in question - one Fowler ought to have driven it, but I did not see him there. I was standing at No. 3, warehouse, and saw the waggon at No. 8, warehouse - Kimley was with it. I saw it go out of the dock with five hogsheads in it, but I could not observe their position. When I saw Kimley first, he was driving slowly, but the nearer he came to me, the more he whipped the horses, and I saw that the front of the waggon was covered with a tarpauling, which came down to the shafts - it was a fine day, and no tarpauling was required: if it had been a wet day, that tarpauling would not have covered the sugar, as it was so much over the shafts.</p>

             was driving it - that was about twenty poles from Mr. Severn's waggon: the second waggon was driven by George Fenn - Mr. Severn's waggon stopped at the corner of Grove-street. I saw Edward Fowler come to Mr. Severn's waggon, by the sign of the King's Head, public-house at the corner of Grove-street. Kimley came to the tail of the waggon, and took a load from Fowler - Fenn was then by the side. I heard Fenn say "Ned don't do it, you'll be seen by somebody." Fowler said,"It must come out, and shall come out," and then Kimley took it on his back - Fowler and Fenn went into the public-house. Fenn said nothing more that I heard. I saw Fenn next day at the dock, and said "Why do you keep such company you'll get into trouble as sure as you are alive;" he said, "I only went to have half a pint of beer."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When carts have been at the Docks for things, do they not come five or six together along the road? A. Yes; and the drivers talk and drink together. I was about six yards from the waggon at the time of the transaction - Fenn did not touch it. Fowler and Kimley did it. Fenn said "Don't do it by daylight, you'll be seen." Fenn was then close to the tail of the waggon. He did not appear angry. I did not say any thing to them till the next day, when I spoke to Fenn.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it not known the next day that this had been done? A. Yes; but I do not know that Fenn knew it. I am a sugar carman - the regular way to load a waggon, is to let the first hogshead go in crossways, the next two long ways, and then one across: a chain goes across to keep them tight, and if there is a fifth hogshead, it goes at top, and is called a rider.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Benjamin Severn and Co. On the 22d of September this waggon came from the docks, driven by Fowler; I assisted in unloading it - the first four hogsheads had nothing particular about them; but on the fifth being put into the warehouse, I knocked off the tin, and put in the drawing-iron, and was surprised to find that there was no sugar near the hole; it was marked D. E., No. 20. I went to the show room, and fetched the dock ticket to see what was the weight; I then weighed it, and it weighed only 15 cwt. 2 qr. 23 lbs., making a deficiency of 1 cwt. 0 qr. 26 lbs. I immediately acquainted Mr. William Severn of it, and it was again weighed, in his presence. I have never seen Fowler since; he had given us no notice of his being about to leave. This was on a Wednesday, and they generally leave on Saturdays.</p>

            . I saw the cask weighed; it weighed 15 cwt. 2 qr. 23 lbs. I saw Fowler about an hour afterwards - I questioned him on the subject of the deficiency; he said he knew nothing about it: I told him to attend me the next morning; he said he would come at eleven o'clock, but he did not, and I have not seen him since. The value of the sugar deficient is about 70 s.; there were three days wages due to Fowler - he has never called for them. Neither of the prisoners were ever employed by us.</p>

            . I am employed at Chelsea Hospital as a bricklayer. On the 2d of November, about half past three o'clock, I went upon the powder magazine - there was some powder there at the time. I found two pieces of flashing - one was pulled up, and a part of it fastened to the wall by wall hooks. I took a part of it, which laid along the roof, away, and put the other down - at seven o'clock next morning, I again found the lead disturbed in two separate places, one on the hip - it was not broken, but lifted up from its hold, and turned up about three inches, not ripped - it had been laid down on the hip, and pressed down on the tiling. I did not perceive that it had been injured or torn. I did not take so much notice of it - it was disturbed from the place where it had been before - it was indented to the shape of the tiles, and over it another piece, which was let into the wall. On the 2d, I had found the piece of the flashing ripped from the wall.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was under the magazine wall, on the outside, and heard the watchman call for assistance; I went round, and saw the prisoner in his custody, and found two knives upon him - I then went on the building, and missed a piece of lead, and found another on the hip, lifted up. I saw marks of some person having climbed on the outside of the wall, to get to the top of the magazine; the lead which went into the wall had been removed from the building; a part was lifted up, and a number of bricks had fallen. One of the knives appeared to be covered with lead, as if it had been used in cutting it.</p>

            . I am porter at the Royal Hospital. The prisoner was brought to me on this night, by the patrol. The whole of the square is within my charge, and is locked up every night. I examined the magazine, and found a great part of the lead ripped from the top of the magazine wall: it lies on the slates - it cannot be nailed: it is fastened by mortar, and soldered down. It was entirely ripped up from the mortar and solder, and weighed about 60 lbs. It was about ten feet by eighteen.</p>

On the 27th of November, about twelve o'clock, my watch hung on a nail in my stall, a little higher than my head; I did not see it taken. The prisoner came to my stall, pulled off his shoe, and wished me to mend it; I said I could not do it while he waited - I was giving it to him again when he returned it, and pointed out another job: I said I could not do it then; he put on his shoe, and said he would get a slipper, and bring it again. I saw a kind of shadow over my head while I was looking at the shoe, but I did not know what it was. I missed the watch half a minute after he was gone. I went to several pawnbrokers to give information - he was taken the same night. I am quite sure he is the person who came to my stall.</p>

On the 3d of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to enquire if we had a waistcoat for sale - he went out, returned again, asked the same question, and went out; a little boy told us he had taken a pair of boots from the door; they had hung too far in for any person to get them without coming into the shop.

            . I am an officer of Billingsgate Ward. I know this house, it is in the parish of Whitechapel. On the 26th of November, about one o'clock in the morning, I was at the Queen's Head, public-house; the two prisoners came in to get something to drink - they were served at the bar, and then it was made known that there was a bed wanting; the landlady said "Who is it for;" Tibbles said "For my daughter, I have married her mother:" the landlady then said "Do you want a bed too," Yes, said he; Tibbels was feeling for money to pay for the two beds, and pulled out this watch. I stopped them both - the watch, seals, and chain were claimed by the prosecutor two days afterwards. I found no purse, but found the pencil-case, and comb, and one sovereign in the bosom of the female prisoner; the watch, a 5 l. note, and a double sovereign on the man.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MILNE'S Defence. He gave me these articles to take care of till he asked me for them, and I gave them to this old man to keep, as I was much in liquor. Tibbles then asked me to give him a glass.</p>
               <p>TIBBLES Defence. I met Milne on Tower-hill, and she gave me the watch to take care of. We had a glass of brandy. I lent her some money to pay for it - she said she would take a bed there - I thought I had better get a bed there too, and give her the property in the morning.</p>

            . I am the wife of Edward Green. The prisoner has been in my service since the 16th of October. I had a character with her. I had been out of town, and when I came home I found she had been making some inquiries about the neighbourhood. I spoke to her about it, and she absconded without asking for her wages, I missed the articles stated in the indictment, on the 20th of November. I saw them again on the 27th - they were left at the house where she lodged.</p>

            . My husband is a paper-hanger, and lives in the Hampstead-road. The prisoner came to live with me about four months ago - she then went to Mrs. Green's service. She had been in the habit of coming in and out, and one evening she brought a bit of carpet for my little girl, and said she would bring her a bit of fringe. I saw her with a shawl on, but I don't know whose it was.</p>

Mr. Parker, the landlord of the house at No. 2, Conway-street, came in and told my mistress that I had reported every thing that was bad of her; my mistress also charged me with it. I took her the shawl, by her desire, to wear while I was going to Mr. Parker to ask him what I had said. I found the ticket of the ring in the ashes. I put it into my pocket until I went to my landlady and gave it her. I pledged my shawl to obtain the ring, and since I would not give her the ring for the 1 s. I owed her, she came to Mrs. Green's and told her that I had robbed her of several things.</p>

I examined the hams, but cannot say whether there was one short or no. I cannot be positive as to this, as we have so many.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of October, about seven o'clock, I was going down Dean-street, Soho, and met the prisoner, and another man, about two hundred yards from my own house, he had a stove on his shoulder. I suspected that it was mine - I walked after him, and then put my hand on it, and said "I want to look at this stove." He put it down and ran away. I pursued Norman, and a man took the stove to the watch-house - it had been in my warehouse not half an hour before, in a kind of lobby.</p>

Bosley had had some of us before. I told them we had none at present, but should have some in a few days. I then desired Bosley to go to our back shop and fetch a little charcoal, as the fire was getting low; in the mean time, a lady came in and asked to look at some articles - she staid a long time looking at them, and said she was about taking a lodging in the neighbourhood, and wanted to buy some stoves, iron saucepans, and other things - the prisoner Molineaux was in the shop all the while. I at length said to the lady, "I will thank you to be as quick as you can as my fire is going out." The lady went into the passage where there were some stoves, and at length went away, and took a saucepan with her which came to 8 d., but she had but 7 d. - I said it was of no consequence; when I returned to the shop, I heard Molineaux say to the other prisoner - "Come, Betsy, let us go, you know where we have to go." They then went away, and in a short time Bosley came back to my shop, and putting her hands together said, "Oh Lord! oh Lord! that girl has robbed you." I said, it cannot be - she said, she has indeed. I then ran into the room and took a canister in which we keep some money - I thought there was the same money in it as before - Bosley then said, "Come to me at the Black Horse public-house, for that girl has four sovereigns" - it then struck me that we had been looking over our money on the Sunday, and had put away four sovereigns and some silver which made up 7 l. 19 s. 6 d., which we had been collecting towards a bill - I then went to a drawer where the money had been deposited, and found it opened very easily - I cannot swear that it had been locked - I looked in the drawer, and found that the money and the box that contained it, were gone - I then proceeded with Bosley to the Black Horse public-house in York-street, where we found Molineaux with a bundle - the landlady said, "Master, if you will look in that bundle you'll find some property of yours" - I looked in and found the four sovereigns and the box, but the little plated mug, where we keep the silver, I found in the room; but Mr. Rose was there, and he said, "You had better fetch her back." I did so, and then went to Mr. Friend; the other articles in the bundle were mine - there is some solder which I believed to be mine, but cannot swear to it. The money had been in the second drawer, in the nest of drawers in the bed room near the shop - we had seen it safe on the Sunday evening, and this was on the Tuesday. Molineaux was in the shop, but I cannot swear that she was there all the time Bosley had been sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020070"/>to get some charcoal, but she came back and they were both in the shop for five or six minutes. I had known Bosley by visiting my shop, and knowing her parents I trusted her.</p>

            . I live at the Black Horse public-house, in York-street. About half past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of November, I was in the yard, and heard two girls disputing in the privy, as if they were quarrelling about dividing some money - I got upon some things to try to see them, but could not - I thought there might be a man there, and broke open the door - I found the two prisoners with something tied up in a silk handkerchief, and blue apron - I said, "Where did you get those things." Molineaux said, "They are things I got out of pawn for my mother;" there was a shilling lay there, I said, "Whose is that?" she said, "It is my mother's." I then found two promissory notes. I let Bosley go, and detained Molineaux - I ran up to Bosley again, and said, "Where did you find these bills?" she said, "In the Broadway." I let her go - a person said I had better fetch her back, which I did, and then went to Mr. Beverstock's, but he had by that time got to the Black Horse public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable - I went to the Black Horse public-house, on the 16th of November, between four and five o'clock; the prosecutor and the two prisoners were there; he charged them with robbing him - I said, "Of what?" he said, "Of this money here." he then put it in this box, and delivered it to my custody - the moment the girls saw me they knew me, and one accused the other of the robbery; when I got them to the watch-house, Molineaux said to me, "Bosley took the money out of the drawer, and she will tell you so." Bosley then said, "Yes, Mr. Timbrell I took it." I said, "My good girl you must not say any thing to me." the prisoners were then both together, I don't know whether they were both together at the time the money was taken.</p>

               <p>MOLINEUX'S Defence. Bosley asked me to go to Beverstock's house, and ask if he made cast iron tea kettles, and to see if there was a woman there. I went in and told her No; she then went in and came out again, and took me to the end of the street, and told me to wait there - she then went back and I followed her. A man then came round with some beer. Mr. Beverstock then took us into the room, and gave us some beer, and wanted to take liberties with us; he then gave us 2 d., and told us to come again in half an hour. He then told us if any body came we were to call him uncle. The lady then came; we were in the room, and the drawer was open; Elizabeth Bosley took the box and put it in her pocket.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BEVERSTOCK re-examined. Q. You have heard what the prisoner has stated. Did you ever attempt any thing of the kind? A. I never did - I never gave them 2 d., upon my oath - I never attempted to take liberties with either of them; they were not more than once at my house on that day to my knowledge. Molineaux might have come there in the morning, but I did not see her, my wife was at home, but I was out.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN TIMBRELL re-examined. Q. When Molineaux was taken up did she say any thing on this subject to you? A. No, she said nothing about it that day, but the next morning she mentioned something of the kind.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DONNE. I live in Charlton-street. On the 13th of November I fell in with the prisoners in Castle-street, Gray's Inn-lane - I was neither drunk nor sober. I went to three public-houses with them and a young man, and after stopping at the third house sometime Hartnell snatched my watch out of my pocket, and ran out instantly - Easterby followed her; the young man stopped, and said it was all right, but the watchman was sent for. I have not found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you not quite drunk? A. Not very. I had some ale with them; I do not know how much. We went to two houses of ill-fame.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel. On the 24th of November, I met the prisoner six miles from St. Albans, with the child; my wife asked her whose it was, she said it belonged to a woman who was either behind or before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She frequently gave me the child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020072"/>with a hat on, and said, "When you are going up the street you can get a caster (a hat) for the child." I have frequently taken it into a cook shop, and fed it, and have taken it off the floor when she has been beastly drunk; she gave it to me, but not to take into the country - I have had six children, and am in the family way now, it is not likely that I should steal a child.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the 24th of November, between four and five o'clock, in the coffee-room. I was in the passage looking through the window, and saw him taking a spoon - he went out, and then went into the United Service Club - he asked for some gentleman's address, which I did not hear - he then went into Regent-street, and crossed the way. I followed, and stopped him. I said, he must go back with me to the St. Alban's coffee-house - on our way back, he said, he had got the spoon, and hoped Mr. Thornton would forgive him, as he was in distress - the spoon was found on the sideboard after we brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I would go back and be searched; but I had not got the spoon. - A. No; you confessed that you had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The waiter is under a mistake respecting the spoon - when he followed me and accused me of it, I was agitated, and do not know what I said - when we got back, there was nobody in the coffee-room but us; there was a great deal of exasperating language between us. I approached the table where their tea-tray was, and said, "You said, there were two spoons, and there they are." I have not taken one. I took up one of them; but I had not had it before - we were both in a state of exasperation, and what language I might have made use of, I do not know - the spoon was on the cloth, not the sideboard.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WINTER re-examined. There was no exasperation at all - the spoon had been taken from a saucer on the table, where I had not put it more than three minutes - there were two spoons - the other was in the sugar basin. I missed the spoon, and immediately followed him into the street - when the prisoner was taken, he gave the name of Burgess.</p>

I left the box while I put in the ear-rings. I might be there about half an hour, and went away. I did not look in the box again that day nor the next, but I looked into it on the Monday, and missed several gold seals and keys. I went into the country, and on my return, I told the landlord of the public-house of my loss - the officer went with me to another public-house - last Monday week we saw the prisoner, and he said, he would serve me out for giving charge of him for such a thing - when the officer had taken him about two hundred yards, he told the officer to stop, and he would speak to me - he then asked if I would be satisfied if I got my property back. I said, Yes; the officer has got three seals and two keys.</p>

Between five and six o'clock on the 29th of November, I found the prisoner at the Shakespeare's Head, public-house, Percival-street; I charged him with this robbery; he said he knew nothing of it. I took him to the office, and in going along he asked me to stop as he wanted to speak to Mr. Moseley, and asked if he would be satisfied if he got his property back - he said Yes. He said the property was in Addle-street; I went there, and a young woman came to the door, she gave me two seals, and one key - the other key and seal I got from Ansley.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES re-examined. When the prisoner had given up the seals he asked if we were satisfied; the prosecutor said, "No, I am not." The prisoner pawned the watch - he kept the duplicate and the money. The prosecutor was not willing to prosecute him, and asked me what he should do - I said I had nothing to do with it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ross, a pawnbroker, and live at Paddington. I have a saw, which was pawned by the prisoner, on the 6th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, for 2 s.; he said he bought it from his father, and gave the name that was stamped upon the saw. On the Monday morning the officer brought him to our shop; he said I was the person who took it in of him. He did not then say that his father had given it to him.</p>

He had three waistcoats, and in the jacket pocket there was a handkerchief, and a pair of braces; the prisoner said they were all his own - but I did not believe him. I asked what ship he belonged to; he said the Posthumous; I took the things, and went on board the ship. Green swore to them. I saw the chest in the forecastle, which had been broken open, and an iron instrument lying near it, which corresponded with the marks on the chest - in the long boot, by the side, there was a red night cap, which Green claimed; also the shoes on the prisoner's feet; the shoes in his hand were his own.</p>

I had seen them in the course of the day before. There was a frock, apron, and handkerchief lost at the same time. We had been washing, and they were on the table, or in the window, dry, ready to fold. Maria Turner is a servant in the house - a shift of hers was missing. I saw my things a fortnight afterwards, and Mr. Rickard's; but not the shift. The prisoners were quite strangers to me. Our door is open sometimes in the day - there is a school in the house - the kitchen is on the ground floor.</p>

On the day of the robbery, the two prisoners came to master's house, with some potatoes, and I let them in - they put the potatoes in a cellar - I lighted them down - they could have got into the kitchen without my observing them, because I went up stairs.</p>

I am sure of his person. I asked how many there were before I untied them - he said he did not know, for he had them from his sister, who had folded them up, and told him to bring them.

               <p>PECKHAM'S Defence. The prisoner Sanders called and asked me whether I would assist him in carrying some potatoes to Chiswell-street, and said that he would give me something for so doing, and in Globe-lane, he met his sister. I went on with the potatoes, so that I could pay no attention to their conversation. We arrived at Chiswell-street with the potatoes, which we carried down stairs; he carrying one portion down, and myself the other. After coming away, I proceeded on while Sanders followed with the barrow - I turned round, and could not see Sanders. I went back a little distance, and there saw him sorting some things, but whose they were, and what they were I have no knowledge, nor can I form any idea how he became possessed of them; he requested me to pawn them, which I refused; he said I was a fool not to take them, as they were his own. I at length consented, not doubting but they were his own.</p>

I had seen them on the 15th, about eight o'clock in the morning, in a cupboard, which was not locked. I went to Gravesend on that day, and returned on the 20th. I laid an information against the prisoner. I went to Gravesend again, and returned on the following Saturday - he was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did any other person lodge in the same room on the night of the 14th or 15th? - A. Yes; my partner did on the 14th, but not on the 15th. I saw them safe on the 15th.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. Giles's. I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of information, in Lawrence-lane, St. Giles's, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the evening of the 23d of November - the man had a pint pot under his jacket, and under the woman's shawl there were two pots - one in her hand and one under her arm. I asked, where they got them; they seemed quite alarmed. I do not know the answer they gave. I took them to the watch-house; and in the man's hat. I found two more pint pots, which make six in all - four of them were Mr. Theakston's, and two of them another person's; I asked, if they knew where they belonged to; the man said he could not read, and he had found them.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! I came out, and saw the prisoner as I ran up the street - he was not running then - he had dropped the coats on the ground, about twenty yards behind him - Ferris had stopped him before I got up to him.</p>

            . I live in Colebrook-place. I was in Galway-street, and saw the gig at the door of No. 1. I saw the prisoner cross the road, go to the gig, and take the coats - he ran towards me. I was on the same side as the gig was, about fifty yards from it. I stopped him, and he dropped them - there had been no cry of Stop thief! then - he did not say any thing about them - the prosecutor came up, and took him - the coats were picked up by a boy, who ran out with Johnson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had intended to steal them, would he have thrown them away before any alarm was made? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the street, on an errand. I saw a youth run along, and drop the coats. I picked them up - this young man stopped me, and cried Stop thief! - the prosecutor came up and took me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FERRIS re-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I saw two young men together - one went away; the prisoner took the coats out - it was very dark.</p>
