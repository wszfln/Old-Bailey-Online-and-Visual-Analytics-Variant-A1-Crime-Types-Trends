            . I had lost goods several times; I keep a shop, and fell by commission in Leaden-hall-market; I got up on Tuesday morning, and watched while the men were unloading the cart; I saw the prisoner undo a basket and take out four chine bones, the property of Mess. Bell and Goff; he went off, I ran after him, he threw the bones on the ground; I called out stop thief, he was stopped; as we were carrying him to the watch-house he pulled off his coat and ran away; the watchman said it was a small affair, and wanted me to let him go; one of them put his staff cross me in order to throw me down, but I ran and catched the prisoner again by St. Mary Axe church; I found the bones in the same place where the prisoner had throwed them down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Col. Hamilton. Yes, I found I believe thirty-three shirts and nine waistcoats at two pawnbrokers; I went to Mr. Bolland's the next morning, he gave me reason to think I had not fair play; I went to Sir

            . I was put in possession in the prisoner's house the 5th of September, by a power of attorney which was made from her husband to her to sell the goods, and she did sell them to Mr. Bolland some time before the fire happened; Mr. Bolland sent word he would advertise the goods and sell them, this was I think the Monday before the fire, if she did not let him have the money he had lent upon them; she had said her husband was coming and coming, but before she would have her goods advertised and sold, she would set them on fire and burn them all; I heard her say that more than once or twice, and he that was in possession with me heard her say the same. The morning the house was set on fire between six and seven, she sent the maid out of an errand to Mr. Bolland, and while the maid was gone, she went up and came down again to me in the kitchen; I heard her go up and come down, her room was up two pair of stairs forward; she came down stairs to me, and said I must see and kill her cat, for her cat ran about the house with fire upon her back; then she said her cat was a witch and would haunt her, and I must not kill her; I said, madam, one day we must kill her, and another day we must not, we will kill her by and by; then she found fault with the fluttishness of her maid.</p>

               <p>Stainsby. I had, four or five days before the fire, she had mentioned it two or three times before; as she was busy in the kitchen blowing the fire, I took the bellows to blow, she said she believed some body knocked at the door; I went up, there was nobody at the door; I came down again and said, madam, your house is all of a smother; she said, it may be by the people washing at the next house; I said, is it usual to smoke so at such time, she made me no answer; I said I did not think that was the occasion, and I thought my blowing the fire could not make such a smother; she made no answer: soon after some body knocked at the door, and said your house is on fire, the fire comes out at a two pair of stairs window; it broke out in the maid's bed chamber, that was a two pair of stairs room; there had not been any fire in that room since I had been in the house, which was fifteen days; I ran up stairs in order to burst the door open, but I could not get nigh it, the smoke and sulphur came so strong; there was

               <p>Q. How do you know the fire began in the maid's room?</p>
               <p>Stainsby. I saw the smoke come out at the maid's room door, and not out of the prisoner's room door; it could not break out in the prisoner's room first, they are both on the same floor; there was no other fire but in the parlour when I came down about six o'clock; the kitchen fire I light up myself.</p>

            .

             a room in the house?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. He had, to put his things in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any message from the Colonel about his coming home?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. I heard there was a message came that he should return the next week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did that message come?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. That was the Tuesday or Wednesday before the fire?</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come back when your mistress sent you to Mr. Bolland's?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. I returned about nine o'clock, then the house was burnt down to the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time had your mistress used to rise?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. She sometimes arose by six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she used to open her chamber-windows?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. Sometimes she used to open all her windows, and sometimes only her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a candle left in your room?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. I went up into it about two minutes before I went out of her errand, there was no candle there at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then go into your mistress's room?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No, I did not, the doors were both open; they opened one into the other; the doors were always open in the night-time, there was no candle in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find smoke in your house by any thing that was going forward in the next house?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the fire came?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No, I do not, I left the house very safe when I went out; my mistress had a rush-light burning in her room in the night, but she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190012"/> got out of bed between five and six, and put it out, that she said on the Monday morning after the fire; I heard her get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to mention that?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. I asked her whether it might not come by the watch-light; she said she got out between five and six, and put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it come by the soulness of the chimnies?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. The kitchen and parlour chimnies were both swept after I came there, it may be two or three months after I came there; I saw part of the shutters of her room open in her room when I went out.</p>

            . I live in the same street, directly opposite the prisoner's house, I used generally to see the windows open in a morning; when I got up that morning, I saw the windows shut about half an hour after seven; as I was putting on my clothes I saw the smoke come out at the two pair of stairs windows, there are two windows, both were shut; she was in general a very early riser, and the windows were generally open.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see the smoke when the shutters were shut?</p>
               <p>F. Parker. It came out at the crevices, they were inside shutters, and it came out between the brickwork; I came down, and told the prisoner, she was very much frighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am quite innocent, I know nothing how it came; Col. Hamilton never took a room of me, I gave him leave for a few days to leave some things with me; that fellow Stainsby has said he would be revenged of me, he smoked tobacco in my house; all this is spite and malice entirely, there is none more cautious of fire than I am, by being dreadfully burnt out before at Wapping wall; this Bolland wanted to arrest my husband, he sent his bailiffs after me, and I was carried to his house; he heard I was going to sell my goods, I let him come and appraise my goods, he put in two fellows; I said to him, Mr. Bolland, take that man out of my house, he smokes so I cannot live in the house; Col. Hamilton desired me to recommend him to a workwoman to make him some stocks, I employed a woman in my house; I did not know he would take the key of the garret away, I had a key of the other garret that opened his room; I did surely make use of his things, but I intended to fetch them again in a few days; I never wronged man, woman, or child in all my days: and now I am upon my trial, by the confusion of my attorney, my witnesses are not here, I should have had 500 to my character, I can prove I have been a woman of an undeniable character, I have the best of characters that any poor woman has; this man has robbed my husband of his goods, and now he wants to take my life away; I know not how the fire came, unless by this cat, she used to be frighted out of the kitchen, and out of the parlour; as she used to lie under the grate, I told them to beat her away; that Stainsby threatened my life, he looks so like a thief I hated him, every word he has said is all false; Dundass said, Bolland offered him 20 l. to swear against me, and he answered he would go to the farthest part of the world before he would.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you consent to his putting your watch down for a guinea.</p>
               <p>Williams. Upon my oath I did not, he slipped it from my hand, and put it down without my consent, and held his hand upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave it you back again, who was by?</p>
               <p>Williams. Then there was my brother and the constable.</p>

            . I was servant to the deceased Mr. Stoddart, the keeper of Bridewell; I took in the prosecutor between twelve and one o'clock at night; he would not have a bed, so I put him among the others, and in the morning he complained he had lost 6 l. I found Matthews and Antrobus, who we call Tantrabobus, on the women's side; I brought them round; the prosecutor offered a guinea to any one that would help him to his money; I knowing Tantrabobus to be a thief, having robbed many since he was there, I charged him with taking it; he told me it was put into a stocking and throwed down into the cellar; we went down, and there we found two 5 s. 3 d. pieces, and half a crown; we took the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190017"/> before Justice Welch, there Tantrabobus owned he picked the man's pocket, and gave it to Matthews in his hammock; Matthews owned he had two 5 s. 3 d. pieces handed up by Tantrabobus, (13 s. 3 d. produced in court.)</p>

I keep the Fox and Anchor Inn in Charter-house-lane; on Wednesday the 7th of September the mare was brought to my house about four in the afternoon by the prisoner; he put her up, and said he would call again the next morning; I never saw him from that time till the Tuesday following, which was the 12th; on the Saturday there came a man that said he came from the man that brought her, to know the expences; that man came again with spurs on, and no boots, and a whip in his hand, and said he came to pay the expences, and to take the mare away; I said, I should be glad to know what sort of a person you take me to be, to deliver the mare to the person I knew nothing of, without authority from the person that brought her; he went away: on the Monday morning I saw the advertisement in the paper, describing her; in consequence I wrote to Mr. Cooke in the Borough, where the advertisement directed; he came and said it was the very mare that was advertised for: on the Tuesday morning the prisoner came for the mare, my wife sent a message to Mr. Cooke, to let him know the man was come; I came down stairs, he desired I would make my bill out; I told him it was so much corn, and five shillings he borrowed of me when he came with her; I had got a constable ready, we secured him, and in four or five hours Mr. Wells and Mr. Cooke came; he said he knew nothing about stealing the mare; when he brought her, I think he said he was a farmer at Harrow, and had sold a load of hay.</p>

I live in White Hart-court, Long-lane, near Smithfield; I have known him two years, he has a very honest character; I lay in Baxter's kitchen three or four nights; on Tuesday the 6th of October I think it was, I came down stairs and asked him how he did about 7 o'clock; he said very well; he said he was going up to Hampstead to fetch some tools away; I saw no more of him till night, then he said to me, what do you think, (he was pretty much in liquor) said he, there was a fellow at Highgate said I was a sheep-stealer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he got away from the man?</p>
               <p>M'Cay. He said a fellow workman came up and said, that man was more like a sheep-stealer than he, and that he had been branded in the hand in this court.</p>

            . I am a house-keeper at No 8, White Hart-court, Long-lane; I am a clog-maker, he was a lodger in my house twelve months; he behaved like an honest man, I never heard he was accused of sheep-stealing.</p>
               <p>- Mills. I was foreman to Mr. English; the prisoner worked under me between thirteen and fourteen months, in that time he behaved well; he was gone from me two or three months before I heard of his being charged with sheep-stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Wheeler. How did he behave when he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. He did not behave like an honest man; Baxter and his wife used to come there and stay till one or two in the morning, and eat pork and mutton, and what they could get; the first I saw of this was a carcase of a sheep lying on the floor one morning; I asked the prisoner's wife how it came there; she came to my room and said, for God's sake, never mention it; I saw two lambs at a time there; they melted sat till they set the chimney on fire, there were forced to be two engines to put it out, or I had been burnt down; I desired them to go out of my house, and they would not, till at last they went away in a clandestine manner, and did not pay me; since that I have had some money; Baxter said to me here I shall not go home alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Who heard him say so?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. Mr. Clayton did.</p>
               <p>Clayton. Mrs. Wheeler was standing talking to me, Baxter shook his head at her and said, you wicked woman, you never will go alive home, them were his words; Mrs. Wheeler has been at my house, and given me information against the prisoner, and told me there were things brought in at unseasonable hours when the prisoner lodged there; she has desired me to go and search, saying there was a carcase in the house, but one thing or other hindered my going; we have watched about the house to see if any thing was brought in; I see since it was a great fault that I did not go and search.</p>

I live with Mr. Leay, he is very ill and cannot attend; our shop was broke the 13th of September, either late at night or early next morning; we left the house safe when we went to bed at eleven, and in the morning we found the front iron was wreached, and the shutter was taken down, and ten hats taken out; I was going into Whitechapel, I thought I would make Duke's-place in my way, to see if any Jews were hawking them about; I saw some hats in Lyon's shop; I went in under a pretence of buying a boy's hat; I saw one lying, I laid hold of it, he would not let me have it; I snatched it out of his hand, and in about ten minutes time I found six, there is part of my own work upon them; I know them to be Mr. Leay's property, they stand him in 3 l. 5 s.</p>

            . I live at the King's Arms, between St. John's street and Islington; on the 3d of September, a little before twelve at night, I was going down to the watch-house; near the turnpike I heard the cry of murder, I turned back again to the turnpike, I heard the blows and sticks go; I asked the turnpike man to go into the fields with me; he said he could not go off his duty; then I returned to the watch-house at Clerkenwell-green, they had heard the cry there; after that I went to Bridewell near one o'clock, there was Mr. Stoddart, the keeper, very much bruised, he had been stabbed and ill used; he was in his own house within the gate, very bloody, lying on his back on a pillow or bed; his clothes were taken off all but his shirt, he had his right-hand over his left-side on a wound; as soon as I could come near him, I asked him how he came to be in that condition; he said he was coming down from the <placeName id="t17681019-43-crimeloc252">New River Head</placeName>

I was servant to the deceased; betwixt twelve and one, between the Saturday night and Sunday the 4th of September, my master was brought home by two or three men and a woman; I found him sitting on a bench in the yard, he said, I am a dead man, Langley; he said, two rascals stopped me in the first field, and said to him, d - n your eyes, your money or life; one of the villains sought fair, and the other cut him with a knife or cutlace; that he overpowered one of them, and got him down, and the other villain came and stabbed him under the breast; we took him up into the parlour, and set him in a chair, and called his sister; I went and called Mr. Hart the surgeon, he came and dressed him about one o'clock; when he was lying in bed, I found a wound on his left-side, an inch or an inch and a half long; his hands were very bloody, he had a cut across the top of his forehead; he said he tore one of the rascals coats off in the fields; we went several of us up into the field, there we found a hat, two wigs, a coat, and two or three pieces of a black silk handkerchief; I staid on the spot; just after day-light I observed a milkman pick up something; he went four or five yards, and put down his things, and came back again to look; I went to him, and said, have you lost any thing; he said, no, but I have found a silver button, he gave it me; I said, go over with me into the field, I will show you where my master was stabbed and the blood; there we found my master's watch-chain and a clasp-knife all bloody, within about two yards of it; I can swear to the chain by the seal, I know it well; I went to see the prisoner in Tothil-fields Bridewell the Friday after he was taken; he said he and Simpson stopped my master with intent to rob him, and that Simpson was the man that stabbed and cut him.</p>

I am a surgeon, I was called in to Mr. Stoddart on the 4th of September, about one in the morning; I found several wounds about him, but the greatest injury seemed to be on his left-side; he had a great difficulty in fetching his breath, and he spit some blood, there was a cut about an inch and a half long on his side; I dressed him, and after a few days he appeared to get rather better; on Tuesday the 13th in the morning I found him much worse, he complained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190029"/> of a great fulness in his stomach, and of a greater difficulty of breathing; he continued growing worse and worse, till the day he died, which was the 18th; I opened the body, and found the left cavity of the thorax near full of an extravasated fluid, which was the cause of his death; I saw him in health about an hour before he went out that evening; that wound had not past very far on his side, his death could not have been from that; he said he had been beat and trod upon by two footpads that used him very ill, it must be the bruises that occasioned his death; I desired him at first not to talk, as it would be injurious to him; but when he began to get a little better he gave a particular account, and frequently repeated to me that he was stopped at the end of a lane by Islington Spaw by two fellows, who demanded his money or life; that he said, you rascals, I hope you shall have neither; that he had them down several times in the lane, and in the ditch, and they endeavoured to get away from him, and he ran after them, and got one by the coat, which the man slipped off; then he took hold of him, and tore his shirt off, and left him naked, but being faint by the loss of blood, he could not stand it any longer, and they got away from him; one ran away, and he had the other in a ditch, and the other came back again and cut him, he thought with a cutlace; he said, sometimes he was down, and at other times they were; he said he remembered receiving a blow on his side, which he thought was by a stick, which I think occasioned that extravasated fluid, which deprived the left lobe of the lungs from receiving any air, which hindered it by way of suffocation; I saw a cut in his coat where the wound on his side was, he mentioned being beat by both of them.</p>

I live at Redburn in Hertfordshire; I came to town the 8th of August, 1767, on purpose to take a draft of 30 l. of Mr. Green of Thames street; I went there, and was told he would not be at home within two hours; I went on London bridge to pass some time away, while I was standing there the prisoner came to me, I never saw him in my life before; he said, how do you do brother farmer; I said, I was very well; he asked me if the water-works were not some mill, and said he was a stranger in London, that he kept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190030"/> a farm at Bristol of 80 or 90 l. a year of his own, and that he was come to London to take about 70 or 80 l. and was disappointed, and had not taken it at present; I told him I came to receive a bill of 30 l. but the gentleman was not at home; after some time I wished him a good night, saying, I must go home; he said, we being brother farmers must drink together; we went into an alehouse just going up the hill, and had sixpennyworth of rum and water; I said I must go, I went out; he said he was going my way; I walked to the Change, still he followed me; I had told him I was to go to the gentleman in two hours time for the money; he told me he would take me to where was a pot of good porter, then we went to the Coach and Horses in Bishopsgate-street; I went to sit down in a box, he said, no, we had better go into another room; we went into a private room, in about two or three minutes in came two men, one of them shammed very fuddled, and said, d - n it, I have been tossing up with some butchers boys, and lost 5 l. and said, d - n it, he ha not cared if it had been an hundred; they did not seem to be acquainted at first with the prisoner, but they soon got to be acquainted; the prisoner asked him how he lost it; he said in toffing, and that he could guess three times out of four; said the prisoner, d - n it, I will lay you a shilling you do not; he and the darken man pretended to toss for a shilling, the prisoner tossed up, and the other was to guess; the prisoner won; then the other said he would give him a toss for 40 or 50 l. the prisoner asked me if I had any money about me; I said, no, nothing but that note I was to get change for; come, said he, I will go with you to the gentleman; he went down with me, the gentleman was not at home that time; we came back again, and staid some time; then I and one of the other men went down, and then the gentleman paid me, I think nine guineas and a half, and six pence, and two 10 l. bank notes; we came up to them again, then there happened to be two strange gentlemen come into the room; then the prisoner said, it will not do here, there was a bustle among them; they paid the reckoning, and went out and I with them; when in the street the prisoner said to me, come along farmer, we must drink together; they went to <placeName id="t17681019-44-crimeloc257">the Nag's Head Tavern in Leadenhall-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>M. Elliot. No, but I saw him in London since; I met him as I happened to go through Clement's-inn and stopped him, and asked him how he did, and if he was not the person that I saw with handcuffs on at Chatham. *</p>

               <p>A. Hughes. It was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days might you stay at Chatham after this?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Never a day at all; I came up to London and sold my things as I came along.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find it out that it was this young man?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because he was coming thro' Lumber-court, and I took notice of him by the cast of his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. That was half a year ago; I was in the court and knew him directly; there was a woman along with him, it was the prisoner at the bar; it was she subpoened me, that is Mr. Davis did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about this affair before you was subpoened?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. No, not till I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know where to find you out?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because I knew them, and I said, this is the young man that was handcuffed at Chatham; I am certain that was all that passed between me and him till I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was two years ago last April?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because that was the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business at Chatham?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I sell laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know you was at Chatham at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I can't swear to the week nor to the month, but I know it was two years ago last April.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not September?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I am not very certain whether it was April or September.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether it was summer or winter?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I am sure it was in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it summer or winter?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. It was April that comes after the month of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Lumber-court?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. It is by the Seven Dials in West-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man that had the handcuffs on say any thing to you about April?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. No, but I knew it was April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined at Guildhall?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I never was at no hall in my life.</p>

            . I saw young Davis at Chatham in the dock-yard, there was a crowd; I had been drinking a pint of beer at the Globe alehouse with Mrs. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. It is about two years ago; I went out of curiosity to see what was the matter; I saw him with handcuffs on him, upon my oath I did, in the dock-yard; I saw no more; I endeavoured to get out of the croud as soon as I could; Mrs. Hughes brought me into the country with laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I live in Smart's-buildings in Holbourn; I used to go with her with laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you gone down there?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I believe it was in May or April, I don't know which; I know it was in the beginning of summer.</p>
               <p>Q. What month is the present?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. It is October I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Hughes in the dock-yard with you at the time?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that young man before?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. Mrs. Hughes was drinking a pint of beer at the Black Dog in St. Giles's; she came to me and said, do you remember the young fellow you saw at Chatham that was handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she mention this to you?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. This was yesterday morning; said she, should you know him again; I sai d, yes, for he had a cast in his eye; she brings him down, I said indeed that is the young fellow; I said, Sir, did I ever see you at Chatham; said he, if you are a person that saw me at Chatham, I am glad to see you, and he made me drink out of his pint pot; then he took me to another house, and made me take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190035"/> a shilling and this paper, and said no more to me; I was to appear in regard to seeing him handcuffed; he asked me no particulars at all, only to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mrs. Hughes and you been at Chatham before you saw this young man?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. Not many days, perhaps three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had seen him did you make for London?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. We made our way for London that day, to the best of my knowledge; I can't recollect the particulars of every thing.</p>

            . I heard what the prisoner swore, she swore the man was handcuffed in Mr. Hanway's house at Chatham, and they were separated and put in a hole, Davis in a top hole, and she could not see him after that; and when they went to the Justice's house, she could not tell whether the handcuffs were on him as he was going along or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her talking about a rope being upon him?</p>
               <p>Reading. I cannot charge my memory with that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fletcher. Did you observe Davis's hands to be bloody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fletcher. They were not bloody; I used him with as great good manners as I could any gentleman; there was not a word mentioned of handcuffs; I treated him with all the lenity a person in his circumstances could be treated with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wildash. Did you observe his hands to be bloody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wildash. His hands were not bloody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain about his hands being hurt by handcuffs?</p>

               <p>Mr. Fletcher No, I live out of the town; it is not at all in the way to my house from the dock-yard to go by the Salt-water Bath; to go by Salt-water Bath is no more in the way than from here Westminster is in the way to Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this young man was ever carried the Salt-water Bath way to your house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fletcher. No, he was not, he was carried from my house to Brompton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pank. After the examination at Mr. Fletcher's house, where was the prisoner carried to?</p>
               <p>Pank. He was carried to Brompton.</p>

               <p>M. Thompson. No, I do not mean that, she might have been married to 'Squire Butler had it not been for Mrs. Quin.</p>
               <p>Council. Was your sister a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She did live with 'Squire Butler.</p>
               <p>Council. Was your sister a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. No, not as I know of, I am talking of her box, she has been dead seven months.</p>
               <p>Council. Was she a common woman of the town, what is called a woman of pleasure, from time to time, to different people?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She lived very honest, and died very honest; she retired from business, and would have no connection with lewd women.</p>
               <p>Council. I will have an answer, was she a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. No, she was not, for she was a married woman.</p>
               <p>Council. Who was her husband?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She told me on her dying bed she was married to Mr. Farrel, he lives at Marybone, he did keep a bagnio in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Council. Was your sister reputed to be a woman of the town?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She might have had a misfortune to be sure; I do not know what you mean by a woman of the town, she was unfortunate.</p>
               <p>Council. Had not she been a woman to many scores at different times?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. O, my God, I think that was a false information given you, she really could not bear a thing of that kind, she could not bear to sit where a lewd woman was for years, for that reason she lived retired.</p>
               <p>Council. Was not she sent for sometimes to a tavern to a gentleman, I will mention the Bedford Arms, and the Shakespeare under the Piazzas, for these last seven or eight years?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She died at twenty-seven years of age, I saw her first and her last breath, I wish we may all die as well and as happy as she; I am a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190037"/> very honest woman, I will not tell a lie for the world</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never live at a bagnio?</p>
