Lee told me of the loss of his shirt; I went to the prisoner's lodgings, I saw him come out and go into Carpenter-street, I called to him and asked him if he had not got this man's shirt about him; he said no, he had not; I told him I thought he had, and I would take him back to his lodgings and see if I could not find it; he said. I was welcome to search. I thought his hat did not set so well as it should, I took his hat off, and I found the shirt in his hat.</p>

When I got into the court she came up to me, put her hand into my pocket, and pulled out three one pound bank notes; she dropped one of them; I attempted to pick it up, and some women who were standing in the court pushed me a way; I saw the prisoner pick it up; I called the watch, a german came up; he called watch, the watchman came and immediately the prisoner ran away; I and the german and the watchman pursued her; the prisoner ran into a house and shut the door; I and the german went to St. Martin's watchhouse and got a constable; he knocked at the door and they opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the court - A. I do not know; it was a different court. They opened the door and we went up stairs; we looked into one room where there were some young women; the young women cried out, is it me; I knew it was not them. We went into another room and found her in bed; she then said she had never been out that night; no notes were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken any personal liberty with her - A. No; there were no more words passed than what I have spoke to you; she did not speak a word when she put her hand in my pocket, and she had her hand out so quick I could not stop her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the room where you found her in bed - A. Yes; the bed and the room was searched; we found no notes. I was perfectly sober. I had been to Knightsbridge barracks to see my brother-in-law's brother. I had only a share of a pot of porter that afternoon.</p>

I went in doors and came out again; there were six or eight women outside of the door; them I saw a piece of paper on the pavement, one of them stooped and picked it up; I went up stair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180004"/>and did not hear any more about it till they came up, searched me and the room, and took me to the watch-house.</p>

About five o'clock on Monday morning, the 25th of June, Griffiths, my fellow officer, came to my house and called me up, and said there had been a public house broken open in Wentworth-street; we went and found the head of the shutter cut enough to take the shutter down; we then went and searched the persons of bad character; I found the prisoner in bed with a girl in a court in Wentworth-street, about a quarter past six in the morning; I then went to a closet in the room and found these halfpence; he was in bed with a girl, undressed; they were in this handkerchief, I found a pistol in the closet, a center bit, and this small chisel, and under the pillar I found these bits of soap; I then took them to the house that was broken open and tried this chisel to two places where the lead had been cut away under the shutter; there were two places that fitted it; we then took him to the office and went and weighted the soap, it weighed three pounds nine ounces. In taking him to the office I asked where he got the halfpence; he at first hesitated, and I asked him again; he then said he had them from his father on Saturday night; he said he knew nothing about the soap.</p>

On the 23d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner with two others came into to my house, apparently as if they had just met on the spot, they called for a glass of liquor a piece; the prisoner presented me a one pound Billericay note to pay for three glasses of liquor that came to about nine-pence. This is the note, I marked it at the back; it is a one pound Billericay note. I told him I could not give him change of a one pound note; then one of them said, you may as well have your liquor here as any where else; they had a bottle of brandy and a pint of gin; I told them I had about ten shillings of change; Carpenter presented me the same one pound note; I said, I do no not like the note; I objected to it because it was a country note; Carpenter then said, you must give me change for a five pound note; I saw it was a Southampton note; I had suspicion it was a forged note; I thought I had better give change for the one pound note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did not you think it would be better not to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180005"/>give change for either of them if it was a forgery - A. Yes, but I saw the place in town, I thought the one pound note might be a good one, he said, they were all as good as the Bank, he took them all in Smithfield that morning; he had a pocket-book full. He said he had a friend in the lock-up-house. I was not to take for the bottle he would return it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you give him change for the note - A. Yes, I gave Carpenter the change, somewhere about ten shillings. When they went away, Carpenter said, if any body should enquire for Harding, to say they should he here and spend the evening; then they went away; they did not come in the evening; and then I suspected it was a bad note; this was on Friday. On Monday morning I presented the note to No. 31, Addle-street where it specified on the note to be payable; the landlord of the house informed me, there had been a party there that came to swindle people.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. No. I live at present in Size-lane. I had a house in Addle-street, I left that house 1809, I had it in 1808, the number was 31; a man of the name of Butler took an accompting-house of me, he called himself an agent, that was in 1808, I never saw Mr. Butler there after it was taken, his clerks as he called them were there from four to five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business they were carrying on there - A. I understood they had to do with the Billericay bank; they left my house towards the latter end of February 1809; they came in the morning with a cart and horse to remove the desks and the fitting up of the accompting-house; I prevented that and stopped the desk. I saw Mr. Butler afterwards; he sent his broker to value the articles; and I gave him the difference.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 5th of July, I went, in company with Mr. Armstrong, to Mr. Cotton, the pawnbroker in Shoreditch, where I found the prisoner Jacobs and these three gowns; I searched her, and in her pocket I found this habit-shirt; I told her the things were stolen, and asked her how she came by them; she said, she had bought them of a man that day in Wentworth-street. On the following day Smith was brought to the office in custody, I shewed him the gowns and told him he was charged with stealing them; he said, he bought them of a woman in Spitalfields for eight shillings, and sold them to Mrs. Jacobs for eight shillings; Mrs. Jacobs was present, she said, I bought the gowns of you, and you gave me an old shirt in the bargain. Smith acknowledged selling her the gowns but denied giving her the old shirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She said that she bought them in Wentworth-street - A. She did, she said of Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Wentworth-street is near Petticoat-lane, it is a place, a fair where people buy these things - A. Yes, on certain days they do.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Cotton, 42, Shoreditch. On the 5th of July about half past five, these two gowns were presented to John Hall, the apprentice, by the woman prisoner, he brought them to me in the kitchen, I knew them to be the pattern of the pieces that were left with me; I came into the shop, and asked her if she had any thing else she wished to leave; she said, why, is not there enough; I said, you have got another gown in your lap, let me look at that; I detained her when I found they all three answered to the pieces that I had left with me. I delivered the gowns up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the gowns worth - A. About sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I bought the property in the open street and sold them in the open street to this woman. When I have got money I buy any thing I can.</p>
               <p>Jacobs Defence. I bought the gowns in the open street; I offered the man half a guinea, he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180006"/>take less than twelve shillings; I had no more than eight shillings in my pocket; I asked him to go home with me; I pawned my ear-rings for four shillings; I have the duplicate in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>- ABRAHAMS. Q. Were you in Wentworth-street any time, when you saw any thing pass between the two prisoners - A. I was, last Thursday week between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the woman prisoner buy three gowns of the man prisoner, she gave him twelve shillings, this was in Wentworth-street, he sold her the gowns and the habit-shirt, he said, he might as well give it her, as it was of no use to him. Them are the very gowns, I stood by; if the woman had not bought them I should have tried if I could have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sent for you when she was in prison - A. Yes, to know if I recollected the man that she bought the gowns of; I told her yes, the next day I went into the fair and saw the same person, I gave him in charge directly.</p>
               <p>Jacobs called eight witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

I was not in the shop at the time they came in, my wife was. When I came into the shop I observed two women in the shop with my wife. My wife asked me if I had any change, I said, I had not; she went out for change of a dollar. While she was gone the prisoner and the other woman and myself were in the shop. The prisoner tapped the other woman on the shoulder, and said, I had better go and tell your husband that we are waiting for change. As soon as she spoke my wife came in and gave the prisoner the change, I believe it was 3 s. 7 d. then the prisoner and the other woman went out together; the moment they were gone I missed the piece of stocking out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen it before that - A. I had seen it between three and four in the afternoon; it stood in the window near against the prisoner and the other woman's back were they were standing. I went out of my shop; I saw the prisoner about ten yards from the door; I laid hold of her; the other woman was before, and immediately upon my laying hold of the prisoner I saw her drop the piece of stocking from under her apron; I saw it fall and unroll as she walked along; I picked it up and brought it in, together with the prisoner. It was my stocking piece, it is about six yards and a half, it had my mark upon it, and worth about thirty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me drop it. I never had it. I was washing and ironing for a woman, it amounted to six shillings; she came in and asked for the linen; he said she could not pay me without I went with her to Mr. Grove to sell some silk ferris to get change. I waited for her till such time she went out of the shop, and when we came out she ran away. I have never seen her since.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these two ladies in the shop a part of her company - A. Oh, no, they had a servant at the door. When the ladies went out of the shop, the prisoner asked me the price of some lace in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What lace was there in the window - A. A white laced veil, with a border round the bottom, and there were several veils hanging up in the window, but she pointed to that; I told the prisoner to go out of the shop, I was certain she did not want to buy any lace, according to the appearance of her, she immediately went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she to the lace when you first observed her - A. I suppose about two or three yards from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the lace in the window - A. No, I had a box of lace on the counter, it was from there I lost the property; the moment she was gone, a carriage drove up to the door, two ladies came out and wanted some lace, I immediately went to the lace box which was upon the other counter, I took the lace box and found all the laced veils and handkerchiefs in the box were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was this lace box placed - A. At the bottom of the shop, on the counter, near the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time seen the prisoner near that lace box - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. Must she come past it to come into the shop - A. No, she must have gone the whole length of the shop to have gone up to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from any circumstance how long she had been in the shop - A. She might have been in the shop about five minutes without my observing her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop before you went in - A. Nobody, nor any body in the lower part of the house, I was in by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the parlour that might have observed her - A. No, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the shop door open - A. Always; winter and summer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you enumerate the particulars of what was gone from the lace box - A. A number of veils and laced handkerchiefs, and a pair of sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you mention them in particular - A. Yes, about a dozen black laced veils.</p>
               <p>Q. How many laced handkerchiefs - A. There might be eight or nine to a dozen, and white laced veils as well as black, a dozen of white and a dozen of black, I dare say, and a pair of laced sleeves. It was on Whit-monday they were missed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of this property that was missing - A. Not till the Friday following. After I had missed them that afternoon, I went to Marlborough-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180007"/>office and gave information; on the Friday following, two officers and a pawnbroker brought some of them to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them when you saw them again - A. Yes, they shewed me a long veil which I was robbed of, I can speak to it in particular. I went with the officer to where the prisoner was at a public house in Marlborough-street; she then told us there were some of the other laced things at her lodgings, where we went immediately to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any found upon her - A. Yes, upon her head. She told me that she had seen me in the shop, and she had robbed me just before the two ladies came in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise or any threats - A. No, she fell a crying, and told us where some of the things were; she said she had sold some at Wandsworth; we went the next morning, on Saturday, and took her to Wandsworth, the officer and myself; she went out of the coach and walked to the shop where she had sold them, we found three veils there which we brought away with us; she likewise told us that she sold one in Cold Bath-fields, and some she sold to a young girl that was gone in the country, which was the reason she wanted to know the price of the lace, on account of her selling them to this young girl. We got the veil that she had sold at Cold Bath-fields, from a house just by the prison; she went with us and took us to the place.</p>

did not want it; I knowing of him, took it up to take care of it for him.</p>

I had a little boy between twelve and thirteen years old, a bed and a sleep. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, I thought it was my husband; I said, Dick, is that you; he said, do not speak. He said nothing else coming in nor going out; I said nothing more to him. He took two waistcoats, and a pair of nankeen trowsers off the line in the room; there were two shirts and a pair of cotton stockings, wrapped up in an old table cloth at the end of the table; he took them to the door, whether there was any body at the door I do not know. He came back again and took down my clock, after that he took down my husband's leather breeches from a nail, and then he took a bason with a saucer at the top, that contained a bit of victuals. On the next morning I found the bason broke, and the saucer whole, in a field at the end of the house. He took all these things away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to interrupt him - A. No, I was afraid if I spoke he would kill me. About that day fortnight he came within a little distance of the gate, he said, mother, what is it o'clock; I said, I did not know, I had not seen a clock that day; and through the window I thought I knew the man. He then asked me to tell him the way to Halsden-green; I said, I did not know; I said to myself, that is the man that robbed me; I knew the man again, and knew his voice. I followed him into the village, and made enquiries after him, I did not find him. I have never seen any of the articles since.</p>

His foreman said, if it is so, perhaps you may make it up, a guinea shall be no object; the prisoner said, I did not know him, I could not hurt him; he never acknowledged that he committed the fact. I was at Wilsdon, on the 17th of May, when the robbery was done, I staid out late that night. Wilsdon is about half a mile from Church-end.</p>

I went into the cellar accompanied by him, I saw the paper parcel tied up, Clark had opened some part of it, I saw eight ounces of twist and a pound of silk, I knew it was my property; this was between nine and ten in the morning; we left the silk there till we saw the house clear, and then Matthews and me fetched it up stairs and examined it. After we were fully convinced it was our own property, I tied it up and left it in the same place; I knew it to be our's, I am quite sure of it. After we had replaced it we waited to see if any of the servants moved it. Clark went down into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180009"/>cellar about three o'clock in the afternoon, and I went down and saw the parcel was missing. In the course of that time Cripps had been out with the cart, when he went out the parcel was in the cellar, and when he returned at two o'clock the parcel was in the cellar; and about three o'clock we missed it. The prisoner was gone out with the cart, when we took it up stairs and examined it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to this cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the parcel was gone at three o'clock, what steps did you take to find who had taken it - A. My partner wanted the horse in the afternoon, and the prisoner had to go to the west end of the town with some goods; we asked him for the key of the stable, he was the person that kept the key, he left the key behind him and soon after he went out with other goods. The stable is in Grub-street; Matthews and Clark went there and brought back the same silk and twist that I had seen in the cellar in the morning; Matthews tied some knots in the silk and put some pins with the heads off in the twist. I am sure it is the same silk that I had seen in the cellar. The prisoner returned about eight o'clock in the evening, he put by his knot, then I desired him to walk into the accompting-house. I shewed him the parcel, and asked him if he had seen it in the course of the day in the cellar or the stable; he said, he had not; I was provided with a constable, I desired the constable to take charge of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you promise him any favour - A. I threatened him then, if he did not tell the truth, I certainly would prosecute him as far as the law would let me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the other partner a share in the house - A. The rent and taxes are paid out of the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other place in which your family reside - A. My family chiefly reside at Camberwell. I always had a good opinion of Cripps before this time, he lived with me about a twelvemonth; I know nothing of Barnaby.</p>
               <p>- CLARK. I am warehouseman to Mr. Scarratt. On the 22nd of June, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I went into the cellar to draw beer, I observed a paper parcel lying under the stairs, curiosity led me to take it up, I examined it, I found it contained silk and twist.</p>
               <p>Q. It is of the same quality as is in your masters' warehouse - A. It is. I informed the other warehouseman, my master was not up; after breakfast I saw Mr. Scarratt, I informed him, he went down and saw the parcel, it was not weighed in my presence. About three o'clock I went into the cellar, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of your masters' stable - A. The prisoner. I and Matthews went to the stable about six o'clock, Matthews found the same parcel of silk and twist in the stable, concealed behind a board; we took it back to Mr. Scarratt.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS. I am a fellow servant to the last witness. I first saw the silk in the cellar, I afterwards saw it when it was taken up in the warehouse. I opened it and marked it, I could swear to the articles without any mark, it was packed up and put in the same place as before. I got the key of the stable of the prisoner. About six o'clock, in the stable, between the weather-board and the lining I found the parcel, I knew it to be my master's silk and twist. After the prisoner was taken in custody, I went with the Constable, Clark, and two others, to the Green Dragon public house, in Fore-street; Cripps had then the stolen property in his pocket, Cripps and the constable went in first; when I went in, Cripps and Barnaby were drinking together.</p>

            . I am a constable. Cripps was delivered in charge to me by Mr. Scarratt; Mr. Scarratt shewed him the parcel of silk in my presence, and asked him if he had ever seen that parcel in the cellar; the prisoner said no, he had not seen it there. I took charge of him, and took him to the Green Dragon public-house, in Fore-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other prisoner Barnaby there - A. I did. Cripps went in with the parcel in his hand, I stood about six yards behind him; I could not hear a word they said, Cripps gave 
               <persName id="t18100718-12-person151">Barnaby</persName>
             the parcel, and he put it behind his coat on the settle; I watched, and when I saw Barnaby put it in his pocket. I took hold of him, and told him he had stolen property: I brought him up to Mr. Scarratt, and then I took it out of Barnaby's pocket; I have had it ever since.</p>

I had the key of the room where the prosecutor and prisoner lodged, on the day the things were stolen, the room door was locked from nine o'clock in the morning till nine at night, I locked it myself. At a quarter past nine at night, the prisoner came in, I gave him the key, he went up to bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180010"/>at that time. I took the prisoner without a character, I had suspicion of him, I watched the light every night, and that night he kept the light in a long while, I thought he was either robbing me, or the young man that was in that room.

There were some children that saw the prisoner, they knew where she lived, they went to Mr. Gilman's, he went and took her, and my son in law sent for an officer, and had her searched in his house; I saw her searched, a tobacco box was found upon her, it was my tobacco box, no dollar was ever found upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time that you lost the notes they were not on your person - A. No; after I got in bed I saw her put her hand into my pocket, she wanted some money to get some porter; she then locked me in and ran down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180011"/>stairs. I rapped at the door, some person came and said, make yourself happy and comfortable, she is only gone for a pot of porter. I laid in the bed till seven o'clock in the morning, and when I was loosened out of the room, I enquired of the mistress of the house where Mrs. Foley was, I told her I was robbed of my money: she told me she was gone to a shop in Charlotte-street, and there I should find her drinking of gin; I went, and found the prisoner coming out of a gin shop with half a pint of gin, and a handfull of halfpence; I stopped her and asked for my money. I sent for an officer, he came and searched her, he found no notes; I have never found my notes since.</p>

The woman came down, and said she would stop no longer for the eighteen-pence; I went into the room to him and asked him if all was right, when he was sitting by the bed side, he said yes, then I locked the door and came down stairs.

On the next morning, I went to Mr. Matthews in the Minories, I found one of them pledged there for three shillings about half an hour after it was stolen; I gave information at the office, the officers told me they knew the men, and where the property was, they were playing at skittles every day, they could take them; I was afraid to go, this passed on.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the glass fallen in the shop - A. No, outside, the glass fell on the pavement, and gave the alarm; there were two lights in the shop, but when the window was broke the wind blew one of the lights out. It was a dark night.</p>

In June, I was going over Blackfriars-road, a carman asked me to lend him a hand with some cotton, I gave him a lift up in the cart, and they came and took me to Guildford; the thieves run away. I did not undergo a trial there was no ground for the accusation.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the handkerchief; it is exactly the same pattern, they cost me six shillings and threepence a piece.</p>

            . I am an officer of Coleman street ward. On Monday, the 18th of June, soon after five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with a load coming from the back part of Mr. Pollard's premises into Coleman-street, he crossed the street and went into Swan-alley; I followed him, he went into White's-alley. Coffee was four or five yards before me, he stopped him and took the load from him; the prisoner made no resistance; we found it to be cloth, about three quarters of a hundred weight. I asked the prisoner where he was going; he said he was carrying it to a man in Crown-court; I named the names of the men that lived in each house; he said, to Elliott. We took him to the Dolphin public house; I asked him if Mr. Pollard was up; he said, no. From his coming out of that part I supposed Mr. Pollard was his master; he did not deny it. I left the property at the Dolphin and went back to the house, and took the prisoner with me, and found the house left open; I let him go up stairs and I followed; I thought myself not safe, having no stick; I returned to the front door, I called him and he came down; when he came down his fellow servant came with him; the prisoner said, my fellow servant is innocent, I am guilty.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Coleman-street ward. On the morning of the 18th of June I saw the prisoner come out of Whitehorse-yard, Coleman-street, I followed him up Swan-alley; I laid hold of him in Printing-house-yard, I caught hold of the bundle, pulled it off his shoulder, and asked him if he had any bill of parcels; he said not. Mr. Wadman came up and took charge of him. He said he was going with it to Mr. Elliot's in Crown-court. Mr. Elliott, when he heard of this business, left his house two or three days.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 23d of June, a quarter before nine in the evening, I was coming home, this little girl came crying to me, and said some person had taken the tea chest off the mantle piece; I came back with the little girl, I saw the prisoner going towards the house again; I went up to him and asked him what he had done with the property, the little girl said he had got it in his bat; accordingly he pulled off his hat and gave it into my hands; I asked him how he came to do such a thing; he told me it was through distress; he begged me to let him go. I took him to Queen-square office.</p>

My mother went out and left me and my younger sister in the house; the prisoner knocked at the door and came in, he asked me if Mrs. Mackenzie was at home; I told him no, he said he brought a bill from Mr. Smith, the linen-draper, for Mrs. Mackenzie; then he went into the parlour and asked me if I could mind the bill; I told him I would mind it very carefully. He put the bill on the mantle piece, in the mean while he took the caddie and and put it in his hat. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . Q. I believe you live with your father, who is a coach-maker in Long Acre - A. I do. On the night of the 14th of June I was returning from my friend's house by Chalk-farm, about half after eleven at night; it was a very fine night, the moon shone very bright. As I came down the <placeName id="t18100718-26-crimeloc154">Hampstead road</placeName>

This was on Thursday. On the Monday I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; I saw the three dollars and the shilling; the shilling was marked; I am almost confident that was the shilling that I had in my pocket before he robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did he go after he had robbed you - A. I was coming from Hampstead, he went over the field on my left hand; that is the right hand going up to Hampstead.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look at your pockets - A. Not at that moment; it was half after five when I missed the pocket. There were two pockets upon one string; the string was cut, and one of the pockets was entirely gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in that pocket that was gone - A. There were thirty-six pounds; three ten-pound notes and four one-pound notes, in a red pocket book; the leather purse was in a canvas purse, in that canvas purse there were four crown pieces, two half crowns, and the rest in small change to the amount of two pounds two shillings in silver; and a good many things in the pocket that I cannot give an account of.</p>

It was prize money; my husband has been to sea a great many years.</p>

               <p>Q. Then on the Sunday he continued travelling up with you the same road - A. No; we were not together on the road; he came the same night to the house at Kensington and asked for a lodging; it was granted.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again after you missed your money - A. I never saw the prisoner from the morning that I missed my money until I catched him in the Borough last Friday week; I saw him at the door of the house where he was quartered at; he was standing picking his teeth; he turned into the house and shut the door after him, he jumped over the paling of the yard and went into the next house and went under the stairs; I went into the next house with a constable, and saw him coming out from under the stairs of the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out of the stairs of himself - A. No; the constable bid him come out, and he said he would; I asked the prisoner how he could do such a trick with me; he said why did not I take it a little quieter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched at that time - A. He was searched when he was taken into prison; I did not see it. I had never seen him before I saw him at Uxbridge; I do not know what business he is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect giving your wife any money at the Artichoke at Kensington - A. Yes; it was on Wednesday morning, at the Artichoke; I gave her the forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lodged it in any persons hands before you gave it her - A. Yes, with the landlady of the Artichoke, forty pounds ten shillings; I took it from the landlady and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that money from - A. I received a draft of Messrs. Cook and co. in the Adelphi, they are prize agents; forty-seven pounds four shillings and sixpence, I received it as prize money; the draft was drawn upon Messrs. Downes and co. Bartholomew-lane, and there I received the money. I had come up to town on purpose to receive this money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what notes you received for that draft at Messrs. Downes and co. - A. Yes; three ten pound notes, two five pound notes, seven one pound notes, a half crown piece, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of having changed any of these notes - A. None of the tens, both of the fives I had changed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you first met with the prisoner - A. At Uxbridge; I had never seen him before; he came in of the Sunday night, he went off on the Monday morning before us, he left the house sometime before us; I stopped to have breakfast. He came into Kensington and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at the Artichoke at Kensington that morning when you took the money of the landlady and gave it to your wife - A. Yes; and through his persuasion, and telling me that soldiers and sailors suffered by putting their money in landlord's hands, I took it out; that is the way that I lost it, by taking it out of my friend's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the house where you lodged that night did you all lodge in the same room - A. This man and another slept in another bed in the same room; we went up all to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your wife do any thing with her pockets when she went to bed - A. No; I laid down in the bed and went to sleep. The next morning we were awake near at one time; I saw her look for her pockets, she missed them; I sat up in bed and missed the prisoner; I saw his bundle at the foot of his bed; I thought the man was not gone. He had left his bundle there for a decoy.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when the prisoner was taken in the Borough - A. No; I was in pursuit after him down at Bristol. I received the number of the three ten pound bank notes at Downes and co. The three ten pound notes were to put my children out apprentice with.</p>

            . I am an office of Marlborough-street office. On Monday the 25th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, in company with Craig and Jackson, officers, I went to a house, <placeName id="t18100718-28-crimeloc165">No. 17, Field-lane</placeName>

                        targets="t18100718-28-off163 t18100718-28-crimeloc165"/>, the street-door was open, I made my way up to the one pair of stairs, I went gently up, the others following me to the one pair back room; when I got up I bursted open the back room door; upon my breaking open the door it brought me immediately into the room, almost upon the prisoners, who were sitting facing each other around a round table, on which was a blanket, my sudden intrusion alarmed the prisoners, who screamed; they endeavoured to catch up the blanket, I to prevent it, in consequence of each scrambling at the same object, the table was in part upset, on which I observed a number of these blanks.</p>
               <p>COURT. What do you call blanks - A. They are blank pieces of metal, apparently for sixpences, they are not coloured; they are a metal which has a colouring in it, but not compleat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. When your talk of blanks you mean unfinished pieces, do not you - A. Yes. The table having in part fallen many of the blanks fell about the feet of the prisoners, and about the bottom of the table, which I picked up, most of them, in number, I think, sixty, many of them are bent, and many of them bear the punch mark of the letter P; upon looking round the floor, close to where the prisoners were, I found upon the blanket, and upon the floor this fine sand paper, most of it having been used. On the floor also, close to the prisoners feet, this punch, bearing the letter P, a pair of pincers which Jackson picked up and gave to me, a small bag also upon the floor close to the table, having in it two counterfeit shillings. In some part of the room this pair of scissars, a paper of cream of tartar I found in one of the cupboards, which I gave to Hawkins, with, I think, nineteen pence halfpenny in copper, which I also gave to him; I then searched the pockets of the prisoner Stinson, and found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180018"/>six good shillings, two good sixpences, two counterfeited sixpences, and a counterfeit shilling the shilling bearing the punch-mark of the letter P, tied up in a bit of rag, the good and the bad shilling and sixpence that I have described. On the fire side, there being a fire in the grate, I found one blank of the small size, bearing the punch-mark of the P, which was red hot. On the mantle shelf of the same room this small ball of blacking. After having secured the prisoners I went again with Craig and Hawkins, and in the same room we found this pocket, which from some liquid appears to have been burnt, bearing some green stained marks, and now very tender; this a blanket also found at the same time, with the pocket, which has in many parts of it, principally in the middle, the stained marks of green. I have the table here which I brought from the same room, it has the same marks of green.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in first did you make any observations on the hands of the prisoners - A. I did, that ther fingers were very dirty, as if they had been at work at some metal.</p>
               <p>Q. It was different from ordinary persons having dirty hands - A. They were discoloured as if they had been using and rubbing of metals; I made an observation to the prisoner Stinson that it was a bad job, her answer was, that they were making button tops.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a curtain in the room - A. There was, which was down when we went into the room, it was a dirty red check curtain; when we went into the room we put it up. The back premises were so situated, I think, that it was impossible to see into the room with the curtain quite down. I have a vial, but what it contained I do not know.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I went to this house with the other officers, I entered the room with Hamilton; I picked up some sixpences that dropped from Stinson, they are three blanks, they are bent and in an unfinished state; two of the sixpence are marked with the letter P. I tried the punches to one of the sixpences, it fitted exactly to the letter; I picked up the punch and gave it to Hamilton. I secured Stinson while they were searching the room, and while I had hold of her hands she said they were making button tops. The room was searched over and over again, no button tops were to be found. This is the punch.</p>

I secured Jones, she said she was making button tops, I found no shank nor wire; I found these rags, some about the room, and others in the cupboard, they are dirty greasy rags, as if they had been used in some process and stained green; here is very near a dozen rags. I found that tin, it appears to have been very much burnt, and there is some blacking upon it.</p>

I found these metal scrapings, they were done with a chisel, and here are some more that are done with another kind of tool, neither of them are filings; on the prisoner Jones I found this cake of soap and some halfpence; in the cupboard in the room I found these papers of powder, there are three papers of powder; one powder she said was sugar of lead; one paper is cream of tartar; I found a small brush, an old file, and a quantity of sand paper; here are three pieces of sand paper, they have been used considerably, and under the table, near the fire place, I found three sixpences not finished; they are blanks.

            . I am by trade a button-maker - a button-chaser.</p>


               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, I know them perfectly well. On the 25th of June I unfortunately went to their house, that was the first time, I went there about eleven o'clock in the morning; the first time I went there was the 3rd of June.</p>
               <p>COURT. I thought you said the 25th of June - A. The first time was the 3rd of June, then I went to the front room, one pair of stairs, to a young woman that I was acquainted with, she lived in the front room; Stinson came into that room to me, and this young woman that I was with expressed her surprise of her coming into the company of a stranger. At that time the prisoner Stinson had a bag in her hand, and she was rubbing in this way. I am come here to speak the truth, and you may depend upon it I will.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do not chatter so - A. Then afterwards she pulled some sixpences out of the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had she done any thing before that - A. Yes; I saw her file some of the sixpences at the edges, then afterwards we had a little conversation; she asked me whether I wished to have any of them; I had three of her sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she had filed the edges and put them into the bag, where did she take them from - A. I cannot tell; after she had filed them she put them into a bag and rubbed them, before she put them in the bag they appeared brassy, and afterwards, when they came out, they were quite while. I went several times afterwards to see my friend, and I saw Stinson most times, I saw them both, they were making sixpences; once I saw them cutting out the oval sixpences with scissars, she had a flat iron without a handle, she struck a punch marked with the letter P, upon the sixpences with a pair of pincers; they were such pincers as them are; then she bent both ends with a pair of pliers; that was Stinson; Jones was rubbing some of the blanks with sand paper upon the table, with a cloth upon it, that was to get the rough marks out of the blanks, then they put them in a leather bag, and rubbed them with the bag and brought them out quite white.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was in the bag - A. Some kind of white dust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know aquifortis - A. I saw some there at the same time, but I did not see it used.</p>
               <p>Q. What is aquafortis to do to them - A. To prepare them. I know what it does to buttons; when we solder them it takes out the rough marks, and prepares them for silvering or gilding, it clears them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you were there - A. I think on the 24th of June; it was Sunday, and I had a shilling, which I took to Mr. Sewell, who is an assistant to Mr. Powell; I gave it to him, I purchased it of the prisoner, I was to give fourpence for it, I did not; I gave that shilling to Mr. Sewell; I told Mr. Powell what I had seen. The last time I went to the house Stinson told me that they should be ready in about an hour, what I went for, some shillings and sixpences, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180019"/>was to have three or four dozen, she was going to get some blanks; Stinson went out and Jones stopped at home, and when I came back Jones told me to wait, she would not be long; I stopped, Stinson came back soon after; when she came back they both set to work at the table in another room; Jones began first to rub the blanks with sand paper, the blanks were ready cut out; at that time Stinson was striking the punch on a coblers last; she then bent them with a pair of pliers, and after they were bent I left the room and went to tell Mr. Powell what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some aquafortis in the room, where was that - A. It was standing in the lid of a window with a feather in it. Stinson told me they were very good things, she and Jones had done three or four dozen in the morning, and they had both been out, they had got a great sale for them; as many as they could do they could part with them.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you had seen did you communicate every thing to Mr. Powell - A. I did. I have told the truth and no more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever learn what powder it was - A. No; it was white. Before they were put in the bag the edges looked brassy, and when they came out of the bag the edges looked white.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what cream of tartar is - A. Yes, I know it perfectly well; this is the cream of tartar; they use cream of tartar and tin shavings to hardware buttons; I do not know what that other paper is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a button maker - A. I am a button chaser.</p>
               <p>Q. You unlucky enough got acquainted with the prisoner on the 3d of June, I think that was your expression - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was owing to your going to a girl that lodged in the same house - A. Yes; I got acquainted with these two by knowing the girl in the front room, she was a very slight acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you carry on the trade of button chasing - A. When I am at home at Birmingham; there is very little button chasing in London.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you were a housekeeper at Birmingham - A. My father is.</p>
               <p>Q. Your grandfather may - When did you carry on the button chasing at Birmingham - A. Three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been doing in London for three years past - A. I have worked in two places and can have a good character from them.</p>
               <p>Q I am sure you are a man of good character because you are doing good service to the public - when was it you came to London the last time to settle here - A. It is now twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten months I suppose you worked at button making in London - A. No, I have not; I worked at Allen's and Butler's in Nevills-court, they carry on the spectacle trade; a person that comes to London must change his hand; I worked with them five months.</p>
               <p>Q How have you got your livehood the last five months - A. I have got very good friends; my father is very well to do, he has sent me up money, and I have received money from my friends.</p>
               <p>Q Have you ever travelled the country much - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. justice Grose - A. I know him very well, I have seen him at the bench, but I was never before him.</p>

               <p>Q. You have charged the two prisoners with money making on the 25th of June - you were taken up about a month ago, that was some time before the 25th of June - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you did not think it was a convenient thing by serving the mint in this prosecution and saving yourself - A. A man has always an opportunity to gain his character in this country.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been taken up after that for uttering a bad seven shilling piece - Do not you expect to be absolved from your sin by accusing them - A. I think repentance is never too late.</p>

            . Q. I believe you have assisted the solicitor of the mint for a great many years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q You are perfectly well acquainted with the apparatus, and things necessary to be used in coming - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these sixpences, look at them - these are the sixpence found by Hamilton dropping from the women, and tell me what is the appearance of these sixpences - A. They appear to be finished ready for circulation; they are now a little rough, they are a little different from what they were the day when I first saw them, they were quite fresh, new coloured, I should suppose first of all they were cut out of the plate with a pair of scissars; there is another sixpence exactly of the same appearance cut out of the plate with the scissars, and that is complete for circulation, it would deceive now, at the time when I first saw it it was new coloured. These are the blanks. Here is a file which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180020"/>would be useful in filing the edge, after it has been cut out of the plate in order to give it a smooth and circular form; here is a sand paper for rubbing the surface to prepare it for colouring; it is a particular sand paper that is applicable for this purpose particularly, so a great deal of it appears to have been used in the rubbing of metal: the blanks, after having been so prepared would be coloured with aquafortis and cream of tartar only.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not the effect of aquafortis bring the silver there was to the surface - A Certainly; I am satisfied of that particular circumstance by taking one of the blanks which were unfinished which I coloured with aquafortis and cream of tartar only; that is the one that I coloured. The colour of silver would be produced by aquafortis, it would be then black and be put into water, and the cream of tartar would take the black off, and produce the whiteness. Here is a number of blanks, of the size of sixpences in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. What would the act of shaking them in the bag do to them - A. The powder in the bag I believe to be nothing but chalk, which would be a quick way of drying them by shaking them in the bag instead of drying them with chalk. The blacking would be the last thing to take off the new appearance of silver, so as to deceive and make them appear as if they had been in circulation. I have looked at the rags, the blanket, and the table, produced by the officers, they appear very much stained in a way which would be the case if aquafortis had been used; I have no doubt that these stains came from aquafortis being used with metal. One of these papers that have been produced is cream of tartar, which has been spoken to. Here is a paper which I believe to be fine chalk. There is a tin pan, I have seen such kind of things frequently before, I have known them to be used in putting the blanks in to heat them over the fire; it makes them take the aquafortis sooner, it makes them take the colour better and easier, and the colour would be much better in the metal, and wear longer; it appears very black, as if it had been over the fire. I have compared the marks upon the blanks before, and I found the mark of the punch to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these two sixpences, are they counterfeit - A. They are counterfeit. A number of people make use of punches in good money, and a number of people will not take them without it, and the bending of the edges make them appear more like an old sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I do not see that any aquafortis has been produced to day - A. No liquid aquafortis has been produced to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think that aquafortis is necessary in making counterfeit money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard a witness swear that he found a pen in aquafortis in the bottle, would not the aquafortis burn it up - A. Yes, it would by being constanty in the bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there that you suppose to have been cut with a pair of scissars - A. I confine myself to two in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. I see here are thirty or forty that appear to have been cut with a punch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Morris - A. Since January.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, from what you know of him, do you not believe he is as big a rogue as is unhanged - A I know nothing of his character but what come within my own observations; I certainly believe him to be a man of bad character.</p>

From information, on the 4th of July, about twenty minutes past five in the morning, I concealed myself in my neighbour's back kitchen, so that I had a view of my back premises; I saw the prisoner Robinson come into Mr. Couchman's yard and go into mine, the prisoner Salmon opened the back door and let him in. Robinson then followed Salmon into the kitchen, they were in about three minutes, and then Robinson came out with part of a sack of flour upon his back; I let him come off my premises and then I stopped him; he said it was the first time that ever he did it. I apprehended Robinson upon Mr. Couchman's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see what was in the sack at the time - A. I did, there is about ninety pounds odd. I had seen the sack in the bakehouse about an hour before Robinson came. I dare say it is worth two pounds and upwards. I apprehended Salmon in my parlor where he had no business to be.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same description of logwood as you had on board the Abingdon - A. It was, the Abingdon had about eighteen hundred weight of logwood. On the same day I caused Quelch to be taken up, and Brown in two or three days afterwards. From the appearance of that logwood in the lug-boat and the cargo, I belive it to be my logwood.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Tuesday the 26th of June, at four o'clock in the morning, I was going down Limehouse-reach in a boat. I saw a lug-boat with a tarpaulin over it. I was coming up the river at the time. M'Bride was rowing the boat up, and the tide was running up. I went along-side of the boat and boarded her; I found the boat to contain logwood. I took M'Bride and the logwood into my custody, and brought M'Bride to the Thames Police. The logwood and tarpaulin were shewn to Mr. Thompson the next day. The tarpaulin is marked TS upon the corner, and Thompson across it. I weighed the logwood myself, thirty-one pieces, eighteen hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You met M'Bride on Tuesday morning was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The tide was running of the Surry side, was it not - A. At that time the Channel run of the Surry side, but he was of the Middlesex side.</p>

            . Q. I believe you were a watchman in the employ of Mr. Thompson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of Monday the 25th of June did you go to your master to receive orders - A. I did. Mr. Thompson's servant told me there was no message for me I met Quelch in Seething-lane close by the house. Quelch said, I can put a pound or two in your way if you like, because I know you are poor and got very little work. I said, I would be very willing, provided it was without any danger. He told me that he had been to a man of the name of Cuff, that lived in Thames-street, Bank-side. Cuff told him he had a punt at Stoney-stairs, and we were to put the logwood into it; his boy would take it away the next morning. He told me to go to Cuff to tell him that he sent me to him, to be sure to send the punt up to him the next morning, and if Cuff would not do it I was to go to 
               <persName id="t18100718-30-person327">Brown</persName>
             the prisoner, and tell him Quelch wanted to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Brown before - A. I had seen him before, he lived in a court in Tooley-street. I went to Cuff's house, there was nobody at home; then I went to Brown. I saw Brown that same evening. I told Brown that Quelch wanted to see him. He asked me what it was about, I told him it was some logwood. He said he wanted a job; he came with me to Sabs-passage near the Custom-house, for the purpose of consulting with Quelch at Sabs-passage. Quelch met us the same night; it was dark; I cannot say the time. We all went into a public house and had a pot of beer. Brown said, he must go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180022"/>into Upper Thames-street to get a key of a friend of his to get a lug-boat. When he got me there he left me in the street, and when he came back he told me he could not get the boat he wished to have, but he could get another boat, there was nothing wanted but a tarpaulin. I told him there was a tarpaulin in the Abingdon barge, on board which Quelch was going down. We went on board the lug-boat at Trig-wharf. We went through the bridge; then Brown said he must get a wherry to go on shore. He told me to put the boat into the Custom-house lower road, and that Quelch was waiting for me at the stern vessel of that teer. I took the lug-boat there; I found Quelch there with a barge; Brown came to us in a wherry. There were some people walking on a vessel that was moored there, we did not think proper to do business there. We went to the South side of the river, Brown in a wherry, I in the lug-boat, and Quelch in the barge; we crossed the river and there it would not do; we had fastened the lug-boat to the barge, and Quelch and I were in the barge together, and Brown in the wherry; we found the coast not clear; we did not do it there; we hauled the lug-boat to the side of the barge; we drove down the tide towards Blackwall, putting the logwood into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Brown come on board the barge - A. No, he never was on board the barge, I and Quelch handed the logwood from the barge into the lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did Brown keep to you - A. He was rowing about in case any thing came to alarm us.</p>
               <p>Q. How much logwood did you and Quelch hand out - A. We meaned to take a ton and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. And while this took place you were floating down the river - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you got when you compleated your point - A. Very near to what they call the fifth mill, near Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in your going down where you sometimes on one side and sometimes of the other - A. It is necessary to go sometimes on one side and sometimes of the other to be clear of the teers; we were sometimes of the North side while we were handing out the logwood. When we had taken a ton, Quelch took the tarpaulin out, and covered the logwood over; Quelch told me to make her fast to the first teer that I could get hold of, and stay till flood tide; I made her fast to a teer by the fifth mill, on the North side of the river.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you parted with Quelch where was Brown - A. Brown parted with us a little time before Quelch told me to go to Cuckold's Point, and Brown would meet me there, then I was to go where I pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brown parted with you before the tarpaulin was put over - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him while the logwood was handing out - A. Yes, he was after us, before us, and about us, he knew what we were doing; he was about us on the North side, and on the South side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you had parted and made fast to a vessel, what became of Quelch - A. He proceeded towards Blackwall; I made fast to a vessel at the teer, and when the flood tide came I floated up the river, and between four and five o'clock, I was met with by Mr. Rye, he took me, and the lug-boat, with the logwood, altogether into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. We are to understand from you, that Quelch proposed to you, that you might get a little money by assisting him in robbing your master - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to carry a message to Brown in Surry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that when you crossed over from the Custom-house Brown was in his wherry, and Quelch was in the barge with the lug-boat attached to it. Now, Sir, I ask you, and is not the fact so, that Brown rowed directly across the river, and went away - Did not you at any other time say, that he went away and separated from you altogether when you left the Custom-house - A. No, I said he was sometimes before and sometimes behind.</p>
               <p>Q. You were apprehended by the Thames Police officer on the Tuesday morning, at that time you were in possession of the stolen property - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was apprehended on the Tuesday; when was Brown apprehended. - A. I did not see Brown till I saw him at the Police office. I believe it was on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information about Brown until you saw your master at the prison - A. I did not. I sent to my master before, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of saving yourself that you accused Brown - A. I could not stand such an untruth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You are a watchman employed occasionally by Mr. Thompson - A. Yes, my business is to take care that nothing is lost when I am employed.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brown got this lug-boat then, he wanted nothing but a tarpaulin; upon which you told him there were plenty on board the Abingdon - A. Yes, I knew there were two or three in her. I was at work for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18100718-30-person328">Thompson</persName>

I told him it was necessary that he should go with me to the Thames Police office to give some account of the transaction.</p>

            . Q. Are you the wife of Nathaniel M'Bride - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Tuesday the 26th of last month, did either of the prisoners call at your house - A. Quelch did soon after I was up, a little after eight o'clock. He asked me if my husband was at home. I told him he was not. I asked him if he had any message to leave; he said nothing material; he went away. Soon after nine o'clock Quelch's wife came to tell me that my husband was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday morning after were you with your husband. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing your husband said to you, did you go with the officer and Mr. Thomson to Brown's house - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you while your husband was in custody, gone to Brown's house before that - A. I had, twice, I went the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180023"/>first time, as soon as I heard my husband was in custody, I went to the police office, and I think it was that same day I went to Brown, I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went with Mr. Thompson and the officer on the Monday; did you go first leaving them behind - A. I did. I saw Brown on the Monday, I had never seen him before; his wife told him who I was, he asked me how my husband did; I told him he was very indifferent indeed; he told me to make myself easy, on the next day he would send me a pound or two; nothing more past, I came out, and Mr. Thompson and the officer came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You went over to Brown's house directly after you saw your husband in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The Monday after you went and saw him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a week had elapsed and Brown had not absconded, though he knew your husband was in custody - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know Brown, or Brown's wife, before this - A. I never saw them before in my life, I never saw Brown before the night he was taken, I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Thompson. What number of pieces were there in the Abingdon before she went down - A. I cannot say; there is a person here who shipped them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there marks upon these pieces corresponding with the remainder - A. There were when the wood came from Plymouth, the wood had a ship mark corresponding with the remainder; there was a cross mark upon some of them, not upon the whole, and there was that cross mark found on some of the pieces in the lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Gotty. There were thirty one pieces taken in the lug-boat, about half of them were marked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q to Thompson. What were the directions that you gave to Quelch, about going down with the Abingdon to Blackwall - A. I told him to take the Abingdon barge down to Blackwall at high water; I further told him, I could not tell him exactly, whether the ship lay at the Foley-house or the Orchard; I then told him to leave her at day-light, and bring up another loaded boat from Blackwall; and if he could not find out the ship, to call upon me in the morning, I would give him further orders; he had nothing to do with unloading her. He called upon me in the morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, he told me that he had not found the ship out when he went down, but since, he had heard where the ship laid; I told him, immediately, to go and put her on board the ship where she lay, and he went away.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Mallin, a wharfinger. I took the weight of the logwood, and employed the men that put them on board, there were nine hundred and seventy nine pieces put on the board.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received it on board - A. At the forepart there was nobody in it, towards the latter part the prisoner Quelch came.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, when the whole was actually put on board the lighter, Quelch was on board to receive them - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Quelch's Defence. My master, he mentioned; in regard of the tarpaulin being in the barge, and there was no such thing; more than that, he said he makes a common practice of going over his craft, sometimes he is not on board them a week, and we have been obliged to go and take tarpaulin's from other peoples' craft, to use instead of his own.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. It is false evidence; I am innocent of what I am charged.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the Friday, two days before the fire happened, drawing any draft on your banker's - A. Yes, a draft of an hundred pound on my banker in Pall Mall; I sent the prisoner to the banker's for the purpose of receiving cash for it; he returned with an hundred pound in bank notes, fifty two pound notes; after I had received these notes, I put six pound in my pocket, and put ninety-four pound into my writing-desk; it stood on a table upon another writing-desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What apartment did you occupy there - A. The first door. On Saturday, the 16th of June, about half past eight in the evening, I left my apartment, I did not return home that night; I was informed of the fire the next morning, I went home immediately, I went up into my room, I saw there had been a fire between the boards and the ceiling; and the papers had been on fire near to where the couch stood, it was almost on the other side of the room. My writing-desk, the hinges had been broken open and there was not one note remaining in the desk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know that the prisoner was in the house - A. I do not; I did not come in till half after eleven, I did not see him. A little before four o'clock in the morning, I awoke with smoke about my bed, which got into my throat and awoke me; the smoke came into my room, it is a two pair of stairs room, immediately over Mr. Tufton's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180025"/>room, in the first floor. I immediately touched my daughter, who was in bed with me, and told her there was a great smoke, and went into the front room, and in one corner of the room, where there was a cupboard, I perceived a great deal of smoke, and in the other there was but little; I ran immediately down stairs to the first floor, front room, and opened it, a torrent of smoke rushed out but no flame whatever. I turned round to go up stairs to get something to cover me, and to see my child was safe, I saw the prisoner behind me, he was about three or four stairs behind me when I looked round; I went up to put my clothes on, I found my daughter upon the top of the stairs coming down, my daughter passed me; I went into my room to put my petticoat on, and ran out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say how he was dressed at the time you saw him on the stairs - A. I think he was in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day following you had some reason for searching of different places to find the notes - A. I searched the things all round the kitchen, after the prisoner was taken up, and at night, Mr. Roton, a neighbour, found a tin canaster in the chimney piece, in a nook on the left hand side, that canaster contained some notes, and the notes were counted on the kitchen table; I think there were ninety-two pound, they were all two pound notes, I saw them counted.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you went to bed - A. Yes, in the kitchen, sitting by the fire with the maid-servant. When my mother awoke me she told me she smelled a smoke, I got up immediately, I dressed myself and went down to Mr. Tufton's room door, I saw the prisoner there, he was in his shirt, he opened his master's bed room door, and then the drawing room door; he said, here it is; he turned round and went up stairs, he left both the doors open, I said, gracious God why do you leave them open; the smoke came so strong that nobody could come down stairs; I shut both the doors and went into the street immediately, and gave the alarm at the Dutchess of Rutland, and asked for the assistance of the porter who slept in the hall. On Sunday, after the prisoner was taken up, I found a two pound note amongst some rubbish and papers in the back kitchen.</p>

On this night I went to bed at half past twelve o'clock, I heard two o'clock strike, and three o'clock strike; about three o'clock I heard a noise on the stairs, as if somebody had been coming up stairs; the next thing I heard was Mrs. Thompson's servant, saying, Lord have mercy upon us, that was a little before four o'clock; she then called out my name and called out fire. I heard Mrs. Thompson say, the fire is in the drawing room, pray shut the door; and the first thing I saw when I got out of my door, was the prisoner coming up stairs; I returned to my room, which by that time was full of smoke, I put on my pantaloons and coat and went out as fast as I could, with a bundle that came from my washerwoman, and went through the prisoner's room, and the first thing I saw was the prisoner sitting on the leads; I went across the leads to the other house, and went down that house into the street; I saw some loose men's apparel laying on the leads.</p>

            . Q. You were a servant in this house of Mrs. Thompson's, at the time of the fire - A. Yes. On the evening before the fire, the prisoner came home earlier than usual, I cannot tell what time it was. He went into Mr. Tufton's apartment, and from there came into the kitchen; I said, you have been a good while in your master's apartment; he said, he had been reading Mrs. Clarke's book. The prisoner went to bed before me; I went to bed about half past twelve, and nigh four o'clock, my mistress alarmed me, I put on some of my things and cried fire. I ran down into the kitchen and drawed water as fast as I was able.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the morning after the fire happened, seeing the prisoner in the back kitchen - A. Yes, sitting in a chair in the back kitchen by the screen, the screen was before the fire place, that was not a place he used to sit in, he used to be in the front kitchen. I was in the kitchen when Miss Thompson picked up a two pound note, I saw it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you went up stairs to bed, do not you know that the prisoner was in bed - A. Yes; I had some conversation with him, I saw no light; I sleep on the same floor with him; I did not see any candle in his room.</p>

            . Q. You are a fireman at the Sun fire office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night you was stopped going to another place, on the morning about four o'clock, you came immediately to Mrs. Thompson's house - A. Yes, the engine stopped by the door; I ran in doors and went up the first flight of stairs and opened the drawing room door, the smoke came out very thick; expecting that the fire was in that room, I shut the door and went down stairs again; I saw Dr. Brown moving some of his things out of the front parlour, I desired him not to move any more, but to supply me with water, I could stop the fire, I thought. At that time Butler brought me up water, I opened the door and saw a fire to the right, I have three or four buckets of water upon it; Butler, one of our people, crawled upon his hands and knees forward from the door, and by that felt another fire on the floor; he told me of it, I desired him to come back, and threw three or four buckets of water on it; I then felt with my hand to the left side of the room, and felt a frame of a picture, I passed it by to the door, and I think Mrs. Thompson took it of me, she said it was a valuable picture, she was very happy to think it was saved; I put my hand as far as I could with any safety, and felt a table, I took the table by the leg, I had no opportunity of knowing whether there was any thing upon it or no; I passed, the table along; I then took the corner of the carpet and found there was something that stopped it, whether it was stuck down, I cannot say, we could not get it away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180026"/>easy; I then desired Butler again to open the window to get the smoke out of the room; he opened the two upper shutters of one of the windows, he was obliged to retreat; I went and got the lower one's open, and throwed my head out of the window to get some air, the room was full of smoke, I went to the other window and did the like; in a little time the room was cleared of the smoke, and having the light we could see, and with the axe we ripped up the floor to see the extent of the fire; we thought it safe, we got to the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the part where your companion complained of heat - A. Yes, of that side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had the boards up, could you distinguish whether any fuel of any sort had been placed under the boards - A. No, but the fire appeared to me to have been underneath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you see the prisoner at this time - A. When I was in the act of ripping the boards up, the prisoner stood to my right, he had got a writing desk in his hand; he asked me whether I thought it was the effect of the fire that had damaged the desk, he opened it, and said the hinges were broke; there are two catches to the lock, I saw one of them were broke; I asked him where it stood, he said on the table; I said, it might fall when I moved the table, and might sever the hinges by falling on one corner, that is all that past between him and me. I cannot recollect I heard any thing fall when I moved the table, I did not see it before I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the desk, does there appear on that desk any damage occasioned by fire - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner, or any body else, an opportunity of going into the room after you were there, and bringing any thing out of the room, between your going in and opening the drawing room door - A. There was no opportunity, before the windows were opened nobody could get into the room, they could not have lived there. I saw the prisoner in the room with the box, while I was in the act of ripping the floor up, about four or five minutes after the window had been opened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuston. That is my box that I locked my bank notes in.</p>

            . When first I went into this room, I saw the papers on the sopha on fire, I turned the books and papers over; I turned round and saw the prisoner; I said, do not stand there, come and help me, move these books away, that was after the windows were opened.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOW BROWN. Q. You went there the next morning, I believe. There is the plan, you look at it - A. This plan was made under my direction, by the surveyor of the Westminster fire office; I went in the room about ten o'clock the Sunday morning of the fire; when I went into the room the boards had been taken up, as in this plan; I saw the girders were exposed and burnt on each side of them; the boards of the floor were laying loose about the room, just as they had been taken up by the firemen; I directed the men to replace them in the same situation as they were before, which was very easily done; which being done, I was enabled to judge in what manner the fire has been put to that part of the flooring; the upper part of the flooring boards were not burnt, and in one of the boards an aperture had been made, and the under part of the boards were burnt to charcoal in some parts nearly through.</p>
               <p>Court. How large was the aperture - A. About three inches by four; the hole had not been originally so large, but the fire having burned through had made it so large; the joints of the boards were also burnt, but no part of the upper surface, I made the men, and I examined myself under the boards, but as a great deal of charcoal had fell from the upper boards, it was impossible to see whether combustible matter had been put in or not. That part of the girder where most of the fire had been, and that was near the aperture, was almost burnt through. Finding that the carpet had been over this floor, I directed the men to spread that carpet out, and I found an aperture in the carpet, and also the carpet burnt in those parts that were over the cracks, and in no other parts except corresponding to the hole. I supposed that it was probable these girders might run into the chimney of the next house, that fire might communicate; I went into the next house and found no stack of chimneys of that side, and therefore it was impossible for the fire to communicate from that house; from all the circumstances that I have mentioned, it did then appear to me that the fire was caused by something having been put in this aperture. I then cast my eyes on the other side of the room, and saw a sopha standing up in the corner, one half of which that is the furthest from the fire, was burnt, the back of the sopha was burnt out and part of the bottom, the most distant part nearest the wall; but that part of the sopha near the fire in the floor was not burnt; the distance from the other fire, to that part of the sopha that was on fire, was twelve feet. There was a table stood between the fire in the floor and the sopha, with two candles upon it, and them candles not melted, so that no fire could have gone across the room; from all these circumstances, it appeared to have been set on fire in two parts; and recently before the men went into the room, because they found the papers on fire when they went into the room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. As they told you - A. I am going further than I know of my own knowledge. I did observe some peculiarities of the prisoner, he seemed to attend to every thing that was said.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Sunday I went to Mrs. Thompson's house. Mr. Tuston had the prisoner called into his parlour. I asked him what time he came home the night before. I am not quite correct to the time; he came home, he said, a long time before the fire, and went to bed: then, I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180027"/>it seems there is no doubt but somebody belonging to the house set fire to the house; can you account for it in any way. He said no, he could not, he supposed I suspected him. I said, we suspected every body, until it was traced to its proper soure, and desired to see his box. He said he would be d - nd if he had done it. I searched his box; he ready let me look at it. One was locked up; I could not then see it. I sealed it up. The other one he opened himself; in that was this glove, containing some stone brinstone. I searched the back kitchen, and then I took him to the office. After I had taken him to the office, we had a fresh search in the back kitchen. I found nothing there. In the front kitchen I found another piece of brinstone in a drawer, that I understood was his drawer Mr. Tufton shewed me the writing desk, I thought it had been broken open by a chisel. I asked if any chisel was lying about the house. Mrs. Thompson brought me this chisel. I applied it to the impression made upon this desk; it is exactly the size of the impression; it his the appearance of two impressions on it. I found some linen of Mr. Tufton's in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Thompson. The officer has produced a chisel, is that the chisel you gave him - A. Yes, I found it in the basket where such things usually are kept, in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Brown. You was stating the search you made to be to ascertain the cause of this fire. Had any brimstone been made use of to cause that fire - A. No, I am certain of that, there was no appearance of sulphur, brimstone always leaves a smell a long while.</p>
               <p>MR. ROTON. I live at No. 5, Sackville-street. I happened to go into Mrs. Thompson's house on the Sunday evening. After searching about the house and finding nothing, I looked up the front kitchen chimney; on the left I saw a hole; I saw this canister: the maid put her hand up and took it down, very much terrified indeed. I immediately went up stairs with it and counted the notes, they were two-pound notes to the amount of ninety-two pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, the first alarm that I heard was, the maid was making a noise in the room. I got up, and saw the maid dressing herself. I asked her what was the matter: she said there was a fire in the house. I ran down with my shirt and night-cap on. I went to the drawing-room and opened the door; the smoke came out so strong it nearly stifled me. I went down to the street door to see if it was open, and then I ran up into my own room, and took all my clothes and trunks and put them upon the leads. I let them down by a cord that belonged to my wife's trunk, and it stuck by the way on the railing. I put my clothes and trunks on the leads for safety. After I had done that, I ran down and assisted in extinguishing the fire. The first thing I saw was the fireman on his hands and knees. He drawed out the table and a picture of my master's. I heard the fireman call out, that there was no occasion to take the things out, he wanted water. I assisted in carrying up water as much as any body else did. I went into the room. The first thing I saw was this desk broken open. I asked the fireman if he could give any account of the desk being broken open, he could not. Mrs. Thompson was in the room at the same time that I was there. She said, why did not I take care of this desk, as the property was in it. I stationed myself in the room, to see that nobody took any thing out; I thought it was the properest place. When my master returned, he saw the desk was broken open and questioned me about it, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I live upon my fortune. I keep the house that Mr. Shaw lives in. I saw the prisoner come out of the cellar with more bottles in the basket than six; he put the basket on his shoulder, I followed him. After he had taken the wine from the cellar, he should have returned the key. He had about fifty yards to go before he turned up the Old Change. When I turned up the corner of the Old Change I missed him all at once. I was sure that he had gone into some house, or had stopped somewhere; he could not have got out of my sight without turning into some house. I then went to Mr. Shaw to see if he had been home with the key. I found that he had not. I left the house, and looked about the neighbourhood of Doctor's Commons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180028"/>to see if I could find him. I returned back again, and found he had left the keys. I knew previous that he was to take six bottles of wine to Tavistock-street. I went to the house in Tavistock-street, and found that he had not been there. In a few minutes I saw the prisoner with a little boy; he was facing the house; he turned up Tavistock-court; he had two baskets with him. I saw him put one basket down containing six bottles of wine, which is the subject of this enquiry, and he seemed to give the charge of the basket to a little boy. He then went to Tavistock-street to the house that had ordered the six bottles of wine, with six bottles, and left them there. I crossed over into the court, and took the little boy with the basket of six bottles into the public-house. I told the landlord of the house to take care of the boy and the basket. I went to Bow-street and got an officer. We secured the prisoner facing of the court, took him, the wine, and the boy to Bow-street. We afterwards searched his lodgings, No. 3, Stansbury-court, Piccadilly; the lace was found there by the officer and Mr. Shaw.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes, perfectly well; I lived with Harding, I seperated from him a twelvemonth ago last April, On last Monday was three weeks, between twelve and one at night, I went into Mr. Wakefield's public-house to get change of a one pound note, I had something to drink there, the two prisoners were there. When I saw them I did not ask for change, I put the note in my bosom and paid for the liquor; I came out of the house and as I went up <placeName id="t18100718-39-crimeloc235">Greek-street</placeName>

I directly went home to my father No. 5, Tottenham-place. I am an unfortunate girl, I did not give any alarm there were nobody in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 25th of June, have not you seen Harding from that time till he was taken up - A. Yes, I saw him the week before last, I met him by Short's-gardens. We went into a house and drank together.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Pelter gun-brig, coming into Dartmouth about that time - A. Yes; I know I did the iron work of the Pelter gun-brig to a lee-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by Mr. Tanner to do any iron work for him to a lee-board - A. Yes, on September 17th, 1795. I have my book here.</p>
               <p>Q. What work was that - A. It was iron work to a lee-board - new bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a new lee-board or an old lee-board - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of that work - A. Four pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that work done to one lee-board, or work done to two - A. I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the work that was done - A. Certainly; I worked the greatest part of it with my own hand; I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to certify that it was work done to one lee-board, or two lee-boards - A. That I cannot say; I never saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether you did any of the work yourself - A. I can say I was never out of the shop, and I rather think the work must past under my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the lee-board have been in your shop - A. No; the lee-board was not in my shop; the iron work was done in my shop and took to the lee-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that four pound six shillings been paid to you - A. I cannot say: in a running account among other things I rather think so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any recollection how it was paid you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jarvis. Have you any other charge against Mr. Tanner for work that was done at that time to a leeboard - A. No, no other charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any demand against him for work done to a lee-board, done at that time, to a larger sum than you have stated - A. No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the work that you did at that time for him - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know what vessel that work belonged to - A. I heard him say the Pelter gun-brig. I do not know that I saw the Pelter gun-brig in the harbour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your entry - A. Mr. Tanner, for the Pelter gun-boat, September 17th, 1795 four pounds six shillings; that was made by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any communication with captain Tomlinson - lieutenant Tomlinson - A. No, I never knew him; I had no communication with him upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the lee-board after it became repaired - A No; I know not what became of it. There was some old iron work repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you receive that from - A. Mr. Tanner's shipwrights, but to say which of them I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that bill and receipt - Is that bill of your hand writing - A. No; I never put my hand to that paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any demands against Mr. Tanner for the repair of this lee-board to the amount of the articles contained in that bill - A. No, I never had no more than four pounds six shillings; that is all the demand I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt of your hand writing - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it like it - A. It is something like it; it is not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the body of the receipt your hand-writing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose it is - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the signature of that receipt your hand-writing - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Mr. Tanner to commit a fraud by means of a false voucher - A. No.</p>

I told him I took him on a charge of forgery on the customs; I took this paper out of his pocket; two hundred hides at four shillings each, forty-pound, the total amount of two thousand and fifty-one, four hundred and twenty-one pounds two shillings and seven pence. Five hundred and fifteen pound five shillings and sixpence is the calculation of the duty.</p>

            . I am a cowkeeper, Helmet-row, St. Lukes. On the 15th of June, I was in Goswell-street between eight and nine in the evening, I saw the two carts and a waggon, they were driving furiously along all the three teams were, before they were stopped; I saw them stop, and I saw the prisoner, who drove the hindmost cart, he turned his horses round the back of the cart and set off again, he passed the others, and sat off at the rate of eight or nine mile an hour, the horses continued going at that rate until they were stopped by Old-street; I was behind, I observed the boy in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the person who drove - A. I cannot say particularly it was the prisoner, I ran to pick up the boys I saw the driver, I cannot say it was the prisoner, I found the boy very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish any thing that happened in the course of driving, whether the driver; whoever he was, had the command of his horses - A. I really believe he had, as he turned from behind the other carts he was of the near side, in passing there was a coach drawed up on the other side, and had he not had the command of his horses, he must have smashed the coach all to pieces, but he then held his horses toward and cleared it. I never saw the boy before nor since; the driver was stopped at the corner of Old-street.</p>

               <p>MR. PRIDDEN. I am a student in St. Bartholomew's hospital. In about a quarter of an hour after the boy was brought in, I was sent for, for upon the examination at the time, a fracture of the right thigh was discovered, and there was considerable injury done to the lower part of the body, he was not sensible; he was brought in on Friday, the 15th of June, and lived till Monday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body opened after his death - A. It was; the thigh was fractured, but the greatest injury was at the lower part of the body; the pelvis; the bones forming it were fractured, and the natural connection with the spine was separated, was destroyed, with a great degree of inflamation and extraversation of urine, were sufficient to account for the death of the child; I have no doubt it was the cause of his death.</p>

On the morning of the 18th, about five o'clock, I went to my stable and perceived the mare gone; I went into my field and traced the mare's feet, and a man's feet on the ground; the snow lay on the ground, I traced it from the dung in my yard by the stable, into the field; there is an adjoining field, they put dung in the ditch and got the mare into the next field; I traced the mare's feet perfectly across the next two fields into the open road, and there I could not trace her no further for the tracks of the carts.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you see your mare again - A. On the 3d of February, the Saturday fortnight after; I saw her in Goswell-street, in Mr. Cumberland's cart; I knew her directly.</p>

A brown mare, with a star in her forehead, she was aged, I gave sixteen guineas for her; I worked her very hard and got her poor, she was worth ten pound; after I lost her they used her very ill, she never did me an hours work, they drove a nail in her foot, the foot came off, she mortified, that day month I carried her away dead.</p>

            . I live at Ealand, in Walthamstow; I am in the jobbing way, with two or three horses in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man at the bar - A. I know that he sold me the mare, I did not know him before. On the 18th of January, about twelve o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner, he was coming along the Ealand road, where I was at work at a dung cart, he had this known mare, nobody was in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same brown mare that was claimed by Baker afterwards - A. The very same. I asked him whether he would sell the horse; he kept going on, and after he had got a little way he called me to him; I went to him, he said he would sell the horse for four pound, or four pound ten shillings; it was very poor in flesh, I told him I would give him two pounds for it; we tried her in my cart with a load of dung into the field; the mare had only a halter on her, and no saddle; I asked where he had her from, he told me he lived at Walthamstow, below Mr. Juff's, the blacksmith, that is in Marsh-street; he said she had been in the country to a straw yard. After I tried her, the prisoner agreed that she was lame, I told him she was broken winded, she appeared rather lame but not in that foot he told me; I told him it was a bad time to sell horses; I dare say she was seventeen or eighteen years old. I agreed at last to give a guinea and a half for it; we were together about half an hour. I am quite certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 18th of January, did you ever see him between that time and the time that the mare was claimed in your cart by Baker - A. No; I was with the cart when the mare was claimed by Baker. I took the prisoner up myself, it is not three weeks ago; I went to Southgate, the prisoner lived there, I told the constable, as soon as I saw him, that was the man, and gave charge of him. I told the prisoner I took him for selling me a mare that they suspected was stolen; he said, he knew nothing about it, he was not the man; I told him he was certainly the man, and it was no other man, he continued to deny it. At the time that I bought the mare of him at Ealand,

            , on the 18th of January, at Ealand, Walthamstow; I did not observe at that time that it was a mare, after it was in Cumberland's possession, I observed it was a mare; I saw him sell the mare to John Cumberland.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he first came up to Cumberland - A. Yes; and afterwards they went a little distance; I heard a great many words that passed between them, I cannot say I did all. I was in the hold when they drawed the dung with the mare in the field. I heard them at last agree for a guinea and a half; he gave him the guinea first in the field, and the half a guinea in the road. I am sure he is the same man, I was with him more than a quarter of an hour. It was a brown mare, with a star in her forehead.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received did you cause him to be taken into custody - A. We did, on the 28th of June. I was present when his boxes were searched in our house, he was an in door servant. In his boxes there were found two pair of trowsers, two pair of drawers, and three waistcoats; in a cupboard not locked by his bedside, in a hat box, were found thirty shillings in penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house keep any quantity of penny pieces for the purpose of paying your work people - A. On account of the scarcity of specie, we have lately paid them in copper; we have from ten to thirty pound at all times in the house in a box, that box was locked and deposited in a warehouse, that he and the other servants had access to; that warehouse was in the lower part of our premises, where we generally take in the work; and I can verily say that the prisoner was not paid in copper.</p>

            . On Monday evening between eight and nine o'clock, I was going down Fleet-street. I saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner, he charged the prisoner with picking his pocket, I saw him pull the handkerchief out of his waistcoat and chuck it down, I immediately picked it up and gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. WORRALL. I am a beadle, the handkerchief was delivered to me, I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is worth three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Shoe-lane, this gentleman came up to me, and said, you have got my silk handkerchief; I said, I have no silk handkerchief of yours; up came a man, who before the alderman, said he lived at No. 2, Shoe-lane; he saw me throw it down. I heard a woman say, here is a handkerchief; I never saw the handkerchief before I saw it before the alderman. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 20th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went into the King's Head public-house, in Threadneedle-street, I saw the prisoner offering a shirt for sale in the tap-room to a customer for five shillings. He had two bundles with him at that time, one was open, and the other tied up. I suspected him. I asked him how he came by that shirt; he said, his captain gave it him. I asked him who his captain was, and what ship, to which I had no answer. I looked over the two bundles, they contained all the articles claimed by Mr. Kelly, and bearing his mark. I searched the prisoner, on him I found the laundress's hooks, with all the articles set down, signed at the bottom

I asked him to walk in. I told him, my master was not within, I would go up stairs and let my mistress know; he walked in, and shut the door after him. I went up two pair of stairs and looked down the bannisters; I saw him take down the great coat and the two hats, and go out of the door with it. I jumped off the bannisters one pair of stairs, and ran down the other, and got sight of him just as he went out of the door. I catched him about three hundred yards from my master's door, on the other side of the way: I never lost sight of him. When I laid hold of him he had got the great coat and the hats in his hand; he dropped them after I caught him, and Mr. Meriton picked them up.</p>

I shewed them some; I think they bought two; they were in about a quarter of an hour. On the part where I shewed these pocket handkerchiefs there was about a dozen or fourteen pieces of cotton bed furniture: I shewed them the handkerchiefs upon the cotton bed-furniture. The woman went out first, and she left the man with the child to bring out; the man stopped behind, and asked me to give him something to drink. I did not altogether like the idea of the man asking to drink, having only laid out three shillings, so I walked to the door to look after the woman, the woman was gone half a dozen yards from the door.

On Monday morning last, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming towards town, he had got a bridle under his arm; when he saw me looking at him, he was endeavouring to hide this bridle, by covering it up with these things. I thought he had not come honestly by them; I took him in custody. He told me he found the bridle. I asked him, where he got the boots; he said, they were a pair of old boots he had worn when he was at work down in the country. I searched him, and found four large knives upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you left it - A. In the shop window. I immediately said, there was a roll of carpet gone out of the window. I ran out of doors, went up a passage of a public-house that adjoins our shop, it is a thoroughfare that leads into Castle-street. On coming to the top of the passage I looked to my left, I saw a man with a roll of carpet on his shoulder. I ran after him, and was going to lay hold of his coat; he threw the carpet down in the middle of the street, and ran off. I called out, stop thief; several people followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him - A. No, I took the property home to my master's shop. I had not been in the shop above three minutes before the prisoner was brought.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I have had the pleasure of seeing him twice, I saw him on the first of July. I live in Mr. Baxter's house, the house is all let out to lodgers; the owner of the house does not sleep in it, I have one room on the two pair of stairs. On the 1st of July, I and my wife went to my father-in-law, No. 15, Brownlow-street; the prisoner was there, in company with us, from between one and two o'clock till half past four, then we were going to see a debtor in Newgate, the prisoner came with us, and coming along I took him up into my room, to shew him a long drum that I had for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that you had a shirt and two bank notes - A. Yes, the notes were in a little box inside of a big box, and my shirt laid on the box, there were three pound in this little box, whoever took them dropped one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that little box locked - A. No, it was fastened down with iron clamps, it is my wife's saving box for a rainy day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in your room with you - A. Not two minutes, my wife stopped behind to lock the door; he and I came down together, my wife, and he, and me were the only three that were in my room, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your father-in-laws at one o'clock, your room door was not locked - A. No, it was not, when I brought the prisoner up, the door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the prisoner had been there before - A. No, I had seen him before where he worked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where you lodged - A. No, not before I shewed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you staid there two or three minutes, had you shewn him this box, or did you open the large box - A. No, I only shewed him the large drum.</p>
               <p>A. Are you quite sure that when you went to see your father-in-law, that the money was in the little box, and that you had it safe in the large box - A. I am not in the habit of going to the large box, my wife was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you discovered that you had lost the property - A. As we were going on in Holborn, the prisoner made an excuse that he had a complaint in his bowels, he left me and told me he would follow me, he did not; I and my wife went to see our acquaintance and returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this person that you were going to see in Newgate an acquaintance of yours or his - A. An acquaintance of both, but more of his, the prisoner worked under him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were walking to Holborn, could you see whether the prisoner had any thing under his coat - A. No, not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of your room to go to see your acquaintance in Newgate, did you lock the door - A. I cannot say, my wife stopped behind to lock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop in Newgate to see this acquaintance of yours - A. About an hour, the prisoner never came to us; I had a couple of pots of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180038"/>poster in Newgate with the debtor; I returned and my wife back to my room, and the door was a jar, I thought it had been left locked; I suspected I was robbed, I went to the box and found the money box broken open; the shirt my wife did not miss till the next day; I examined my box, three notes were gone, one was found upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your great box been broken open - A. No, the key was in the great box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the little box taken from the great box - A. No, only broken open, the iron clamps had been wrenched up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the contents of the box - A. Yes, I was by at the time it was put in, there were three separate one pound notes, I put one in myself, and my wife put in two.</p>
               <p>Q. On examining the little box two one pound notes had been taken away, and one dropped on the floor of your room - A. Yes; this happened on the 1st of July, on the third I saw the prisoner at Bow-street, I went to the

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing respecting the taking the bank notes - A. No, I believe he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered your two pound notes again - A. No; the duplicate of the shirt was found upon him when he was taken in custody, I would not take exactly upon me to swear to the shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. You took this man up to your room to shew him a long drum - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the little box was in the great box, that great box you did not open in his presence - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know any thing of your little box - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not know it was there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found the two notes since - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the lock broken when you came back - A. No, the bolt of the lock was in no other situation than as if it had not been locked; it might have happened by not having been locked, or by being opened by a key.</p>

Yes, and my mother went with us, she is not here; my mother said below while we went up to our room, and when we came down, the prisoner set off with us with an intention to go to Newgate; this man, who was in confinement for debt, was an acquaintance of both of us. The prisoner went as far as Middle-row, Holborn, with us; my husband and he walked together. I did not hear his reason for leaving us there; he left us and went across the road. I did not see him any more till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from Newgate, did you go immediately from Newgate to your own lodgings -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180039"/>A. Yes, my husband went before me, I met him in Queen-street, he told me the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your lodgings to go to Newgate, are you certain that you locked the door or not - A. I am quite certain of that, the prisoner bid me go back to see if I had locked it, I did go back, and it was locked. On going up into my room, I saw the cover of the little box in the chair, with this knife, and the body of the box was in the great box; the knife was my knife, it had been laying in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the knife been at all notched or bent by opening the little box - A. The knife is bent, it was not bent when I went out, the knife was laying under the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of this - A. My father and mother went to his lodgings the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform your father what you had discovered - A. Yes; he went to look after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the Monday, in St. John-street, in Smithfield, in the morning, part of the day my mother and father were with me. I asked him how he came to break the door open, and come into my place after we left it, and take my money; the prisoner said, there is an officer, if you choose to take me up you may.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him upon his word and did take him up - A. Yes, he was taken up; he was searched in the Poultry compter yard, I was by at the time, and a duplicate of a shirt was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the duplicate to the pawnbroker - A. Me and the officer did, to a pawnbroker in St. John-street, Smithfield; we found the shirt, I knew the shirt to be my husband's, there was the initials of his name, P. E.; I knew it to be my husband's, I use to wash for him, he had it for about three months; I can speak with positiveness that it is my husband's shirt; I told the prisoner at Bow-street of the shirt, he said he did take that. He was taken to Bow-street the same day, my husband did not see the prisoner till the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. This first of July was on a Sunday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your husband went to your father-in-laws before you saw the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out you locked the door as you thought - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs in your way from your father's to Newgate, the door was not locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you supposed you had locked it - A. I did not go out then meaning to leave it open, I thought I had locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had made one mistake that day - when the prisoner went up with you on your return from your father's, that was the first time of his going in your room - A. The first time, he did not know where we lived before then.</p>
               <p>Q. Much less where your money was - A. I suppose he guessed at it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lock is it to your door - A. Not a very good lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence when you came back - A. No, I thought it was opened by a key, my husband was the first that went into the room.</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON. I am a servant to Mr. Briggs, a pawnbroker, St. John-street. On the 2d of July, the prisoner pawned a shirt with me, I have known him some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that duplicate afterwards brought the same day - A. Yes; Mrs. Egin and the officer came between eleven and twelve, they claimed the shirt; I shewed them the shirt, I have kept it ever since; he pawned it in the name of Hinton, I have known him by the name of Hinton, always. He lived in St. John-street, and that is the duplicate I gave to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CADMAN. Q. You took charge of this man - A. Yes, I searched him in the presence of Mrs. Egin, I found the duplicate upon him; I afterwards went with the duplicate to the pawnbroker's, the shirt was produced to me there. It was an old man that took charge of him, he delivered him up to me; the officer that had him first, said he knew him from a child.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday, the 1st of July, I was taken by Peter Egin to his house, for the purpose of shewing me a big drum. We were going to see a person in Newgate, I carried provision, and they gave me a bottle of liquor; I left him at Gray's-inn-lane, I told him the occasion; I went into the first public house, and there I met a friend, he told me the consequence of taking liquor into a prison, in consequence of that I did not go. I returned in about three quarters of an hour, to Egin's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180040"/>house, I asked if Egin was at home, they told me no, I returned down, I saw Egin no more untill I was taken into custody, he told me at his father's, that he should not stop in Newgate more than a quarter of an hour, and my stopping with my friend made me go to his room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Were you going to take any thing to this friend of yours in Newgate - A. Yes, my father in law sent it in a bottle.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep the house yourself - A. I do, it is my house; I have a niece that lives with me, I am the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of May, was your niece gone out at night - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she with her your two men servants, the coachman and footman - A. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your female servants at home - A. There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. Between eleven and twelve on that night were you writing in your parlour - A. I was writing, it was within a quarter of twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell us what drew your attention towards the parlour door - A. I heard something as I thought, turning the latch of the door, but very low, gently the door opened, and a man presented himself; I looked at him steadily, he did not say one word to me; nor I to him. The first of his actions was saying burr, he was pointing to the fire where I was sitting, he took a second step with making the same noise, then he was pointing to the back parlour door saying burr, he directly began to lay hold of me, and drew me into the parlour; I made some opposition to it, and by the way of giving him some counter action there was a card table that stood by the fire place in the parlour, on which I had been writing, I had really forgot to put the feet up, I laid the whole weight of my body on the table, the table of course fell on me, and cut my skin a good deal. At that time I was quite clear what he had in view was the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the table fell upon you, were you in the front parlour or in the back parlour - A. I was in the back parlour, pretty near the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. You were now down upon the floor - A. The table having fallen upon me, and there was a small box between my feet. It is a room full of papers and boxes. He was up, the table did not fall upon him. I had not been long in that situation when he gave me a blow on my stomach, and I fell on my back. In that situation I was, I found both his hands at once one in each pocket, in my left hand pocket, I had one hundred pound in small bank notes in my right hand, there was my pocket book, as soon as he took these out he thrust his hand into my side pocket, and took the key of the iron chest and opened the iron chest with all the ease imaginable, and he began to rifle the chest; but he only rifled the chest with one hand, he was afraid of my getting up; I was in that situation I could not get up, he held me fast, I of course endeavoured to free myself from him, which I could not do on account of the embarrassment of the card table, and the box between my feet, and there he had me; he took every thing from the iron chest, he took gold boxes, diamond rings, chains, and watches, part of them are here, I have not them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all them things in the iron chest - A. No, part of them were, some were in the drawer, he took the things out of the cases they were in, and this snuff box had a case. After being on my back, I turned about, I said, I wanted to sit down, he said, burr; I said, I wanted to sit down on one of them little boxes, he resisted my attempt by making the same noise, that is the only noise he made the whole time. I endeavouring, or wanting to get out of his hands, crept about two or three yards to the parlour door, he pursued me, and there he got upon the top of me, and gave me a violent blow upon my head which gushed out blood.</p>
               <p>Court. He gave you a violent blow with what - A. With his fist, what, said I, do you intend to murder me, these were the only words that passed between us; I suppose that blow must have stunned me, I spoke no more. When this was done, he had done every thing, he had rifled the chest, he took the candle out of the parlour that I had, he took that in his hand, I remember his going away, he went out of the door into the front parlour, turned the key of the door, and there he left me, there I was three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Do you mean that he locked you in the back parlour - A. Yes, I was left in the dark laying on the ground; I was not able to get up till some little time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he leave this candle that you have been speaking of - A. I think he left it in the inside room, but there was a candle which is a remarkable thing, I found a candle which he had thrown in the corner, how the house escaped fire I know not; since the candle was broken in two or three pieces, the tallow had run all about the floor, and the wick went out; it was a most wonderful thing how it went out, he dashed it in the corner as he went out, the waistcoat is signed.</p>
               <p>A. From whom had you the bank notes that you had in your pocket - A. I wanted to pay some tradesmen, I had them from Mr. Antrobus, the teaman, in the Strand, I intended to pay them away the day after I had them in; there were others that I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the young man at the bar - A. I do, perfectly well; he was six months in my service, he had left me about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that committed the violence upon you about the size and height of that man - A. I believe he was; he had a black gauze over his face, of course that made his features appear larger to me, he looked more robust then, and in the features of his face having the gauze over it, I thought I knew his voice; I really and truly did think that it must be the prisoner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180041"/>Court. You did not hear his voice did you - A. No, only burr, from the manner of the voice. I really believed it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean that your opinion is found upon the observations that you made at the moment or from the knowledge that you have since acquired with the; information of Humphrey's - A. It is not from subsequent information at all, I think so at least.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that the face of the man through the black gauze appeared larger - A. No doubt it did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you stated that the person appeared larger in bulk than the prisoner - A. Certainly, I thought so, I do not think that he exceeded in height.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street In consequence of information on the 25th of June, I went to Mrs. Temple, No. 15, Little Barlow-street, Marylebone, I found the prisoner there about five o'clock in the afternoon, there are two rooms on the first floor; I rapped at the door, I went in, the prisoner was drinking tea with Mrs. Temple, and a soldier belonging to the life guards; I said Mr. Towers how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, he arose from his chair and said, how do you do sir, I have not the pleasure of knowing you, I told him I knew him very well, and that I had called two or three days before, and left my address, he said, I have your address in my pocket; I said, how was it you did not call upon me, he replied, he only came to town last night, I told him I understood he had an inclination to go to India, he said, he had; I said, I should wish to speak to him in private, he said by all means, we went into the back room, me and the prisoner only, then I noticed the chain and seals of his watch, I said, you have got a curious seal, a very pretty one, he said, it was; I laid hold of one of the seals, and observed the lion rampart upon it; I then said, will you have the goodness to let me look at the watch in your pocket, he said, yes, I will, he took the watch out of his pocket and gave it me in my hand, I said, they were nice seals, and the watch appeared to be a French one; he said, he did not know about it being a French watch, I told him I believe I had some knowledge of the seals, and also of the watch, he said, he believed not; it was a watch that was left to him by his uncle a very rich farmer in the country that had died lately. I said, you lived with Mr. Bryen once, he said, he did; I asked him if he thought Mr. Bryen would give him a character, he said, he had been living with a gentleman in the country since he left Mr. Bryen; I told him my name was Humphreys, I am a Bow-street officer, if this is your watch which your uncle left you, you will have no objection to go with me to Mr. Bryen, he said, he would not go, then I took my staff out of my pocket that I would not deceive him, and told him he should go; then I asked him if the trunk and box in the room was his; he said, no, it was the soldiers whom he slept with, I told him he had better go quiet and easy, and say no more about it, if it was all right he would soon return again. I got him down stairs, then he wanted to speak to his landlady, I told him no, I took him by the arm and led him out of the yard into the street. We went together till we came to the corner of Manchester-street, he had occasion to stop there, we proceeded to Mr. Bryen's door, and as I put my hand to the door he attempted to make his escape, he ran some distance before I catched him, nearly a mile, I stopped him, took him into Oxford-street, before I could get a coach, I then tied his hands, and put him into a coach, I attempted to search him, he seemed very ticklish he did not like it. In what I am going to relate, I neither promised him any thing nor threatened him, I put my hand into his breeches pocket, there I found a gold snuff box, he said, you are right, it is of no use for me to deny it any longer, take care of that box for in it there is seven and thirty pounds, this is the snuff box, he then said, keep all you find about me, and I will not split, that is he would not say any thing about it, I told him I should keep all I had got a short time, but I should split; I then asked him what he had done with the remainder of the old gentleman's property that he had taken, he replied, that he had sold it to a jew, he should not know him again if he saw him, he had not pledged it, and I might depend upon it that every thing that I found upon him was the whole that was left, I took him to Bow-street, locked him up, and took another coach and went back to his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that snuff box and watch - A. The gold snuff box is mine, the gold watch, seals, chain, and key are mine.</p>
               <p>Humphries. When I got to the lodging, I found a trunk and box there, in the trunk I found a gold repeating watch, a gold snuff box, part of a tortoise shell box, an ivory box set in gold, a pearl box, a large gold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180042"/>ring, and three other gold rings; here is gold chains and other inkets, and topaz broaches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The are all my property, they were all in the strong box.</p>
               <p>Humphrey's. There were linen in the other box, I believe, what he owned, there is two five guinea pieces and some double joes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost two double joes, and three five guinea pieces.</p>

On the night of the 20th of June, I had a dispute with my comrade; he said that I should not sleep with him that night; I said I would find a bed at another place; I went out into the street and met with the prisoner; he asked me if I would go along with him; we went down Chelsea, to find a house open, it was twelve at night; finding no house open we agreed to lay under the trees till morning. In the course of the night, I was disturbed by the prisoner pulling my watch out, he cut the fob of my trowsers, and while I was taking my hat up he ran away, I could not catch him; at eight o'clock in the morning I found him in his lodging.</p>

I believed what he said, that he was Mr. Scott; he asked me if we had any children's black hats to dispose off in the shop; I told him yes; he told me I might take two children's black hats there at six o'clock, for a child about four years old, and a bill and receipt, and he would pay for the hats. He took me up a street out into the Old Jewry, said he wanted to go to Coleman-street, and for me to make haste home. When I got home to my master's shop I told what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the evening with the children's hats to Mr. Scott - A. Yes, I went alone, and when I came there they said they did not know any thing about the children's hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire whether the hat come home to Mr. Scott, by the person calling himself Mr. Scott - A. Yes, I could not learn any thing about it there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again that took the hat from you - A. On the Tuesday following, in Cheapside, by our door; I told my master of it, the prisoner saw me, my master went after him; the prisoner was going to run through a passage, a thoroughfare, my master stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the hat again - A. No. I said I was sure he was the man, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this hat charged to the customer - A. Five shillings. It was an old hat that had been dressed.</p>

I immediately went to the prosecutor's apartment, and at the door the prisoner was sitting; the prosecutor told me the circumstance of the robbery, that he was asleep in his bed, and the door on the latch, and the person, whoever it was that had robbed him, opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a ground floor - A. No, up one pair of stairs. The woman enumerated the things that she had lost, and said that she had a handkerchief of hers on her neck; I desired the prisoner to take it off her neck, which she did; on searching her the woman found a five shilling paper of halfpence, two shillings in silver, and some odd halfpence. I then went with her daughter to Mr. Cotton's, in Shoreditch; upon enquiry they produced a frock and two aprons; there were a pair of shoes on the prisoner's feet, the prosecutrix said they were her shoes, and on the stain were left an old pair of shoes and a pair of stockings. The prosecutrix took her into another room, undressed her, and took off her an old flannel petticoat that belonged to her daughter.</p>

Afterwards the last witness brought in this instrument, a bodkin which tailors use, as soon as ever I saw it, I said, this is the thing that broke open the back garret door, I examined the door the mark corresponded, I asked M'Gee if he used a bodkin in his trade, he said, no, he did not, I asked what he made the holes with for the button shanks to go in, he took a pair of scissars and shewed me how he did it, his little boy said it was his father's bodkin, the prisoner afterwards acknowledged it had been in his room. The property was never found.</p>

               <p>Court. What time of night might this be - A. About half past ten, the prisoner appeared to be coming from the King's New road, he met me very near the pound, as if he came from the King's New-road, he seized hold of the lappels of my coat violently; he snatched from me my watch, and then the first words that he said was, give me all the money you have, I gave him all the money I had in my pocket, amounting to seven of eight shillings, I cannot say the exact sum but not less. He immediately looked at me very hard in the face, and said I have seen you somewhere before in Parliament-street, and I know you to be a b - r, if you do not promise to behave to me as a gentleman I will have you in the pillory in less than a week for sodomy. He desired that I would meet him the next morning at the same place where I then was and give him five pound, I told him I would do so, he persisted in his threats that if I did not behave to him as a gentleman he certainly would appear against me for the crime which he charged me. I told him that his accusation would not avail, as my character would bear the most minute enquiry, and I had the most respectable connections. I then told him who I was, I said, my name is Mr. Price, and that my brother was physician to the York hospital, Chelsea. He said, he did not believe me, he immediately locked my arm in his, and took me over to a public house just by, he took hold of my arm and hurried me over where he called for something to drink, he took a candle off the bar and looked me in my face. When the prisoner had taken a glass of liquor he handed a glass of brandy and water, which I tasted, we came out together, I parted and went home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Now Mr. Pride at the time that he seized you by the lappel of your coat had you ever seen or known the prisoner before - A. Never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever spoken to him before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Now after he had got your watch and your money it was after that he made this threat - A. It was after that he made this threat.</p>

               <p>Q. After he made that accusation and threat were you under considerable alarm - A. I was under a considerable alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you prior to that been in a good of ill state of health - A. A very ill state of health.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he took you over to the public house, and at the public house to your parting with him, did you continue in that state of alarm - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. While you were in the public house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Q. Why did not you at that time make any alarm - A. I considered myself at the mercy of the prisoner, I did not know with whom he might be connected, and that he might have persisted in carrying into execution the horrid charge of accusing me publicly with a crime which my nature shuddered at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him the next morning - A. I did</p>
               <p>Q. This was Friday night, the 6th of July - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time that you saw him again - A. On Wednesday morning the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him again - A. The most renger that attends at the medical board told me that a person wanted to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day might that be - A. I should suppose about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what he said did you go down stairs - A. I did, to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you saw the prisoner at the public house with the candle there, are you sure that the person you saw at the door then, was the prisoner and the man that attacked you on the Friday night - A. I am sure; the first words he said was, I wish to speak to you sir; I walked out with him a few steps, he said to me, you have not performed your promise by meeting me at the place appointed and desired me to give him five pound; I told him that I had not five pound in my pocket, he desired me to meet; him the same evening at seven o'clock, and to give him five pound; I promised so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at this time, and you say it was the same man were you alarmed - A. I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you were talking in the street - A. I should suppose ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you conscious that your countenance was at though you were under great alarm - A. I am conscious of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He went away after some time - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time why did you not cause him to be apprehended - A. I did not wish to throw the department into confusion on my account, I did not wish to develop my own name on the occasion; and not having mentioned the circumstance to my friends, I did not know how much the prisoner might have the advantage of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet him that night - A. I did; he took me to a place near the end of Berkley-street, and desired me to go with him into that passage which leads from Berkley-street, into Cousin-street. When I came there he accosted me, he said, sir, have you seen the newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it - A. Seven o'clock. He said, Sir, have you seen the newspapers in which there is an account of several persons having been taken up for a certain crime; those are the words he made us of; I told him I had, he said, he did not mean to take the advantage of me, and that if I would behave like a gentleman he would never mention my name upon much a subject. He asked me if I had brought him five pound, I told him I had; and I gave him the five pound. He said, sir, I have pawned your watch, but I will tell you at once what I mean to have of you. I want fifty pound, in order to enable me to procure my discharge from the Guards; I have been a serjeant in the guards, and am a <rs id="t18100718-66-deflabel398" type="occupation">deserter from the regiment of Guards</rs>

I understood it to be a crime too shocking to mention; I was even as much alarmed then, as I was at the first, perhaps more; we parted, and the same night I communicated it to my brother, doctor Price.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you, during the whole of this time, not to communicate it to your brother - A. It was a subject I was loth to communicate.</p>

               <p>Q. What to your own brother - A. It was a painful thing then.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On Wednesday; I waited on my brother after I had left the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. You went there the next day accompained by two officers, Foy, and Craig - A. I did, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you marked a two pound note - A. My brother marked his initials first, I then put mine, and the two officers put theirs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there on the Thursday evening - A. At seven o'clock; I saw him at the end of Berkeley-street, the same place he met me before; the officer's I left a few paces behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him what did he say to you - A. He said, Sir, you hardly know me, I suppose, I am so very smart. He had equipped himself in new clothes, to what I saw him the last time; he asked me to walk down the same passage with him, where I had been with him before. He said, Sir, I am a gentleman, and mean to behave to you as such. Pray have you heard of the story of a certain nobleman, whose name he mentioned, who has been obliged to pay a thousand pound for concealment; I told him I had not; he said, if you will give me an hundred pound, I will never trouble you again, as that sum will enable me to return into my own country, where I have an estate; I told him that was a great sum, and that I did not think it possible that I should be able to pay him all that sum; he said, then give me twenty pound to night, and bring me the remainder to morrow; I told him that I had only a two pound note with me, which I put into his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same note that had been marked - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you went there this night, it was purely for the purpose of apprehending him - A. It was; I was keeping my eye upon the officers, I saw them when I gave him the two pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. When he mentioned the thousand pound that was given for the purpose of concealment, what did you understand by it - A. The same crime. When I put the two pound in his hand, the officers came up and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When he seized you the first night, and took your watch from you, had you ever seen this man before - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And the reason that you did not give the alarm then, and at other times, except the last time, you went for the purpose of apprehending him; I will now ask whether it was not under the terror of that charge that you did not apprehend him - A. It was, and from no other cause.</p>
               <p>Q. And your reason for not communicating it to cause but have given his Lordship, the nature of the accusation against you - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he seized you by the collar and took your watch, before he made any threat, were you under any alarm - A. A considerable alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had your watch again - A. I have not, that I positively swear.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Q. Upon the virtue of your oath, where was the first place you met me - A. Upper Eaton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet me on last Tuesday night was a week - A. I did not meet you.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the virtue of your oath, did not you make me a present of two pair of cotton stockings, and did not you make me a present of the watch - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put your hand into your pocket and give me a dollar and two shillings - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never extorted a shilling from Mr. Price, as I am to dye, he gave me five-pound; we walked round Berkley-square, and came down St. James's-street.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Thursday night, the 12th of July, I went with Mr. Price, and Foy, we were in disguise. I first saw the prisoner in Landsdowne passage, in company with Mr. Price; I was stationed at the end of the passage, in Berkeley-street; I went up to him in about five minutes, they were standing conversing together; Foy went first up the passage, I saw Foy pass him, I was some paces behind, I went up; Mr. Price, said, this is the man; I laid hold of him by the right hand; in his right hand was this note, I asked him what it was; I do not know, said he, it is something that gentleman has given me. I took it out of his hand, and at that time Foy came up on the other side of him; he turned round when he saw Foy, and said, Mr. Foy, this is a bad job, or a bad thing, or words to that effect. Foy asked him what he had done with the gentleman's watch, he did not see any chain about him; he said, he had returned it to him. last night. I answered, that Mr. Price had said to the contrary, that he had never had his watch back. On our way to the office, he said, he was awkwardly situated, that if he should dye he should be innocent. Foy asked him where he lived, he said, somewhere in St. Giles's, he had a fresh lodging every night, he could not tell the house or the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon that note - A. I did, there is my mark, that is the same note.</p>

               <p>Q. While Mr. Price was in the passage and conversing with the prisoner, did you walk by him - A. I did; as I passed by, Mr. Price said he had no more than two pound; I passed and gave the signal for Craig to come; the prisoner said, that was not enough, it would not do. I went on twelve paces or more, I turned round and saw Craig apprehending him; I immediately turned round and came on the other side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went there had you marked the note - A. Yes, When I laid hold of his arm, he looked round and said, ah, Foy, this is a bad thing; I said, what have you done with the gentleman's watch; he said, I gave it him back last night. We did not search him untill we got him to the office, in his pocket we found a street-door key; I asked him where he lodged, he said, St. Giles's, he did not know the house, he had a fresh lodging every night. On further examination the magistrate asked him where he lodged; he said he lodged opposite No. 3, King's Head-court, Broad-way, Westminster. We had a search warrant, and when we came there the house was stripped, every thing was gone. At the office, he denied that ever he said he gave the watch back.</p>

            . I am the acting physician of the military hospital, called the York hospital; Mr. Price, the prosecutor, is my brother, he is in the habit of visiting me frequently in the evening. On the evening stated when my brother called me, I was absent, he called on me the following night, that made me recollect I was absent on that night. On the evening of the 11th, my brother called and made this communication to me, and then my brother did not give a verbal communication, he wrote me a letter and gave it me, he said, there is a business I cannot detail to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother at that time in a state of alarm and agitation - A. He was, I advised him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother had been ill before - A. Yes, I attended him with the surgeon of York hospital; he was in a state of extreme ill health.</p>

Mr. Price met me when I was pumping cold water on my legs, he frequently walked with me; he brought me to the five fields chealsea and brought a young woman there, he wished me to have a connection with her; he asked me if I was large, as Irishmen were in general; I asked him where she was, he then said it was dangerous; he unbuttoned my small clothes and took my penis out in his hand; I told him it was not a thing that I was accustomed to; it is a shocking thing, he said, say nothing about it, now my life is in your hands, now I will ever be a friend to you as long as I live; he walked down with me as far as the wheatsheaf, he had a glass of brandy and water, and I had a glass of gin; he met me on the Tuesday and gave me three shillings, he told me to call on him at the office of the medical board, I did, he came and gave me a dollar and two shillings. On Tuesday evening he gave me a five pound note to pay my lodgings; he told me to go down to the salt water, and if I should go to Colchester, where he came from, he would get me the best connections that he had. In Albermarle-street, he brought me down there, he put in my hand a two pound note; I told him I did not want that, but to get me a situation, and to go down to the salt water. I own that Mr. Price gave me the money, I never extorted a shilling from him.</p>

            . On the 15th of June, I went in company with Armstrong, and son, to the Gibralter dye-house. Wilkins was brought into the parlour, he was asked where he got the three pieces of long from; he said, he had them from Nash, who worked for Mr. Kirk. Mr. Burton's foreman was present, he said, you told me you had them from an undertaker, the other side of the water; for the purpose of getting them dyed. Wilkins said, I did say so; but that was not true. We took Wilkins in custody, and went and searched his house; up stairs, in a cupboard or a box in a bed room, we found this piece of blue, it is the same sort of stuff only dyed blue that he said he got from a publican to get it dyed blue. Armstrong took him to the office, I went to Mr. Kirks, and Nash was brought to the office in the presence of Wilkin's; Wilkins then said, he had them from Nash for the purpose of getting them dyed. Nash said, he had them from a man about four years ago at a public house; but the man he did not know, he took them to Wilkins for the purpose of getting them dyed. I and

On Thursday, the 12th instant, about a quarter before one, I was in Cannon-row, Westminster; I saw the prisoner pass me up the steps into Bridge-court, with a hamper on his shoulder, he was going as if from our cellar. It is always our custom to leave one of our men in the cellar at dinner hour, to take orders; it was the prisoner's turn that day to stay. When the prisoner passed me, I had no suspicion that he meaned to steal it; I saw him put it down by a book stall, in the court, he then followed me, and said, he had been to take half a pint of porter; I then asked him, what he had done with the hamper; he said, he had no hamper; I then said, do you mean to tell me that I did not see you going up the steps this moment with a hamper; he said, no. I called him a scoundrel, and took him to the spot where he put the hamper down. I saw the hamper was tied with our cord, a young woman at the fruit stall, said, she saw the prisoner put it down there; I then said, come along with me, I will transport you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the hamper contain - A. Three dozen empty bottles, I cannot speak to the bottles, the cord is made by our order to prevent depredations of porters it the inns opening it.</p>
               <p>Q. From that circumstance have you any doubt of the hamper and bottles being your's - A. I have not, at the same time, I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As for the cord; there are not London, that do not make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180049"/>use of the same cord, and if they can say they have seen them bottles, I am willing to abide by the punishment.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 5th of July, I was on the bridge. I saw Willis, and Russell, they were very busy, putting their hands into people's pockets; I kept my eye upon them. One of them put their hand into my pocket, felt the staff, and then they sheered off. In a few minutes afterwards. I saw them again, and followed them and stopped them; Nicolls searched Willis, and found the handkerchief in his hat. When he took it from him he said, it was his own.</p>
               <p>- NICOLLS. I was in company with Limbrick, I saw Willis, and Russell, come from the crowd; Russell was thrusting something into his breeches. We took them into a public house, I searched Willis, and found this handkerchief in the crown of his hat; he said, it was his own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was on the bridge. I met Russell, by that means I crossed over the way; I spoke to him, he asked me if I was going home; Limbrick came and took us both, and searched us both, he found the handkerchief on me, and the watch on Russell. I bought the handkerchief for sixpence of a man, he said, he was starving; he would sell the handkerchief off his neck to get him a bit of bread.</p>

I had information also of the post boy losing his property, from suspicion, I pursued the prisoner; and apprehended him on Tuesday morning at three o'clock. On searching him, I found Hutchins's breeches upon him, and one of the shirts that had been taken away from my ground he had on; On searching the place where he slept in the barn, I found the other shirt and handkerchief.</p>

I did not intimate that I observed it. I called him to come back, he did, and observing me look at the warrant, he questioned me whether it was correct. I paused some time, and said, very well; I having a firm conviction that these three names were forged, I gave information; it was laid before the board. I went to take this man up, he was in Mr. Rowe's accompting house alone. I believe I asked him if he had not, in the course of the day, tendered me a warrant for East India tanned hides; he said, yes. I believe Mr. Wright asked him whether he wrote the warrant; I believe he answered to that, yes, he did. Nalder came in, he was taken in custody; he was searched; this bill of calculation was found upon him. and five hundred and fifteen pounds in bank notes.</p>
               <p>The defendant said nothing in his defence, called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
