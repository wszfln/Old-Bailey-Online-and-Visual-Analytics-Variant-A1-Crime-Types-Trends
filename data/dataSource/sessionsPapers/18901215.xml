               <p>him into the house—I knocked and was refused admission—I was there early next morning, 1st August, and saw him leave his house and walk towards Queen's Road Station—I said I was Detective Sergeant Outram from the City, and that I held a warrant for his arrest on the charge of libel; and I added, "You will have to go with me to the City"—he went with me—I read the warrant to him at the station; he said in answer, "I published the pamphlet"—he also said he was going to see his solicitor, Mr. Wontner, to arrange to surrender to this charge, and at the same time he produced a letter from, the purport of which was an appointment what time he should be there—it was handed in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The purport of the letter was arranging to meet him at Mr. Wontner's office—I heard that as soon as Morris was arrested with regard to the publication of this libel, Butterfield went to the police-station where Morris was, and offered himself as bail—I think that was the night previous to the arrest, I am not sure; it was previous to his arrest—I was at Butterfield's house about eleven p.m. on 31st July, when they refused to open the door—I did not placard the house during the night with these bills—I know nothing about that; I was surprised when I saw the house placarded—it was not done the night before—it was done in the night-time—I knew Butterfield's address when Morris was arrested—I had seen his wife, and she had spoken to me through the kitchen window—I asked the inspector if it was true that Butterfield had been there—this is the letter he had in his hand. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Messrs. Wontner, and stated that they had seen Mr. George Lewis, and arranged that Butterfield should surrender next morning, and that the better plan would be for him to be at Messrs.

               <p>for 500 dollars, and forced me to sign a bill of sale for him over the business and the stock and plant there—he gave me nothing when I signed it—when my husband died there was amongst my property some jewellery—Mr. Marks took from me a gold watch and chain, a diamond scarf-pin, three rings, and three diamond studs—he borrowed those to go to dinner with Mr. Seligman, a banker in New York—that was either just before or just after the New Year, 1879—he never returned the jewellery to me, I have asked him several times about it, and he has told me he pawned it—I asked him what he had done with the money, and he told me he purchased flowers for a lady friend—my husband was member of a Foresters' Lodge—in respect of that, the day after the New Year, Montagu L. Marks brought me a cheque for 1,000 dollars, and he wanted some money of me, and I told him to go to my office and see Harry Marks, and if there were 100 dollars there he could have it—Montagu L. Marks is no relation of Harry Marks—I gave Montagu L. Marks the 1,000 dollar cheque, and he went to the office to see if Harry Marks had 100 dollars to give him—afterwards, from what I heard, I asked Harry Marks about what he had done with that 1,000 dollar cheque, and he said he had spent it with other women at the Cafe Brunswick—I never had any money from Harry Marks—after the incident of the 1,000 dollars he came over here, he said he was coming to see his father and mother—while he was away, on 20th July, I gave birth to a child—that was Harry Marks' child—this is the certificate of its birth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a few days after the birth Marks returned from Europe, and came to my house—he named the child himself, after his sister, Alice Marks, so he said—it is registered in that name—my name is Annie—he did not remain in the same house with me, for there was rent due, and he deserted me from that right away—I was not able to pay the rent there—I removed to Twelfth Street, and I had to sell my furniture piece by piece while I was there—I never applied to Marks to assist me, nor asked him for money—he did not offer to do anything to assist me—I have two children of my own besides—I had three to keep—in October I was so badly off that I had to apply to the Courts to relieve me—on 18th October I went to the office to see Marks—I had before sent a messenger to ask Mr. Marks for some money, and he sent back that he had not got any, and I sent again, and he sent me 1 dollar—that was all he gave me—the same day I went to the office and asked him what he intended to do with me; did he intend to starve my children, and he began to laugh at me, and told me I was insane; then I told them all to leave the office, I could take care of it, and they did leave; I had no means of locking the door, and one of the office-boys from upstairs nailed the door for me, and I went home—at this time I had sold very nearly all my furniture—the next day was Sunday—on the Monday morning, when I was leaving home, an officer came to my door, and I was arrested and taken to the Magistrate's Court on a charge of insanity—the officer did not exactly tell me what he took me for till I got to the Court—Judge Smith was the Magistrate—I saw Marks at the Court all through—when I was taken to Judge Smith's room he told me I was held for Harry Marks for insanity, and I should be detained in prison for insanity and correction—they kept me nine hours—that was the first I knew of the charge against me—I was taken to Judge Smith's place—I asked for leave to send for my own</p>

Wontner, to start in the <hi rend="italic">Eurania</hi>—the night before I received this telegram, and in consequence I was taken on to Philadelphia; there I was left all night in the waiting-room, I had not a cent of money—I had given it to Mr. Stevens, the man who took me to Philadelphia—I was sent on by the superintendent of the line to New York, and then by the kindness of a firm of solicitors I was put on a steamer—my trunk was left at Kingsbridge Station; I suppose it was at Philadelphia with me, but when I got to Kingsbridge I found it there—I came in the <hi rend="italic">Britannic</hi>—I believe this telegram was sent by my brother-in-law—at the time of my husband's death, moneys were due to the paper from subscribers; none of those were ever paid to me by Mr. Marks; he collected all claims, and brought it all over to England; and he sold the printing type besides.</p>

My age is thirty-five now—I mean that seriously; I have had four children, three belonging to my husband and one to Mr. Marks, all healthy, and none of them born before their time that I know of—the eldest is in his sixteenth year—my brother-in-law, Mr. Seigfried Koppel, first spoke to me about giving evidence about five weeks ago—I have not had any money for coming here, and I am quite sure I am to have none—my expenses were paid for me—I have not heard that £500 has been lodged with one Dimmach for me—I know a person named Dimmach in Massachusetts—he is a farmer, and keeps a summer hotel; I lodged there last summer as housekeeper—he is married, and his wife is living; I was there from June 6th to October 6th last year—October 6th was the last time I saw him—I expect to get nothing but my expenses—I received £3 to use on the steamer when I was coming over, that is all—since I came to London I have been stopping with a lady friend, Mrs. Abbott—I do not know the name of the street nor the number—she is a friend I gained here since I arrived on this side; I had never seen her before—I have seen Butterfield at the house—he was not living there—I was personally conducted here, and personally conducted home last night—my sister went with me with Mr. Marks' child; her name was Maggie Doyle—she was single then; I cannot say whether she is now—she is my full sister, my maiden name was Doyle—I did not give a false maiden name in the registry of the child; I never put into the register of births, "Name of the mother, Annie Marks; maiden name of mother, Figler"; I cannot explain it, it was done without my knowledge; it was the nurse and doctor <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that; I did hot know anything about it; Mr. Marks named the child; I left it to the doctor, and I do not know how he came to give the wrong name—I met my husband Koppel in 1872, and we were married in October, 1873; he was at that time an advertising agent, and was using the <hi rend="italic">Reformer and Jewish Times</hi> to help his business of canvassing we lived in Fifty-eighth Street at the time of his death, after which I was compelled to take lodgers; I never did so in his life-time—I never assisted in a shop during his life, but I was compelled to do so afterwards—I never knew Mr. Koppel to be in difficulties—he did not die in debt to his landlord for arrears of rent that I am any way aware of—I did not know that daring his life he had given a bill of sale on the <hi rend="italic">Jewish Times and Reformer</hi> to Gustave D. Daniell; that is new to me—I never knew anything about his being in very poor circumstances—he had a house and grounds at.

Marks had the cheque, and he beat him, broke his eyeglass, and kicked him down the stairs, and took the cheque away from him—I know that, because I met Mr. Montagu L. Marks in the street after he had been beaten; Mr. Harry Marks told me he was after beating him when I met him at the office—I do not know if it was on that occasion or not that he kicked him out of the office; I suppose it was; I never knew him kick him out before that—I told the newspaper reporter that I received 1,000 dols. from the Foresters' Lodge on my husband's death, and that I entrusted them to Mr. Marks, who deposited them in the Broadway Savings Bank to his credit, so I was told—I did not also say that, in the transfer of the office to him, Harry Marks paid me 500 dols. out of this money—I did not say that 500 dols. was paid by Marks out of the 1,000 dols. I got from the Foresters—I got no money from Marks either out of that or any other money—I made a statement to the reporter as to the way Harry Marks used me—I did not say that Harry Marks made a payment to me of 500 dols. out of the Foresters' cheque, and that, having paid it, he immediately received it back again—I asked Marks what he had done with the 1,000 dollar cheque, and he said he had spent it with other women at the Cafe Brunswick; the man who had promised to marry me—I continued to be on friendly terms with him—I was not all the time on friendly terms with him—I was on friendly terms with him after he returned from Europe—notwithstanding this fraud, I continued under his influence signing anything he and Mr. Goodheart put before me, because I was in hopes he would do something for me and his child—I continued on friendly terms with him until his return from Europe in July, 1879, although in January, 1879, he had defrauded me out of 1,000 dollars, and told me he had spent it on women—on his return I swear he did not pay the rent of my house, which had accrued during his absence—he only visited me once after he came back—he did not tell me he could not keep up the connec<lb/>tion</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The document was read</hi>)—there is not a particle of truth in the suggestion that I had 500 dols.—as far as I know, and from my knowledge of him, he had not got 500 dols. at this time that he could give me—the jewellery was got from me a day or two before the New Year—he got no other money from me about this time with regard to the paper—I received no money from the office of the paper—when he spoke about the paper he gave me no explanation as to what he was doing with the moneys he got—before I gave him a power of attorney, and before I signed a bill of sale, he was affectionate to me—his affection cooled after he came back from Europe—after he had got the power of attorney, bill of sale and jewellery, I had nothing left but the furniture—the money I had from the other insurance companies was invested in the paper to enlarge it—Marks asked me to do that; he had the investment</p>

Haddon, who came to me when I was arrested for insanity—Marks paid the nurse—my son, when he was ten years old, had 20 dols. put in the bank for him—Marks could not take that—that is safe—on his return from Europe there was nothing more I could part with—from that time Marks ceased to visit me—I applied for charitable assistance to the Judge of the Court—in October I was living in Twelfth Street with my three children—I had been to a lawyer—I asked him if the house at Fordham that was sold had brought more than the mortgage, whether the money had been properly accounted for—when Marks and Goodheart came I had no one to advise me—the document they brought was ready written—it is not true that I said the words which were then written; nor that they said, "I understand," or "Do you want to make a statement?"—I made no statement that was written—the document was ready for me to sign—I signed it that night in their presence—neither suggested then I was out of my mind—I have no experience in drawing up documents.

Smith and Sons, I did not know that they were the solicitors of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, I knew their address; I had known Mr. Smith for some years, I did not know him in business—I went and saw him; nothing was produced to me, I think, on that occasion—I cannot remember the date when I became possessed of the property that I was to sell—the transfer of the property to me was not done by Smith and Son, but by Messrs. Eldred and Co.; they were the solicitors—a man named Benjamin transferred the property to me—I did not put any money into it, I paid nothing—I don't know what the supposed price of the property was—I don't remember who sent me to Eldred and Co., probably Mr. Smith, I only say probably—I believe Ralph and Ernest were the firm of Smith and Sons—at the time the property was transferred to me I signed a document, I signed whatever document that was put before me; I don't know what became of them—I don't remember whether any form was gone through, any receipt for the money I was supposed to pay—I did not offer any; I signed what I was told, I did not take any receipt or any document away—I don't know when I was to sell the property to the company; I believe it was the same day that I purchased it—the sale took place in Messrs. Smith's office, as far as I can remember—I can't say who was present—I should say Mr. Marks was not there, I think not—several documents were signed, that is all I remember—I had nothing to do with the price—I do not know Mr. John Fleming, or Charles Berry, or Douglas Money—I cannot say whether I signed more than one paper at the place where I was supposed to buy the property—I did not sign several blank pieces of paper on that occasion; I did on other occasions—this is the document I signed on 13th January. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement between the witness as vendor of the property and the trustees.</hi>)—I do not recollect any discussion at the time of signing that document, as to how that £50,000 was arrived at—while I was doing this I continued to be a clerk in Frank Barnard's office—I knew that he and Mr. Marks were connected together in business—I think I was paid some money for doing this—I don't remember what I got at the time, there were various payments at different times—I was not paid the £50,000 at that time; I received cheques afterwards for various sums; I can tell you some of the dates, I have a rough memorandum here—the first date I have here is January 26th, £952 10s.—these are rough memorandums of sums paid to me as vendor by the Rae Company, made at the time—the next date is February 3rd, £3,850; February 10th, £4,812; April 4th, £500; June 14th, £4,812 10<hi rend="italic">s,;</hi> then without date £2,500, £627, and the last, 27th September, £187 10s.—those are all that I have any record of—Mr. Nicholl, the company's secretary, gave me the first cheque at Frank Barnard's office; he brought it to me there; I endorsed it,</p>

I live at The Hermitage Cottage, Richmond—I retired from banking in 1886—in 1887 I asked Marks to introduce me to directors, with the result that I was invited on the Rae board—I married Marks' elder sister Zillah—he showed me the Rae skeleton prospectus—my name was not already on it—I only knew about finance—I understood there was a syndicate with whom he had influence—I attended the Rae preliminary board meeting—Penning, Bevitt, Pearson, the secretary, Mr. Nicholl, solicitor, Air. Smith and myself were present—there was a minute-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the entries would be correct—Marks was present when we made the allotment; nothing was discussed at the first meeting as to the contract of sale to the company—I understood Mr. Smith was vendor of the property—I had no reason to suppose otherwise—Marks had not enlightened me as to Smith's position—Marks gave advice as to the mode of procedure; he was there to advise—I did not know the persons to whom the shares were allotted—I was not aware that the secretary reported applications for 27,000 shares, and that the applicants were a very small number of persons—Marks remained only a short time—Marks advised us generally—I knew Alfred Benjamin's relations with Marks, but I did not know any other people;, I had not seen Frank Barnard at the time—long afterwards I employed him—I do not think Marks sat at the table—Captain Pearson was present at the allotment, but I never saw him afterwards—on the 21st January I remember there were two persons desirous of withdrawing their application for shares—those were 500 and 200 shares respectively, and cheques were drawn for those and returned—the next meeting was on the 26th January—at the meeting Mr. George Emden was appointed auditor; he audited the balance-sheet—at the next meeting on the 31st January the bank passbook was produced, and showed the balance to be £807 15s. 11d.—a cheque for £350 was drawn in favour of Mr. Frank Barnard for brokerage, including a charge of £100 for the broker in Glasgow—I suppose the secretary advised us to do that—at the meeting on the 2nd February, 1887, a cheque was drawn for £3,850 in favour of Mr. F. J. Smith in compliance with his request, as part of the purchase.

J. Smith asking for money—I do not consider that dunning—you will see by the minute-book when the men went out they took out a mill, machinery, picks and amalgamators; the amount spent upon it will appear in the cash-book—I had nothing to do with the estimate of profit, Penning and Bevitt did that; the secretary of the company usually took his instructions from me; I dictated almost all letters to him in shorthand, except when they did not apply, orders for machinery and that sort of thing—I did not know that Smith was merely a nominee until I saw it in the newspaper—after the liquidation commenced the directors were paid £150 a year—the general meeting was pleasant, not enthusiastic—we had not the information from the property then, the mine had only just started; it took three or four months to get up the country—I had attended every meeting—Mr. Bevitt was in the chair at the statutory meeting in April—Mr. Penning had gone to the Transvaal—I do not know the object of sending a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> with a report of the meeting to the shareholders—the "cheers" were not sham—the meeting was satisfactory—the letter received from Mr. Smith I believed was genuine—I believe the shares were for Smith's nominees, not Marks'—I did not know the people—I moved and Bevitt seconded that the Rae account should be transferred from the Capital and Counties to Smith, Payne and Smiths, and the balance, £848, paid to them—that was my suggestion, because I did not like the Capital and Counties Bank—the cablegrams were sent to the shareholders, because several called at the office desiring to be informed of them—it was to benefit the shareholders, so that if the telegrams had been true they would have equal chance with the directors to purchase shares in the market—we took no advantage of those—I never sold a share, nor did I buy a share—I ordered the secretary to stop the cablegrams because of the company's money being spent on them without result—no gold came to confirm them—we got some dust as a sample—I do not know where it came from—I do not know anything about the rotten reef—Mr. Bevitt can tell you—I daresay I told the secretary not to reply to inquiries without the instructions of the board—1,000 shares were demanded by Mr. Rae for information—we did not recognise the claim—Captain Pearson never came after the allotment—letters to him came back from the Dead Letter Office—the 250 shares, at 5s. a share, referred to in the minute of 15th September, were never allotted to Mr. James—he had been and knew a deal about the Transvaal—the engineer did not obey our instructions—then £300 was voted towards Mr. Bevitt's expenses in going out, I think in November—then his son Arthur Bevitt was appointed a director—then Mr. Rae attended and supported his claim for 1,000 shares—it was a bogus claim—he made a great noise, and threatened to ruin the company, and I persuaded the directors to let him have them, because neither he nor his solicitor knew that the agreement required to be filed, so he got the liability—he was "landed" with them, but there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was formerly the manager of the London and Provincial Bank, South Kensington branch—I established that branch in 1875, but I had been a bank manager twenty years before that—the directors desired, in consequence of the falling off of business, to reduce my salary in November, 1886, and I declined to remain—I did not hear of Higham Benjamin as one of the syndicate—F. Smith was one of the syndicate, or their nominee—we dealt with the syndicate as acting for the vendor—W. H. Penning, whose name appears on the prospectus as a director, and is described as a Fellow of the Geological Society, and late of H. M. Geological Survey, was the expert who gave a report on the mine—I was associated with him afterwards as a director; I did not know anything about the basis of his report—Penning constantly told Bevitt and myself he believed this was a highly valuable property—Penning and Smith professed to have been on the property—I never saw Fowler or Ivey, only their reports—I do not know if Ivey is a practical man; he is described as a practical miner of forty-two years' standing in Cornwall—Evelyn Smith had inspected the property—we sent out, in the first instance, the engineer, Fryer, and one other engineer, Mr. Nichol, who came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150030"/>
               <p>from Chesterfield, in reply to our advertisement—he had been tin or iron mining—after Nichol went out we had a number of cablegrams from him, no result followed, and we told him not to send cablegrams, we wanted something practical—my fellow directors and I came to a resolution to take proceedings against Fryer for not following the orders of his directors; his contract was to send a monthly account of his expenditure; he did not do so, and the solicitors were instructed to take proceedings—it was then arranged that our chairman, Mr. Bevitt, should go out—Mr. Bevitt could only listen to what Mr. Penning said, he had not been out to the property at the time—we honestly believed we were working on a substantial concern; not one director was of a different opinion; we always believed those cables till we did not get any result, and then it was resolved that Mr. Bevitt himself should go out—the title had first to be registered regularly in the Transvaal—we received this letter from F. J. Smith, recorded it, and acted on it—the stipulation at that time in the letter was £25,000 in cash and £25,000 in shares—it was the first company I had to do with, and it seemed to me quite reasonable to have the shares put in any names which the person entitled to them desired; but I had no previous experience of it—on 21st January, 1887, we returned the money to the two shareholders who had applied for the 700 shares—I find on February 3 an entry to the credit under the date represented of £8,850 in one item, and under the same date an exactly similar item of £3,850 made up in five sums to the credit, it appears, in one sum, to the debit in four sums which come exactly to £3,850, and exactly cover the entry on the other side, leaving it exactly as it was before either of those items appeared—the four sums are Florence Isobel Skeats, 850; Fanny Chamberlain, 1,000; Alfred I. Benjamin 1,000; and Alexander D. Barnard 1,000—I find in the cash-book, on March 9th, paid to J. Smith a cheque, £4,812 10s., and another cheque £1,500—I found on the other side the same amounts to Florence Isobel Skeats, Fanny Chamberlain, A. I. Benjamin, and A. D. Barnard, making £4,812, so that taking out those two figures the cash account would be exactly as it was before—the £4,812 and £3,850 made £8,662—the balance between the two sides on May 31st, 1887, is £1,013 6s. 7d.—the balance on the credit side is £14,513; deducting from that the £8,662 the cash balance would be less than £5,851, because several entries here would be cross entries—apart from those two sums coming from Barnard to help the company, I do not think there was any pretence for saying that from the public in application for shares a sum exceeding £6,000 was at any time received—the books accurately represent the transactions that took place, as far as I know; the secretary constantly brought them into the board-room for me to see, and our secretary was a very good bookkeeper too; they are perfectly correct—I do not remember seeing a report about the property from Mr. H. Benjamin—I saw he report of Mr. Fowler at the time; I do not remember the name, or recollect the contents of it now—the Ledophini, or what is called here Lenophine, was the farm in question. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 1883, <hi rend="italic">and only partly read</hi>)—I do not carry in my mind the details of any of the grants—Mr. Pennine's report was the one we principally relied on; he continued to entertain his views as to the prospects of the company, and influenced by his opinion I took the same sanguine view myself—I</p>

               <p>do not know the date when the first statutory meeting was held—all Fryer's reports and letters were written on very thin paper, letter size. (<hi rend="italic">Some of these were read</hi>)—I know what "trying by panning" means, some of the soil is placed on a tin basin with water, and washed, and the gold all falls to the bottom; it is only for the purpose of testing—we had sent out such machinery as our advisers said was necessary to work this mine—Mr. Nichol, who went out with Fryer, has no connection with the secretary; he happened to be of the same name—in addition to these reports we had a number of telegrams from him. (<hi rend="italic">Some of these were put in</hi>)—I placed the general body of shareholders in the same position as myself; I kept nothing back from them—there was not a large public subscription for shares j Mr. Penning went out to the Transvaal, but he did not get to the property on this occasion, but he says in his report that he had known it, and examined it before—we thought it necessary for Mr. Bevitt to go out, as Mr. Penning had not gone up there; he went out about November 18th, 1887, and the next general meeting was held on 22nd May, 1888, when we issued a balance-sheet, in which the amount expended on the mine appears.

(<hi rend="italic">The report to the shareholders at the second ordinary meeting of</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd May was partially read</hi>)—we had dismissed Fryer then—the Frankfort was a good property close by the Rae, and not the property described by Fryer; he wanted to buy that for his own purpose—Mr. Harry Marks had offered £5,000 for the reconstruction of the property, and the acquisition of the adjoining property; I think the secretary had a letter, he reported to us—I was present when he made the announcement—Mr. William Bevitt wrote home to us, both privately and officially, and I only knew from him that this was a valuable property—I had perfect confidence in his opinion—the Frankfort property was not acquired, because when the syndicate discovered that the Rae Company wanted it they asked a much larger sum; it was £11,000 or £12,000, and afterwards went up to £45,000, I think; that was one of the reasons that the matter went off—when the vendor showed it to me I said I thought he represented a syndicate—the voluntary winding-up was on May 22nd, 1888—our report refers to a special meeting, of which notice had been given, and which was held—this is it; I remember it being passed—the proposal for liquidation was proposed to the general body of shareholders, and accepted by the general body of shareholders, with a view to the reconstruction.</p>

I know nothing about bringing out mines—I see an enormous amount of them advertised—you could not bring a mine out without reports of this kind; that is part and parcel of every prospectus—I am a bank manager of experience—I was not in liquidation at the time, not till twelve months afterwards—as brother-in-law of Mr. Marks I read their prospectus carefully, and as a director of the company I was going to take part in managing—I very likely saw the estimate as to the earning of £28,000 from stamping alone, I do not remember now, it is three years ago—I was a director of the Criterion Gold Mining Company—I am not a director of any mine now—I have heard the engineers reports that have been read from the Transvaal—we had no hand in distributing</p>

               <p>them—the man sent had no instructions to report in any special way, he was to send a report and balance-sheet when he got there—I saw these favourable reports published in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> as they came home, and in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and every other paper—we published a balance-sheet in February—I thought the whole amount of the stamping machinery we purchased was £400; the £138 was for trial machinery in the balance-sheet published a year after the company was in existence—the plant and machinery was purchased for £138 17s. 4d, and we had then upon the spot stores of the value of £20, and a capital, after a year, of £538—that capital was not to earn the £28,000, because if the reports had been confirmed, and there had been gold there, we should have sent out larger machinery which would have done that—we saved the money because we did not get any verification of the reports—we could not possibly verify every matter before we put the matter before the public—in the balance-sheet there is a communication from Bevitt that an additional property could be secured, not without cost, but without cost to the shareholders; Mr. Marks offered to advance the money for the company to purchase it, because the reports Mr. Fryer sent home as to the Rae property were not verified, and it was disappointing—I think Mr. Marks owned shares in the company—I do not say that there is any trace of his doing so, you can see the book; I believe he had shares in his own name—I do not know the explanation of the entry of Florence Isabel Skeats, Fanny Chamberlain, Benjamin, and Barnard—it has nothing to do with book-keeping, the book-keeping balances, and it is perfectly in order—I do not know who Florence Skeats was, I never heard of her in my life, I cannot tell you whether there was any cheque for her £850—I made no inquiry of the secretary who she was—I made no inquiry about "Fanny Chamberlain, £1,000"—I do not know what Benjamin had to do with it, or Barnard; I never saw him—that makes up £3,850, and I signed a cheque to Frederick J. Smith, who I believed to be the vendor; it was due in payment of the property due to him, and we had to pay it because of our agreement—I did not ask where the money came from; I thought it was in payment for shares—I was asked if I could identify the people, and I could not—I do not know that this entry was a perfectly bogus transaction—I did not understand what was being done except what came before us officially—if Smith represented a syndicate I do not know why these people should be finding the money to pay, and the same answer will apply to the other questions where the four names appear together—at the time Smith was asking for his money these four people came on the scene with these cheques—I believe I saw the cheques—I do not know whether I saw Florence Skeats' cheque, or where she banked—I saw the cheque endorsed, and paid into the bank—I mean that there was a cheque of Fanny Chamberlain's paid into the bank; the pass-book shows that—I do not say that there were four cheques; there may have been three or five—I think we had a cheque from Barnard as broker; I do not think it was his money—the bankers' pass-book will show whether we drew more than one cheque; if it was only one cheque for £3,850 they would enter it as one cheque, and if there were more than one cheque they would enter it in detail—I made Smith's cheque for £3,850 out as a "bearer" cheque, and initialled the alteration from "order;" I believe we were asked to do so by Mr. Smith—I suppose we never bought any more</p>

               <p>machinery after the balance-sheet of February 7th—we never got anything out of the agricultural value of the property—as to the diamonds, a paper came, and it showed something had been in it, but when I opened the paper it seemed as though the letter had been tampered with on the way—this cheque for £3,850 went into Frank Barnard's account; he was not the vendor, but Smith was, at his office; I only knew that since I heard it this morning—I never saw Harry Marks at the meeting; it might have been through Ernest Smith that he offered the £5,000, or it might have been through the secretary—I do not know that the offer of £5,000 was made to prevent proceedings being taken, to relieve the promoters—I never attended any meeting of the liquidators—the Rae farm was sold; I do not know the price—it was sold for a breach of contract in not having the Frankfort, I believe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-called</hi>). I am in business alone as an auctioneer and surveyor—I know Mr. Marks—I am not connected with him in any way; I have known him about three years; I first heard of the Rae Mine by this advertisement—I did not know that it was going into liquidation till the meeting of May, 1888—I attended that meeting as a shareholder—I had acquired shares some time previously, about a month or two; I bought them through Mr. Barnard, 200—I don't know whether they were bought at under Is. a share, the books will tell; I can't tell who suggested that I should buy them, I thought they would rise in value; I can't say the exact sum I gave for them; I think it was more than Is. a share, I can't say whether it was less than 2s.; my business at that time was the same as now—I had no partner, I was by myself—I was appointed one of the liquidators at that meeting—I had not made any application to be made liquidator—the company appointed me—I don't think I was proposed by Mr. Snell, I think Mr. Marks, the chairman of the Maxim-Weston, proposed me—the books came into my possession, and I made an examination of them—I had been a liquidator before—I think the books were sent to my office after two or three applications, by Mr. Nichol, there was some little delay in sending them in consequence of Mr. Nichol's illness—I had the allotment book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the books will give you all the details, I cannot, from memory—a list of contributries was settled at the first meeting; Messrs. Snell and Son have it—the application forms are usually returned and put into a book, I believe that was done in the present case; as far as I remember, this is the book—there is an allotment to Fanny Chamberlain of 5,000 shares, for £250, to Florence Isobel Skeats of 4,257 shares, on a payment of £212 10s., the address given is, "The Hut, Adelaide Road, Surbiton," it does not show the date of payment, it is simply January, 1887, that is the banker's receipt; the next name is Alfred J. Benjamin, 40, St. John's Wood Road, Gentleman, £250 on 5,000 shares—then Alexander Donald Barnard, of Dunedin, New Zealand, £250 on 5,000 shares—I presume these to be genuine applications for shares—there is nothing to show that they are not real applications and real payments—when the allotment money is paid then the receipts are given—I have no document to show when the money was paid on these shares, I presume the books will show—the list of contributories would show what shares Florence Isobel Skeats held at the time of the liquida<lb/>tion;</p>

               <p>the transfer book would not show that, because probably at that time some of the transfers would not be posted—I can only tell you by the transfer book how these persons got rid of their shares—referring to the transfer book the first entry here is on the 1st September, Fanny Chamberlain; there are a series of transfers to different persons of 200 shares at various dates, until on 14th March, 1888, they are all gone—Fanny Chamberlain starts with 5,000 shares, and there are a series of transfers to Mr. Duke, Mr. Hall, Mr. Smith, Mr. Worthington, Mr. Sam James; 200 were got rid of altogether—then on 2nd September 580 are <hi rend="italic">unloaded</hi> to Trefall Twigg and others, and 90 to Michael Green; on 31st August 90 shares and 5 on 1st September; 500 to Mr. Wilkinson, and so on down to 4th October, 1887, when they were all gone—A. I. Benjamin starts with 5,160 shares, and he begins to transfer on 7th September, and by December, 1887, he transferred all but 250—afterwards he added 720, and then transferred 250 in May, 1888, leaving a balance of 120—there was a steady decrease in his shares from the commencement—Alexander Donald Barnard had 5,000 to start with; on 4th October, 1887, he transferred 2,000, and at the date of liquidation he had a balance of 50—he did not purchase any during that time—I had no idea there were any false entries in documents supplied to me as liquidator, such as applications for shares or transfers—I treated them all as genuine—I have now no knowledge of any false entries—I believed these were genuine applications for shares, and that the entry in the minute-book that 20,000 shares had been allotted was an honest entry—Agnes Mary Benjamin, Westbourne Square, appears by this book to have had 1,750 shares at the allotment in January, 1887—on 2nd September she transferred 1,750—those are the only shares she appears to have held; there is only the entry 1,750 on each side—Gertrude Lizzie Benjamin had 1,750, which she transferred on 27th July, 1887—Louisa Koch bad 100 shares, which she transferred in two lots of 50 each on January 11th and January 19th, 1888—I know that by the Companies' Acts an honest register has to be kept with true entries—Samuel Goodman Levy had 9,000 shares, numbered 6,001 to 15,000—I did not know he was an uncle of Harry Marks; I never saw him—he sold 250 shares in April, 1887, and sold till September, 1887, I think, when no shares stood to his credit—Dinah Sarah Cohen had 1,500 to stat with, numbered 15,001 to 16,500—she sold them—the first transfer was on August 4th, 1887—John William Clark, the sub-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, I only know by name—he had 250 shares, numbered 25,001 to 25,250, on April 27th, 1887—in January, 1888, he sold the 250—William Henry Penning had 250 on 20th January, 1887, and then a further 250 on 27th April—on 27th April, 1887, he sold 250, so that he bought and sold 250 on the same day—on February 29th, 1888, he appears to have transferred others—the numbers of the first 250 transferred were 25,001 to 25,250—the numbers of the second 250 were 6,001 to 6,250—Townsend Percy had 1,500, numbered 22,501 to 24,000, on 27th April, 1887—he got rid of them on August 24th, 1887—I do not know who he is—this list of contributories is the list of persons who were shareholders at the time of liquidation—if Marks was a shareholder in the ordinary way his name should be in this book or the other—he appears in share register No. 2 to be a shareholder—the date of registration of his shares is May 3rd, 1888—he got 500 then</p>

               <p>—the transfer will show what he gave for them—I cannot tell if he purchased shares a few weeks before the liquidation—I was appointed liquidator at the end of May or the beginning of June—the numbers of the first 500 shares Marks appears to have acquired are 60,589 to 61,088—I cannot tell who he purports to have acquired them from—they appear from the book to be from various persons; one is part of a number transferred by Mr. Hyde, others from Mr. Probert, Mr. Layton, Mr. Crofts, Henry Milward—they are various numbers, and do not run consecutively, 57,801, 58,821, 51,229, and so on—the 9,000 shares to Frederick John Smith are numbered 53,951 to 62,950—he is described as Frederick John Smith, of Island Cottage, Chiswick, not as Barnard's clerk—those shares are transferred to a variety of persons—the first transfer from him is to Frank Stewart Barnard 8,060 shares, and 30 shares to James Duncan Balfour on 15th December, 1887—small numbers are transferred to Morris Rosenheim—there are 19 small transfers of shares to other people—ultimately he disposed of the whole 9,000, 940 in small parcels and 8,060 in one parcel—Marks' first 25 shares were numbered 57,821 to 57,845; the next 50 were from 37,228; those are from different persons to Harry Marks; then 775 shares of various numbers, 59,124 to 59,128, 14,151 to 14,190, 14,298 to 14,277, 8,381 to 8,390, 21,301 to 21,340; then 50 shares, 35,568 to 35,617; and 200 shares, 63,546 to 63,730, and 56,381 to 56,695—25 are from Mr. Hyde, 50 from Mr. Probert, 175 from Mr. Lay ton, 50 from Mr. Cross, and 200 from Henry Milward—there were four transferors—62,000 shares were issued, I don't say to the public—I don't know if 27,441 were allotted at the meeting and 700 afterwards withdrawn—I had nothing to do with the history of the company—this list of contributories would show in whose possession the 62,000 were when the company went into liquidation—614 persons were holding shares at the time of liquidation—I don t know the number of original applications for shares—I see Arthur Cohen got some shares—Arthur Cohen had 5 and 495 shares on June 2nd, 1888; that is the date of the registration—it does not follow that he bought them after the liquidation; he bought them a little before 2nd June—15 shares came out of the name of Joseph Yellowly Watson, and were numbers 34,138 to 34,142; the date of the transfer is 23rd May, and the 495 shares came out of the same name on the same day, and are numbers 36,118 to 36,167, 24,301 to 24,350, 18,076 to 18,125, and 47,213 to 47,257—the book containing those transfers has been in my possession—I last saw it in the possession of Messrss, Snell, Son, and Greenip; I have not got it; there have been a variety of actions and other things in connection with this company, and they have had the books—Edwin John Churchouse, of 60, Almack. Road, Lower Clapton, had on 22nd December, 1887, 475 shares to his credit, and then he had 1,525, making 2,000 altogether—580 of those shares are transferred on 29th September, 1887, the date of registration being 5th January, 1888—at the date of liquidation he had 450 of the same lot—when I had conduct of the liquidation Mr. Marks, as a contributory, was entitled to be present at any meetings, and Arthur Cohen and Mr. Churchouse were too—I am not aware that Marks and Cohen attended any meetings—we had some examinations before the chief clerk, and as the result of those Messrs.

               <p>and the chief clerk ordered a meeting of creditors and contributories to be held—those meetings were held; these are the notices settled by the chief clerk for them—Snell, Son, and Greenip reported to us that they had received an offer from Messrs. Michael Abrahams and Co. to pay £5,000 to satisfy the debts, and make a return to the shareholders—I believe that offer was made after Mr. Frederick John Smith and Mr. Dawson Philpot had been examined—I don't know who the persons were offering the £5,000; it was reported to us the offer had been made; I only know it was connected with the promoters—I never had any means of ascertaining who it was, only that the promoters had offered it—I was told by Snell and Co., who were assured by Messrs. Abrahams, that it would be forthcoming, and it was; it came actually into their hands—apart from the shareholders we had claims from creditors of the company to a little over £2,000; they were sub sequently reduced by the chief clerk to about £900 or £1,000—when I was acting as liquidator I had no money to pay the creditors—the principal creditor was Mr. Fry, I think the late manager, the engineer—I had no means of satisfying the creditors; no means of paying them anything—a little over £100 was handed over to me as liquidator—there would not be much of that for the creditors—I do not know whether they ever got anything; we did not pay them anything—Mr. Fry and I acted together—this is the notice we issued in consequence of the communication from Messrs. Snell, Son, and Greenip—we also sent out a notice to the contributories, so that they might vote by proxy—upon that were forms for them to fill up; this notice is dated 26th May, 1890—the offer of £5,000 I communicated to the creditors as soon as the chief clerk had settled the notice—the liquidators appointed Messrs. Snell and Co. as solicitors—I had known them many years—I do not know who are the solicitors to the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>—this was the result of the meeting: The creditors accepted the offer unanimously, and 255 shareholders were present, either personally or by proxy; those shareholders represented 35,903 shares, and voting in favour of the proposition, there would be 242 shareholders holding 34,339, thirteen shareholders, holding 1,564 shares, voting against it, and I incorporated those figures in the affidavit to the Court—I don't think Marks was at the meeting; Arthur Cohen was—I don't know whether he had Marks' proxy—a shareholder would be entitled to vote to the extent of the number of shares he held—I think I remember Arthur Cohen being there, but I would not be certain—I cannot tell how much the people who voted paid for their shares; you can tell from this book—I resigned on 4th November, 1890—the £5,000 offer was accepted; it was paid to Messrs.

               <p>company were the secretary and Mr. Fry, who made a claim which I believed to be extravagant, and which was ultimately considerably cut down—there were claims for £2,000; we reduced them to about £9,000—the shares held in the names of Chamberlain, Skeats, Benjamin, etc., were, with a very small exception, disposed of before liquidation; I know it by the transfers—if Mr. Benjamin's shares were vendor's shares they would be fully paid up; so were others taken up by the public—all the shares dealt with at the date of liquidation were fully paid up shares; there was no liability attaching to them—I do not know the law requires where shares are issued as fully paid up, that in order to make the contract legal there must be a contract registered at Somerset House—that is a legal question—I do not know that this contract was registered at Somerset House—I attended the meeting in 1888; as far as I am aware Mr. Harry Marks had nothing to do with my nomination—as far as I know he is no relation or connection of Mr. Marks, the chairman of the Maxim-Weston Company—this company kept all the books, which are ordinarily kept in such companies; as far as I could judge they were very regularly kept; £75,000 was the company's nominal capital; there was a right to issue 75,000 shares—the total issued was 62,000—assuming that the shares allotted to, and afterwards dealt with, by Chamberlain, Skeats, Barnard, and the other were vendors' shares, I do not think there were more than about 30,000 issues to the public; I believe the prospectus gives the vendors 25,000; if you take 25,000 from 60,000, it would leave you 35,000, and then there is a further 9,000 to be deducted; that would be 24,000, and some returned applications which would bring it to about 23,000—the £5000 offer would leave 900 to the creditors, and something like 1s. 6d. per share; that would leave £1,400 for distribution—these shares, like all others, would fluctuate in the market—all mines are speculative to a large extent.</p>

               <p>22nd December, 1888—Snell and Greenip are the solicitors—I held 100 ordinary and 100 preference shares—I knew Marks was the editor—he has employed my firm to do legal work occasionally in company matters—I first saw him in reference to the Rae Mine about the middle of January, 1887, at the office of the paper, so far as I remember—he referred me to Slade and Co., solicitors, and asked whether my firm would act for a company that was about to be registered—I believe Slades were acting for Mr. Hume Webster—I do not think I saw Marks again till the company was registered—the directors appointed my firm as solicitors—I came in contact with all of them—the appointment might have been by minute, I cannot tell you; it might not have been in writing—we took the papers over from Slade and Co., and registered the company—I suppose at the instance of Marks—I attended the first meeting—I saw a print of the prospectus as solicitor—I cannot remember whether our name was then upon it; I did not prepare it—I do not know who had it printed; I never was informed—I naturally read it—I cannot remember names, it is three years ago—I have acted for several companies; not for Harry Marks before—if that is the original prospectus I saw the names of those who made reports—I have no idea who employed them—the next person I saw would be the vendor—I do not know who introduced me—I have known him four or five years on and off—not as Barnard's clerk—on the Stock Exchange—I did not require an introduction—I presume he came to my office; I should be sorry to say definitely, as the intending vendor of this property—my firm then did legal work for the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>—that is not entirely "being the solicitor"—I was not the only one—Mr. George Lew is did work for them—probably Smith mentioned Marks' name—I believed Smith was the nominee—he certainly was the vendor—"bogus" is a difficult word—I should call him the nominee of the vendor—I Knew nothing of his business—I cannot tell you how he came possessed of the mine except from the documents, which explain themselves—I understood he was under contract to purchase the property—I subsequently ascertained he did purchase it—by the documents—I do not know that he told me, but I saw the contract—I did not get him to sign it—the 13th January is the date—I was not present when he signed it—I examined the title—I had the abstract furnished me by Messrs. Vennings—I think it is here—I inspected the original documents, and compared them with the abstract—he purchased from Higham Benjamin—the actual assignment to Smith was February, 1887—the title deeds would be with Messrs. Vennings—I asserted Smith had the deed of transfer from Benjamin to himself—I believed it to be a genuine deed—I prepared the deed of transfer from Smith to the company upon the directors' instructions—this is the contract—I am attesting witness—I prepared it as a genuine document—I think I received instructions at a board meeting—I got knowledge from the prospectus—I had nothing to do with negotiating the price—drawing agreements is part of my education—the directors collectively or the secretary told me the terms—as Smith was represented by Eldred and Co., solicitors, I should see them—I do not know that Smith was paid for signing his name—I had no need to see him except to sign—the board told me the vendor had been pressing for payment—I believed them—it was not a sham—I suppose he pressed the directors through his principals—I cannot tell</p>

               <p>you who they were—I believed Smith was pressing when I prepared the second agreement—the instructions lay between Bevitt, Philpott, and another director—not Penning; I fancy he had left for South Africa—I did not think there was any <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> legal work after 1887, except libel actions, and that Mr. Lewis did—Snell also acted for them—I prepared the Churchouse agreement by instructions of the directors, probably Philpott and Bevitt—I understood at that time they were in want of money. (22<hi rend="italic">nd December</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">agreeing to issue</hi> 1,525 <hi rend="italic">shares for</hi> 475 <hi rend="italic">shares</hi>)—I did not see Churchouse with regard to the agreement—I did not take his signature—our firm also prepared the indentures assigning the property; we forwarded those out to the Transvaal; we had to see that they were properly registered I cannot tell you the price paid for the property—I saw Marks I fancy at the allotment meeting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. My father was admitted in 1834, and myself in 1880—I ascertained from Slades that the property had been offered for the purposes of bringing out a company to Hume Webster and Co.—I got the details from them, and the abstracts from Vennings—I saw the origin of this title was a grant by President Kruger to Higham Benjamin—it was a deed of concession, dated September, 1883—Vennings acted for Benjamin—they are solicitors for the Transvaal Government—I got the abstract from them—I inspected the original deeds at their office—there was no concealment of the fact that Smith was acting as nominee—that is the usual practice—I found there was an effective or "good marketable title"—then followed the contract transferring to Smith, and the deeds—I have not been concerned for Marks since—after Marks referred me to Slades, he had no relations with me on the matter—I had no more to do with the prospectus than to see that the law was complied with, for instance, to see that the contract was the contract referred to in the prospectus.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There was no concealment so far as I was concerned; nor the board—Smith told me he was a nominee—I do not call the agreements shams—I am aware of the 38th sec of the Act of 1887—I do not think the object of the agreements was fraud—the name of the nominee is put in for convenience—I cannot answer legal questions—I did not see Marks every day—he did not call at my office—I went to him occasionally.</p>

I was a director of the Rae Company—I did not know Smith was a sham vendor or nominee—it was brought to my knowledge that Smith had something to do with the vendor to the company, but in what capacity I do not know—I do not remember any explanation given to me—I had not been director of a gold mine before—I have since—I was an engineer in 1887—I applied to Mr. Webster to put me on the board of a company where I could be of service—when all was arranged he put me in communication with Harry Marks—I did not know Marks, nor his position—I first met him on the day of allotment—all steps were not taken before I was put in communication with Marks—I had perused the reports and everything before I would sanction my name being on the prospectus—Webster submitted them to me—he remained at the meeting only a few minutes—it was just an introduction to Marks, a shaking of hands and saying one was glad to make acquaintance—I was introduced to him as the promoter of the company—Penning, Bevitt, and Philpott were there—they were all</p>

               <p>strangers—I was nominated to the chair—it was my first experience of a gold mine—the allotment papers were put before us, and applications for shares—I think they were read out—Marks said there was a fair amount subscribed—that there were 27,000 applications was apparently the truth—I believed they were genuine—from the public—it struck me as singular that Skeats and Benjamin should apply for so many as 20,000—I had no suspicion—I believed they were paid for by genuine cheques—whether the applications came direct I am unable to say—I had my private opinion about it, but nothing tangible; I simply formed my own conclusion—I was suspicious with regard to the large allotment—I have no idea of the amount necessary to be subscribed—we should hardly go to allotment on 6,000 or 7,000—I attended the meetings—Captain Pearson came once—Philpott was generally there—and Penning—I usually took the chair—I was present at the first statutory meeting—I remember the prospectus being discussed, and suggestions of diamonds as well as gold—I kept my shares till I went to Africa, then transferred them to my son—I am not certain whether they were the 250 I bought; I held others—I sold no shares afterwards—I had bought 500 at 10s. and sold them for 7s. 6d.—I held 250 in addition to my 500—I required no assistance in composing my speech—I believed the reports to be genuine and true—the reports were sent to the papers in compliance with the request of the shareholders who wished to be furnished with news—I paid very little attention to the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> advice and answers to correspondents—I do not know here Penning is—he went from London whilst I was in Africa—I saw the property—I did not find any diamonds—I found a quarter of an ounce of gold in washing—I was there twelve days—I did not come back before the liquidation—I knew nothing of the additional 9,000 shares to go to the vendor in December, 1887—I brought my friends to apply for shares—I heard of the liquidation in Africa—there was on the ground a three-stamp battery, picks, shovels, bars, windlass, and sundry tools—I found a few Kaffirs and one man, all else had been discharged—perhaps nine or ten Kaffirs—the Kaffirs got 10s. or 15s. a month and their food; but prices have gone up—nothing worth speaking of was got out of the mine—there was plenty of work done to try and find the reefs or to develop the outcrop on the surface; there was a reef near the surface—there was one shaft 30ft. deep—the plant put at £130 was not intended to earn the £28,000 a year—it was simply a prospecting battery—the £20 of stores would be as bought in London, and worth double when they got to the far end—after the vendor's 50,000 shares there would be left, for buying machinery and stores, £25,000, if all the capital was subscribed—there were buildings—they were originally farm-houses—the property was sold by auction for between £600 and £700, as I learn from the papers—the law expenses took £500, and charges connected with promotion—except what was used for the battery the timber was left growing—no land was let to other companies—we dug a sluice for the water—we had no hydraulics—I did not see the Hill's Waterfall property—I knew Smith was pressing for money—by letter—I had no idea he was acting for Marks, or that he had £200 for signing papers in blank.</p>

               <p>whom he had put forward to apply for shares and pay for them, when he arranged to pay them back when the company was formed—Webster told me he had had the matter under consideration in reference to bringing out a company—I am both a mechanical and a mining engineer, and I thought I could form a judgment on the subject—all mining adventures are necessarily speculations—Penning held a high opinion of the property—he said he was acquainted with the property—I did not doubt it—I do not think Marks was at the allotment meeting more than half an hour—to the best of my belief Marks was entirely in the hands of the directors; it is possible he may have looked in; I have no recollection even of that—he never interfered with the management—it was finally resolved that I, having an interest in the company, should go out and report upon the property—I left England on the 4th November, 1887, and arrived on the property in February, 1888—my first cable would be about the 20th February, but you could not send a telegram direct, it had to go to Middleberg by post, which would occupy ten or twelve days—my letters would arrive here in April—up to the time of receiving reports from Fryer my confidence had not wavered—those were in June to September, 1887—Fryer never sent adverse reports till September—I went over the property and examined the various workings, took samples, and testing them found them not satisfactory, and concluded the property was not good, and so advised them at home—between twenty and thirty shafts had been sunk, one 30ft. in a 15ft. drive, without result—the reef went westward—I found the vein very thin—if I had gone, on the property in the first instance I should have formed a favourable opinion, judging from the outcrop—I would never take a property before it was worked—an honest man might be deceived—I was mining manager in the Dakota Company—I should only send out at first sufficient machinery to test—if the property justified it I should afterwards have sent out larger machinery—the Frankfort property was satisfactory; I so reported—I had no instructions to procure that for the Rae Company—the scheme for reconstruction and for acquiring that property was after it had passed out of my hands—I afterwards ascertained that Marks had offered £5,000 to acquire that property—the Frankfort people raised the price—the terms of payment were different—they were to receive so much cash, which was not forthcoming, and there was a breach of agreement, and that led to an action by the Frankfort against the Rae Company for breach of agreement—the original agreement contemplated a large payment down—I could have placed the property in the hands of the Rae Company, in the first instance, at a considerably lower price before it got into the hands of a syndicate—the Frankfort property proved to be better than ever it was reported to be—it was about ten or twelve miles from the Rae-r-in the same country—the sale of the Rae property was by Order of the Court, and, therefore, a forced sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The Frankfort bought the Rae for £650—it is always advisable to make experiments before purchase, but it is not always convenient, because of the distance away and the time in getting there—it does not strike me as curious to start examining a property after giving £50,000 for it—it is not my experience that these mines generally go into liquidation—it would not be possible to experiment before paying for the property—the</p>

               <p>vendor would not wait the time—there was no concealment that Marks was a promoter—no steps were taken to inform the shareholders of it—I have been engaged to look after the machinery in a brewery—to get the quarter of an ounce of gold cost my own labour in picking and fanning it—I took samples from different parts, then crushed and fanned it—its value was 17s. or 18s.—I also looked after the sinkings in different places and the fannings along the river—I did all I could to find gold—I could have acquired the Frankfort for £5,000 cash and 20,000 shares—I did acquire it at that price—for independent purposes—not for the Rae Company—250 shares qualified for a director—the directors were paid—and the solicitors and secretary—we had water power to work the stampers—the stampers were bought for £130 in London—it was only for prospecting—you can buy them from £80—I signed the agreement on behalf of the Rae Company with the Frankfort—I ordered the machinery from Applebys', London—it was quite adequate for testing purposes, for which it was bought—it would appear in the cash-book—I bought it about April, 1887.</p>

Yellowly Watson (a member of the Stock Exchange), William John Andrews, Mr. Jones, Mr. Posselthwaite, Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Green, etc.—a considerable number of shares were bought about the time of the meeting, two years before the £5,000 offer—the £5,000 originally offered was at the time of the liquidation; this £5,000 was only last year; £5,000 was offered on two occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had business relations with Mr. Penning in 1887—I described him as a leading expert in mining matters—he believes in the property down to this day; he has always protested it—he is a man of good reputation and a honourable man—in the standard work on the Goldfields he is referred to as one of the first, if not the first, to whom the discovery of the Transvaal Goldfields is due—he induced me in the first instance to take shares, and I took all my 1,050 shares on his inducement—at the meeting of 22nd May, 1888, there was a discussion about the acquisition of the Frankfort property—I knew it before the meeting by the report—by the report of the meeting you will see it was distinctly said to the shareholders that the Frankfort property was to be acquired for shares—at that time the Frankfort property was held out to be made over to the shareholders of the Rae for shares—there was no mention of £5,000 then; but in getting out the matter afterwards I found that part of the consideration was to be £5,000, and then I went to Mr. Penning, intending to find out what he meant, and he told me Mr. Harry Marks was one of the promoters of the Rae, and he was willing, finding how disastrously the thing went, to find £5,000, and then I immediately appreciated the position—that was all after June 7th, when my appointment as liquidator was confirmed—after that the cash which the owner of the Frankfort was willing to-receive went up—the owner's proposal was through the syndicate, and when the property got into the hands of the syndicate the price in cash and shares was materially raised, and the matter fell through—I dis<lb/>agreed—I was a party to it with Mr. Klenck; of course I took my share of the responsibility in declining the property—when this letter which has been read came before us in 1890, I was anxious it should be done in the interests of shareholders and creditors—the whole matter was relegated to the chief clerk, in. whose chambers the matter was going forward; there was no concealment of any kind with regard to it—the chief clerk declined to sanction the full release which was required, but he would have sanctioned the giving of a receipt—therefore with the sanction of the chief clerk the money might have been paid with a receipt only, but he would not sanction the full release required by the terms of the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The chief clerk raised no objection to our accepting money from Marks or anybody else, and giving a receipt but not a release—I believe this letter was read to him; I should not be surprised if I incorporated it in an affidavit—I did not hear him say that Mr. Justice Kay had better have the letter before him; I think not—Snell, Son, and Greenip had the £5,000—it went back to whatever source it came quite recently, since these proceedings, I think—I believe Mr.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Snell, Son, and Greenip—I am the solicitor who registered the second company called the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, it was a reconstruction of the first—that was the first time I acted for Mr. Marks—that is the only business the company, as a company, has ever had—I have not acted for them in other business—we were appointed solicitors to the liquidators in the Rae—I had known Mr. Klenck a long time; he appointed us solicitors—we have acted throughout the liquidation—I do not know that we have ever been brought into communication with Marks as promoter of the Rae—when we advised the liquidators to make inquiries as to the formation of the company, reconstruction having fallen through, we received instructions from the liquidators, and applied to the chief clerk for liberty to summon certain persons who were presumed to have knowledge of the affairs of the company, and we summoned Marks and Arthur Cohen, and all persons we thought could give information of the company—Marks did not attend—I do not think Cohen gave evidence; the matter went on a great many days—we intended to allege in proceedings to be taken that Marks and other persons were promoters of the company—I do not know whether we should have established that, I think we should—I never knew of any concealment that Marks was the promoter of the company—the examination was continued for a great many days, and was very expensive, and the liquidators did not feel inclined to go on with it until they saw their way to pay the expenses, and thereon we received an intimation from them to stop; we brought it before the chief clerk, and then we received the letter from Messrs. Michael Abrahams and Co.—we had before that had examinations before the chief clerk, and discovered that Messrs. Eccersley and Arthur Cohen were in the promotion of the company—we discovered Smith; he was examined—I advised the liquidators that the £5,000 offered should be brought before the chief clerk—he decided that a meeting of creditors and shareholders should be called, to say whether the offer should be accepted, and whether the creditors and shareholders would find money to go on with the proceedings—I do not think the matter came before Mr. Justice Fry; the chief clerk dealt with it himself—the transfer-book, produced this moment, had been mislaid; we gave our clerk instructions to look up all books and papers, and bring them here, aid only yesterday this was found in our housekeeper's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I thought it right to bring Mr. Michael Abrahams's offer before the chief clerk, and he decided that the opinion of the shareholders and creditors should be taken on it—I reported the result of the meeting to the chief clerk, and also that the shareholders decided at that meeting to raise funds to go on with the proceedings; that influenced the chief clerk to some extent—the result was he gave his sanction to have the money accepted, but declined to sanction any absolute release, which was one of the conditions—he said the liquidators might take the money, and give an ordinary receipt for it, which in my view would have been quite sufficient for the persons paying the money, and I am surprised they did not do it—there is machinery to compel the attendance of any person whom the liquidators require to be examined; we could and should have done it—I was not present, but my clerk</p>

               <p>informed me that Marks' solicitor attended in obedience to the summons, and asked that the examination of Marks should be adjourned—mean-while my clients gave me instructions to stop, and Marks was not examined—I explained at the meeting to the shareholders the position fully; that the parties alleged to be the promoters had been examined in Court, and in my opinion there was a case to some extent to be made out, but it would be at great expense—I did not say that the promoters had been examined; I placed the matter before them fully.</p>

               <p>to me was that she was thirty-two—I went to see her—alter that first visit I stayed for some time at the house—I paid other visits to the house—among other people there I saw a man named Louis Lehmann—the acquaintance was continued for that year—it was suggested she should give me a power of attorney—I was at her house one evening, and she told me 'she had had a quarrel with Dr. Mendes, who then held a power of attorney over the paper, which was the property of the Koppel estate—she complained of the way in which he had acted towards her, and asked if I would take charge of the paper—I agreed to do so, pro-vided I was given the same power as Dr. Mendes had—there was some conversation about terms, and I said nothing could be arranged until I had had an opportunity of looking into the paper and seeing what it was doing—she consented to the transfer of the power of attorney to me, and gave me the power of attorney at once—it was dated 29th November, 1878—Mr. Morris Goodheart was not present at the surrogate's office at the time the document was sworn and signed—the power of attorney was not signed there, those statements were absolutely false; Mr. Goodheart had nothing to do with the power of attorney—I proposed to investigate the affairs of the paper; I found that it had never paid, though Mr. Koppel had managed to eke out an existence by running it in connection with his business as an advertising canvasser—I thought that I might manage to make the paper pay, and continued to manage it experimentally during Decem-ber and the early part of January, without receiving payment or salary—I made myself acquainted with the monetary position of Koppel when he died—I found that he had died in debt to every one with whom he had relations, and that three months before his death he had given a bill of sale over the paper, in order to protect himself against judgments that were out against him—Mrs. Koppel told me herself that no rent was owing on the house she occupied—I never heard of the houses at Fordham and plots of which Koppel is said to have died possessed—I heard of two insurances, one of which was for 1,000 dols., of which 500 had already been anticipated by the widow, while the remaining 500 dols. were retained by the society until the majority of the eldest child—about November I became criminally intimate with Mrs. Koppel; her statement as to its being 19th November, 1878, is substantially accurate—that intimacy was never procured by any promise of marriage on my part—there is not one syllable of pretence for the suggestion that there was any talk of marriage then or at any other time—I from time to time visited her—it is not true that I lived under the same roof with her—I passed only two nights in my life under her roof; once in Fifty-eighth Street and once in Twenty-ninth Street—the intimacy was not of very much more frequent occur-rence than these two nights—in the early part of January, 1879, I told her that the paper could not exist if a salary was to be paid to the manager, and if she was to draw a revenue from it—I suggested that the best course would be to sell the paper, and I made her an offer, telling her to confer with her friends in order to see if she could get a better offer—a week or ten days later she told me that she had spoken to Mr. Funk, a friend of her husband, and to Mr. Volk, her husband's book-keeper, and that if she sold she must have at least half the money in cash at once—I agreed to pay half the money at once—I had to borrow it, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150054"/>
               <p>to the best of my recollection I paid half the money within four or five days of signing the bill of sale, which is dated 10th January, 1879—I drew 150 dols. of it from the office for which I was writing, and the balance of 350 dols. I borrowed from my friend Mr. Goodheart—on 18th January I paid over the money on the terms of this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the balance was secured by a promissory note, payable in twelve months—there are two signatures of Mrs. Koppel—the first is witnessed by John Yolk—this is a duplicate receipt for the same money—the promis-sory note was paid by instalments, as I happened to have it, and each payment was endorsed on the back of the note—I received back the pro-missory note on the last payment—I do not know what has become of it—I continued to manage the paper till the 8th October, 1879—so little did it pay that between the time I became proprietor in January and the time it ceased to exist I had to surrender such little type as I had in the office to pay the printers bill—after Mrs. Koppel's visit on 19th October, 1879, it came to an abrupt end—I sold what was left, which was prac-tically the subscription list or goodwill, to the publisher of a paper in Cincinnati, of a similar class, for 130 dols.—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated</hi>31<hi rend="italic">st December</hi>, 1878) is for 231 dols., in six payments to her—that is, I think, signed by Mrs. Koppel—this receipt (30<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1879) for 126 dols., in ten separate payments, is signed by her—in February, 1879, Mrs. Koppel was living in Twenty-ninth Street—she had removed there from Fifty-eighth Street—there is no truth in the charge against me that I had left her in Fifty-eighth Street to pay the rent of her lodgings—I was not in any way responsible—she had lived with her husband in Fifty-eighth Street—she had asked me about this flat in Fifty-ninth Street—at Twenty-ninth Street she made a communi-cation to me as to her condition—I think it was early in February, or late in January—I had very grave doubts about its truth, and at first I said very little about it, but later she reiterated it, although I was in doubt as to whether I was responsible for her condition, I intimated as much to her—I did not know whether it was possible for her to attach the blame to anyone else, and I told her she charged me with getting her into trouble, and at any rate I would see her through it—I gave her all the money I possibly could afford whenever she asked for any, and she asked for money every day—these are three receipts by Mrs. Koppel for sums amounting to 42 dols., between the 8th of February and the 17th March (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think I did give her money in April, but I cannot remember without reference—it is absolutely untrue that she never received any money from me in her life with the two exceptions she named, the ten dollars and the one dollar—the "black-edged" letters reached me, I should say, in the early part of 1879, but I have no means of ascertaining, as they are not dated—Mrs. Koppel gave the Lehmann letters to me about the time of our first intimacy—there is no truth in the allegation that I have stolen those letters—these are two receipts for rent paid by me, one in regard to Twenty-ninth Street, and the other in reference to St. Mark's Place. (<hi rend="italic">Produced, one dated January</hi>,1879, <hi rend="italic">and signed by Whitmark, and the other June</hi> 7th)—in New York rent is paid in advance, and it is so stipulated on the receipts—there is no truth in the statement that either at that time, or at any time, Mrs. Koppel went in the name of Marks, or was known as Mrs. Marks—every receipt was in the name of Mrs. Koppel—when I left New York in May,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150055"/>
               <p>1879, I told Mrs. Koppel I was going to visit my relations—she made no serious objection—I came over to London, but before my departure I made an arrangement with Mr. Goodheart as to what payments he was to make to Mrs. Koppel during my absence, and general instructions as to my business—to the best of my recollection Mrs. Koppel's rent was to be paid on the 1st of each month, and she was to have 12 dols. a week—those instructions were carried out; the receipts were produced by Mr. Goodheart—I came back to New York about the 27th or 28th of July—I went and saw Mrs. Koppel, and discovered to my great surprise that she had had a child during my absence—I learned that the child had been born within a week or ten days before my return—I said some-thing to the effect that it was remarkably quick work—I told her that I was very glad she was over her trouble, that I had kept my promise, and that now there must be an end to any intimacy between us—I also said that if I could befriend her in any way I would do so, but I would not resume intimate relations—she was correct in saying that from that time the intimacy was not resumed—she is not correct in saying that was the only visit—after I had made that announcement I had daily letters, telegrams, and messages to go and see her—she used to send the servant after me—I only went there two or three times, or perhaps three or four—I should add that I did go to her again after my first visit, and I think it was on the second occasion that I made the statement as to the intimacy between us—on the second occasion I paid Mrs. Koppel the last instalment due on the promissory note for 250 dollars, given in January, and for two or three days afterwards I was com-paratively unmolested—when those days were passed the same thing went on over and over again, every day and every night—I used to have two or three notes, couched in the terms of the note read, asking me to go and see her, and on one or two occasions assuring me of the purity of her intentions; there were telegrams sent to my office, and servants sent to me at any time of night, and when I wont to her I found there was nothing to be said or done, but that she had simply invited me to pay her a visit—I was constantly watched—on one occasion she wrote to me about a detective—I had my footsteps dogged, and on going home at night I found a servant on the doorstep—this went on for six or seven weeks—during that time I went to see her several times at St. Mark's Place—the last time I went there I found she had moved, or had been moved, on account of some disturbance in the house—that was about the middle of September—I had several letters from her at the office—on the 8th of October I received a letter from her of a very urgent character, in consequence of which I went to her house in Twelfth Street—I went alone, and asked what was the matter—she was very much excited, and told me that in the morning a man named Michael Marks, a lawyer's clerk, called and took her to the office of a lawyer named Spelman, and that there she had signed some papers about me, she did not know exactly what papers, charging me with ill-usage and stealing her hus-band's watch and jewellery, and cheating her out of her paper—I asked how in the name of fortune she could have done such a thing, and she gave me a very confused explanation, to the effect that Michael Marks was a friend of the landlord, and he had threatened her, and all sorts of things—I said, "You may do me great harm by this sort of thing," and she said she was very sorry, but she had been mad with me because I</p>

               <p>had not been to see her; but she did not want to do me any harm, and would do anything in her power to undo it—I then went to Mr. Good-heart, told him what had happened, and returned with him, when she repeated in detail what she had said to me, and finally she gave the same statement again, and, at Mr. Goodheart's dictation, I took down what she said in writing, word for word—Mr. Goodheart read oyer what was written sentence by sentence—after it was read over she signed it, and then stood up, raised her right hand, and swore that the statement was true—her signature was witnessed by Mr. Goodheart—after that I received two or three letters, of which I took no notice—I did not see her again until Saturday,. October 18th—to the best of my recollection I was at the office on that day—while I was seated at the desk the door flew open, and Mrs. Koppel, in a state of great excitement, rushed in with another woman in a state of equal excitement; she rushed into the office, using very violent language, drew from under her shawl or cloak, a big hammer, and began to smash the glass partitions; she lifted up a chair and threw it through the partition; it was a glass partition dividing our office from another—she also threw the ink bottles through the window—all the time she was shouting at the top of her voice in the most violent and abusive language—as soon as I could I left the office—Oswald and Volk, the two men in the office at the time, followed me very rapidly downstairs—I know nothing of her nailing up the door—she was acting like a lunatic—she was raving—very likely I did say she was insane—the scene was wit-nessed by twenty or thirty people who ran out of their offices in the building—f looked for a friend of mine that evening—I saw a legal friend next day—I made the affidavit before a police justice—the warrant was not executed until the following morning—I went to the police-court next morning—the matter was heard in the Magistrate's private room—Mrs. Koppel was committed to be examined by a physician to the Commissioners of Charities—she was examined by the physician on the-same day, and was released—the Magistrate sat at 10.30 or 11, and she was discharged about 4—there is no truth in her statement that at the time of her detention I entered the office of the paper and carried everything off, there was nothing left but splinters, except such books as were there, which I sent Mr. Volk to get the following day—I took my papers and sent the other papers to Mr. Goodheart for delivery to Mrs. Koppel—I never returned—I gave instructions to Volk to bring me my papers, and to take everything else over to Mr. Goodheart—I received information from Mr. Goodheart that an action had been com-menced, and that an order of Court to arrest had been issued—I put in bail, but I never was arrested—I remained in New York throughout the whole of 1880; always in New York itself—no action was brought against me in that year—on the 14th February, 1881, the suit was dismissed for want of prosecution—throughout 18801 was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mining News</hi> in New York—in 1881 I was editing a new edition of the paper called the <hi rend="italic">Financial Mining News</hi>—I traded as a mining broker, and was elected a member of the governing committee of the Mining Exchange, and also a member of the governing committee of the Oil Exchange—from October, 1879, down to June, 1883, I continued in New York, then I came to see my family in London—I returned to New York in August, and came again to London in September or the beginning of October, 1883</p>

               <p>—during the whole of that period no action was ever taken or threat-ened against me by Mrs. Koppel—no demand was made for the restitution of jewellery, or anything of that description—I have had no articles of jewellery in my possession belonging to Mr. Koppel, except a gold watch, a good deal worn, which Mrs. Koppel gave me in the early part of 1879; no part of that jewellery, so far as I am aware, had any existence—I never saw it; I never heard of it—my recol-lection is that in the early days of 1879, just before or after I had acquired, the paper, we were looking over some papers at Mrs. Koppel's place, which Mr. Koppel had left, when she took out this watch; I asked if it was Koppel's watch, she said, "Yes;" I said I should like to buy it as a keepsake of Koppel; she said she would not sell anything belonging to Koppel, she would give it to me—it was given to me at that time—the watch was worth between five and six pounds—it is untrue that I borrowed jewellery from Mrs. Koppel to attend a. Seligman dinner and make a good appearance, or that when pressed to return it I declared I had pawned it, and used the money to purchase flowers for a lady friend—I had the watch to the end of 1883 or after—there was an insurance in a Foresters' Lodge—it is not true that I took a cheque for a thousand dollars and afterwards collected the money, and when asked for the money said, "It is none of your business, I spent the money with other women at the Cafe Brunswick"—it is not true that I moved Mrs. Koppel's furniture to Twenty-ninth Street, nor that after a short residence she had to leave because of the non-payment of rent; it is disproved by the receipt for the rent for June—I told her at the time that the paper was not paying—I continued to pay money to her down to August—it is not true that after she had removed to St. Mark's Place I collected all the moneys due to the-newspaper, and went off to Europe; I did not go off till May—I do not know that the child, which was born during my absence, was a girl—it is not true that at my request it was named Alice, after my sister, I have-no sister who is called Alice—I have a sister who has three names, one of which is Alice—her names are Frances Alice Mary, but as a fact that sister is never called Alice in the family—there is no truth in the state-ment that I once sent her a dollar only—I have no recollection of any such transaction—it was not by me she was made the worse for liquor.</p>

It is not true that the proceeds of one of the insurances was invested in the paper to enlarge it, as Mrs. Koppel states, not when I was acquainted with the paper before I acquired it—I only knew of two insurances—Mrs. Koppel spoke of a third, and said that the proceeds had been realised and put in the paper; I knew nothing of that—I remember that one week during my connection with the paper, at what period I cannot tell, the type on the way to the press-rooms was pyed, and the paper did not come out that week—there never was a strike of the printers, and it is not true that Mrs. Koppel had to find the funds with which to pay them—it is not true, to my knowledge, that she drew 500 dole, from some lodge—the composition bills of the paper certainly came to less than 20 dols. a week; that was inclusive—500 dols. would be absolutely out of proportion to pay one week's wages—it was-not at my first visit to Mrs. Koppel, after my return from Europe in July,</p>

               <p>the last payment on the promissory note was made, it was early in August—at that time I called her attention to the fact that she had drawn all the money she had, and I gave her a statement showing what had been paid for her account, and to her, showing her that she had actually over-drawn the amount that was in the bank to her credit—I gave her a state-ment of the expenditure, and of the moneys that I had paid her for her-self under the power of attorney—at the first interview, when I told her that our relations hereafter would have to be of a different kind, I said I was quite prepared to put the child with somebody who would take care of it, but she refused; she laughed it off—at the second interview, when I called her attention to the state of her affairs, that the money that had come to her she had spent, I suggested she should see to some-thing for the future; I knew at the time that she had been engaged at a shop either before or after her connection with Mr. Koppel, and I suggested to her that she should see what she could do in the same line in which she had earned her living before; and she did after that write to me in one of her letters that she was working in a shop—I said yesterday that I was in New York during the whole of 1881, but I remember that I was in Europe about eight weeks in 1881; with that exception I was in New York the whole year—it is entirely untrue that I left New York because I had overdone it, or under any circumstances that were in the smallest degree reprehensible or discredit-able; I left New York in September or October, 1883, with the design of coming to London to start the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, and it was started in London on January 14th, 1884, by me and Colonel Macmurdo, who found the money, and I agreed to give him in return a half-interest in the paper, and I had the other half; I should say that of the original company only one half of the capital was issued, and that half was equally divided between Colonel Macmurdo and myself—the paper was con-ducted on those lines down to, I think, the end of 1888; I am not sure there was not a modification before that time—I should state the first name of the Publishing Company which owned the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> was the Union Publishing Company, I think—Mr. Guedella was a solicitor who had worked for Mr. Higham Benjamin, and who at that time was mortgagee of the Ledophini, afterwards called the Rae Mine; Mr. Guedella informed me that he had lent £5,000 on it—he was unable to get his money back, but he got the mortgage paid, and in addition to that he was at a heavy expense to pay the taxes on the property, amounting, as I understood, to £500 a year or thereabouts, and so he desired to sell the property so as to get back his money; he would be satisfied if he could do that—he had given Mr. H. Benjamin every oppor-tunity to dispose of the property, who had endeavoured to sell it to Mr. Hume Webster, but he would not take less than £20,000; Mr. Webster had it actually under offer at that time for £20,000; I entered into negotiations with Mr. Guedella about the matter, and it hung fire for some weeks—I inspected all the papers; some were given to me by Mr. Guedella, others I obtained from him, and others from Messrs. Slade and Monk, the solicitors to Mr. Hume Webster—I find here bound up, first the reports, and then the concession of the Ledo-phini or Rae property from President Krüger to Mr. Higham Benjamin—there is a map showing that the Ledophini adjoins the London Mine, and is the next mine but one to the Lisbon-Berlyn Mine,</p>

               <p>which was capitalised at over half a million—in our immediate neigh-bourhood there are the Transvaal Gold and Exploration Company capitalised at over £300,000 or £350,000; in the same district is also the Grasscrop, the property of the Balkis Company, capitalised at some-thing over half a million, to the best of my recollection; a very large sum I know—Mr. Penning was the first person I consulted; he had at that time the reputation of being the expert on Transvaal properties, and I made no definite reply to Mr. Guedella till I had seen Mr. Penning, and gone through the papers with him, whose view was that it was one of the best properties in the Transvaal; he told me he had been oyer it himself, he had tested it, and he believed it was as good a property as there was in that district; I asked him if he would pledge himself to that, and he said he would; I asked him if he would go on the board, he said he would, provided the capital was reasonable—apart from those reports to me, Mr. Penning had reported on this property independently and most favourably; he confirmed the most promising part of those reports—I did not impart what I had learnt with regard to the property to any of my business friends until I had seen Mr. Penning, and then I decided to take it up, and spoke to Mr. Eccersley about it, and asked him to join me in it, and he agreed to do so—he was at that time a member of the Joint Stock Association—I also spoke to Mr. Arthur Cohen, and asked him if he knew of any of his friends—he is one of the sub-editors of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>—he conferred with some of his friends—there was only one I knew, Mr. Wertheimer—he agreed to find the money for one portion of it, so Mr. Cohen informed me—I was to have a half, and each of the others a quarter—the property was bought from Mr. Higham Benjamin—I believe the document is in Mr. Snell's possession, either the original or the certified copy; it has not gone back to Pretoria—£2,800 was paid in cash, and £6,000 in shares, in addition to the other charges then existing on the property, which brought the total to about £10,300. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence</hi>)—the sale was made to a nominee, Mr. F. J. Smith, on benalf of myself and my associates—that is a very usual thing to do—I think you will find in nine out of ten companies, when more than one is interested in the property to be vended, all the parties so interested agree upon a nominee who shall represent their interest—the property having been sold to a nominee, steps were taken to sell to a company, a company to be formed for the purpose of working the mine—the same nominee was stated to be the vendor to the public of the property—I only selected Mr. Philpott as a director; Mr. Bevitt and Mr. Penning, to the best of my recollection, had both been spoken of at the time that the matter was in the hands of Mr. Hume Webster, and, to the best of my recollection, their names and that of the Hon. Edward Arundel were in the skeleton prospectus which I obtained from Messrs. Slade and Monk-Captain Pearson, who took the place of Mr. Arundel, was introduced to me by Mr. Hume Webster as willing to take Mr. Arundel's place—Mr. Philpott has been manager of a branch of one of the principal London banks; Mr. Bevitt had practical experience as a mining engineer; Mr. Pen-ning was the Mr. Penning who had so frequently reported about tins pro-perty, and who had expressed his willingness to go on the board—Messrs. Smith and Sons were only solicitors to the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> in the sense of having registered the company—this prospectus was issued with the map</p>

               <p>showing the position of the locality and its boundaries—the prospectus was approved by the directors—I showed it to Mr. Penning specially, but they all saw it before it was issued, and they all approved it—I checked the figures in it with Mr. Penning—a number of reports are referred to in it, and extracts from Penning's, Glenister's, Fowler's, Rickard Brothers', Ivey's, and Evelyn W. Smith's reports are set out—those reports were all before us for the preparation of the prospectus—I procured none of the reports myself; they had all been made before I ever heard of the property—at the date of the issue of the prospectus I believed in every statement contained in it—the capital, £75,000, was to leave a working capital of £25,000, one-third of the total—in the light of Mr. Penning's statement that was an adequate capital—the company was registered on 14th January, 1887, and the agreement of 13th January, 1887, under which the company was to pay the vendor £50,000, £25,000 in cash and £25,000 in shares, was registered—at that time that was the only agreement entered into by the company—that agreement was modified, as appears by the minutes of 20th January, 1887—the vendor in place of receiving £25,000 in cash was to receive £6,710 in cash, and the balance, £18,290, as and when, and in proportion as it should be received by the company, and there was an object in making that stipulation—the effect and object of it was that the vendor was to take £6,710 in cash and £18,290 in shares—under that modified arrangement the allotment was proceeded with—6,000 shares were handed over to the mortgagee or his nominees in addition to the £2,800 in cash; and something was paid over and above that for charges on the property—I know it was done—I did it myself as to the money, and the snares were transferred by my directions—the amount of shares was 1,000 and £500 cash—£2,800 in cash and £6,000 in shares were paid to the mortgagee, and £500 in cash and £1,000 in shares were paid for other charges—in all it was £3,000 in cash; it made a total of £10,300, I think—the applica-tions from the public were for between 6,000 and 7,000; subscriptions for 700 were withdrawn and the money returned—the total amount received from the public, in relation to the applications from the public from January, 1887, does not exceed £6,300—I was present at the allot-ment—the terms of application were Is. per share on application and 4s. on allotment, as I remember, and then there would be three further in-stalments, at intervals, of 5s. each—I am not sure whether the £6,000 includes or excludes the £700 eventually returned, the book at the allotment meeting would show it—there were applications from four persons, Miss Chamberlain, Miss Skeats, Mr. A. Benjamin, and Mr. A. D. Barnard, amounting to 19,250 shares; those applications came about thus: the amount of the public subscription being only between £6,000 and £7,000, and the contract with the vendor calling for 25,000, the vendor modified his agreement to the effect that he should receive the difference between the amount of the actual subscription and the amount to which he was entitled under his contract, as and when it might be received, and that it might be received the vendor, or rather the broker to the company, made applications in the names of the nominees for those shares, the effect being that instead of receiving that amount of cash the vendor received that extra number of shares in the place of cash; it was in part modifying the contract and reducing the cash price to less than £7,000,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150061"/>
               <p>and increasing the price in shares—the pass-book shows on the credit side that various cheques amounting to £3,850 have been paid in, and on the debit side there is a payment to Smith of £3,850—the date in both cases is February 3rd, 1887; the date is identical—on 10th March there is £4,812 on the credit side, and on the debit side £4,812; they are cross entries simply—this was done by the broker, Mr. Frank Barnard; I cannot say with my sanction, because I arranged what the proper course would be, and I always thought that the proper course would have been to formally modify the agreement by a further agreement; it would have been more regular, and the effect would have been the same—it was merely modified by letter—that was my original objection to it—the solicitor to the company, Mr. Smith, was consulted about it; and he advised upon it, and then this was done,' and I then made no further opposition to it—I do not know Miss Chamberlain or Miss Skeats or Mr. Alexander Donald Barnard—Alfred Benjamin is my brother-in-law—three out of the four were absolute strangers to me—out of the £6,710, which under the modified contract was to be given to the vendor, £4,500, in round figures, was actually paid—then there were the expenses of pro-motion, amounting to close on £2,000, which I bore on behalf of myself and my associates; the expenses of printing, advertising, brokerage, com-mission, and telegraphing to South Africa to ensure proper registration of the title, and so forth—under the circumstances it was not right that the leaderette of the 14th October, 1887, should have appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, but at the time it appeared I honestly believed in the truth of the statements contained in it—I have no recollection of the letter of 15th January, 1887, sent to Mr. White, it was not written by me; it is evidently signed by someone in my office—the initials "P. C," would be "per Cohen;" it might be Mr. Arthur Cohen—the body of the letter is not in his writing, but the signature is his, I have no doubt—I have no recollection of its being sent, but I have the responsibility of it; the statements in it were made in the full belief of their truth; I believed them at the time, and for some time afterwards, and it was known in the office that I had that belief, and letters addressed to the office were answered, that being known—to some of my correspondents throughout January, February, March and April, 1887, I did from time to time recommend the mine as a speculation; the term "mining invest-ment" may have been used, but I think the term contradicts itself, as any money put into a mine is not an investment but a speculation, the nature of the venture is itself so essentially speculative—I make the same answer as to my belief in their honesty and truth—down to that time all our reports were favourable, and everything was going on as well as could be wished—in July I copied into the <hi rend="italic">Financial, News</hi> a paragraph that had appeared in <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>, and down to the 4th July, 1887, my belief was unimpaired—the reports that came from Mr. Fryer far exceeded Mr; Penning's opinion—I know nothing about those reports; I never saw Fryer in my life, and he being on the spot I believed entirely the reports he sent—up to this time 19,250 shares were applied for—between April and December, 1887, other shares were put in the names of Agnes Benjamin, Gertrude Benjamin, Louisa Koch, and Goodman Levy—they were shares put into the names of nominees by the brokers to the company—they were shares belonging to the vendors—I don't think the 100 put into the name</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150062"/>
               <p>of Louisa Koch were vendors' shares, but as to the 9,000 in the name of Goodman Levy there is no doubt, and the same applies to Mr. Head; they were vendors' shares put in the name of Mr. Head, who is a friend of mine—he is independent, the son of the late Sir Francis Head—there were also 1,500 put in the name of Townsend Percy, who is a friend of mine, my New York correspondent—Miss Benjamin and Miss Gertrude Benjamin are no relations of mine—I do not know them—no doubt the shares held by them were part of the shares issued to Higham Benjamin, the mortgagee or the mortgagee's nominee, in payment of the property—up to this time, out of the 6,710 which I was to receive, I had received 4,500—in December there was in effect a further modification of the agreement, the balance of £2,000 odd remaining due to the vendors under their contract, and modified by the letter of January, was paid to them in shares calculated at the then market price, which was about 4s.—on 8th December, 1887, they had those shares in lieu of the money—I think, in November, Mr. Bevitt went out—I know nothing of a transaction on 22nd December, between the company and Mr. Churchouse—Mr. Bevitt took a considerable time to get to the property, and could not have communicated with this country till February, 1888; my recollection is we had no communication from Mr. Bevitt from the mine, even by cable, before the beginning of March—he could not have communicated, subsequent to his arrival, before the end of February—the notice in the <hi rend="italic">Financial New</hi> of 25th January, 1888, "We think the shares are a very good purchase. The company have sufficient working capital in hand, and a report is expected shortly from the chairman, who is now on the property," does not refer to the Rae, to the best of my knowledge—it is not my writing—I have formed my opinion that it did not refer to the Rae Mine from the fact that at that time I was not advising shares in the Rae Mine—every day the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> answers between one hundred and two hundred questions concerning all classes of securities, from railway debentures to half-crown mining shares, and from those answers these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) have been selected—assuming that this notice in answer to a correspondent does refer to the Rae, down to the date of its appearance on 25th January I had no reason to believe that the mine was other than sound—from the date of the receipt of Mr. Bevitt's first communication, whether at the end of February or the beginning of March, not a favourable word was said about the mine in the paper—there may have been a recommendation to then holders to join the proposed reorganisation; I think that is very possible, but I do not remember that—that was the outcome of a written recommendation sent by Mr. Bevitt, which reached this country about the beginning of May, 1888, the outline having been sent by cable—as I remember, Mr. Bevitt's unfavourable report was communicated to the shareholders at their next meeting on 22nd May, and a scheme of reorganisation was then discussed—before it was so discussed it had been under my consideration—Mr. Bevitt's proposition was as to the acquisition of the Frankfort property, which was near to, but not touching, the Rae property—the proposal emanated from him, and was first communicated by cable—I did not receive the communication direct from Mr. Bevitt; the first communication I had was from Mr. Nichol; the cash required and the whole particulars were given—it was a verbal communication from Mr. Nichol, being as I understood a translation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189012150063"/>
               <p>of the cable message in code from Mr. Bevitt—the sum in cash then re-quired for the acquisition of the property was £12,000, of which £5,000, to the best of my recollection, was to be paid down on the signing of the documents, and the balance was to be left to be paid out of the first pro-duct of the mine; that was the first proposal—I offered to find the-£5,000; I offered to take shares in the proposed new company at par to—the value of £5,000 to enable the company to acquire that property—the reorganisation scheme finally agreed to was that there should be formed a new company, to be called the Frankfort Company, and that it should have a capital of £100,000; out of that £100,000, £32,000 in shares were to be-issued for the redemption of the existing Rae shares, in the proportion of one new share for two old ones, 32 for 64—£42,000 was the price to be paid for the Frankfort Company, of which £12,000 was to be paid in cash and £30,000 in shares; then there would remain a balance of £26,000, which was to be reserved for future issue as working capital if required—I made the offer of £5,000 because I felt a responsibility in the matter; it was the only company I had recommended in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> in which I had a promoting interest, and I felt I was responsible for a great many people haying put their money into it, and it was only fair that I should make some offer to enable the rehabilita-tion of the company—undoubtedly I believed in the proposed rehabilita-tion—I am informed that the Frankfort is one of the best paying com-panies in the Transvaal—it has paid dividends—I was not present at the meeting of 22nd May; I only know how it fell through from what I heard at the time; while the communications were going on the price-was advanced—it evidently became known what was going on here, and it changed hands at once, and the terms were at once varied—£12,000 was demanded down at once before they would trade, and the negotia-tion fell through—in the early part of this year I attempted to reopen negotiations with Mr. Whitehead, one of the directors of the Frank-fort, who was in England; not on the old terms, because the property was proved of value, but on some terms in which the Rae shareholders would have had a benefit; the negotiations continued for some time, but in the result failed, and after that failure I made this offer, about April, of £5,000 for division among the creditors and shareholders of the Rae—I paid over a cheque for £5,000—the total out-side profit on the whole transaction, as near as I have been able to arrive-at it, made by the promoters of the Rae was not in excess of £11,000, of which I was entitled to half—my share would be between £5,000 and £6,000, of which £5,000 I offered absolutely for the purchase of the Frankfort, and handed over for the purpose of paying the creditors and! shareholders of the company—the net result to me at the present time is that I am between £6,000 and £7,000 a loser on the transaction, because I bought back between 30,000 and 40,000 shares of the Rae—I have, never refused to buy shares of any shareholder coming to me who has been on the register—I have refused to buy of any speculator on the market who has picked them up to trade on the scandal which has been caused in the matter, but I have never refused to buy shares from any legitimate shareholder, and I have bought at from 2s. a share of the-original allottees, and I have paid out in respect of such purchases over £10,000—I know of the Hill's Waterfall Mining Company as a property which is still believed to be of great value—I had nothing to do with the</p>

I was sworn on the Testament—any oath is binding on my conscience—I am not a Christian—I did not look at the Testament, it is immaterial, because when I take an oath I am bound by it—I have been accustomed for many years to take an oath by raising my hand—I do not know what is the ordinary way in which Jews are sworn—I have not been accustomed to see members of my faith sworn on the Old Testament, with the head covered; that is the exception—a Jew simply takes the Testament in his hand and kisses it, and swears to tell the truth; I have seen on some occasions the man taking the oath cover his head; I believe the Old Testament is used—the form of oath is of no importance to me; the fact of the oath is the essence—I did not say that I attach no importance to the taking of an oath on any Testament—if I take an oath, any oath is binding upon me—I have not said I know no difference between one form and the other—one form is not more bind-ing than another; when I swear in the name of God to tell the truth I tell it—I saw several copies of this pamphlet; I read it—no doubt I saw that it purported to be a copy of an article taken from the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi> of New York; I was aware that the publication had been procured by the pro-moters of the Harney Peak Company when I attacked it in 1887; I did not say by Mr. Grenfell—I knew it had appeared, and I took no proceed-ings against that newspaper—I was represented in New York by Town-send Percy at the time this appeared, and also by Mr. Goodheart, the solicitor and attorney—I instructed Mr. Goodheart to take such steps as he thought advisable—I think he informed me he had threatened that paper with an action—I knew Mr. Ashley Cole some years ago as a reporter in New York; I think very likely he knew me; I am not aware that he is, or ever was, the editor of that paper; I have only heard it; I do not know it as a fact—I do not think I have ever ascer-tained who the editor was of this paper which attacked me—I have no recollection of Mr. Goodheart saying to me that the proprietors of this paper said that it would be useless to attempt any bounce with them, because they knew my record well—I will swear that Mr. Goodheart never made any such statement to me—I did not take any proceedings for very good reasons, and I have not taken any proceedings against the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi>; it would be useless—the libel law is a dead letter in New York; I have never known a libel action there in thirteen years—I never tried to take any proceedings; I knew the law in New York, and I knew that it was impossible to procure a conviction for libel—I did not try; I was too well known to need to vindicate my character by refuting such charges as these; they did not affect my position and therefore it was useless to take action—I did not see the articles in the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Stats Zeitung—this</hi> article was not in the New York papers prior to the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi> having published this—I have not sug-gested that no paper in New York had published the matter contained in this article before December—I have published, with regard to Butter-field, comments on the verdict of a court taken from other papers—some of them were adverse to him, not all—the libels complained of by Butter-field in his action were extracts from an American paper; there was such an extract commenting on his company, not on himself personally—that was introduced into the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> as a comment on a public company—I glanced through the documents at the end of this pamphlet;</p>

               <p>I have since read them—I noticed there were enclosed in the pamphlet copies of the official documents; the warrants I had obtained from the magistrate, and an affidavit and other documents proving those docu-ments were genuine—I gave a proof to Mr. George Lewis, in this case, at least a month ago, just before one of the days the case was set down for trial—it was not written by myself—I have, on several occasions, dictated statements to Mr. Lewis's secretary I went to America at fifteen, alone—my father had friends in New Orleans, and I became a clerk in their house—I had taught here at a school, during a vacation at college, at Dr. Bidlake's, at Islington, only during the vacation—I had had no other business or employment—I went into a wholesale drug house in America; I stayed there till 1872, about a year; the name of the firm was E. J. Hart and Co.—part of the time I did their French and German correspondence, or assisted in it, and the rest of the time I was in the laboratory—from there I went to Texas—my first employment there was as a canvasser for sewing machines, and driver of a mule team for the sewing-machine agent—my next employ-ment was as managing editor of the <hi rend="italic">San Antonio Daily Express</hi>—that was during the Presidential campaign in the latter part of 1872—I next became a travelling correspondent for the <hi rend="italic">Galveston Bulletin</hi>—I continued that until I returned to New Orleans in March, 1873—in 1873 I joined the staff of the New Orleans <hi rend="italic">Picaune</hi>, and remained there till the latter part of 1873—I then went to New York with introductions from the editors I had served, and obtained a position on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi>, which I held till 1878—at the beginning, during the Carlist War, I assisted the foreign editor—after that I became the assistant night editor of the paper, and held that for about three years; as far as I re-member those were all the employments I was in till 1878—I made the acquaintance of Mr. Koppel, I think, in the early part of 1878—it may have been the latter part of 1877—I had known him for a long while as an advertising canvasser—I should think I first got employment from him in the latter part of 1877 or beginning of 1878—that employment was to write a certain amount per week at a certain price—this paper, the <hi rend="italic">Reformer and Jewish Times</hi>, was not a financial paper in any way; it was a paper circulating among the Jewish community there, partly printed in German, only an eight-page paper, a small paper published weekly; I think I was paid by space there—I saw Mr. Koppel frequently—I cannot say he was a personal friend of mine—I was not on terms of friendship with him—I knew him very well in a business way—I had never been intimate with him—I saw him—I did not represent to him that I was in great distress—I did not, to my recollection, represent to him that I had had employment upon papers in England—I swear that I never made any such statement to Koppel, when I got that employment, as that I had been employed on papers in England, or mention the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> as a paper I had been connected with—I have a recollection of making some such statement—I have never said in London that any young man who has got courage enough can get employment by telling a few lies—I never told any editor I had been in the employment of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—when in 1872, at the age of seventeen, I was looking for work in Texas, I thought myself competent to fill a post on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">San Antonio Express—when</hi> I saw the manager he thought I was too young for the position, and I did then tell him that I had had experience on the London</p>

C. Koppel and Co., not under the power of attorney, but as the proprietor of the paper I was trading as L. C. Koppel and Co.—at the time that this was discussed, the question of this woman selling all the interest that her husband had left her; John Yolk was present; he was a bookkeeper; there was a conversation before the signature; she made known to Yolk what she was doing—I explained this bill of sale to her; she knew it as well as I did; I know she understood she was selling the paper for a sum of money, and that she accepted that money—150 dols. was what I had from the newspapers—I borrowed the rest from Mr. Goodheart—he did not come upon the scene—that was the first time I had brought Goodheart in connection with Mrs. Koppel—I had not had his assistance with the power of attorney on the bill of sale—Goodheart lent me the money within a day of the time I paid it—to the best of my recollection it was an open cheque—I think I cashed it, I cannot swear—I gave it to her in the office—I gave her bills; bank bills: a sort of bank notes, greenbacks, in fact; it might have been in 50 or 100 dols. bills—I don't know if there is any way of tracing these in any way—it is my belief Volk saw me hand it—he was present in the room where the transaction took place, and witnessed her signature to the bill—I gaveher a promissory note—I fancy I got the form from promissory notes in theoffice; blank forms; but I cannot say from my recollection where I got the bill—I drew it up—the drawing up of promissory notes is not a very difficult thing—I desired to do everything in proper form according to</p>

Do love me a little, Harry,")—I do not recollect if that letter was written after I had got her to sign the bill of sale: "Please do not quarrel with me, for I am sick"—I did not attach any significance to that, nor do I now understand the reference—"sick" in America is a general term for any illness—I have other letters of hers—she gave me Lehman's letters in Fifty-eighth Street—I chaffed her about Lehman—I never received her insurance moneys—a cheque for the Foresters' money was sent to her, endorsed by her, and paid to her account; I think in the Broadway National Bank—I deposited the money there under the power of attorney, as trustee or attorney, the early part of 1879—I drew cheques in the same way—the money did not always come into my possession, I sometimes gave cheques to her—I had not an account there, it was an account of the estate—I saw the pass-book some days before the scene in 1879; also on the day before I saw the books, including a rough book for advertisements and answers for subscribers, and a rough cash-book—the money I got to come to England was money I had saved for months—I had not repaid Mr. Goodheart—I have now—the last instalment was in the early part of 1881—I worked for the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Times</hi>, and many other papers—I got from thirty to forty dollars a week—thirty dollars was all I needed to save—I left in May—I do not remember the vessel—I never crossed in the <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>—I travelled as Mr. Henry, because I did not want Mrs. Koppel to come to the docks and make a scene—I did it to prevent her from discovering, as she endeavoured to discover by going round to the steamship offices, which ship I was going to sail in—I have not learnt that you can take a passage on board—I never was arrested for debt in my life—I have never been arrested, except what is technically called an arrest, through the action of Mrs. Koppel; and upon two occasions I have been summoned for assault—on the first occasion the summons was dismissed,: and on the other occasion I was fined ten dollars for the assault—the</p>

Volk in the Court; I did not want another scene—I was at the police-court on the morning of the next day—I knew that she had friends there—the matter was fully reported with most sensational headings—I learned journalism there.</p>

After the Saturday afternoon, when I had sworn that Mrs. Koppel was insane, to the best of my recollection I never returned to the office—the paper never appeared again; that was the death of the paper—I charged her simply with insanity, no other charge—I took no steps with regard to the damage done to my property—from that time I did not give her any money—I never made her any recompense for having charged her with insanity; she at once commenced an action against me for false arrest, claiming damages—after that, for two years she failed to prosecute the action—I made application to dismiss it in 1881, through Mr. Goodheart—her father was security for her in that prosecution, and swore he was worth at least £500, and was a householder—it would only have cost her 3 1/2 dollars (14s.) to bring the case to trial, that being the Court fees—she did not require the services of a solicitor or counsel, if her case wastrue—I had a solicitor to appear for me, and she had a solicitor to appear for her; Mr. Spelman appeared for her—I made no offer as to the child after that I have mentioned in August; I made no provision after the attempt to lock her up; the action was then pending against me—I did not know that the birth of the child was registered in my name—I don't know that it is the practice in America for the doctor to register the birth of a child—I never knew in July that it was registered in my name; I never knew it till I heard it read out in this Court; that was the first I ever heard of it—I never saw the child—I heard that it was brought to my house, but not to my knowledge—I did not send my landlady with it to the Commissioners or Charity, or what is equivalent to the Foundling Hospital—I have no personal knowledge of what became of it—I was told it was left in the street opposite the house—I have done nothing to provide for it—after the paper ceased I and a man named Volk started a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Beer Glass</hi>, and advocated the use of temperance in drink—it advocated the use of beer instead of other alcoholic drinks—I was connected with it as long as it lived, and that was a very short time—I was then connected with a paper first called the <hi rend="italic">Postal Card</hi>, afterwards changed to the <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi>

I had endeavoured to find the money from other sources, and had failed—I did not endeavour to borrow it, I tried to find somebody to supply capital to establish a paper which I thought would pay; I wanted some one to believe in the project as much as I did, and who would find the money in return for my doing the work, for my experience—I am not aware that Colonel Macmurdo had any paper at that time—the first amount he found was £1,000—when it was started it was the <hi rend="italic">Financial and Mining News;</hi> I think that continued about a year, from January, 1884, to January, 1885; the word <hi rend="italic">Mining</hi> was then dropped, and it became the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> about that time—I was in part proprietor of it from the day of its existence, and the original capital was £50,000—it was turned into a company when it first came into existence—I do not remember when it was reconstructed, my impression is there was no reconstruction till 1888—the capital was not enlarged till I had acquired control, that was in the latter part of 1888—during 1885 and 1886 the paper was</p>

               <p>being printed by Messrs. Head and Marks—I do not think they were continually pressing me for payment of their bill—I swear they never pressed me for their bill; Colonel Macmurdo had guaranteed all payments; they may have pressed him—I did not know that acceptances and cheques were given and dishonoured—I think I knew the position of the paper—I did not know Colonel Macmurdo's secretary, Mr. Bosdett—I knew Buckland, the clerk, from seeing him in Colonel Macmurdo's office—to my recollection I never sent to Colonel Macmurdo for £3 to keep the bailiffs out; I think it extremely doubtful—I have seen Mr. Bosdett in the box—I knew the colonel had a shorthand writer, named Buckland—I made the acquaintance of Arthur Cohen the day after the paper started, he came to me with a letter of introduction; I employed him as a shorthand writer, paying him a salary; he is paid a salary now, either £6 or £7 a week, and he has commission on all orders he gets, a very considerable commission—my recollection is he commenced with a salary of two guineas a week—it is not within my knowledge that he has made a large fortune in the last three or four years; I should be very much surprised to hear it—I last saw him about three weeks ago, in bed, at his house—he became ill about a week or ten days before that, I should think—I do not know of his buying a 1,200 guinea picture, not in my presence—I believe he is recovering very slowly, he has had congestion of the lungs, and has been dangerously ill—I do not know whether he is well enough to be out in the evening—I have had actual control of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> since about the middle of 1888—it was started in the interest of shareholders and investors, to give honest advice, to protect the public from doubtful companies, to criticism prospectuses, and, amongst other objects, to see that companies did not go into allotment with insufficient capital—I take the responsibility of everything that appears in that paper—I know the article that appeared in the paper the day after the Butterfield verdict—I have heard the extract read from it, in which I say that telling the truth is a fixed habit with me, and I do not mind the expense I may be put to in protecting the public from doubtful schemes—I have some knowledge with regard to company matters, I have considerable knowledge; and a great knowledge of what are called "wild cat" schemes; that is my own word—it is a common expression in America—there is an enormous number of mining companies in liquidation, something like a capital representing ten millions—during the trial of the Butterfield case I remember Sir Charles Russell examining me on that subject, and I remember giving the figures—I first had a banking account of my own in Galveston, Texas and in England within a month or two of my arrival in 1883; that was at the Kensington branch of the London and Provincial Bank—at the beginning of 1887 my account was at the Alliance Bank—a Mr. Barnard acted for me as broker—I had many brokers; I think Mr. Barnard was the largest operator for me—I think my wife had a housekeeping account at the London and South Western Bank; I think I had no other myself—the Rae matter was first introduced to me by Mr. Guedella; I afterwards saw Mr. Hume Webster—the prospectus had been got out in skeleton before I had anything to do with it, to the best of my recollection—of course, in the interests of the public I should examine it critically; I should think</p>

               <p>more so in the case of a company I was going to promote than in any other company—I did examine it critically and carefully—at that time there were not anything like the number of mining companies in liquidation that there are now—I had some knowledge of the value to be attached to the reports of mining engineers—Mr. Penning was not a personal friend of mine; I knew him by reputation; I had never met him till I sent for him to come and talk about this—I believe he is now on the expedition of the British South African Chartered Company—I did not know any of the other persons personally who had made reports—Mr. Penning assured me that he had made the proper inquiries at the place, and I believed his statements—I believed the statement that it would be possible to earn an income from crushing alone of £28,000 a year; the calculation showed it—I believed it from the information he gave me, and from the reports of the other experts who had reported upon it—it was my view that the Transvaal properties owned in England had failed to realise the expectations; it was notorious that they had, and the cause assigned was excessive capital—I also believed that, apart from the £28,000 a year, it would be possible to earn dividends from other sources, by hydraulicing, and letting it out on tribute work—I think the first person I saw with regard to launching the company was Mr. Hume Webster to get the papers from him; I came in contact with Mr. Penning with regard to actually bringing it out—I introduced Arthur Cohen to it as soon as I decided to take it up; he was not a clerk then; he was then one of the sub-editors of the paper—I do not know what he was being paid—I invited him to see whether he could get his friends to take sufficient interest in the scheme—he and his friends were to be jointly interested with me in the promotion of the company—I do not know what the sum was that he found; he got some from a man called Wertheimer—I have heard there is an action pending against Arthur Cohen with regard to the matter—Mr. Eccersley was also interested in the matter to the extent of a quarter; to the best of my recollection he was to have a quarter, Arthur Cohen a quarter, and I a half—my brother-in law Charles Dawson Philpott was the only director I knew personally at that time—I did not know Pearson personally—I never remember Mr. Webster using such an expression as that after the matter had left his hands he would have nothing to do with it; that he would wash his hands of it—he took no interest in the matter—I believe he promotes a good many companies; he did not promote this one—I think I saw Mr. Bevitt and Captain Pearson before the meeting for allotment, I am not sure—Mr. Bevitt is very likely accurate in saying that the first time he saw me was at the meeting, when I was introduced to him as the promoter, I do not remember definitely—I say it was a perfectly honest company—it is the usual way in which companies of this character are promoted and brought out, the usual way in which mining companies are promoted; it is the customary way—according to my view it was brought out in a legitimate way; nothing to be ashamed of—it is the mode adopted by other companies; it is the practice that there should be a nominee vendor in a legitimate promotion, the almost universal practice, the practice in all great companies—it is immaterial whether the vendor is a man of straw or a man of substance; he only acts as trustee, that is all—he is to be treated as a principal up to a certain point; his signature is to be recognised as that of a nominal vendor who stands</p>

               <p>within the relation of trustee to the actual vendors behind him; it was the same as Allsopps, Guinness, and every great company—it is not customary to disclose the fact that he is a nominee—the object of every prospectus is to induce the public to subscribe the capital asked for—if I had disclosed myself as vendor the capital might have been subscribed at once; but it was not the custom—I should not depart from custom in this case—I should think it would be a very irregular, and a very injudicious thing for the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> to put himself forward as vendor; if I had done so it might have surprised people very much—I don't know that it would have been a very startling thing—it does not matter who is the vendor, provided the shareholders are not injured by the choice of a nominal vendor—I don't think an omnibus conductor would do, I think you should select a man conversant with honest business matters—an omnibus conductor is not a man experienced in business matters; not accustomed to the duties of a trustee—he hasto read through documents, and make himself acquainted with the contents, and to sign them—in some instances Smith says he signed blank papers, they were not papers conveying the property—he was to study the documents put before him, to the extent of understanding their contents, that he might safely attach his signature to them—in no case were the shareholders to have any remedy against him—it was not material that they should know who the vendor was; they did not buy in the name of Smith—there is no responbility against the vendor—the directors may recover against the vendor, and the shareholders may recover as against the directors—I only knew Mr. Smith as an acquaintance of Mr. Barnard; I did not know he was a clerk; I had no knowledge of what his position was, pecuniary or otherwise; the introduction of Mr. Barnard was sufficient; I should accept any statement of his—I don't remember whether Smith asked to be employed as secretary—I don't remember whether I said he could not be secretary, but he might be vendor; yes, I told him he might be vendor; that is trustee for the vendor—I don't remember coming to any terms—I don't remember making any offer; I cannot say that I did or did not—in nine cases out of ten a vendor is a nominee—£200 would not be for writing his name; it is for giving his daily attention to documents, reading documents, and acting as trustee—my knowledge of his capacity was derived from what Barnard wrote to me, and his conversation with me; he said he had been in the City, and his general capacity was displayed in his conversation; I thought he was capable of acting as vendor trustee—I then got the prospectus out; it was printed by my printers—same of the prospectuses were brought to my office; some of them were addressed from there; very likely by my clerks—I don't know how many prospectuses were sent out, only 20,000 were printed—I selected Frank Barnard as the stockbroker—I only know from hearsay where he is—I know he gave evidence on commission in the Maxim-Weston case about two months ago, and he said he was about to leave England—I have heard he was in the South of France, where he goes every winter—there was nobody whom I was brought personally in contact with except Frank Barnard—I did not keep any books showing any record of my stock, etc., transactions with him—I keep my contracts up to a certain time, till they are closed—if the original capital asked for had been subscribed I should have had £25,000, and there would have been</p>

               <p>£25,000 for the working capital, that would have been sufficient, more than the average proportion—I had it advertised, and advertised it in my own paper—I was desirous of getting the £25,000 in cash, if possible—I believe Mr. Eccersley is now in Greece, building a railway—the day after the prospectus was issued I had a leaderette in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News;</hi> it would be in the leaderette column.

The property has been favourably reported on by authorities of undoubted responsibility, including one member of the Board of Directors, who has personally visited and examined it. The capital has been fixed at a very moderate figure, and ample provision has been made for working capital. Under such conditions the Rae has every element of success, and we believe that its shares will prove a very safe and remunerative investment. Judging by the demand for shares which existed yesterday afternoon, already they are likely to prove a good speculation as well")—I thought that; I wrote that four years ago; I should not write it now—it was true; there was a demand for shares—I do not know that there is such a thing as making a fraudulent market in shares—it would be very difficult to say what a fraudulent market is—four years ago, when the mining boom was on, it was the almost invariable custom, when a new mine came out, for shares to be bought at a premium by people who did not apply to the company, but who would instruct a broker to buy them at £ premium, with a view of getting out at £ or I advance—it was the same as buying shares, and selling them, never having had them; they buy them for a rise, or sell them for a fall, bulling and bearing them—you can deal in shares without their coming into your possession, as with any other kind of shares, Government shares, and railway stock—it was reported to me that there was a demand for these shares—if the public had believed the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> they would have made £1,000 where they have lost £10—I was desirous that the public should contribute to the mine—I think such a leaderette as this was calculated to influence the public mind—it was for that purpose it was published—I have advised the public as to the purchase of shares for the last few years, at the rate of two hundred a day, on all classes of securities—I do not have lithographed letters prepared for that purpose—I saw the letter to Mr. White in this case; it was not lithographed, but it is lithographed in the pamphlet—I keep no record of the letters I send out to subscribers; as far as I know this was not one of a number—I think the body of it is in the writing of a clerk in the office, named Hilton—it is written in ink by a pen, not by any machine—I have only heard of two of those letters being sent out, and I think if I had sent any more I should have heard of them by now—I see a very small proportion of the letters that are sent out—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was not a specially prepared letter—I do not know who composed this letter, "Referring to your inquiries for a good mining investment, etc" (<hi rend="italic">Recommending the Roe Mine</hi>)—it was very likely written from general instructions in the office; it is practically a paraphrase of the leaderette there is a fee of 5s. for every fetter</p>

Graham at my house last Wednesday night—he came and said, "I have been served with a subpaena; I suppose they want me to prove that I have bought Rae shares for you; shall I appear?'—I said, "You can do as you please; when did you get the subpoena?"—he described the manner in which it was left, and I said, "It is not a legal service, and you need not attend unless you wish"—I did not tell him to keep out of the way—I did not tell him I would indemnify him from anything arising out of his subpoena—I did not tell him there were many others in the same position, and who would not appear—I know Robert Phillips Noah—I did start another paper named the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi>—it was afterwards merged into the <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi>, of which I am part proprietor—Noah, I think, was employed as managing editor or news.</p>

               <p>the promotion of the Maclennan, or Hill's Waterfall Company—in relation to any of the companies, or to any company, there is no ground for suggesting that I directly or indirectly received money for blackmail—Noah was dismissed from my service—in relation to the Ashley Bottle Company Mr. Myers, solicitor, publicly stated that I had had money from Cottam; he said it at a meeting of the shareholders, and I quoted the statement in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, and said that Myers lied—Myers brought an action before the late Baron Huddleston and a special jury; the jury found a verdict for Myers, with one farthing damages, and Myers was ordered to pay his own costs—I have never in any paper under my control attacked private character I have had brought against me twenty-three actions in seven years; I have never lost one case, with the exception stated; I settled one by a payment of ten guineas out of Court, and the others have been in my favour or withdrawn—my father is the Rev. Mr. Marks—he is the leader of the Jewish Reformed Church section, and has been for forty-nine years—he gave me a good education—from fourteen or fifteen I have earned my own living, receiving no assistance except one loan of £500—up to September, 1883, I spent practically my earlier years in America; principally in connection with journalism—my career in America can be followed through journals there, absolutely, from 1872 to 1883—except this story as to Mrs. Koppel there is not one thing in that record of which I am ashamed—I have never by any one been charged with any offence, or fraud, or anything dishonouring to a man anywhere—this is Koppel's bill of sale of 1st April, 1878, three months before his death—it is his writing—Mr. Guedella told me the Rae papers were with Hume Webster—he said he had advanced £5,000 to Higham Benjamin on the property—afterwards I was put in communication with Penning—Penning had at one time 500 shares—after discussing the matter and reading the reports, I believed the adventure offered a fair and reasonable prospect of success—the prospectus is based upon an estimate that so much will be produced—the transfer was to F. J. Smith—the ownership was vested in him—a prospectus only states who the promoters are in cases where the vendor alleges he himself is the promoter—where paid-up shares are issued under a registered contract it does not matter in whose name the shares are put; it makes no difference in the liability of ordinary shares—these snares were issued to the vendor as part of the price of the property transferred to the Company—the shares I bought back were from persons whose names were on the books of the Company, and not in the hands of speculators—as a result of my connection with the Rae Company I have lost between £6,000 and £7,000—the secretary sent us communications from Fryer in the usual manner for publication—they were published—I had no reason to doubt the statements in the prospectus—until I had seen Bevitt's report I did not suggest the purchase of Rae shares—that was about March—I did not seek to help the shares off—Bevitt strongly recommended the purchase of the Frankfort, with a view to the reconstruction of the Rae—from that time I had bought and not sold shares—I offered £5,000 in aid of reconstruction before the resolutions were submitted to the meeting—I renewed the offer when the matter was being wound up in April last, for the benefit of the creditors and shareholders—I did not</p>

               <p>seek to influence the selection of liquidators—I held or influenced less than half the 34,000 shares, for, although I bought in all directions, many were without proxies, merely transfers—after my intimation to cease connection with Mrs. Koppel I was inundated with letters, and soon I found this annoyance an intolerable nuisance—I did not see the documents relating to the Koppel case from October, 1879, till after 1887—they were in New York—alter the publication of the libel in the <hi rend="italic">Press</hi> I wrote to my solicitor for all papers bearing on my career in New York—among them I found the papers produced—Judge Smith was a son of the Recorder of New York—Montagu Marks came to my office and abused me, I ordered him out: he refused, and I put him out—Benjamin was Barnard's clerk—Barnard was my broker—Arthur Cohen had a fourth interest in the Rae—I had no more to do with him—I have not done anything to keep Barnard out of the way—he was examined on commission in the Weston case—he has visited the South of France every year since I have known him—I saw Arthur Cohen about three weeks ago, in bed—he has been at Torquay suffering from congestion of the lungs—a daily paper like the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> is all outgoings at first—that paper now pays 50 per cent upon 50,000 ordinary shares, and 60 per cent, upon 50,000 preference shares—in 1884 I had most valuable information relating to the state of things in New York—it was a year of panic, in which prices fell heavily—that year I made a good deal of money by bearing the stocks as to which I had information, and by warning the public through my paper of impending crises days before the panic—I have examined the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> from its beginning to the present year, with this result: it has warned the public against going into companies which were withdrawn or have since failed, their aggregate capital being thirteen millions; it has given timely warning of every important decline in securities, and in most cases of impending crises; it has warned the public against inflation of Nitrate snares; it predicted the panic in Argentine securities, and advised holders of stock to sell; the advice has been sound, the information invariably accurate, and those who have acted upon it have saved money where they have sold, and made money where they have bought.</p>

This single shilling is counterfeit; these four shillings in the tobacco pouch are also counterfeit, but from different moulds to the first—if a man's teeth almost met in a shilling, one part going down while the other was straight, I should say that it was bad; if he had bent it back again it would have broken—some of these shillings came from the same mould as some of those in the last case.</p>

I am a drayman, in the employ of Stansfield and Co., brewers, and live at Walham Green—I have known the prisoner about five years; on Saturday evening, 15th November, about a quarter to nine, I went into the Wheatsheaf public-house—I had a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a 2s. piece, and two half-crowns in a leather bag, and some loose coppers in my right-hand trousers pocket—the prisoner was there when I went in—I did not speak to him—I had several half-pints of ale, which I paid for with my loose money—I came out about ten minutes past ten, lighted my pipe, and set off to walk home; as I walked down the road I turned round several times, and noticed the prisoner and another following me—as I was going behind Walham Green Church the prisoner came up behind me and hit me in the head, and said, "Take that, you b—!" and knocked me down, and while I was on the ground he kicked me in the head, and while the other men kicked me about the body the prisoner put his hand in my right-hand trousers pocket, and took out my leather bag containing the money, and then they all ran away—this happened about a quarter of a mile from the Wheatsheaf—I got up and picked up my hat, and went home—I showed my landlady a large wound in my head, I bathed it under the tap and went to bed, and next morning I spoke to the police.</p>

I am living with my daughter, but on November 1st the prisoner's mother asked me to stay with her for a week, to do some washing and cleaning for her—on 21st November, in the early morning, about one o'clock, I was in the kitchen, minding the house; the prisoner and his mother and the two little girls came in, and I said one of the little girls looked very pale, and they had better put her to bed—upon that the prisoner said, "You b—old cow, I will go for you!" and he ran towards me, and struck me in the eye; whether he had anything sharp in his hand I can't say, but it knocked me down and I was cut; I tried to get up, and he put his foot up; I put up my hand to protect my face, and he caught me on the finger, which I nave lost the use of; I was getting very weak; as I was getting up he went to the dresser and took a knife and stabbed me in the cheek—T said, "Let me go to the hospital," and I was going through the passage and the prisoner and his mother followed me, and he said to his mother, "Don't let her out; can't you throw her down the b—cellar-stairs, and have Mrs. Hogg on her, unless she promises that she won't <hi rend="italic">ruck</hi>"—I went outside and got a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody—I went to the station, and a doctor attended to me there—the prisoner did not seem to me to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lyceum Tavern, 354, Strand—on 14th July the prisoner called, and said, "I have called from Carnaby's," or Carnaby and Co., "to see if your gas regulator wants repairing, as I was in the neighbourhood, at Haxell's, repairing theirs"—that is a few doors from me—as our regulator was a little out of order I let him see to it, and paid him five shillings—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Signed, W. H. Reddon</hi>)—the next day the wire broke, and I wrote to Carnaby's and complained—I paid him, believing he came from Carnaby and Co.</p>

I am in partnership with Henry Isaacs, at 17, King William Street, Strand, as the Union Deposit Bank—we had had transactions with the prisoner and his brother, and on 14th January the prisoner called and said he wanted a loan—I asked him what his liabilities were; he said that they did not exceed £1,000, and that his income was £1,500 a year—my partner was there, and we agreed to give him a loan if he would make a declaration that what he had stated was correct—the loan was to be £400, and we were to give him a cheque for £320—it was to be repaid by instalments of £100 each month—he left the office with Walter Smith, our clerk, who afterwards returned with the declaration—I gave him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to hand to the prisoner when he had made the declaration; it has been honoured and returned by our bankers—this is the promissory note, on account of which this cheque was drawn—two instalments of £50 each have been paid off the loan, we had a difficulty in getting the rest, and instructed our solicitor to take civil proceedings, and a writ was issued—we received this letter of June 3rd, purporting to come from the defendant—("Gentlemen,—I was much surprised at the issue of a writ on your behalf to-day after the conversation I had with you. I explained to you that I had had very heavy losses, but was anxious to pay you the whole of your debt in weekly instalments, after my brother's affairs were settled. To this I understood you agreed, but apparently, from your action, I am mistaken. I think it only right to tell you, before it is too late, that if you persist in pressing your action I can so arrange my affairs that you will receive a very small portion of your claim. I am very loath to do so, but unless you withdraw your action I shall certainly do so")—the civil proceedings were gone on</p>

I remained in the room—I instructed our solicitor to take criminal proceedings—Mr. Isaacs and I are the only partners in the Union Deposit Bank, Registered—the name has been registered at Somerset House three or four years—the names of the proprietors of the bank are registered, so that if anyone wants to know who they are they apply to Somerset House—"Union" relates to the union of myself and Mr. Isaacs, and we take deposits in—we state, "Capital £250,000"—whether that is true I do not think has anything to do with this case—I should say we have very nearly £250,000 engaged in the bank, and a reserve of £120,000; that is our money invested in the business—we have stocks and shares—I will not swear that we have got the whole of the £370,000 in the business—I am "Edward Johns, manager"—I reversed my name so that no one could interfere with the name in future—that would have been accomplished if I had called myself John Edwards—I am not subpoenaed; Mr. Isaacs is—he said that he was Edward Johns; we are both Edward Johns—we keep six clerks—we have got a large amount of money on deposit from the public—we charged £150 per cent, in this instance; but if we have security we charge 5 or 10 per cent.—we receive deposits at 4 £ per cent.—£113 per cent, does not always come home as in this instance—we say, "The full amount applied for guaranteed, without any deduction," but not in this instance—the first transaction we had with the prisoner's brother was in the previous year—it is very possible that in 1889 his brother was being threatened by us with legal proceedings; I offered to discount further with him up to £500, if he would pay back his first advance of £200—he suggested that his brother would be security for him, and a clerk went down to see the position of the security—I did not send the clerk down to press him to join, so that I might get my £200—eventually we got the defendant's signature, to the extent of £500, as surety for his brother—I do not know that the defendant paid the first two instalments of that—we got back our £200 quite, because they gave a promissory note for £500; for which they received £450; they would not have the full amount of principal and interest—we charged Charles Wallis three times the interest we did on the first occasion; you see there were two names, and of course that is more safe than one name—I do not know who took up these notes—I believe Mr. Isaacs is here—he did not come to Gatti's and persuade him to come to the bank, and say that there was a private door, and that we had had a duchess through that door the day before—I am not aware that Isaacs, in consequence of his dislike to come to the bank, took this notice to Gatti's Restaurant to sign—I will swear I was there when he called on 14th January; it was between ten and eleven a.m.—I have not got another business now; I had; I was a doll manufacturer—I do not carry</p>

I am a chartered accountant, of 85, Gresham Street—I was appointed trustee in the defendant's bankruptcy—the date of the receiving order is August 28th—the first proof was by John Carr for £2,608, £108 of which was interest—he incurred the debt on April 25th, 1889—there was a proof of Thomas Wallis for £7,316 14s. 6d., £6,000 of which was incurred before January, including interest—I was present at the bankrupt's examination, and those proofs were admitted—the house and furniture were assigned to his wife's father early this year, I think—the total amount of liabilities is about £10,000—he said that it occurred through losses in business and through his brother; he became security for his brother and a man named Sanders in Stock Exchange matters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutors—on 14th January I went with the prisoner to Mr. Lewin's office, and saw him make this statutory declaration—he read it in my presence—I am the attesting witness to the promissory note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the banking-house of Glyn, Mills, Currie and Co., Lombard Street—the defendant has had an account there for twenty years in the name of G. H. Cousins and Co., trading as wool broker—we made advances to him from time to time on dock warrants—it was the practice, when a dock warrant was deposited for a loan, that a warrant letter should be filled in, which mentions the sum the merchant desires to have placed to his credit, and the description of the security—on August 1st, 1890, this warrant letter was brought to the bank with this dock warrant—the warrant letter describes the wool in the dock warrant; it is all printed, with blanks to be filled in by the person desiring the advance; this letter refers to dock warrant 6851, for eighty bales of wool lying at the London Docks, 320 cwt. medium, market price on August 1st 13d. 1b., and the amount is carried out as £1,940—that letter and the signature are in the defendant's writing, to the best of my belief—I produce a verified copy of the defendant's account with the bank, which I have examined; it shows the state of his account from August 1st to September 9th—I find that on August 1st, in accordance with this warrant, £1,500 was placed to his credit on loan; the amount standing to his account before that morning was £300 1s. 8d., and the same day £2,905 9s. 3d. was paid in; that gave him a credit of £4,046 5s. 11d., and on that day we paid cheques on that account, leaving a balance at the close of the day of £106 7s. 7d.—on 9th September this warrant, letter "D," with this warehouse-keeper's warrant, was given to us—the filling-in is in the defendant's writing—it describes the wool referred to as E 650, consisting of seventy bales lying at Brown and Eagle's warehouse, weight 220 cwt., market price on that day 1s. 4d. per 1b.; the total value at that price and weight is £1,717—£1,500 was placed to the defendant's credit on that day, because of these documents being placed at the bank and a loan being asked for—£200 was paid in on that day, September 9th; the balance before that morning was £95 13s.—£1,739 2s. 5d. was drawn out that day by cheques, which left a balance at the close of the day of £56 0s. 7d.—in consequence of information I caused inquiries to be made about the wool; I then communicated with our solicitor, and eventually with the police—September 15th was the last date on which the account was operated upon, and the account was left with a balance of £80 7s. 6d.—the last cheque was for £240, which was paid over the counter—I think one cheque was presented after that for £5,000, but we refused payment—the balance of £80 7s. 6d. was arrived at by taking the two advances as money advanced on sufficient security—I went to the defendant's office, but did not succeed in seeing him—I never saw him till he was brought back from Spain and charged on an extradition warrant; we received no communication from him during that time.</p>

I sat at the side of the scale and took the weights down—we had some bales of wool there weighing 7 1/2 and 10 cwt., but 3 or 4 cwt. is the average weight—we generally get Cape of Good Hope and Australian wool, but this was described in the catalogue as coming from Spain; that is lighter than the ordinary wool.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I am single—I live at 23, Steele Road, West Ham—I have known the prisoner for some years—I saw her in Stratford High Street on Saturday night, 15th June, about half-past eight—she had her child by the hand—she was crying; I asked what she was crying for, she said she was looking for a lodging for herself and the baby, as her mother had told her she must go; she said she had only given her mother 6s.—I walked with her as far as the Green Man public-house—we went in there—she then told me that her stepfather said if her mother had not told her to go, she would have to leave that day week—we had a pint of ale between three of us; Eliza Loch was</p>

               <p>with us—she stayed there with me about a quarter of an hour; she had been with me about half an hour coming along Stratford—when she left the public-house she did not say where she was going; she said she would not be long; she did not say she was coming back; I thought she was going home—it appeared to me that she was out of her mind; as the baby sat on her right hand she was tearing her hair with the left, pulling it out—she seemed strange—she was still crying when she left me.</p>

She seemed out of her mind from some trouble; I did not think she was fit to be trusted alone—she walked the child along at first, and then took it up in her arms—I think the one pint was all we had, but I could not swear one way or the other.</p>

I am the wife of John Tresader, of 62, Stanley Road, Stratford—I know the prisoner well—I saw her on 15th November about half-past nine outside the Butcher's Arms, Stratford; she was walking along the High Street, leading her baby by the hand—I said, "Hallo, Annie, have you been washing her hair?" because her hair seemed thinner in front—she said, "No"—I stopped with her about twenty minutes—I said, "The child's eyes are still very bad;" she said they were better than they used to be—I gave the child a halfpenny, and left her—she was going towards Stratford Church, and towards the bridge—I saw her again about ten, outside 25, West Street, close to where she lived, in the adjoining street—she was crying—I asked my mother-in-law what was the matter; she (prisoner) recognised my voice and said, "Is that you, Jenny? you gave my child a halfpenny about half-an-hour ago, and I bought it a halfpenny worth of potatoes, the last thing its mother will ever buy it in this world"—I said, "What nave you done with your baby?"—she said, "I have thrown it over the Harrow Bridge"—I asked her if she knew what she was saying—she said, Yes, she knew perfectly well what she was saying, that she had done it, worse luck—the police then came up and took her away.</p>
               <p>

I was on duty on this night, and about half-past nine I saw the prisoner in High Street, Stratford—she came from the footpath by the side of the river, and was going towards the bridge—she had no child with her—she went into the High Street—about a quarter to ten I was called by a little boy to 3, South Street, and saw the prisoner standing on the footpath, and a crowd of people—her mother was fetched, I saw her stepfather at the top of the street; before I said anything the prisoner said, "Oh, policeman, I have drowned my child"—I said, "Do you know what you are talking about?"—she said, "Yes, I had a few words at home this evening with my mother, I then took my child out, went up the High Street and threw it over Harrow Bridge. I then came home and told my mother I had drowned my child, and asked for a policeman to be sent for"—I told her I should take her into custody—she said, "All right, sir, I will come with you;" I took her to the station—as far as I could judge she was sober, she appeared excited.</p>

               <p>been drinking or not—the bridge is a very narrow one, it is in High Street, the main thoroughfare; there are gas-lamps along the High Street, and I believe there is a lamp on the bridge—ten o'clock on Saturday is rather a busy time, the shops are open and there would be a considerable amount of traffic—she came up the path from the river, there is a very steep embankment; the parapet is about 4 ft. 6 in high from the road, you can easily lean over and look into the river—Police-constable Blagden was with me.</p>

If I hadn't been the worse for drink and upset I should not have done it; I liked the child too well for that, and I worked and kept her since she was born, out of my own money what I earned"—she signed it and acknowledged it to be voluntary—she appeared to be perfectly sober.</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police at Stratford—I examined the dead body of the child at the West Ham Police-station at twelve p.m. on 15th November—there were no marks of external violence, the general appearance being that of death from drowning—there was mud about the eyes and nose, such as might come from the bottom of the river—I made a post-mortem on the 17th, and found the cause, of death to be drowning—the body was shown me by Inspector Rooks—I saw the prisoner the same night at the Police-station—she was excited, and I said, "What is the matter?"—she said, "Had it not been for</p>

I am a butcher, of 104, High Street, Lewis ham, within a minute's walk of the High Road, Lee—on 8th November about 8 p.m. Clarke came and bought half a leg of mutton, price 2s. 4 1/2 d., and gave me a florin and a sixpence—I gave her 1 1/2 d. change, and she turned to go, when Barnett came in and spoke to me—I then tried the florin with my teeth—it was soft and it bent—my teeth went into it—this is it—I found it gritty, and handed it to Barnett immediately—he left the shop, and in about three minutes brought in the two prisoners and the half leg of mutton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant divisional surgeon at Battersea—I went to 17, Plough Road on 3rd December, and on the second floor back room I found the body of a woman in bed, lying with her hand under her head, and her right arm across her chest—she must have been asleep when she was shot—there was a ballet wound in her right temple—there was no scorching or powder mark—I made a post mortem, and found a bullet embedded in the brain—I gave it to the inspector—she was four or five months gone in the family way.</p>

I live at 300, Battersea Park Road—I am the prisoner's brother—he had been married about fourteen years—there are three children, of eleven, eight, and four—he had been in the oil and colour trade about twelve years—he had been in the army—I went to my brother's house and identified the dead body of his wife—I had a conversation with him about his wife early in October—he said he believed she met either men or another man, I don't know which; and that he had engaged some one to watch her—I told him it was a ridiculous thing altogether—we had other conversations on different occasions; the last time I think was 1st December, when he was very</p>

                  </hi>. I practise at Bridge Road, Battersea—the prisoner came to me for treatment on, I think, 13th October—he was suffering from a syphilitic ulcer on his tongue—he said it was of old standing—I examined him—the first or second time he came to me he asked me if I could tell him the symptoms of gonorrhea in a female—I asked him if his wife had a discharge, and he said, "Yes"—I treated him for old syphilis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in practice at 13, Colebrooke Row, City Road—I attended the prisoner for about seven years up to within the last twelve months, when he left my neighbourhood—I treated him principally for syphilis, severe nervous excitement, and suicidal mania—he has once or twice said to me it was a fine night for a fellow like him to throw himself over Blackfriars Bridge—he appeared to be remarkably fond of his wife and children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The syphilis was of some years' standing, what we call tertiary syphilis—it is always amenable to treatment—the old disease will break out again, in which case it is not eradicated—it is very improbable that tertiary syphilis will be eradicated—it is a common thing for persons with tertiary syphilis to think they had better drown themselves—the mind gets unhinged.</p>

I am Medical Officer at Her Majesty's Prison, Holloway, and have had the prisoner under my constant supervision since 4th December, and have frequently examined him as to his mental con dition—he told me he had had a sunstroke at Gibraltar twenty years ago—that he was insensible between five and six hours, and was in hospital for three, four, or five days; he was not quite certain—he said his married life up to June or July last was quite happy, when he began to suspect his wife, and believed a man had been intriguing with her, but gave me no idea who he was or what he was like—he said when he entered his house at the back he could hear the front door slam, and imagined that this unknown man was escaping, or, <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> if he entered</p>

               <p>at the front the man would go out at the back—it has been represented to me by those who have watched the prisoner that he has slept very badly; he has complained to me of a dull aching pain in his right temple—I have tested his head by tapping, and he flinches directly you touch him there—it corresponds with the place in which his wife was shot—I can't account for it except that it is an insane idea he has got.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. There is nothing to suggest that a man would suffer in the part of his head where he shot anyone else—I believe there is such a tenderness, for he flinches there, and nowhere else—the only reason I can suggest is that he has so concentrated his attention on that spot where his wife was shot that he has become influenced with that idea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. He told me very often that he thought the pain must be due to the bullet being in his own head—he tells me he is constantly hearing a faint sigh which his wife made when she was shot, and that he has seen visions of his wife lying dead, and children appear—he is now of unsound mind, and was, I believe, on 3rd December—I believe he is suffering from mental disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Supposing a sane man to commit an act of this kind I should be surprised at his being haunted by the dying sighs of his wife—I don't think it would be a natural thing—I should not say that it was an indication of itself that the man was insane—if he blew his wife's brains out I do not think it would be unnatural that he should not be haunted by the dying sigh of his wife—I am not astonished that he is restless in his sleep—if he saw visions of his wife I should certainly think his brain was affected; not if he dreamt it—I cannot find any other delusion he has except that he thought a man was committing adultery with his wife—that is a well-marked one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I often find that the acts of a person who has an insane delusion are connected with that delusion—I think his giving himself up tends to show that he was of unsound mind—the fact of his having been restless and excitable, especially since July, helps me to form an opinion as to his mental condition.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had considerable experience in mental diseases, and I examined the prisoner on 16th December, at the request of the solicitors to the Treasury, in order to ascertain his mental condition, and I thought him of unsound mind, and I should say that condition had existed for several months—I discovered no evidence of syphilis—syphilis is a cause of insanity—the sunstroke might have something to do with it, but it is a very long time ago, and there have been no symptoms in the intermediate time—I think when I examined him he was under a delusion—I examined his head—he complained of pain in the right region, where he flinched immediately from the slightest touch—I think that is part of the evidence of his derangement—he said the explanation of his feeling this pain, where he said he had never felt it before, was that since he shot his wife he thought the bullet was there—when I asked him how he thought the bullet could possibly be there he looked puzzled, and said, "Well, it is exactly in the same place, I am sure," and he seemed to think it</p>

               <p>was a satisfactory account of it—he seemed confident it was there—I think his giving himself up and speaking as he did on 3rd December is quite consistent with his being of unsound mind, and more consistent than the notion that he was actuated by ordinary passion—there is often calmness after an outburst.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The mere fact that a man had an unfounded suspicion of his wife's fidelity would not induce me to say necessarily that he was insane—that has not led me to my conclusion—if he, under that unfounded suspicion, blew out his wife's brains I should not say, necessarily, he was insane—giving himself up to justice after the act does not tell, nor would a man giving himself up for a crime he had committed be conclusive evidence that he was insane—the prisoner indicated to me the spot in his head—I examined the man as I should any ordinary person who came to me, to test his sanity or insanity—I asked him if he had any pain, and he replied at once, "Yes," and pointed to his head in that situation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. There may be a real foundation or not; I should say he had pain where he pointed, though the pain might not be occasioned by organic disease—of course there is very great difficulty in discriminating between an assumed pain and a real pain—I am accustomed to examine patients constantly, and the impression conveyed to my mind was that he did suffer pain—it seemed to me to be an after-result of the deed—the constant concentration of attention, on that part of the brain does conjure up a condition of things in which pain is felt—there is nothing more common than that mental concentration on particular parts of the body will occasion actual pain, and other actual changes in the body also, the seat of the nerves.</p>

On Sunday evening, 23rd November, I was on duty in Kennington Road, close to the church—the vestry door is thirty or forty yards from the road—I examined the door and found the vestry door broken open—I blew my whistle, and in two or three minutes Ross came up—we closed the door and searched the church with my lantern, and found the three prisoners in the lobby of the north door, which was locked; it is divided from the church by swing doors—I said, "What are you doing here?"—Clark and Harding said, "We got drunk; we don't know where we are"—I said, "We shall take you into custody;" they made no reply—the female prisoner said nothing—we took them to the station—the first time we tried to open the lobby doors we failed, because they were being held inside.</p>

I took the charge at the station, and examined the church with a police lamp—an attempt had been made to enter the vestry by tearing away the lead and glass of the vestry window, but there were iron bars inside, and they could not get through—you cannot see the bars outside—I found marks of violence on the vestry door and on the hasp, and inside the vestry a table drawer was wide open, papers were scattered all over the floor, and in the inner vestry I found the safe opened, and the contents scattered over the floor, and a cupboard wrenched open, with a lock lying under it—I went into the church and found in a pew this knotted rope, which is used for lowering anybody from a window, and in another pew these keys on a cushion—the verger identified them as being taken from the safe—they were about ten yards from where I found the prisoners—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, which corresponds with eight or nine indentations on the vestry door and doorpost—I saw the prisoners as soon as they were brought to the station—there were no indications of drink whatever on any of them.</p>
