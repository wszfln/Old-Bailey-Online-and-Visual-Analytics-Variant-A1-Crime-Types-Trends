                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Confidential Inquiry Department of the General Post Office—in consequence of losses on the prisoner's delivery I was directed to make inquiries—in consequence of those inquiries I made up a test letter containing three postal orders, two for twenty shillings and one for ten shillings—I privately marked each order and put them in this letter, directed to Mr. T. Leeson, 129, Villa Street, Walworth—I posted it at half-past three on 22nd July at the S. E. office—I had previously given notice to Mr. Mackenzie as to where the letter was going—I ascertained at seven that night that the letter had not been delivered—next morning I went with constable Bick to watch the prisoner's residence in Thomas Street, Beresford Street, Walworth—at twelve at noon I saw the prisoner leave his lodgings in plain clothes—after he had gone a little way Bick stopped him—I then spoke to him—I told him who I was, and said, "Yesterday afternoon, at 3.30, I posted a letter at the S. E. district office containing three postal orders,</p>

               <p>two of twenty shillings and one of ten shillings, addressed to Mr. T. Leeson, 129, Villa Street, Walworth; this letter should have been delivered by you last night; it was not de<lb/>livered; do you know anything about it?"—he said, "I have not seen it; I had nothing for them last night but a paper"—I said, "Have you the letter in your pocket?"—he said, "No"—I then asked if he had any postal orders in his pocket; he said, "No, sir"—I said, "Then you don't know anything about the letter?"—he said, "No, I have not seen it"—I then said, "You must go with me to the General Post Office and be searched"—he then said, "The letter is in my pocket, but it is not open, I am just going to deliver it; I forgot it last night"—he was then taken to the General Post Office and searched by Bick in my presence, and this letter was taken, in its present condition, but it has gone a little more; it shows that a portion of the back part of the envelope has adhered to the gum—I said to the prisoner, "This is the letter which I posted last night; how do you account for its being open?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Why did you say when you were stopped that you had not soon the letter?"—he said, "I did not know what to say"—several loose postage stamps were found on him, twenty penny unobliterated, and four halfpenny stamps—I asked where ho got them from; he said ho had had them for a long time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bick went up to the prisoner first; I was a little behind him—I remember the conversation I had with the prisoner, and I made a note of it in shorthand, part of it as soon as I got to the office, and part at the time the conversation took place—I am quite positive he first said he had not seen the letter—the Magistrate at the Police-court asked to see the letter; he did not say it did not seem to have been gummed down properly—letters had boon missing from this district from about March this year—the prisoner had been there since 29th January—he bad been previously employed at another office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Thomas Russell, of 1, Belmont Villas, Queen's Road, Richmond-in March, 1889, I wished to invest some money, and I applied to my solicitor, who introduced me to the prisoner at 15, Fish Street Hill, my solicitor's office—the prisoner said, "I want to borrow some money," and then my solicitor showed me this statutory declaration; I cannot say whether I saw the prisoner sign it, but it is in the prisoner's hand writing, because I have seen him sign—this was read over to him at the time the money was lent, on 4th April, 1889. (<hi rend="italic">In this instrument the prisoner declared that he had not charged, assigned, or otherwise encumbered his share under the will of Albert Billings, save as the same was charged by the indentures dated</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th December,</hi> 1888, <hi rend="italic">in favour of George Brown and George Hall Hall</hi>)—on the strength of this declaration I advanced him £700 in cash on the same day—I saw the prisoner at the same time sign this mortgage, which he handed to me. (<hi rend="italic">In this document the prisoner was described as mortgagor and beneficial owner</hi>)—on 11th July, 1889, the prisoner applied to me for another £700 loan, offering the same security as before—he made this second declaration, which I saw him sign; it is almost precisely like the first one—I then advanced him another £700 in cash—he also signed this document in my presence, and it was handed to me—the prisoner paid interest till July, 1890, but after that he paid neither principal nor interest—I heard nothing of him after July, 1890, till I found he was at the Old Bailey in July 28th this year, and I came and heard the case; he had had £250 from someone last Christmas—he was acquitted then—I went to a solicitor and took these proceedings at once.</p>

I am the last witness's husband—I was present on 4th April and 11th July, 1889, when the prisoner signed the declarations and deeds; my wife's evidence is perfectly correct—she asked the prisoner on the first occasion, "I hope what you are stating: in your statutory declaration is true, because the money will make a deal of difference to me;" and he said, "I am a man of honour, and I have never robbed anybody in my life," and the solicitor said, "If it is not true, Mr. Billings, you know you are liable for ten years"—I saw the prisoner sign both declarations, and they were read over to him first—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189109140008"/>
               <p>he stated they were true—when signing he made some sort of remark; I think he said, "This is my hand and seal"—I saw the money pass on both occasions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Lawford and Co., solicitors, of 28, Austin Friars—they are solicitors to William Radford and his wife Emma, and have had the management of their business for the last ten years—William Radford is one of the trustees under the will of Albert Billings, the prisoner's brother—under that will "the prisoner had a reversionary interest in one-sixth of the residuary estate—on 27th September, 1880, he executed a mortgage on that interest to Mr. Silberberg, in consideration of £400—Mr. Silberberg brought an action against the mortgagor and recovered judgment in 1881—the prisoner then applied to Mr. William Radford to relieve him from the pressure Mr. Silberberg was putting on him—Mr. Radford handed me £500, and told me to do the best I could—on 8th November, 1881, I saw the prisoner, and obtained his written instructions to settle with Silberberg and some other creditors—I did so, and on the same day I obtained a reassignment of Silberberg's mortgage to the prisoner; and on 11th November I procured his execution in my presence of a new mortgage to Mr. Radford, in consideration of the £500, of the one-sixth share of the residuary interest; the balance of the £500 was handed over to the prisoner—in April, 1882, the prisoner, who was represented by a solicitor, Mr. Smith, proposed to sell the reversion, subject to a mortgage, for a further sum of £300—Mr. Smith arrived at the figures—after some discussion the business was carried out, and an absolute assignment of the reversionary interest, subject to the mortgage, was prepared; the draft was submitted to the prisoner's solicitor, and after some discussion was approved, engrossed, and executed, and the £300 paid over on the written order of the prisoner to his solicitor, the purchaser being Mrs. Emma Radford—therefore the prisoner had parted absolutely under this deed with all his interests under his late brother's will—he had his own solicitor, and it was not my province to explain the matter to him; but on the occasion before that I adopted all precautions, and took care that the engross<lb/>ment and draft were read over to him before he executed the deed—with reference to the assignment my instructions were to take care that his wife, who is a very good woman of business, should know thoroughly what was being done, and that it was an out and out sale, and I said I should require evidence of it, and he showed me a letter he had received from Mrs. Billings, and handed me the original on the completion—it was a step in the business, a <hi rend="italic">sine quâ non,</hi> that the prisoner's wife should understand the matter before the completion—this is a press copy of the letter I wrote to the prisoner's solicitor.</p>

I am a cabman at 1, Ovey's Mews, Hammersmith—soon after five on the evening of 27th June I was at Aldridge's Horse Repository, St. Martin's Lane—Russell, whom I knew by sight, came up and wanted to know if I would buy a good cab-horse—I said yes—he went away—another man came up and spoke to me, and I went with him to the Globe public-house, New Compton Street; outside the Globe I saw a chesnut cob tied to—the tail of a cart—I had a look at the horse and went inside, where I saw George Rich—he spoke about the horse, and I agreed to buy it for £13 if it suited me after I had tried it—I was to pay £3 down before I tried it, and if it suited me I was to pay the other £10 on the Monday—Castling came inside and wrote out the receipt—after that arrangement was come to, this was written out: "Bought of J. Smith a chesnut horse for £13; £3 deposit, leaving balance of £10 to be paid. Signed P. Smith"—I could not say whether Castling or Rich signed the receipt; Castling wrote it out—the words "Before delivery" were written after "to be paid"—I think Rich struck them out—if the horse was not satisfactory, my £3 was to be returned to me—they were to come to my address to get the £10—while this was going on Russell came into the house, and said whatever was done he would be answerable for, and if I had not money to buy the horse he would lend "me £20 if I wanted it there and then—he then went out of the public-house—the horse had been given into the charge of Patrick Mahoney, who was holding the halter outside—I refused to pay the money till I had possession of the horse outside, and I went out and took hold of the horse—I paid Rich two sovereigns, ten shillings, and nine shillings in silver, and I was going to give him the other shilling, when Castling pulled the halter off the horse's head, and I was hustled and knocked down by Castling, Russell, Rich, and two others, and when I was on the ground the horse and money disappeared—I saw the crowd going with the men that had the money—I got up, and went after the crowd that was after Rich, who was running as hard as he could run towards Drury Lane—I ran and caught him, and had my hands oh him, when I was pulled from behind on to the ground, and he got away again—I had not seen Russell while I was running after Rich—I gave information to the police—two days afterwards I saw Rich</p>

               <p>at the Elephant and Castle, and gave him into custody, and charged him at Marlborough Mews Police-station on the evening of 29th June—next morning, about eight, Russell and Glover came to my house—Russell said, "I have come about <hi rend="italic">squaring</hi> that job about the horse on Saturday"—I said it was out of my hands altogether, I had nothing to do with it—Russell and Glover kept following me about and speaking about the matter till 10 o'clock, and in the end I received £5 from Glover in Russell's presence, and I wrote out this paper, which I afterwards saw Glover produce from his pocket after he had been charged at the Police-court—I had given it to Glover, whom I knew as Allen—that morning I did not go to the Police-court, but sent my wife there in consequence of Russell and Glover—after a little bit Truman spoke to me that morning—directly Russell and Glover went away I telegraphed to the Police-court, and then I went towards there and met the police officer, and then I was told that Rich had been discharged about two minutes before—on the 13th July I was called to Marlborough Street Station, where I saw the two prisoners in custody.</p>

I live at 20, New Compton Street, and am a French-polisher—on 27th June I was standing outside the Globe public-house when I saw Williams come up—he talked to Rich, and they went into the Globe, Williams leaving a chesnut horse outside for me to hold—Castling came up and asked me to let him have hold of the horse—I refused, and a bit of a row took place—he tried to get the horse away from me while the others were inside the house; he did not get it away—the others came out of the house, and Williams took hold of the horse by the halter, and paid £2 10s. in gold and 10s. in silver to Rich, who then drew the halter off the horse's head and struck Williams to the ground, and put the bridle on, and he and Castling walked the horse away; Castling had the horse—Williams got up from the ground, ran after them, and caught Rich, and he and Rich had a row, and Rich struck him and knocked him down and got away a second time—he went away with Castling and the horse.</p>

               <p>Society of Great Britain—on July 29th I received these three bottles, C, D and E, from Inspector Barton—C is nitric acid, D is a strong solution of cyanide of potassium, and E is strong sulphuric acid—F was also handed to me; that is also a strong solution of cyanide of potassium—those fluids are used for electro-plating—the cyanide of potassium is commonly employed as the vehicle by which gold is transferred from one surface to another; the two acids are used for cleaning or "pickling" metals so that they shall more readity take a surface of gold or silver—on the 30th July I received these three sovereigns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated 1852, 1888, and 1891; that of 1891 is 18 grains and a fraction short of the current weight and 2s. 11d. short in the value; that of 1852 is 14 3/4 grains short and 2s. 5d. in value, and that of 1888 is 14 1/2 grains short and 2s. 4 1/2 d. deficient in value—the standard I have taken is the least current weight of a sovereign, 122 1/2 grains—the deficiency has been brought about by their immersion in fluids capable of dissolving gold, such as are now before me—on the 1852 sovereign there is a mark such as would be made by a wire to suspend it in, a solution of cyanide of potassium,. with a view of taking gold off it and placing it on another surface, and on the 1888 sovereign I find a blight indication of such a wire mark; in that of 1891 I find no such mark, but it has the same appearance as the other two—that of 1852 has more especially signs of the battery—the reduction does not materially affect the circulation—they would be taken by persons not accustomed to examine money closely—they have not been in circulation since they were tampered with—the deficiency could not be caused by ordinary wear and tear.</p>

               <p>Soho, was established in 1821, and the prisoner has been in my employ<lb/>ment on and off for eight or ten years; he is a man of thoroughly respectable character—on July 21st he was going out, and said as he had not had his money would I leave it out for him—I told one of the sergeants that I gave him two sovereigns and some silver, but he says it was only one—his wages were 30s. or 35s., according to whether he worked overtime—there was also some money for petty cash—he was taken in custody on that day—he often did a few little jobs at home for himself, he often asked me to allow him to have a little acid and a spirit lamp and blow-pipe and charcoal to braze articles; he had a little connection of his own, nothing to do with me—there was no concealment about his getting this sulphuric acid; supposing he was going to do repairing or cleaning, it would be necessary to clean it.</p>

I am a die sinker of 5, Newgate Street, and work for the Bank of England—on 11th May I first saw the prisoner; he came to my office and said in English, "Do you make business cards?"—I said, "Yes," and showed him some specimens—he gave me an order for a plate and 100 cards, price 5s., which he paid and wrote down his address—he then showed me a coin or token, with General Moltke on it; I said that that was in my line of business—he left and came again on 19th May, when I gave him the cards—he said in German, "This is very confidential," and showed me a half-crown and said, "Can you do anything like this for me?"—I said, "Yes; do you know this is a criminal case for you to order it or for me to make it?"—he said, "Yes, I know all about it; several friends on the Continent have been making mark pieces for twenty years and have not been caught"—I promised to consider the matter, and he said he would call again—I then went to the Bank of England, and was referred to the Treasury; I went there, and received instructions on the following day—on May 23rd the prisoner came again, and asked me in German if I would do the dies for him—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have changed my mind; you had better make it half-sovereigns or sovereigns"—I said</p>

I am the wife of George Heath, a labourer, of 34, Newton Road, Page Green—I saw the prisoner there with a baby on her lap—she said at first it was twelve months old, afterwards said it was eight months, and that it was her own child—it was rather dirty—I once gave it a cake and some milk, because it was crying and hungry; it was very ravenous—I told the prisoner I thought it was completely starving—she turned round on me and said, "Mind your own business"—she said her husband had gone away from her—some gentleman offered her a shilling to buy the children some food—she said she should only do the same with it as she had been doing, spend it in four ale—she was then the worse for drink—she said she would throw the baby away; she held it so, and I took it out of her hands, and took it to the station, and she was also taken there—she attempted to run away.</p>

I was living at 114, Seymour Street, Euston Road, on the top floor—at the end of June the prisoner, her husband, and three children came to live there in two unfurnished rooms on the first floor; the baby was about eight months old—between the end of June and 1st August the prisoner was in the habit of taking drink—I have seen her the worse for drink on several occasions—the husband was out during the day; the prisoner had charge of the children—on 19th July, at a quarter to eleven, I saw a large crowd outside the door; the prisoner was there drunk and creating a disturbance; a little boy was holding her baby—she was not able to do so—she would not go indoors or be quiet, and I took her into custody and took her to the station, and took the child to the workhouse—it was very thin and dirty, and had diarrhœa; it remained in the workhouse till the following Saturday—I saw the prisoner on that day bring the child upstairs—on Sunday, 2nd August, she was in and out during the day when the public-houses were open, getting drunk—there was no one to look after the baby but herself—the child was very ill that day—she was away from it for half-an-hour or an hour at a time—she would come in about eight or half-past the worse for drink, and incapable; my wife has had to help her to bed—on 3rd August I saw the child in its cot; it was very dirty, and smelt; the prisoner was out at that time—I did not see her till she came home at night—I went to Arbour Square and gave information.</p>

I am a surgeon of 14, Clarendon Square, St. Pancras—the prisoner brought the child to my surgery on Saturday, 1st August, about seven; it had a bad cough and cold; it was in a very emaciated condition, a pinched face and limp—on examining the chest I found it was suffering from a severe attack of bronchitis—I told the prisoner that it was very wrong to bring the child out of doors in its con<lb/>dition, that it ought to have been seen to—she said she had just brought it from the workhouse, that she had been in trouble, that she was obliged to bring it out, and she brought it to see me—I examined it, it appeared very clean, and nice and tidy; I prescribed for it—I told her it was very ill and in a very serious condition, and not to bring it out again, but I would see it at home the following morning (Sunday)—I gave her some medicine, I think she had two bottles—I told her to give it according to the directions every three hours—the child seemed easy and more com<lb/>fortable on Sunday—the medicine would last about a day and a half, if taken regularly, if it was very bad—if she had done that the bottle would not have been as full as it was, it would have been nearly empty—on the Sunday I saw the child lying in a cot in the back room; it appeared as well as I could expect—I told her to go on with the remedies, to keep it wrapped up in cotton wool, and rub it with camphor oil—on Monday I went again, it was then in a very dirty filthy condition—I did not see the prisoner then, I saw the husband—I did not go again, and I noticed nothing about the buttock on the Saturday night—on the Monday there were excoriations, the buttock was inflamed—I did not see the child after death.</p>

               <p>saw a butler standing at the area gate of No. 53; it was the prisoner—he and another man were joking, and he asked me to come down the area steps and he would give me some champagne and a half-sovereign—I went down to the basement; he opened a bottle of champagne, and we drank it—I said, "I don't like it, it is very tart"—he said, "It cost five guineas a dozen, and it is very dry"—I asked him for the tea shillings; he gave me four shillings and this postcard that I might find him (<hi rend="italic">Addressed to Mrs. Reiss</hi>)—he let down a bed from the wall, and I did not leave him till 3.50—he asked if I should like some champagne and some wine—I said, "Yes," and he gave me a bottle of champagne and two of wine; he rolled them up in some things, which were afterwards found—the night-shirt came off the bed as far as I remember, and he pat some strawberries in—the hamper was fastened up with a string—I do not know whether he gave me anything else; I was too <hi rend="italic">boozed</hi>—I went out by the area door, and fastened it after me—soon afterwards a policeman took the hamper from me and locked me up—I was brought up at the Police-court the same morning and was remanded, when the prisoner said he had never seen me—I was sentenced to one day's imprisonment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Westminster Police-court—on 25th July I was present when Mary Walsh was charged with being in unlawful possession of a hamper, a bottle of champagne, two bottles of claret, a pencil-case, and other articles—this is the charge-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was called as a witness, and sworn—Mr. De Rutzen was the Magistrate—the prosecutor said that he was butler to the last witness, and had never seen the prisoner before, and that the cham<lb/>pagne and claret were the same as used by his master; that he had charge of the wine, and that which was unused after dinner was kept in a collarette—she then interjected that he gave them to her—he continued, "I did not give you the postcard produced; the address on it is my lady's"—Mr. De Rutzen remanded her to July 29th, when the prisoner gave further evidence—he said, "I made a mistake last Saturday, saying I did not see the woman in the house; I said the back door was locked, and it was not locked. I went to rest at 11.45 in my room. I went out into the back yard. I had had some drink. The prisoner came into my room; she wanted 10s. I had nothing to do with her, and she left the room, <hi rend="italic">etc. Cross-examined.</hi> You came down the area steps; I did not bring you in. I did not find you the drink. I had not connection with you. I did not see where the hamper came from"—at the conclusion of the evidence she was remanded to August 4th, and then sentenced to one day's im<lb/>prisonment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The only charge against her that was made was un<lb/>lawful possession without giving a satisfactory account of it—the</p>

On 25th July I took charge of the case against Mary Walsh—after the charge was heard I went to 53, Sloane Street, and saw the prisoner—that was after he had given evidence—I saw him with his master at six p.m., and said, "This woman tells me you asked her down the area steps, and let her into the house and gave her the property"—he said, "It is a great untruth," and I think he said, "I never saw the woman"—on the evening of 28th July, the day before the remand, I saw him in Sloane Street, and warned him to attend the Court on the following day; he said, "I will be there; I made a mistake, I did let her into the house; if I had been in my sober senses I should never have done so, but I swear on my oath I never gave her the property."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found that the prisoner has been in his master's service about fourteen years, and has always borne a most excellent character—I have ascertained that he was drunk on the 24th, and he had the appearance of it on the 25th when he left the Court, and when I saw him later on he appeared very much excited and upset about what had happened—Walsh said, "He promised me 10s., but he did not give it to me"—the prisoner has lost his situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Schwarer, a watchmaker, of 14, Green Street, Bethnal Green; I sleep there—he keeps watches in the window—on the night of 7th July the shop was properly fastened up, and the outside shutters were up—about midnight I was roused up; I went into the shop and found the shutters were down, and one of the windows was smashed—I missed fifteen silver watches, worth £17, from the window—I was shown some of them at the Police-court; they were Mr. Schwarer's property—these are two—I missed no gold ones.</p>

About ten minutes to twelve on the night of 7th July I was on duty, and my attention was attracted by a smash of glass—I looked towards the place and saw Hescott and three others in front of the shop No. 14—I saw Hescott with his arm in the shop, and he handed something to Lack—while that was taking place some signal was given, and the men ran away—I followed Lack over 200 yards; I am quite sure he is the man—a knife and a watch were afterwards picked up in the direction he ran—I found this watch price-ticket at the corner of Digby Street, and this one at the corner of Globe Street, on the ground he had gone over—this watch and a piece of cloth were picked up just outside the window—I was present when a watch was picked up—I next saw Lack on 15th, when he was in custody.</p>

About midnight on 7th July I heard cries of "Stop him!" and "Stop thief!" in James Street, about one hundred yards from the shop—I saw Hescott running very fast away from the direction of Green Street—I ran after and caught him, but he wrested himself out of my grasp and ran for two hundred yards—I followed him through a court into Globe Road—I was getting exhausted, and shouted to another constable to stop him—he did so—as Hescott was stopped he put his right hand into his right hand coat pocket; I caught hold of his hand, and he took these two watches with these tickets on them from his pocket—he put his left hand into his other coat pocket and pulled out a life preserver, which he dropped in the road—he was taken to the station and charged—this small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was found on him.</p>

               <p>saw the woman lying on the flat of her back, her petticoats entangled with the near step of the trap, and the near wheel skidded her along ten or twelve yards into the centre of the road—a man was holding the pony's head, trying to stop it—at the same time police constable Barber, in plain clothes, came up—with his assistance we extricated the woman from the wheel of the trap and carried her on to the pavement—I sent to Charing Cross Hospital for an ambulance, and the woman was taken there—the prisoner was also taken there—I took him into custody and took him to Bow Street Police-station—I there charged him with furiously driving and causing bodily harm to the woman—I should say he was driving at the pace of between thirteen and fourteen miles an hour.</p>

On Saturday, 8th August, about half-past seven, I was in St. Martin's Lane, standing by the board on the side of the Orange Grove Restaurant, almost facing 109—I was on the right hand Hide going into the direction of Holborn—I heard a cry—I turned my head and saw a trap going in the direction of Trafalgar Square, and a woman under the wheels—she was dragged a distance of about ton yards—I ran in company with 375 and assisted in getting her from under the wheels—her dress had caught in the step—she was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective T</hi>). About 9 p.m. on 14th August I saw the two prisoners walking together in High Street, Brentford, near the Ealing Road, each carrying a carpenter's basket similar to this—I followed them to Kew Bridge, where I saw Ambrose, a uniform con<lb/>stable—I called him to assist me, and stopped the prisoners—I said to them, "I am a police officer; I wish to know the contents of the bags you are carrying'—Tyson said, "It is all right"—Wright said, "We will go to the station "—I went with Wright towards the station, and Ambrose followed with Tyson—at the corner of Pottery Road, Wright slipped the bag from his shoulder and I fell over it, and he immediately ran up the Pottery Road—I ran after him and blew my whistle and shouted, and at the corner of Netley Road Wright disappeared—I looked round;</p>

               <p>it was very dark—I saw a doorway into a yard—I entered, and groped round the walls, and found the prisoner crouching at the side where the dusthole is—I said, "You will stop here till I get assistance"—he struggled, and tried to get out; I blew my whistle again—he said, "You know nothing; let me go"—I was in plain clothes—we had several struggles, and he got out into the road—he then promised to go quietly, and he did so for a few yards, and then he caught me up and attempted to throw me; he fell on the ground, and I on top of him—two other men came up to my assistance, and I got him into the Pottery Road; he struggled all the way going to the station—at the station I examined the contents of his and Tyson's baskets; Tyson was at the station when I arrived—I found in the baskets the property that has been described, some in each—they were charged in the usual way—Wright, I believe, said they did not know anything about the breaking into the house—I found in Wright's pocket this match, and the portion of a broken handle of a jug.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in England three years—I am a diamond merchant, of 24, Hatton Garden—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—before July 20th I let him have a parcel of diamonds, worth about £80, which he returned—I had done no other business with him till then—I did not know where he lived—on 20th July I saw him in the street at Hatton Garden—he said, "I have been commissioned by the Australian shipping-house of Hoffmann and Co. to show them about two hundred carats of diamond melee; I will go at once with them, and bring the goods back if not sold"—I went to Lindenbaum, Weil, and Co., of 25, Hatton Garden—I received from them two parcels of diamond?, one weighing five and five-eighths carats, at £5 15s. a carat, and the other ninety three and a half carats at £5 10s. a carat—I told the prisoner the price—that was in a Hatton Garden restaurant—I handed him the parcels—I opened my pocket-book and showed him a parcel of 57 1/2 carats of melee at £4 10s. a carat, and a pair of brilliants weighing 26 carats at £8 10s. a carat, a single brilliant 6 carats at £16 a carat, and 71 carats of white brilliants at £12 a carat—when he saw them he</p>

               <p>said, "These goods are just the goods Messrs. Hoffimann want to buy"—I then gave him the goods, and he said, "I will show them at once, and be back as soon as possible "—to Hatton Garden—I gave him those six parcels about eleven o'clock—I returned to my office—at 12.30 I saw him again at. the restaurant—he showed me an envelope which was fastened down, on which was written "£5," and the initials "H. and Co. "—he gave me the envelope, and said, "This is the price "—Mr. Abrahams had the envelope—I last saw it in his posses<lb/>sion at his office—that was the next (Tuesday) morning—Mr. Abrahams took it out and put it back in his drawer—when I first saw the envelope it was fastened down like an ordinary letter, with gum—there was no sealing wax upon it—when he gave me the envelope, he said, "This is the price Messrs. Hoffmann offered for the two parcels, but they want to buy about 100 carats of by water brilliants at between £5 10s. and £6 10s. a carat—I took the envelope to Messrs. Lindenbaum and Weil—the prisoner knew I had them from another person, to whom I had to submit the offer—I told the prisoner what Mr. Weil said—Mr. Weil said the price of £5 for the diamond melee was no good; and I told the prisoner that he had to go back and break die seal at once—that is the usual course—I told him that Mr. Weil had got a parcel of 125 carats of bywaters, but the price was £8 a carat instead of £5 10s. or £6—that was after I had seen Mr. Weil—he said, "Never mind, come and get the goods "—I went to Mr. Weil again, and I got the parcel of 125 carats of bywaters—I next saw the prisoner in my office—he had come from the restaurant—I fetched him—I saw him in the restaurant, and told him I had the goods for him, and I took him to my office—I gave him the bywaters—I parted with them because he said he wanted them for Hoffmann and Co., and I believed that his statement was true—it was about two o'clock when he went away with the bywaters he was to return at once—he said he would return as soon as possible—I knew Hoffmann and Co.'s place was in the City—I remained at my office till 6.30 p.m—the prisoner did not return—when I left Hatton Garden I went up to the prisoner's brother's house at 32, Adolphus Road, Finsbury Park—I did not know the prisoner's address—I got there about seven.—I did not find the prisoner there, and I went back to Hatton Garden—between 8.30 and 9 o'clock I went back to the prisoner's brother's house—the prisoner came downstairs—I was in the hall when he was coming down—I said, "Where is your brother Louis?"—the prisoner said, "He is not in"—I said I did not believe it, whereupon the prisoner called upstairs to the bedroom, "<hi rend="italic">Tony,</hi> is Louis in?"—Tony is the prisoner's brother's wife—she answered, "Yes!" and I told him, "You say he is not in, and he is in"—and he said, "He is not in "—Mrs. Spitzel, who heard our conversation, answered a second time, "He is not in, my man is not in "—I had spoken aloud so that the brother's wife could hear—then she came downstairs and was very indignant that I did not believe her, and she told me that she had a telegram from her husband that he would not come home so early, as he had to see Mr. Abrahams, who owed him £900—I then took the prisoner into the front room—Mr. Katzin was in the passage—the brother's wife spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear—she aid not show me any telegram—when I was in the front room I asked the prisoner where my goods were—he said."I have, lost them "—I asked him, "Where did you lose</p>

               <p>them? "and he answered, "In the Tottenham Court Road," and then, "In Oxford Street"—I said, "Where have you been?"—he said he left the City at half-past four and took a cab from there to King Street, Covent Garden, to see a jeweller of the name of Partridge—he said he saw young Mr. Partridge, and that from there he went to Long Acre to see Messrs. Jones and Son, and from there he went to the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths' Company in Regent Street, but he did not go into their shop—he said it was a quarter to, five-when he was at Regent Street—I said, "How is it possible? You say you left the City at halfpast four, that you made all these journeys and saw all these different people, and yet you were in Regent Street at a quarter to five; that means a quarter of an hour!"—he said, "Well, it must have been earlier than half-past four when I left the City, and later than a quarter to five when I was in Regent Street"—he said he took an omnibus to Tottenham Court Road, and when he came to Torrenham Court Road he found he had lost his pocket-book—he said he took a cab to Moor Lane Police-station, and from there to Bow Street Police-station—I was crying bitterly for him to give me my goods back, and begging him to give them to me, as it was so heavy an amount, and by losing those goods I would lose my existence, and would be a ruined man for the rest of my life—I said, "I am sure you have not lost the goods, "and" You had better give me my goods, as it will be my ruin "—I waited in the brother's house till about half-past eleven, then I went with the prisoner to a restaurant in Islington—the brother did not return—the prisoner went up to the front bedroom and came back in a few minutes—I told him I thought his brother would not come back at all, and as I had not had anything to eat for the whole afternoon, I wanted to have something to eat—then he took me to this restaurant in Islington—he took me to the back room and he said, "You go on and have something to eat, and I shall be back in a second"—I said, "All right," but as soon as he went out I went after him—I was standing outside the restaurant and I saw him loitering at the opposite corner looking for some<lb/>body, and all at once I saw him jump in a cab—he was just driving away, or giving his directions to the cabman, when I jumped on the cab and caught hold of him, and said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I shall be back in a minute"—I told him, "That won't do, you know; I won't leave you until I have my diamonds back "—then he said, "You can believe me, I shall be back in a minute"—I said, "If you like to get out from the cab, do so; or, if not, I shall go with you"—he said, after some hesitation, "All right, you can come with me"—he then drove to a street I do not remember the name of, and told me to wait in the cab and be would be back in a few minutes—he knocked at the door, ran upstairs, and came back in a few minutes—it was seven or eight minutes' drive—I have seen the house since—we then both drove to a restaurant, and the cab was discharged—he said, "You can go in, and I shall be back in a second"—I said, "All right," and I did the same as before; I saw him go over the road, and I watched him from outside the restaurant—I saw him speaking to a girl whom he brought to this restaurant—when I saw him coming across the road I went in the back room and sat down—he came in with the girl, ordered something for her—afterwards he said he was very tired, it being very late, and he wanted</p>

               <p>to go home—I said, "I will follow you, I shall go with you"—he invited the girl, and we all three went back to the same house he had entered when I was in the cab—we went to the first floor and found another girl—the prisoner began to tell her he had lost such a heavy amount of diamonds—I said, "What is the good of talking to this girl? she cannot help you "—after about fifteen to twenty minutes' stay in this room the prisoner said he would go to bed—the girl stayed in the same room—I said, "Where am I to be?"—he said, "There is another room on the second-floor," and I went to it with the woman who came in the cab—I did not go to bed—I had nothing to do with the woman—the remainder of the night I was sitting near the window of the second-floor, which was only half a staircase off, and where I Could watch and hear every movement of the prisoner, and when I heard anything suspicious I opened the window—I went three times downstairs to see if the prisoner was still in that room, so that he should not go out without my being Able to follow and stop him—very early in the morning I turned the handle of his clock on about two hours to make him get up—about 7.30 I made his clock show 9.30—the clock was in the first floor bedroom on the mantelpiece—when he saw it was 9.30 he got up—we went to his brother's house, 32, Adolphus Road—the girls were left behind—the right time when we got to the brother's house was between 7.30 and 8 o'clock—the prisoner went up to the bedroom—I heard him say," Mr. Krolik is there," meaning me—the brother said, "I am getting up just now, I will be downstairs in a minute "—I was in the front room—the same room I had been in the night before—the prisoner and his brother came down—the brother said, "I am sorry to hear, my wife told me of the loss"—I said, "Look here, Mr. Spitzel, you know very well that your brother has not lost the diamonds, so I came to you to have influence upon him to give me back my goods; and why has your brother never lost his pocket-book when he had only 10 carats of diamonds or one parcel of your own in his pocket? Why did he only lose the pocket-book to-day, when he had such a heavy amount as he never had before in his pocket?"—Louis said, "Go with my brother wherever he wants you to go," meaning the prisoner, "and if you do not find the diamonds, then come back to my office to Hatton Garden, I shall be there, and I won't let anybody in to-day, and if you knock three times at the door that will be a sign that it is you, and I will open the door"—I did not leave off begging the prisoner to give me my goods back, and I said I did not dare to face my people who had entrusted me with such a heavy amount—at last he said "I will give you £500"—I went with his brother to the platform at the Finsbury Park Railway Station—I said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "You see your brother has not lost the diamonds; he offered me just now £500 "—the prisoner said he said that if he would be rich he would give £500—the prisoner, his brother, and I went from Finsbury Park Railway Station, the prisoner and myself to Moorgate Railway Station, and the brother to Farringdon Street—the prisoner and I went to Moor Lane Police-station—we saw the sergeant in charge—the prisoner said to the sergeant, "Has the pocket-book been found?"—the sergeant said, "No," and asked the prisoner a few more questions—I left with the prisoner and we went to Mr. Abrahams' office in Basinghall Street—he took me there, and on the ground floor—when we came to the back office,</p>

               <p>Mr. Abrahams saw the prisoner and myself come in—I knew Mr. Abrahams by sight—he said to his clerk, "Leave us alone and lock the door"—we' entered the front office—Mr. Abrahams was there—the door was closed, the clerk withdrew—the prisoner said to Mr. Abrahams, "I have lost my pocket-book"—Mr. Abrahams said, "I am very sorry," and while we were talking Mr. Abrahams took an envelope from a drawer and said, "I sealed up two parcels of melee on Monday morning and broke the seal in the afternoon "—he said, "This is the seal I sealed the envelope with "; he took out a thin brass seal from his drawer in his table; I understood that he sealed it with sealing-wax—it was a seal that would make an impression with sealing-wax—then Mr. Weil came to the office—he came in the same room—as soon as he came in he struck me—I was the person to whom he entrusted the diamonds—he then put some questions to the prisoner, but I was too ex<lb/>cited, through the presence of Mr. Weil and Mr. Gordon, who came in, and did not hear or see what was going on—Mr. Gordon, from Paris, gave the prisoner into custody at Islington—he is one of the firm from whom I had the four parcels—when I left Mr. Abrahams' office I went to Moor Lane Police-station, being the nearest station, to inquire what I could do—Mr. Weil remained to watch the prisoner—I next went to my solicitor to get a warrant—I next saw the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Weil struck me because I had lost £2,000 worth of diamonds—I had no right to part with them, being entrusted with them—ho was angry because I entrusted them to somebody else; to this particular man—one broker entrusts another broker with a parcel if asked—it is not the custom—I did not give Mr. Weil any explanation—it did not occur to me to explain—he did not say I ought not to have given them up to Spitzel—Spitzel was a broker, as I was—I sometimes tell the broker the name of my customer—it depends from whom I get the diamonds—there was nothing to prevent my offering the diamonds to Hoffmann and Co., but the prisoner told me he had known all the Australian diamond merchants very well, and would get a better chance than anybody else—if the prisoner had sold them we should have divided the commission—I only knew Hoffmann and Co. by reputation—I did not know they had bought from Lindenbaum and Weil—I do not remember having got goods from any broker—one broker has a better chance to sell to a merchant than another, because the merchant may like him better, and if the diamonds are from the factory at Amsterdam or elsewhere he thinks he can buy more cheaply than from a London house—the prisoner has not been in business in London three years I am sure—I have known him twelve months—he never sold anything for me—I had entrusted him with two parcels on the previous Saturday, also a diamond snuff-box, to sell—I understand a transaction is when business is done; he never did any business for me—I have not entrusted him with anything else—I keep no books showing these transactions—there is no record of the weight or value of the diamonds parted with—I did not tell Lindenbaums to whom I was going to show the diamonds—they did not ask me—they entrusted me with them upon my statement that I could sell them—that is the custom of the trade—the prisoner said his customer had not time to go through all the parcels in the morning—I told him to show them again</p>

               <p>in the afternoon—I did not say the envelope was sealed; I said it was fastened down like an ordinary letter—the initials "H. &amp; Co. "and the "£5" were written on it in ink—there was no wax—I saw the same envelope in Mr. Abrahams' office—I did not say I saw no sealing wax on it—I had seen Mr. Abrahams before, but did not know his name—I have seen him here—diamonds are always in a parcel—even if only a single stone—I told the prisoner to go back and try to get another 5s. a carat—the prisoner's words were not, "This is the price the firm offer me," but "This is the price Hoffmann and Co. offer"—the name of the firm had been mentioned before—I do not remember the words I used at the Police-court—I said there the name Hoffmann was mentioned—I do not know whether the prisoner was at home when the wife said he was not, and I did not go upstairs—I said I thought his brother would not come back and it was no use wait<lb/>ing, but I always thought he was at home—I have seen him here. and and his wife—before I left the brother's house I thought the prisoner had stolen the diamonds—I paid 8d. or 10d. for my dinner; the prisoner paid for himself—I do not know who paid the little amounts, I was too much confused—I think I paid the cab from Finsbury Park to Islington—I paid for my own room—I did not sleep with the girl—<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the woman.

A man named Vryburg made a declaration as to some silver which I had not given him possession of, and I was held liable for the duty—as it was still my property I agreed to plead guilty and pay £50—the total value of the goods the prisoner is alleged to have lost is over £3,500, the value of the goods obtained from Mr. Weil £2,000—that was in my pocket-book—I spoke to the prisoner in German—he has no office—the artistic value of the snuff-box was £150—Weil and Co. made an entry of the goods—I accept their statement as correct, and the vendee could test its correctness—the goods merely pass through my hands from vendor to vendee—the other goods were Mr. Gordon's, from Paris.</p>

I am assistant to my father, Edward Partridge, of 20, King Street, Covent Garden—he sometimes deals in diamonds—there is no other son in the business—there is no other person of that name in King Street—on 20th July the prisoner came and asked if Mr. Partridge was in—I said he was not, and the prisoner went out—I believe that was about 12.30—I cannot be certain of the hour—it was before a meal-time, but which meal I cannot say—he did not offer me any diamonds—he did not come between four and five to my knowledge—he did not call more than once—he did not mention the loss of a pocket-book, nor inquire about a pocket-book with diamonds in it.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Lindenbaum and Weil, diamond merchants, of Hatton Garden—Mr. Krolik got some of these diamonds from us—we first heard of the loss on the morning of the 21st, and I eventually went to Mr. Abrahams' office in Basinghall Street—I found Krolik, the prisoner, and Abrahams there—I said to Krolik in the prisoner's presence, "How could you be so foolish as to give such a large amount of goods to Spitzel?"—in my passion I struck Krolik; he made no reply before I did so; he hardly had time—I then asked the prisoner how it was he had lost them—he told me that at four o'clock in the afternoon he was at Mr. Abrahams' office, showing him some of these diamonds, and that from there he took a cab and went to King Street, Covent Garden, with the intention of showing these diamonds to Mr. Partridge; when he got there Mr. Partridge was not there, but his son was, and as his son did not buy any he left there; from there he went to Jones and Sons, of Long Acre—I asked him, "When you left Partridge, did you know you had these diamonds in your pocket? "—he said, "Oh yes, certainly, because I wanted to show them to Jones afterwards "; from there he went to Jones, and offered these goods to Mr. Harry Jones, and Mr. Harry Jones told him he was no buyer; from there he went to the Silversmiths' Company in Regent Street, but as it got too dark he did not go in to offer the goods—this was in July—from there he said he went to Oxford Street, and when he got to Tottenham Court Road he put his hand into the side of his pocket and he found that the pocket-book was missing—just as he was telling me this Mr. Lindenbaum came in—Mr. Abrahams was in and out of the office the whole time while the prisoner was telling me this—Abrahams said, "I sealed these goods yesterday," and he took out a brass seal to show me—I asked him if he had the envelope he sealed them in, and he went to the basket and said, "I suppose it is gone "—he rummaged about, but he did not seem to display any anxiety to find it, so he did not—Lindenbaum came in very excitedly, and said, "What is this about? "—I told him what the prisoner had told Mr. and he said, "What did you do after that, when you found the goods were missing?"—the prisoner said, "I went to Moor Lane Police-station to give notice "—Lindenbaum said, "It seems a very curious story, that if you lost them in the West-end you should go to the City to report the loss; it was rather strange you should not go first to the people you had gone to see, to see if you had left your pocket-book</p>

"—he said, "By cab to Oxford Street"—I said, "Do you think you may have left it in the cab, if so you should have gone on to Bow Street at once, and reported it there"—he said, "I know I had it in the cab because I took it pat and counted them"—I said, "Then you have certainly lost a lot of time in coming here; I cannot understand if you saw them in the cab, and felt them in your pocket in King Street, why you came here "—he said, "I was so confused I don't know where I lost them; I will go to Bow Street at once"—I said, "You might call here on your way back, and let me know if you have heard anything of them; say that you have reported the loss at this station "—he said, "I will," and left the station—I went off duty at eleven o'clock that night; he had not come back by eleven—I next saw him between nine and ten next morning, when he called at the station accompanied by Krolik—he stood for some few seconds, neither of them spoke, so I said to the prisoner, "Good morning; I suppose you have come to inquire about that loss of yours last night?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have not heard anything of them"—</p>

               <p>Krolik then half turned away from the desk; the prisoner leaned forward and said, "It was Mr. Abrahams I called on in Basinghall Street last night"—I was sitting at a double desk, about four feet from the prisoner, and he leaned over the part that was away from me when he said that—Krolik was close to the prisoner; they were standing side by side, both leaning over the desk when I first made the inquiry—Krolik half turned away when I said I had not heard anything of the diamonds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no note of this conversation—I said if he thought he had left them in the cab he should have gone to Bow Street, because that would be the nearest police-station to Oxford Street—I am not well acquainted with the police-stations near there—I said Bow Street, because he said he had felt them in his pocket in King Street; when he first came in he said he thought he had lost them in King Street, and knowing Bow Street was the police-station in the Covent Garden district, I thought he meant King Street, Covent Garden—I asked him what King Street, and he said Oxford Street, but I understood Covent Garden, because I knew King Street was near Covent Garden—I said if he had left them in the cab he ought to have gone to Bow Street, because I thought he would get out of the cab at the nearest point to King Street, Covent Garden—I told him if he went to Bow Street to say that he had given information of the loss at my station—immediately he had left, at ten minutes to five, I sent it on by wire to our chief office, and they circulated it—they would receive it at 26, Old Jewry, directly after he left my station—it would be wired on. in the ordinary course from there to Leman Street, and then to Scotland Yard, and it would be circulated from Scotland Yard.</p>

I carry on business at 64, Basinghall Street, as a merchant and exporter, dealing in every class of merchandise—on 20th July the prisoner called—I had known him three or four months as a diamond broker—on the previous Saturday, when he was showing me a diamond snuff-box, I had told him I wanted to buy a parcel of melee and a small parcel of bywaters—on the Monday, between eleven and twelve, he brought me two parcels one was over 100 and the other a little under 100, about 200 carats altogether—he asked £5 15s. for them—I told him the price would not suit—he told me to make him an offer, and I gave him a seal for £5—I told him I only bought for prompt cash, as I always have done since I have been in London—I took., an envelope out of my drawer, and gummed and wetted it, and sealed it up, and as I was taking out of my drawer the seal with the firm's name, J. H. and Co., on it a friend of mine in the office said to me, "Is that the way they do the business in London?"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "I will show you how we do the business in the Cape; thousands and millions pounds' worth of diamonds go through our firm," and he took the pen and wrote "I. A., £5," and crossed it—he is an intimate friend of mine, who is always in my office; he is Mr. Benjamin Weil—the prisoner went away with that envelope and with the diamonds in it—I stuck it down myself, and I was going to take the seal out of my drawer to seal it; but it was through my friend I did not</p>

               <p>put the seal "J.H. and Co." on it—it had been my habit to seal with sealing-wax before that—I gave a seal on the Saturday with sealing-wax, and the stamp with the firm's initials, "J. H and Co. "when he brought me the diamond box—on the Monday before he left he showed me some by waters, and asked £8 per carat—I said it would not suit; I said £5 10s. or £6—he asked me to give him a seal for them; I said I would not give him any more seals; I had made two offers, and I would not be bothered to give any more seals—the prisoner returned on the Monday after lunch, between three and four, as far as my memory serves me, bringing the sealed envelop back in the same state that I gave it to him in—he said "They will not accept it; if you will give five shillings more I believe I could get them for you "—I said that was my price, as I was buying for prompt cash—I then broke the seal, tore the top of the envelope right off—he put the diamonds into his pocket-book, and put it into the inner breast-pocket of his coat; he had no overcoat on—that was done before four people besides myself—I don't know what became of that particular envelope; in the ordinary course it would be among the waste paper; I tried to find it on the morning afterwards; I could not—I set my man looking among the waste paper—I think on that particular day the dustman called for the paper—I saw nothing more of the prisoner on that Monday after he left my office about four or a little after—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion that the prisoner left the diamonds with me; they were taken out of my office, and I can name three people in the City that saw them taken away; one is in Australia now—on the next morning, Tuesday, 21st, the prisoner and Krolik came to my office; I had not been there ten minutes, and was looking over my correspondence, and my office door was ajar, when they knocked and came in—I said, "What is it?"—the prisoner said, "I have brought Mr. Krolik down here to prove that I submitted to you a parcel of melee diamonds yesterday, and that you gave me a seal of £5 for the same"—Krolik asked me particularly what time he offered me the first parcel of diamonds; I told him between eleven and twelve; he asked me what time he showed me the other parcel of diamonds; I told him between three and four—he asked me what time he left my office; I told him I verily believed after four o'clock—Krolik asked me if I gave him a sealed envelope, and whether it was with sealing-wax—I said, "No; the envelope I gave him was an ordinary common envelope, and written across was 'I. A.,' and the price, and crosses all over the envelope"—I took an envelope, a duplicate of the one I gave the seal in out of the drawer, and showed him the class of envelope it was—I took the seal out of the drawer, and told him I sealed the diamond snuff-box on Saturday with that seal—nothing had been said or done about locking the door at that time; the door was open—there is no truth in the statement that directly they came into the office I said to my clerk, "Leave us alone," and locked the door; the door was never locked at any time—as this conversation went on Mr. Weil rushed in in a very excited state, without asking to come in; he had never been in my office before—he said, "Excuse me, Mr. Abrahams, for taking the liberty of doing what I have done"—I said, "All right; what is the matter?"—he told me the goods that he had lost belonged to their firm, and he asked me the same question as Krolik had done as to what time the prisoner had showed this parcel of goods to me, and what</p>

Hermann and Mr. Abraham Hermann, of 16, Barrack Street, Sydney—the firm does not exist in England, and they are not here; I do all their business in London, and always have done since I have been here—I next saw the prisoner on the Monday, between eleven and twelve, when ho showed me two parcels of melees, one of 100 and odd carats and some under 100—I found out the exact weight when I made the seal—I made no memo<lb/>randum—my friend Mr. "Weil wrote the £5 on it in figures, I did not—he is another Mr. Weil, not connected with the other one—he wrote "J.

Hermann and Co.—I sealed the snuffbox with their seal on Saturday, and I should have done the same on the Monday, only my friend interfered, saying, "Is that the way they do business in England?"—I was the buyer—that was put on the parcel, and the prisoner went away with it—when he went away he may have shown me two other parcels; I won't swear he did; he showed me some—they were mixed bywater—I gave him an order for bywaters in the morning between eleven and twelve—I did not give that order at the same time as the others, because the others were of most consequence—he came again between three and four, and showed me some bywaters, and I think another parcel of diamonds—I think the bywater was a parcel of 70 or 80 carat—I made no offer; the price they quoted did not suit me; he asked £8; I said £5 or £6—I broke the seal of the melees—I never sealed the bywaters—I had them in my hand—I handed them back to the prisoner, who wrapped them up and put them in his pocket-book, which he put in his side pocket—I did not see him fasten his pocket—when he put them in his pocket Louis Spitzel, Jacob Hermann, the member of the firm, Mr. Arberger, of Holborn, who I do not think is here, and Mr. Weil, who is not here, were present—Louis Spitzel is here—they could all see him put them into his pocket—Krolik, the prisoner, and Louis came back on the Tuesday—I will pledge my oath I did not have the door locked—nobody was present when Krolik and the prisoner came in on the Tuesday; others came in afterwards—when Weil put his hand on Krolik it was not a blow; it was to stop his mouth, because he said what he did not want him to say—he asked him if it was not Smith, and he said he had the offer from Abrahams; I don't know why he did not want him to say it—as he got the word Abrahams out of his mouth Weil put his hand over his mouth—he did not strike him in anger—I suppose he wanted him to say somebody else—I am telling the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to James George Andrews, licensed victualler, 154, Fleet Street; the house is known as the Portugal—the prisoner was in the employment as a barman for five weeks—I had occasion to suspect him, and watched him—on Saturday, 22nd August, about six in the evening, some persons came to the bar, after the prisoner had come down from his tea—about a quarter to six I left the bar for the purpose of watching him—I went out, as he thought to go into the billiard-room, but I turned into the private bar; from there I had a dis<lb/>tinct view of the till, but I did not see where the prisoner was standing at the time; he was serving—he served three drinks, which came to nine-pence—I could not see the amount of the coin that was handed to him; he went to the change-rack for change—I saw him drop one sixpence through the till—he ought to have dropped either a shilling or two six<lb/>pences—he put one coin through, took some coppers from the rack, and went towards the customer; I walked behind him, and heard him put the change on the counter—our till has four separate slots; there is a bell to each slot except the shilling slot; that was broken, and did not ring—each bell has a different sound—I saw the prisoner put one sixpence through, because the bell rang once—when he put the change on the counter I rushed from where I was and went behind the bar; the prisoner was standing behind the bar, with one hand flat on the counter, and his Tight hand with two fingers on the counter and the other two fingers doubled under—he turned round, and saw me stooping down behind him, watching—there was a water-jug on the counter; he picked it up, went with it to the tap, and dropped a coin from one hand to the other; he then returned to the counter, put the water-jug on the counter, and turned to go—I said, "What have you in your hand?"—I opened his hand and said, "It is the sixpence you should have put in the till"—I sent for a constable and sent the prisoner upstairs, and said I would have the constable waiting for him—he made no answer—I gave the constable the sixpence, and said I should charge the prisoner with steal<lb/>ing it.</p>

               <p>sixpences or one shilling in the till by the drinks coining to ninepence—there was a bit of a dispute at the station as to the coin which had been given him—he said it was two shillings; I said, "I cannot contradict you, because I did not actually see the coin "—if two sixpences had been given he would not have had to go to the change-rack—I could not see what he took from the rack, because it was hidden from my view—I did not speak to the customers, they had gone—I had been away for ten days before this—the takings rise and fall at times—the place where the prisoner took the jug to get the water is five steps lower down than the bar—I did not hear the customer ask for water; he might have done so—the prisoner said at the police-station that I had not given him time to put the sixpence in the till—I am certain the change was placed on the counter before the prisoner went for the water—I caught him with the sixpence in his left hand.</p>

               <p>to enter, and expostulated with the man for barring the door—he held up his hand and pretended to call someone by the name of <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, saying there was a party of them—I was surrounded by a crowd, and was not able to move; I felt a hand in my right-hand trousers pocket—I broke backwards through the persons, and then I observed several Bank of England notes fluttering about, which I supposed I had knocked out of the man's hand when pushing through—some of the notes went under the train—three or four people, among them the prisoner, sprang from the platform under the train and picked them up—I saw the prisoner coming up on to the platform again with bank notes in his right hand—I was about two feet off him—I demanded them, as they were mine—the prisoner said something, I don't know what; he tried to <hi rend="italic">bluff</hi> me—I then accused him of having picked my pocket—I caught him by the left arm and held his sleeve; there was no attempt on his part to break away; there was no struggle—I did not understand what he said when I demanded the notes—a man came up on the opposite side of the prisoner—he overheard me say to the prisoner that he had picked my pocket—he stopped for perhaps fifteen seconds on the prisoner's right side—he pushed his face round in front of me and told me I was a b-liar—I had not addressed that man; he passed down the platform—I saw nothing besides the notes in the prisoner's hands—I called for a policeman, and gave the prisoner into custody—I accompanied him to the police-station—I did not know how much money was on me when I was leaving the racecourse—I ascer<lb/>tained at the police-station how much I had—I calculated how much I had when I left the course, and I found notes to the amount of £35 were missing—I could not tell the numbers nor the denomination of the notes.</p>

I am a manufacturer of straw and fancy grass goods, at 10, Edmond's Place, Aldersgate Street—the prisoner travelled on commission for me—I got an order first from Mr. Glover, on 29th July—the prisoner showed him samples, and said that if Glover's people called he would have a commission, and Mr. Glover called, and we did a little business—the prisoner informed me that order was coming—the goods, value £2 8s., were sent off by Carter Paterson—I have not received the money—this endorsement on this cheque is not my writing, nor is this receipt—I never authorised the prisoner to sign for me; I have a banking account—the prisoner sometimes received money for mo when it was cash on delivery—I wrote to Mr. Glover when the money was not forthcoming—afterwards I asked the prisoner about it and he said, "It is nothing, I will give it to you; it is nothing to sign a cheque "—I afterwards gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, St. Paul's Crescent, Camden Town, and am a compositor—on Saturday, 15th August, about half-past eight, I was at the Queen's Arms, in the Caledonian Road—I saw the prisoner there with two companions, and got into conversation with them—I paid for some drink for them—we left together, and were proceeding towards the Angel, and while in North Street or Collier Street the prisoner deliberately struck me on the mouth with his fist, and knocked me down—at the same time I felt a hand clench my watch-chain, and the watch was taken out of my pocket—while I was on the ground I felt a hand go into my right-hand trousers pocket, and about 19s. 6d. was taken out; I also missed a pocket-knife—the prisoner and the other two ran away—I went home, and on Sunday night, about seven o'clock, I went to King's Cross Road Police-station and made a complaint, and gave a description of my watch—from there, as I was going towards the Victoria public-house, at the corner of York Road, I saw the prisoner talking to two other persons—I got up sufficiently close to identify the prisoner, and went to the corner of the street where there was a constable; he came with me, and I gave the prisoner into custody inside the Victoria public-house—when told the charge he said, "It is a mistake; he is mistaken altogether"—or words to that effect—I have not the slightest doubt of the prisoner's identity—my watch was worth £4.</p>

On 1st August I received informa<lb/>tion from Mr. Tiller, and went to his house—I examined the cellar and found the bolts were unfastened in the flap—no doors or windows were unfastened when the prosecutor came downstairs—the bolts were drawn from inside, and afterwards the entry was made from outside by lifting the cellar-flap, and passing through into the bar—I found the lock of the cupboard door had been forced off; an ice-pricker in the bar corre<lb/>sponded with the marks—I took the prisoner into custody on 24th August, and told him the charge—he said at the station he should not have done it if it had not been for the men, Thomas Oates (that is Adams's nick<lb/>name) and <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> Elder. "I saw them outside the house after closing time; we went for a walk round the houses, and afterwards came back, lifted the cellar-flap, and went downstairs, got into the bar, and took</p>

               <p>the money and handed it to the other two"—he afterwards made this longer statement: "About a fortnight before this burglary occurred I saw Adams outside the public-house, while cleaning the windows; he asked me how I was getting on; I said, 'All right. 'He asked me if I had any money; I said, 'No;' he said, 'Do you know of any<lb/>thing?' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'Cannot we do anything in here?' he meant the public-house, where I worked. On the night when I left off work I saw Adams and Elder outside; they asked me what I was going to do, and we had a walk round the house till two in the morning. We came back to the public-house again, and got through the flap, and went upstairs and got the money. I went downstairs. When I got the money we all shared, about £3 odd a piece."</p>

About half-past eight on the evening of 31st August I was on duty near this house—I saw both prisoners coming along Holland Road, from the direction of Hammersmith, looking at the houses and into the areas—I suspected them, and kept them under observation—at Holland Gardens they remained in conversation for about ten minutes; they kept looking at me, but I did not seem to take any notice of them—I was in uniform—I was about fifty yards from them—they were in conversation in Russell Gardens for ten minutes; they went some distance down Holland Road—I got into the gardens unobserved by the prisoners, and kept them under observation; I then lost sight of them near Addison Gardens—I remained very quiet in the gardens for twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, when I heard a loud smashing of glass—another constable who was keeping observation on the other side of the road came across the road, and we both had a look into a few areas, but could not find the prisoners—knowing 113 was under our control with no person in charge, we entered the area and found the prisoners half stooping in a dark corner there—I asked them what they were doing there—Brown said he came there to ease himself, and Hodgson said he came there to sleep—the scullery window was broken; by taking out three or four little pieces they could have entered—the other constable found a knife on Hodgson—at the station I found on Brown this box of silent matches, a candle, and some used matches, corresponding with those found on Brown, were found in the area.</p>

I was walking along Old Street towards my home on the night of the 14th August, and saw the prisoner and two other men following the prosecutor—I walked smartly past them, and stood under the shadow of a wall, and watched what took place under the tree—I saw the prisoner from behind the prosecutor deal him a smart blow, and he struck him again, as the prosecutor half-faced him, and knocked him on to the ground—the other two men sprang from the edge of the kerb, and caught hold of the prosecutor as he was on the ground—I came out and engaged with the prisoner, and after giving him two or three smart punches I turned my attention to the prosecutor; the other two men made a pretence that they were picking the prosecutor off the ground—the prisoner, whom I held, said, "You have no business to interfere in this; why do you interfere?"—I said, "I saw you strike him a cowardly blow"—he said, "Do you know what he has been doing to me?"—I said, "No"—he made a motion with his hands—I said, "What do you mean by that?'—he said, "He made an indecent assault on me"—I said, "Where did he do that?"—he said, "In the urinal down there"—I said, "You waited till you got here?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "It is a lie, because I watched you from the urinal"—his friends said, "You had better do a <hi rend="italic">guy,</hi> Charlie"—I said, "He does not do a <hi rend="italic">guy</hi> now," and I sent a bystander for the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman, of 7, Russell Street, Covent Garden—on 12th March I had a house to let at 29, Philip Road, Peckham, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From G. Porter, of</hi> 28, <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Road, Clapton Park, saying that he had called to see the witness about the house in Rye Lane, but not finding him at home he enclosed his references, namely, his landlord, Mr. Smith, of</hi> 175, <hi rend="italic">Sandringham Road, Dalston, and Mr. Vagle, of</hi> 78, <hi rend="italic">Leyton<lb/>stone Road, Stratford</hi>) <hi rend="italic">—I</hi> wrote to Mr. Smith, and received this reply:—"Dear Sir, <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> G. Porter,—I have every reason to believe you will find in him all that can be desired in a tenant, etc.—Yours truly, H. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi> "—I then wrote to 394, Milfield Road, and received a reply from the prisoner, which I have lost; I then wrote, telling him his reference was quite satis<lb/>factory,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189109140079"/>
               <p>and I would call and see him any evening he chose to mention—he replied that as he was out so much, travelling in the boot and shoe trade I might call several times and not find him, but he would call on me the following evening, March 18th—he did so, and I agreed to let him the house, and said that an agreement should be prepared in a few days—I told him I had moved nearer the market, and had no use for my pony, phaeton, and harness—he said he had a friend who would most likely purchase them—the price was £30—on March 20th he called again, and executed this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was to take the house by the year, at</hi>£32 <hi rend="italic">rent, payable quarterly, subject to a quarter's notice after the first year</hi>)—I handed him the keys of the house, and he said his friend would call on me—two men called, one gave the name of Allen, and said he was a veterinary surgeon; they looked at the lot, and agreed that I should take them for a drive the following Sunday, when they were to decide; but before that I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Offering to buy the pony and cart if the witness had not sold them, having had an accident to his own pony, and stating that he would call that evening.</hi>)—he called and arranged to come the following Friday morning to try the pony—he said he had had an accident with his cob in Lea Bridge Road—I took him for a drive, and his friend, who called himself Allen, drove by us and pulled up outside the park; we went into a public-house and drank, and Allen said, "I see you have got my friend Porter out with it; I was coming about it next Sunday"—I said, "Being my tenant, and a sound man, I prefer letting him have it, to a stranger"—I finally sold it to the prisoner for £28; he paid £5 on account, and said he had some heavy bills out, but he would forward me £5 in the course of the week to make up the £10, and would finish the whole in a month—I let the prisoner go into my house, believing Mr. Smith's reference was true, and I let him purchase the pony and cart, he having had an accident, and being my tenant, and having a good reference, I thought it would be better for me to oblige a tenant—on May 12th or 13th, in consequence of something which came to my knowledge, I went to 29, Philip Road, Peckham, and found the yard-gate open, the yard door torn off its hinges, and only one sound lock left in the house, some of the others had been removed and others broken; the shelves were torn out of the wardrobe cupboard, half the door taken away from the coach-house, the lamp taken from the hall, and a pair of steps taken away—the fixtures were included in the rent—I-found no one there—the key had disappeared—about a month ago I saw my pony at Aldridge's, with five inches of his tail cut off—it is one of the best ponies in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner,</hi> I employed a woman who lived opposite, to hold the keys of the premises—I never promised you £2 commission if you found a buyer for the pony, but my wife said, "We will take a little pity on him on account of the accident," and £2 was taken off—I have found out that Francis Allen had his van in your stable—the rent was to be paid quarterly from March 25th, and you went out on the 11th or 12th May; all the money I have received from you was £5 for the pony—I do not know whether you lent any furniture in; I saw two chairs through the window—I found heaps of straw in every room—you suggested the agreement.</p>

I am stationed at Chingford-in the early morning of 23rd July I was at the Police-station when the prisoner was brought in by the last witness—he stated in her hearing that he had found her near the hotel, and that she had told him she had drowned her children—I took down her statement—she said her name was Mary Jane Heathcote—I asked her if what she had told Mr. Hicks was true—she said, "Yes"—I cautioned her, and said, "Where are your children?"—she replied, "In the water; I walked into the water with my children and left them there; I tried to drown myself, but the water was not deep enough; I then walked out"—I said, "How old are your children?"—she said, "Five, and three years"—I said, "What are their names?"—she said, "Florrie and Cissy"—I said, "What is your husband's name?"—she said, "Joseph Heathcote, residing at 69, Kynaston Road, Stoke Newington"—I said, "Where are the children?"—she said, "In the water, in Epping Forest"—I said, "Why did you do it?"—she said, "We have all been ill"—she signed that statement—I noticed that her clothing was saturated; everything was wet—it is about seven miles from Kynaston Road to Chingford—the matron found this book.</p>

At half-past twelve in the early morning of 23rd July I was called up by the last witness; I went to the Police-station and found the prisoner there in custody—I asked her where her children were—she said, "In a stream in Epping Forest"—I asked her why she had drowned them—she said, "I did not want to go home, as we had all been ill"—I asked her if she had been drinking—she said, "No, I never drink"—I got assistance, and made a search in the neighbourhood, and in about an hour and a half found the dead bodies of two female children floating in a brook on Chingford Plain; the water was about nine inches deep and about four and a half feet wide—I had the bodies brought to the station, and the prisoner was then charged with having murdered them—she made no reply—they were identified by the father the same day—Mrs. Jackson identified them on the 25th at the inquest.</p>

               <p>that afternoon, and as he was not there he would take the things Mr. Hamilton said he was to have. He then asked me for six white shirts, two ties, a hat, seven pairs of socks, and nine collars. He choose them from the stock; the value was £2 5s. I gave him the things. I gave him the goods believing his statement that Mr. Hamilton said he was to have them. I told Mr. Hamilton on Tuesday morning. Prisoner said he would settle up with Mr. Hamilton. I knew prisoner before; he used to have things from the shop. I have been told not to give credit,"—this prisoner was then sworn and said, "I know prisoner, and have done so for six months; he has dealt with me before, and paid for them. I did not give prisoner any authority to obtain the goods on Monday evening. I had seen prisoner in the morning, and told him I was going out for the day. On the 14th Stanfield spoke to me; I went to prisoner's lodgings. I said, 'What do you mean by fetching things from my place, getting the things from my boy?' He said, 'I'll settle with you. I said, 'Yes, at Brentford,' He came to the shop afterwards. I told him I was going to get out a warrant for him. He said, "If you talk to me I'll punch you in the b----mouth.s' The boy has orders not to give credit." George Felton was then sworn. (<hi rend="italic">Evidence at page</hi> 1135)—on that a remand was ordered till July 18th, when the boy gave evidence again, and said, "Mr. Hamilton told me to say that the prisoner said he had seen Mr. Hamilton and that he was to have the things; what he actually said was, "Is Mr. Hamilton in?"; I said, "No"; and he said, "I want some things;" and he then chose them and he took them away—he said he would settle with Mr. Hamilton. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told Mr. Hamilton the first story was not true, and he said, "Well, that's what you will have to say at Brentford."—on that the charge was dismissed, and Hobbs took out a warrant.</p>

I think you are a thief "—he said, "All right," and went downstairs with<lb/>out any boots on—I fancied I had heard the voice before—it was dark; there was no lamp—he ran downstairs, unbolted the scullery door, and ran out—I found a coat belonging to my grandson in the scullery, marked as if somebody had been lying on it—I was the last person who went to bed—I missed a small brooch.</p>

"—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Where? "—he said, "At the bottom of the hill"—I said, "You came across London Bridge"—he said, "No"—I found he was wearing two overcoats, two jackets, one waistcoat, and two pairs of trousers—I said, "Do you usually wear as much clothing as this? "—he said, "Yes, you don't want a fellow to catch cold"—I told him his answers did not satisfy me; he would have to go to the station, and be charged with, the unlawful possession—he replied, "All right"—I took him to the station, where I found on him this rent-book, pawn-ticket, and latch-key—he was wearing no boots, only a pair of socks—the prosecutor afterwards identified the clothing, and the prisoner was discharged and re-arrested on the charge of burglary.</p>

Great Dover Street—I said, "Would you like your boots?"—he said, "Yes "—I gave them to him, and he put them on—he afterwards said, "They don't belong to me; I changed my boots away for the clothing"—the boots were found in the place.</p>

I am a tailor's cutter, of 181, King David's Road, Birmingham—I know Mr. and Mrs. Frank Akehurst—that is Mrs. Akehurst in the dock—I met her in High Street, Birmingham, two and a half years ago, and asked her how Frank was, in a bantering manner; she said she aid not know, but she would make it hot for him yet—I saw her again in 1888, and asked her how Frank was; she said, "To hell with Frank"—I also met her in 1885, and had a conversation with her about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 80, Stockwell Road—on Sunday morning, 26th July, I was going home alone along South Lambeth Road, and was accosted by two girls; they caught hold of me by the arms; I pushed them, and told them to go away—one of them called "Jem," and Morris rushed on me from behind a pillar by the railway bridge—we struggled and fell; we got up, he struck me, and we fell again—he whistled, and then four or five more men rushed on me when I was on the ground a second time—I recognise Mackey as one of the other men, and I could recognise the others if I saw them—the three or four men robbed me of 7s. 8d. and a scarf-pin, and kicked me in the side—I cannot say who took the things—I kept hold of Morris till a constable came—I was on the ground—I gave him in charge for assaulting and robbing me—he did not say anything to the charge—the divisional surgeon was sent for to strap my head, as it and my eye were cut open—my hip was kicked, and this finger was about the size of three—I next saw Mackey at the Police-station at twelve p.m. on Thurs<lb/>day, 30th; I identified him without any hesitation among others.</p>
