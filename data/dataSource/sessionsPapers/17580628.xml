               <p>Mary Newman. The prisoner came to wash for me about a month ago. I went out for some beer, and left a gold-ring set with garnets hanging on a hook by the fire-place, she being then alone in the house, I suppose took it, for I missed it directly after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it again?</p>
               <p>Newman. The prisoner told me she had given it to her sister, but first she absolutely denied knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone before you returned?</p>
               <p>Newman. No, she did not go away till she had done her work.</p>

               <p>I picked the ring from off the ground, and thought it had been a brass one, so I put it in my pocket, and gave it my sister.</p>

               <p>Anne Sennet. I came up to London to look for a daughter. I had been at London-bridge on Sunday last, and coming into St. Giles's, I went into an alehouse, this man at the bar was sitting there, he said I think you are a country woman of mine; I said I cannot tell that; he said he knew I was; then he asked me to drink with him; I said I had called for a pint, so as I had drank with him, I made him drink with me; then he said he had seen me at Derby, and desired I would call upon him at his lodgings, at one Mr. Welch's in <placeName id="t17580628-4-crimeloc19">Church-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17580628-4-crimeloc19" type="placeName" value="Church-street"/>

                        targets="t17580628-4-off16 t17580628-4-crimeloc19"/>. This was about eleven o'clock on that Sunday night; I eat a little victuals with him; I said I wanted to buy a pair of shoes; he said his wife wanted a pair too, but he could not afford to buy her a new pair, he would buy her a pair of second hand ones. We went and bought a pair of new for me, and a second hand pair for her. We walked about till night; he had seen me draw out half a guinea from my pocket, to pay for a reckoning. I was then for going to my lodgings, he said there were such riffraff sort of people about, that would rob me, and they carried me bodily up to their own garret, where they lay. When I saw what a poor sort of a destitute nasty place it was, I would not stay; then they said they would conduct me to where I lodged. They had made me pull my shoes and stockings off; I left my stockings behind me; they both came down stairs with me. When we were walking along, he put his hand into my pocket, and said you will be robbed, give me this money.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Sennet. This was about eleven at night; I said no body will rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take your money?</p>
               <p>Sennet. He did, he took all I had, which was a 3 l. 12 s. a 36 s. and a 27 s. piece, and two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to prevent him?</p>
               <p>Sennet. I did, from putting his hand in, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out?</p>
               <p>Sennet. I did not, I was afraid of being used ill, and being a stranger in the city, I desired him not to take my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What country woman are you?</p>
               <p>Sennet. I come from Liverpool. I went to my lodgings, and said nothing of it till morning, then I went to their lodgings, and the woman where they lodged, told me she believed they were run away, and that in her debt for a week's lodging. I ran out immediately, and by inquiring found one had gone from the door one way, the other the other way. I ran the way I was informed the man went, and soon met with them both together; he ran away upon seeing me; the woman got a parcel of woman to mob me, and there they spouted water upon me, and called me many such names, that I am ashamed to mention, so that I was ashamed to stay in the street. When I asked her where her husband was, she said he was here and there and every where. I insisted upon having my money, then she said her sister-in-law would help me to it. I went with her, and we found one who said she was her own sister;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280004"/> she gave her a very bad character, and would do nothing for her. I would not part with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the man taken?</p>
               <p>Sennet. He was taken last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman assist in the taking your money from you?</p>
               <p>Sennet. She did, she got hold on me at the same time that he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. from R. Finley. Did not I drink with you in Derbyshire ?</p>
               <p>Sennet. I do not know that you ever did; you told me in London you had seen me at Derby.</p>
               <p>R. Finley. She is as vile a drunken woman as any in England, she wanted to lie along with me, and my wife came and catched me upon her, in my room that night.</p>
               <p>J. Finley. I did catch her and my husband in an indecent action.</p>

            . I am a constable, last Sunday I was sent for to the house of one Flannagan, at the Hampshire hog, St. Giles's, there was the man at the bar; I was ordered to take him into custody, I searched him, and found a 36 s. piece and two guineas, (producing them) upon him, which he acknowledged to be the prosecutrix's money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutrix there at the time?</p>
               <p>Blyth. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she charged him with robbing her?</p>
               <p>Blyth. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Blyth. He said she gave him the money. I asked him what he had done with the 3 l. 12 s. he said he had changed that in St. Paul's-churchyard, and it wanted 3 s. of weight; then I said what have you done with the 27 s. piece, he said he knew nothing of that.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner brought a silk petticoat, a Holland sheet, and six aprons, a table cloth, and a handkerchief to pawn to me.</p>

               <p>White. She laid them in her own name.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you give her liberty to pawn any of these things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>White. The prosecutrix came to our house with a list of the things, and desired me not to let the prisoner have them, till she herself came with her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280005"/> After that she came with a warrant, and I delivered them all up.</p>

               <p>William Smith. I went along with the prosecutrix to the justice for a warrant, and took up the prisoner, who owned to me she had taken every thing mentioned in the indictment, and where they were pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say the prosecutrix gave her leave to pawn them?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, she did not, we went and fetched the goods from the pawnbroker's, and before the justice, though blind, swore to them all; she swore she cut out her own shifts, aprons, and gowns; that the shifts, petticoat and aprons were of her own making, (an apron is put into her hand.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is not of my making, nor my apron. She takes up her aprons, petticoat and table cloth, and mentioned particular marks on each, and shew'd them very exactly.</p>

My maid came down, and went into the back room. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280006"/> was describing her to my maid, presently the prisoner came down with a lap full of things; she went out, I opened my door, and followed her, I took her by the arm, and asked her who she belonged to, she said what was that to me; I said hussy how dare you to go into that house, do you know any body there; she said no, then said I what did you go there for; she again said what is that to you; I pulled her by the apron, and observed in it a blue and white gown, and a black quilted petticoat; I asked her how she came by them, she immediately ran up stairs, and flung them out of her apron, with other things, them I knew, (taking them up from amongst the others.) Coming down, she laid hold of an old waistcoat that belongs to a poor man, that lodges in another room, she said to me, you impudent jade, how dare you stop me, I was directed here to hire a room, and am a dealer in old cloaths, this is all I had in my apron, shewing me this old waistcoat, (producing one) this I know to be the poor man's property I mentioned, that was lying at the bottom of the stairs. I sent for Mrs. Macquire, she came home, and went up to the door, and returned, and said it was broke open; said the prisoner will you swear your door is broke open; she said she would, then said the prisoner I will sent for a smith; a smith was sent for, who said the lock was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take this waistcoat?</p>
               <p>Sprage. I saw her take it up at the bottom of the stairs, the poor man is a watchman that lives in the house, I have seen him with it on many times.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Sprage, I saw the prisoner take up the waistcoat, and know it is the property of a poor watchman that watches in Red-Lion-street, he lodges in that house where the prosecutor does; I saw her put it into her apron, when my mistress took hold of her she swore and curst at a desperate rate.</p>

               <p>Clark. She said she was a buyer and seller of old cloaths. When she went up stairs to put the things out of her apron, my mistress followed her and would not let her get away, she sent me for Mrs. Macquire, a constable was sent for afterwards, and she was secured.</p>

I found there were missing a card with twelve pair of sleeve buttons, set with Bristol-stones.

I got a constable, and took him to the Fountain tavern, there he confessed he opened the shew-glass, and took them out.

            . As I was passing through St. Pis church-yard, I saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and saw him pull out a handkerchief; I thought he put it in his bosom, but it went I believe to a confederate, for there was one on each side of him. I laid hold on the prisoner, and said to the prosecutor, that is your chap; I believe he has got your handkerchief; he felt, and said, he had lost his; so we secured the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Queen's Head-court, Newgate-street. On Thursday, the 1st of this instant, June, I had been at the Rainbow coffee-house on Ludgate-hill with one Mr. Moore, and other gentlemen. Coming away, a little before twelve at night, as soon as I came by Ashley's punch-house, a woman (not the prisoner) took hold of my arm and said, I should go into a house with her, and give her a glass of wine: I told her I was not for her purpose, having a family, and was going home; she still kept by my side; when I came to the end of the <placeName id="t17580628-10-crimeloc57">Old-Bailey</placeName>

There are generally about a dozen such creatures standing there; so that neither a man nor modest woman can pass at that time without difficulty; I have had overtures made to me, since the prisoner has been in confinement, that I should have my ring again, if I would not prosecute.</p>

My husband is at sea; and I have 9 s. per week allowed me; I did not appear dressed like a whore or a bunter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not desire the prisoner's life: I have this to add in her favour, there were no threats made use of at the time. I could not lay the indictment in any other manner than it is; for had I laid it for privately stealing the ring, that would certainly have failed, as I both saw and felt the ring go.</p>

On the 22d of March last, the prisoner, (I believe it was) came to my house, and asked for a tankard of beer, and went into a little room, about a quarter of an hour before eight at night; he had a tankard brought to him; having a light, he cared for the news-paper, which was carried to him I believe he was there about four or five minutes; he threw out the beer, and went out with the tankard at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, did you see it?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, I did not, he could not one any other way out of that room, but must have been seen; and the sash was left up, which I am sure was down before he went into the room a man came immediately, and said, a man had jumped out at my window. My boy and I nt into the room directly and found it as I have- lated.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in first ?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. The boy did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280009"/>Q. Are you sure he did not put up the window before you got in?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I am sure there was not time enough for that?</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the tankard.</p>
               <p>Dorrington. It cost 7 l. 13 s. being twenty-five ounces, and thirteen pennyweights; we looked about to see if we could see him lurking about, but saw nothing of him; I advertised two guineas reward in the Public Advertiser, and also in the Daily Advertiser; nothing came on it. Some days after, I met a gentleman who asked me if I had heard of what I had lost; and said a gentleman had a tankard cut to pieces, and wrote me a direction where to find him, I went, it was the prisoner that had it in his possession, cut into pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He is a broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you or are you not certain as to the prisoner being the man that night?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live ?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He lives in a place called the Devil's Gap, Drury-lane. I told him I was come to look at a tankard that he had got cut to pieces, and that I came from Mr. Sanders, then he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion as to the man when you saw him at his own house?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Then I thought he was about the size of the man that had stole my tankard; as to his face I did not see it before, but by his speech I thought he must be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by the pieces?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He told me two country-men brought it to him, and he stopped it. I asked him why he had not stopped the men as well as the tankard; he did not make any great manner of answer to that; at last he said he would let it alone for them to come again to prove it to be their property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was cut to pieces when they brought it?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him then?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, I did not; I staid till after my boy had seen him; I asked him why he had not advertised it; he said he had had it but a few days; the person that gave me directions, said he had had it nine or ten days. I lost it the 22d of March, and this was the 15th of April, that I first saw it; after this he did advertise it; I could not positively swear to it; I went again after this, and asked him if any body had been to own it; he said there had been a woman, who said, part of it was her's, but she would not swear to it; I desired him to let people publickly come for to see it; he said he would advertise it twice more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it advertised afterwards?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, I never saw it advertised above once after that: I had information he had sold it to a Jew. I went to see whether he had or not; he was not at home; I saw his wife; she said what can you want to see it any more for, you have seen it twice; the next time I saw him he said he had had the misfortune to have his house broke open, and they had stole the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after you had heard he had sold it?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. It was; then I went to the person who informed me he had sold it, and asked him, if he could prove that the prisoner had sold it; he said he could; and could shew me the receipt; here it is (producing one.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say it was stole from?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He said it was stole out of a cupboard in the house?</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you this receipt?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Justice Fielding obliged the Jew to deliver it; the Jew is here to be examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Jew say he had done with it?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He said he had sold it to a refiner.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces was it cut into?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. It was cut into sixteen; there were two pieces stuck so tenderly together, that it would come in two, so be seventeen pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces did the Jew say there were of them he bought?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He told me there were sixteen pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the receipt mention the number?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, that only says a parcel of pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Jew's name?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. His name is

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When do you say you lost your tankard?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. About a quarter of an hour before eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280010"/>Q. You say you cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I cannot swear to his face; but I believe he is the man that took it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window is yours?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. It is a sash window?</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a screw to it to keep down the sash?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it easy to get out at ?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Any body might get out at it, by putting the sash up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner offer the pieces to you if you would swear to them?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He did, but there had been care taken that the marks were cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he advertise it ?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. It was that he had stopped a parcel of silver, and that the owner might have it again upon paying the advertisement.</p>

            . I am about fourteen years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you at church?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was at church about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not go very often ?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, I do not now. I used to go every Sunday before I lived at a publick house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what it is to take an oath?</p>
               <p>Roper. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever sworn before?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was, before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the nature of an oath?</p>
               <p>Roper. It is to speak nothing but the truth ?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what a crime it is not to speak the truth?</p>
               <p>Roper. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Roper. I live with Mr. Dorrington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Roper. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see him?</p>
               <p>Roper. I first saw him the twenty-second of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Roper. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How, and where did you see him? tell your story, be careful, and keep to what is strictly truth.</p>
               <p>Roper. That I will. The prisoner came into my master's house, and as he was going into a little room, I lighted him in with a candle, and asked him what he would please to have, he said a tankard of beer: I went and asked my master whether I should carry a silver tankard; I had left the door open, and my master looked in, then he said yes, I might. I carried him a tankard; then he asked for the news-paper; I carried it in, and he shut the door, and in about four or five minutes after that, he was gone out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Roper. He had a blue surtout coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a waistcoat ?</p>
               <p>Roper. I could not see that, his coat was buttoned over it.</p>
               <p>Q. How else was he dressed ?</p>
               <p>Roper. He had a shabby cocked up hat, and a brown cut wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit with his hat on or off?</p>
               <p>Roper. He sat with it on.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider what you are about; the man's life depends greatly upon what you say; be careful, and speak nothing but what you know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a fire in the room?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, there was a coachman came in, and told us there was a man gone out at the Window. I went into the room, and my master followed me, and found the man and tankard were gone, the sash was put up, and the curtains drawed close.</p>
               <p>Court. Mention the words the coachman said.</p>
               <p>Roper. He said what are not the doors wide enough that people are forced to come out of the window?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had carried the news-paper in?</p>
               <p>Roper. This was about four or five minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you that four or five minutes?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was sitting at one of the boxes in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master?</p>
               <p>Roper. He was in the bar, I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing your master had not been in the bar, might not the man have come out at the door without your seeing him?</p>
               <p>Roper. I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that man after this?</p>
               <p>Roper. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Roper. I saw him come out of his house, and another man with him, and as soon as he saw me he ran down a court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280011"/>Q. What sort of a man was it?</p>
               <p>Roper. I did not mind him much; that man lives next door to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Roper. Because I had seen him go in there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there before ?</p>
               <p>Roper. I had been after the prisoner the day before, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that other man the day before ?</p>
               <p>Roper. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he ?</p>
               <p>Roper. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw the day before?</p>
               <p>Roper. I am not sure, but I think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen that man the day before, and believed him to be the same man that lives next door to the prisoner, describe what sort of a man he is.</p>
               <p>Roper. He is not very tall, he had a brown coat on the next day, but had a blue one on then. The prisoner said to him, as soon as he set eyes on me, d - n you this is our way, and turned down as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other man go with him?</p>
               <p>Roper. They both ran together; we went round the other way to see to take them, but they got into some house.</p>
               <p>Q. What should make the other man run?</p>
               <p>Roper. I do not know, they were both going together, they were not running when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that day?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, I did not, he was taken up that night; my master went to justice Fielding directly after I had seen the prisoner and knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Roper. I saw him the next day at justice Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Roper. He was dress'd in a brown coat; I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to him there?</p>
               <p>Roper. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Roper. He did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you you was mistaken ?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took the tankard?</p>
               <p>Roper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or that he leaped out of the window?</p>
               <p>Roper. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Roper. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run away when you saw him the second time?</p>
               <p>Roper. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the tankard was lost.</p>
               <p>Roper. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you believe it was?</p>
               <p>Roper. I believe about a month after. He was examined the 18th of May, and that was the day before that I saw him run.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call running ?</p>
               <p>Roper. He laid hold on the other man's arm, and made off as fast as he could; the gentleman that was with me saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no account how he came by the tankard before the justice?</p>
               <p>Roper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room all the while?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the justice ask him that?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, I did not hear the justice ask him any questions; I am a little hard of hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice any other time?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was every time he was there. I was there the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the justice said to him then ?</p>
               <p>Roper. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room all the time?</p>
               <p>Roper. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend from what you saw that the justice was talking to him?</p>
               <p>Roper. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. During that four or five minutes you say he was in the room at your master's, did no body call for any beer?</p>
               <p>Roper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit at the same place all that time ?</p>
               <p>Roper. I did, and never stirred out of it till I went to go into the room.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house on the 16th of May, the last witness was with me. Just before we went into the house, I said to the boy, be sure if there is any men there, take particular notice of their faces, and be punctual in what you say. When we came into the room, there was a little back room, there sat the prisoner at the bar and another man along with him, seemingly at breakfast; it was so dark I could not distinguish faces. When we went out, I said to the boy, you could be no judge where you stood. No the boy said, but he said that was much such a man, the nearest to me. We went over the way, and staid some time, the prisoner at the bar and another man came out of the house and walked pretty fast. I and the boy went after them, and the boy ran by them. As soon as the boy got by the man that was with the prisoner, he turned and stared in the prisoner's face; the prisoner look'd at the boy's face, and catched at the other man's sleeve, and away they went down a turning. I said to the boy, do you know either of them; the boy said the biggest in the brown coat, is the man that I served with the tankard of beer. I went down the next turning, and the boy with me, and had they come through where they turned down, we should have met with them, but we could see nothing of them. I went and look'd down Bow-street, and am sure it was impossible for them to get down that street before I got where I did. I fancy they must go into some house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>Disdel. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the justice ask him any questions ?</p>
               <p>Disdel. He asked him what was become of the tankard ? he answered he did not know. The justice asked him what Jew he sold it to; he made no answer to any purpose, but said if it was Mr. Dorrington's tankard, he must have it again, that was all he said he knew about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of his being in Mr. Dorrington's house and calling for a tankard of beer.</p>
               <p>Disdel. He denied that.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>

               <p>Disdel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come out publickly at the fore door afterwards?</p>
               <p>Disdel. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the dark room?</p>
               <p>Disdel. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he before the justice give an account how he came by the tankard ?</p>
               <p>Disdel. I don't remember he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the justice ask him where he had it?</p>

I am a peruke-maker; I was coming by the Castle in King's-street, I think, on the 22d of March; a man jumped out at the windows and almost knocked me into the kennel; I said, what is there not room enough, but you must come out at the window!

               <p>Knighten. Seventeen pieces, and two small slips.</p>

               <p>Knighten. No, I suppose it was not, there was no name, no proof, no mark, nothing at all, if there had been the whole tankard, there must have been the mark, name, or proof.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. What money did Dorrington offer to you?</p>
               <p>Knighten. I shew'd my receipt to Mr. Dorrington, he said he would give me a note of hand of twenty pounds while he kept it. I said I would not part with my receipt for a hundred pounds. This was at Mr. Dorrington's house; I went away, and in the afternoon, going by his house again, crying old cloaths about, they called me in. I asked if they had heard any farther about it, they said no. About five or six days after that, they took me with a constable, and brought me to justice Fielding's, and from thence to goal, and put me an iron on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take you up for?</p>
               <p>Knighten. I do not know, I was cleared on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dorrington. On what account was the Jew taken up?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He would not let me have the receipt to shew to Mr. Fielding on any consideration, and the justice desired he should be examined.</p>

            , Bishopsgate-street, the prisoner at the bar came in that night about nine o'clock, and called for a negus in a tankard; my wife said to me, I have some suspicion of that gentleman, I don't choose to send him in a silver tankard. She sent it in in a China quart mug. I went in about three or four minutes after, he asked me to drink, there was very little left. I wondered it should be gone so soon I went out again, my house was very full at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone?</p>
               <p>Askew. Yes, and went into a room by himself, in the middle of my house. I went in again in about three minutes after, and the liquor was all gone; he called for the boy to shew him up the yard. After he was got to the necessary-house he put the candle out, and bid him go about his business. I imagine he wanted to see whether there was any back way out. After that he came in again, and called for a tankard of beer, and a welch rabbit, they were carried him. My wife being suspicious of him, bid me look out a little sharp. After he had had it about five or six minutes, the beer was drank up, the rabbit eat, the window throw'd up, and the curtains drawn back, and he had got the tankard in his hand, but happily prevented, I did not lose mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not you sash up before he went into the room?</p>
               <p>Askew. I am positive it was not; there was a pin to fasten it down, that he took out to throw up the sash.</p>

He said I'll stop it till you bring sufficient proof how you came by it. I went down to Tring after him with a warrant granted by justice Fielding, and took another man along with me; we got it back'd by Esquire Walker of Barkhamstead.

               <p>Paul Deingraman. About eleven o'clock, on, I think, a Tuesday morning, rather more than a month ago, while I was speaking to one of the gentlemen which were with me, being in the same room with the prisoner and the deceased, about five or six feet from him, the deceased cryed out for help; I turned, and saw the prisoner standing on his legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. About two feet from him; they had been sitting on one bench together, when I saw them before; when I saw the blood, it surprized me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see blood ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280016"/>Deingraman. The deceased opened his breast, and I saw it there, he said, Oh, he was stabbed! he was stabbed. The prisoner being near him, I judged that it came from him; I took the deceased in my arms, and went down stairs with him, and bid the rest of the gentlemen to take care that he should not follow me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you leave in the room with him?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. There were about four persons. When I was down stairs, I directly sent for a surgeon, and his relation, and then came up stairs. The deceased told me the prisoner gave him the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had given him any provocation?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. He said he gave him none; he gave me the wound, and I do not know for what.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the room with them before this happened?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. I was in the room about four hours before. I did not hear a word spoke between them.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any words, (I mean angry) might you not have heard them?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. If there had been any, I am sure I must have heard them; I heard none at all; I left the deceased with his relation, and the surgeon, and went up to the prisoner. I directly asked him what he had done, he told me, he had stabbed the deceased. I asked how and for what, he told me that he took his own knife and stabbed him, because he did not like the man, upon these words, I told him that the deceased was very well, that he was likely to recover (because I would not frighten him;) to which he answered, he was sorry for that. I was angry with him; then I told him that all things should pass easy and quiet; but he answered, that I might go and get a constable, and carry him before a justice, because he knew what he had done. Then I ordered the rest of the men, that they should not go near him, because I did not know what was became of the knife, that he had stabbed the deceased with, I went down stairs again, where I found the surgeon, the deceased's wife and father-in-law with him; and a constable was sent for, and the prisoner taken before the justice, and afterwards secured.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. I have been acquainted with him about four months; I have known him two or three years before; he was a man of good character, and minded his business. I have been told that he was once in prison with what we call madness.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he behaved to your own knowledge as to the state of his mind?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. Since he has been with me, about Lent-time he would not eat. If I asked him to eat, he would say he would not eat; and desired I would not ask any questions about it; he always spoke very sincere to me; he never attempted any such rash action as this before, as ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to make his escape?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. No, he did not in the least.</p>
               <p>The pri soner being asked if he had any questions to ask the witness that might be of service to him, answered there was no occasion to ask any more questions.</p>
               <p>Q. to Deingraman. Did you ever know of any quarrel between the deceased and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Deingraman. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>

            . I was at my father's; I believe it was in June; I do not remember the day of the month; I had word brought that my husband was very bad; when I came where he was, I found him all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>A. Wentworth. He was wounded in the left breast, I asked him who did it, he said it was the man that worked with him, meaning the prisoner; I then desired that the prisoner might be secured, and not let to go away; by that time the surgeon came; then I said, I would go home and prepare the bed ready for him to go in, and so I did, and desired my father to see the man secured; it was near half an hour before they brought my husband home, which was in a chair, he was put into bed, and lay there sixteen-days, and then died; he told me before he died, that wound was the cause of his death; he bled from the wound the last day, and that a great quantity. The day before he died, he desired me to go and see how the prisoner behaved in the gatehouse, where he was. I did, and he was called down to me, I had first inquired how he behaved, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280017"/> the people said he behaved very well, and there was no danger in seeing him. When he came down, he asked who it was that wanted him; he saw me, but did not know me, he said he knew Mr. Wentworth. I asked him whether he stabb'd Mr. Wentworth, he said he did; that he naturally had a distaste against him, from his first coming to work at the shop, and that was the reason why he did it, and he could not be easy till he had killed him. I asked for what had he that dislike against him; he answered again, he did it because he did not like him. I asked him whether he did it in cool blood or in a passion, he said, in cool blood; that he got up the night before three times, with an intent to do it, but he had not power to do it; but he could not be easy. I asked him if he was sorry for it, he said no; but, he said, he was sorry for me, and for his own wife, but he was not sorry for what he had done to the deceased, because he did not like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to be in his senses?</p>
               <p>A. Wentworth. I believed him to be then in his senses as much as any one here.</p>

When the constable came, we went up and said he must go before the justice; he seemed very willing to go, and we went before justice Cox; he asked him several questions regarding this affair; one was, whether he did it on purpose to kill him; he answered, yes, he did. He wrote his mittimus to the gatehouse, and several of us went to the gatehouse with him; he said the same afterwards as he did before the justice, that he did it on purpose.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I was called to the deceased betwixt the hours of eleven and twelve, on the 25th of April; I found he had received a wound which had got into the cavity of the heart (not into the heart itself): from the wound there issued an inflammation for the space of a week or upwards. I was called one morning, he having a fresh bleeding, this was about eight o'clock, it continued till half an hour after ten, at which time the deceased expired.</p>

I went, and took a waterman with me to the two houses, the Fox and Hounds, and also the Hare and Hounds. The landlady of one of the houses (I cannot tell which) said, there was a woman there that had sold some plates, and had been gone from her house about half an hour; but if I would go up higher in the town, perhaps, I might find her there. The waterman and I went, and were told they had seen a woman go by about a quarter, or half an hour before, we went on to Putney Bowling Green; there I asked if they had seen a woman with a red cloak and red gown on, go by, (she having been described so to me) they said yes, and shewed me which road she took, we went a little farther, and there saw a woman sitting on the ground, the prisoner at the bar; I asked her if she was the woman that stole the plates at the Bull at Fulham, she said no. I said she was the woman that had been described to me, that had stole some plates there; so I brought her along with me to the Black Bull at Fulham.</p>

I went after him, and took the plates from him, and brought them back to her, and gave them to her. She had got a letter she said from her husband, at the Isle of Wight, directing her to go there to him, she cryed and said, she had not a farthing in the world: she said she had a dozen of those plates in all, that her mother had se her out of the country a great way off. I believe Mrs. Whetstone asked her questions for a quarter of an hour, to know whether she had stole them or not; by her answers we thought them to be her own. She said she must sell those to carry her down to her husband. Then it was put to about four or five of us to know the value of them, and I bought them of her at the door.</p>

I took him before justice Welch, and there he denied the same.</p>

               <p>Q. By whose order did you saw and carry it there?</p>
               <p>Thomas. By the prisoner's order; as he was intrusted by Mr. Townshend, I did not know but that he had given the prisoner an order to have that done.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I can't exactly tell the time, but as near as I can remember, it is half a year ago or better.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Townshend. Did you every employ the prisoner to put up that copeing stone in Gerrard-street ?</p>
               <p>Townshend. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Townshend. No, I never had any reason to suspect him, if I had, I should not have made him my foreman in this building; he sent me down the men's time they worked every two or three weeks, but no account of this work for Mrs. Marshall.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar pick'd me up, as the rest of the girls of the town do men sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she pick you up?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. In Church-Lane, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. On the 12th of this instant. In the evening she asked me to go with her home; I said I would not go with her to any bawdy-house; she said she had got a lodging of her own. I agreed to go along with her there; when I came there, she took me into a room on a ground floor; and by and by a woman came and demanded a shilling for the room; I gave it her; the prisoner asked me for another shilling, which I gave her. Then I stripped and went to bed to her, but I did not lie long before I left her. From thence I went to the sign of the two brewers in St. Giles's; there I met with another girl, who wanted me to go along with her; I told her I would not go to a bawdy-house; she said she had a lodging of her own. I went with her after I had had a pot or two of purl. She took me to the same house; then I said I had been there before, and had paid for the room, and I would lie there with the prisoner; she was still in bed where I left her; I went to bed to her, but I looked at my money first; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280023"/> a thirty-six shilling piece, a half guinea, and some silver. She persuaded me to go to sleep with her, which I did, she lent me her handkerchief to tie about my head, here it is, (producing one ) I was very sleepy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I was not very sober; when I awak'd she had deserted me, and taken my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you tell it?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. When I went to the window to tell it, she said d - n the money; you are afraid to lie with me, for fear I should take your money; but you are as safe here as if you lay in any house in town. She left her stockings, her bonnet, and her under-petticoat behind her. I got up and went about to the alehouses to look for her, and in about four days I found her, but with no money, only she had cloathed herself with new stockings, shoes, petticoats, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but somebody else might take your money?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I had taken the key, and put it on the inside of the door, and locked the door; and I am sure there were none but she and I in the room, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself ?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. When the constable examined her, she said I gave her some of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say you gave her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. A guinea and a shilling; but I had never a guinea; there was found in her pocket a little steel corkscrew, which was my property, but she made away with that in the round-house; there was only a few half pence, and a farthing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Are you certain that I am the woman?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible as to what you did?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I was sensible as I am now; I saw her twice that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in liquor the first time you was with her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you drank between the two times of seeing her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I had drank a pot of purl.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other girl that you went to that house with, the second time?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. She went away, and left me with the prisoner.</p>

            . The man came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I deal in rabbit-skins; he came to my house, and said he had a woman at my house, that he had known two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. This was the next morning; he said he had been robbed; I said I did not know her by his description. After that justice Welch sent for me, and desired me to do what I could to get the woman; and in four days after, I saw the prisoner drunk in a cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner was the woman?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. By a pawnbroker, saying, she had taken out some things, that she had pawned that morning, and had changed half a guinea; so I took her up on the description the prosecutor gave me, and that of the pawnbroker. I delivered her into the care of the constable, he examined her, she had but a penny about her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barnard. I heard the prisoner say, if she had got a little of his money, she had kept him company long enough for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together ?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I keep a publick house in Monmouth-street; I know nothing of the prisoner; I have seen her before, and that is all I can say.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner at the bar about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you work for?</p>
               <p>Harris. My mother is employed for Mr. Lamater, and I took some of his silk, which she was at work upon, and carried it and sold it to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your mother work?</p>
               <p>Harris. She used to wind his silk at her own home, I used to assist her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry it to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harris. I had seen one Mrs. Acton go there with some, so I went with some.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever desire you to bring it?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you carry in the whole to her?</p>
               <p>Harris. I carried about twelve ounces to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was about that quantity?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because my mother has wanted that quantity in her weight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she give you for it?</p>
               <p>Harris. Sometimes she has given me a penny an ounce, and sometimes three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that you was to have money for it?</p>
               <p>Harris. I saw her give the other woman money, and I thought she would give me the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How much an ounce did she give the other woman?</p>
               <p>Harris. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she use to say to you?</p>
               <p>Harris. She never said any thing to me, only took it out of my hand, and gave me money according to the quantity I brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever bid you come again with more?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; she never used to say a word to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. The prisoner lodged at our house, he told us he had lived with a lady, and she had left him 5 l. a year; he used to dine with me, and always behaved very civilly. On Saturday morning, the 20th of May, he came and asked if we had breakfasted, we said yes; he desired us to make him some tea. After he was gone I missed the tankard; between ten and eleven o'clock it was in a cupboard over night. He came home about ten the next night. I took him up, he confessed it was at the Golden-ball, a silversmith's-shop in Leadenhall-street, at the house of Mr. Job Tripp. I went there, and asked for the tankard, and found it there. Mr. Tripp has the tankard now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Clark. He said he dreamed the night before that he must have the tankard, and so he took this opportunity to take it, as he was in great necessity for money at that time.</p>
               <p>Job Tripp was called, but did not appear, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.  <rs id="t17580628-23-verdict129" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Pyke. He is ill at this time, the prisoner at the bar brought this bill to my master's house (producing one,) it had then the acceptance upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he bring it?</p>
               <p>Pyke. I can't tell the day, but the prisoner himself since confessed it was the 9th of September, 1756.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money paid upon it at that time?</p>
               <p>Pyke. No, there was not; he desired me to let my master know of his bringing it, my master was then out of town; he said it was accepted by Mess. Margesson and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want with your master?</p>
               <p>Pyke. He wanted my master to let him have a note of hand upon it; my master not being at home, the prisoner took it away with him. After that he sent a woman with it, I suppose his wife. She said her husband gave this service to my master; she applied for a note of hand of 26 l. upon it. She left it, and on the 28th of Sept. he came and desired my master to give him a note of hand for 46 l. 5 s. on the credit of the same bill. My master gave it him, but told him he had never indorsed the bill; he then indorsed it, and delivered it back to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at his name on the back of it, did you see him write that?</p>
               <p>Pyke. I did.</p>
               <p>The bill read to this purport:</p>
               <p>Sept. 6, 1756.</p>

               <p>Pyke. He said the M. and C. was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that their way of accepting?</p>
               <p>Pyke. Mr. Margesson and Collison say it was their usual way of acceptance at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to say this is the bill that was brought by him the first time, because he took it back again?</p>
               <p>Pyke. When the woman brought it, I took it out of her hand, she said it is what my husband brought before, and she obtained of my master a note of hand of 26 l. She said her husband sent her, and begged very much that my master would oblige her husband, and it was left with my master in my custody. Afterwards Carrier came himself with another note, as I mentioned before, of 46 l. 5 s. I believe we had two or three draughts before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his trading with Mess. Margesson and Collison?</p>
               <p>Pyke. I know he did for a considerable sum a year, by his own account.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a commission of bankruptcy taken out against the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pyke. There was, and this draught was proved against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who he tendered the bill to?</p>
               <p>Pyke. He gave it into my hand, and said he wanted my uncle to lend him a note of hand upon it; I read it over; I did not mind the two initial letters; I said it must be carried for acceptance, he said there it is, pointing to the M. and C.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this discovered?</p>
               <p>Pyke. By the bill becoming due, but we did not proceed sooner, because we could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this bill become due?</p>
               <p>Pyke. It became due in February.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the commission of bankruptcy taken out then?</p>
               <p>Pyke. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to demand the money?</p>
               <p>Pyke. A gentleman in Newgate-street came and said Carrier was gone off upon the account of a forgery; then I went to demand the money of Mess. Margesson and Co. I saw Mr. Collison, and shew'd it him, he said it was a forgery, and was very sorry we had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bill proved at the commission of bankruptcy?</p>
               <p>Pyke. It was, on the 22d of April.</p>

            , Gent. On the 1st of June I had an information that some of my prisoners, that were transports, were endeavouring to make their escape; there were at least twenty or thirty in a ward. After searching a little time, we found the bars almost saw'd through, and in eight different places, some quite through. We afterwards found a clock spring saw, (producing one.) This is it, it was buried under one of the planks, or barracks, which they lie upon, we found two or three pieces more of saws, that were broke. Some of the prisoners told me they were broke while we were searching. Upon this I ordered the prisoners to be secured. My turnkey told me that the wife of Coffield, one cast for transportation, brought in the saws. I ordered my servant, when the woman came to her husband, to stop her, which he did, and she readily confessed she brought in the saws to Coffield, which then she said was her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew her this saw?</p>
               <p>Akerman. I did, she said she bought it, and her husband gave her the money. She said she was very sorry for what she had done. I asked her where she bought it, she said at the White-Lion, in a street at the upper end of Newgate-street. I took her with me there, and she went into a shop, and pitched on a young man that she said sold her the saw; (it was the White-Lion; Foster-Lane,) the young man compared it with the rest of his saws, which they have in half dozens, it appeared to be one of the same. I desired the young man to go along with me to my Lord-Mayor; there he said he believed he sold this saw to the woman at the bar; (he is here now, if there will be any occasion to examine him.) My Lord was a little dubious about committing the woman, as she said she was the wife of Coffield; she said she was asked at church, and married at Hanover-square. I took it down, and told her I should take the trouble of searching. She once or twice said she was his wife, at last she confess'd she was asked in the church to him, but never married to him.</p>
               <p>Q. It is necessary to ask you, because it is laid in the indictment, to be without your privity, did you consent to this saw being brought into Newgate ?</p>
               <p>Akerman. No, I did not.</p>

            . I was ordered by Mr. Akerman, my master, to stop the prisoner, as one of the prisoners had given information she had brought this saw into Newgate. She came in the morning, and I stopped her, and had her search'd, there was nothing found upon her.</p>

               <p>Townley. This was about one o'clock. After dinner I lay down on my bed, and between four and five was called up, and told that Baker the prisoner had killed a man.

I fell backwards, and he lay on me, he beat me, I had much ado to get from under him, he was always a notorious drunken man.</p>

               <p>Parry. Mr. Cruchfield belongs to a club at my house, Mr. Hall I do not know, the prisoner gave me the order, and I gave him a glass of wine, he bid me get a bill ready wrote for the wine and bottles, but said he should bring the hamper back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prepare the bills?</p>
               <p>Parry. I did, and charged for bottles and wine. He said he would go and get a cart from Bartholomew-close, and come and take it away. He was gone not a quarter of an hour, and came back again, and said he wanted six or seven shillings to give Mr. Jefford change, at the Blue-Boar in Cannon-street. I opened the till, and gave him 8 s. After I found he did not come according to his time, I went to Mr. Jefford to know if any such person called there. I was informed no such person had been there. Since that, I was coming down Holbourn, there I saw a mob of people, in the midst of whom I saw the prisoner, he was taken up for defrauding another vintner. I asked him if he did not remember his coming to me with such a pretence, and his getting 8 s. of me; he owned that he had the money, but said he did not rob me of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shew'd him no paper; I ask'd him to lend me 8 s. and he lent it me.</p>
               <p>Parry. He came with a paper when he gave me the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before ?</p>
               <p>Parry. I never saw him before that time to my knowledge? that order I found to be entirely false.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I have no friend within one hundred and forty miles of this place; I only borrow'd the money, and he lent it me out of his pocket. I once was coachman to this Mr. Hall, but have been out of place about a year and a half.  <rs id="t17580628-28-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Ing. They were begun to be taken in January last, and ended in the month of March, I believe. The prisoner lodged and boarded with us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280031"/> about three years; but I never had a shilling for his lodging and board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Ing. Then I lived in Craven-buildings in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against him now?</p>
               <p>Ing. He came and asked it as a peculiar favour, that my husband would indulge him, two or three nights in January last, to let him lie at our lodgings in Clare-Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband then?</p>
               <p>Ing. He was then in the King's-Bench prison; there we let him lodge, and there were all these goods mentioned; but he took the liberty of staying longer, for he was there three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you beds in your lodgings ?</p>
               <p>Ing. I had several; he came over to me, and desired me to be careful about my lodgings. I had no good opinion of him. I went over the 21st or 22d of May, in order to look over my goods; I unlocked a cabinet, and found the bolts had been forced, and it had been opened without unlocking; out of that I missed a Dresden waistcoat, a silver snuff box, one Holland shirt, one worked apron, and I believe a handkerchief or two.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things you mention before?</p>
               <p>Ing. I saw them the last time I had looked in it, which was about two months before?</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in that lodging besides the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Ing. Yes, my son lay there on nights, but was not there on days all the time the prisoner did; he used to come to me at about eight o'clock most mornings, and to go there by ten at night. I missed a quantity of pewter, a tea-kettle, some china cups and saucers, and a clock without a case, out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge I took many things and pawned for their use.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your husband supported in prison?</p>
               <p>Ing. By his own fortune: he has got an estate in the city of pretty near 200 l. per year.</p>
               <p>Q. What does he lay in prison for?</p>
               <p>Ing. There are only two actions against him, one for 27 l. the other for 12 l.</p>

               <p>Ing. He did; he was taken there by the prisoner, and my son admitted him?</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner frequently used to come over to you and your husband?</p>
               <p>Ing. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not employed by your husband to look out for a coffee-house for him ?</p>
               <p>Ing. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ him to pawn some of your things ?</p>
               <p>Ing. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ your son to pawn things for you?</p>
               <p>Ing. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never receive money of either of them for things that were pawned?</p>
               <p>Ing. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your son sending the prisoner to pawn things ?</p>
               <p>Ing. My son has told me he has given him some trifling things to carry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you imagine had the money?</p>
               <p>Ing. I imagine the prisoner has had part, and my son a part.</p>
               <p>Q. From January to March, had you not been over at their lodgings ?</p>
               <p>Ing. I have two or three times; but did not open a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son tell you these things were going, before they were all gone?</p>
               <p>Ing. I cannot say he told me of it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you arrest the prisoner for a debt?</p>
               <p>Ing. I did, it was a debt of 6 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried to prison?</p>
               <p>Ing. He went to the Marshalsea for it; but we dropped that.</p>
               <p>John Williams. I lay at the lodgings every night, but was frequently out every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there all the time the prisoner was in the house ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was; I was in some distress, and he persuaded me to send a few of the things; I sent him with seven small pictures, my own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280032"/> cloaths, and a gold mourning ring, the whole were pawned for about 30 s. he took the other things I have mentioned, but Bentley took my cloaths out. He desired me to write a letter to Bentley, about two months ago, in which he was to send him a blue book, in which were all the accounts; which I find was to lay it to me, as if I knew of the whole of the things he had taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write it as he desired?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did in these words for the book wherein were the account of all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you know of any goods being pawned by the prisoner at the bar, except what you have mentioned of pictures, your own cloaths, a ring, and trifling things to the amount of 30 s.</p>
               <p>Williams. I do not. Here is a letter of his hand-writing, that he sent to my father-in-law in prison. I know it to be his hand-writing: I desire it may be read.</p>

               <p>Williams. There was; it had blue leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know of the china and tea-kettle being taken away?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, I never missed them; being frequently over the water.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280033"/>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not come over in the morning, and say your mother wanted some money, and delivered the pictures to me to pawn for money for your mother?</p>
               <p>Williams. It was not for my mother, neither did I say so. I wanted the money to pay for some things that were in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. What things ?</p>
               <p>Williams. They were some spoons that were left there at an inn. There was some money to have been paid; it was three or four shillings short.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether he did not send Bentley out with some spoons to pawn for him ?</p>
               <p>Williams. There were some salt spoons I believe I did send him with, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other thing that you can recollect, that you sent the prisoner and Bentley to pawn?</p>

I went out after her, and heard her say to him, my dear, I want a pair of shoes; he said, my dear, what can I do? if I take any thing more out of the drawers, they will be missed. I went to Mrs. Ing, and told her what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Ing and you acquainted before?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No. She was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know where to find her?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I went to her lodgings in Faulcon-court. I had never seen her but once before.</p>

               <p>Q. What month?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe it was the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner and his wife come together?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. They did; but he was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I live now with Mrs. Ing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who supports you?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. Mrs. Ing does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pawn any of your master's things to support Mr. Ing?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you ever pawn any of Mr. Ing's things?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No; I took a gown of my own, and pawned it to buy snuff, and what I wanted.</p>

            . I live in Drury-lane, and am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar brought several things and pledged at my house, at several times, from the 11th of February, to the 25th of March; five gowns, a sack, four petticoats, a shift, a pair of ruffles, and a pair of plated buckles. The whole were pawned for about 39 s. 6 d. I questioned him very closely; he said they were all his own wife's wearing apparel. Mrs. Ing saw them before the justice, and there swore to them.</p>

             on the highway of a silver-watch, in Marybone fields, on February the 27th at night. The prisoner Cotes in his defence called the present prisoner at the bar; who, after he was sworn, gave in evidence, that he was going up Tyburn-road on Monday was five weeks, which must be Monday the 27th of February, the same day the prosecutor of Cotes was robb'd. This Myers said, that on Monday, about ten in the morning, he saw Cotes, near Oxford-market, buying a pair of buttons of a Jew, in a dark red cloak; that he changed sixpence for them; that the Jew asked Cotes, if he would buy a watch; the Jew asked three guineas and a half for it, and at last they agreed for two guineas and a half. Upon being asked how long he had been acquainted with the prisoner Cotes, answered he never saw him before that time; or since, till then in the court. He was then asked, how he came to find the prisoner Cotes out? the prisoner said, because he described me to his wife, what sort of a man I was, as being a lame person; so Cotes's wife found him. Upon being asked, what sort of a watch it was, said, it had a key, and a bit of packthread to it, and it was a white one. Then Cotes asked him, if he did not pick up a paper that dropped out of the watch when he was buying it? then the prisoner produced a watch-paper. The prosecutor being shewed the paper, said there was such a one in his watch, that was taken from him; that there were two watch-papers, and, that if it was his, it lay uppermost. He was asked, if he had the paper from the prisoner Cotes? he said he had not, but that he then put it in his pocket, and had had it in his pocket ever since. Being asked, how Cotes knew that he had that paper, said, he told Cotes there was something fell out of the watch; Cotes said it was good for nothing; so he put it in his pocket. See the trial of Cotes, No 193, in April sessions last.</p>

            : since he received sentence, he sent for me, and confessed he robbed me of my watch, and asked my par don. The prisoner at the bar was produced as an evidence for Cotes on his trial. He then swore he saw Cotes buy a watch of a Jew-like man, near Oxford-market.</p>

               <p>Dunier. I cannot, it being a printed paper; I had one of the same sort in my watch, and when I received my watch from Mr. Humphrys, that paper was not in it. I remember the court was of opinion the prisoner had perjured himself on his producing that paper, which he swore fell out of a watch, which the prisoner Cotes, he said, was buying on the morning of the same day, that I was robbed of my watch in the evening: so that at the time he swore to, I must then have had my watch, with that paper in it in my pocket.</p>
