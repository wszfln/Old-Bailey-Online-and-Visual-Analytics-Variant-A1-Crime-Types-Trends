                  </hi>. I am a member of this society, and have been a director of it—I am one of the trustees—the course was for two trustees to sign cheques in blank, and Mr. Ruffey used to fill them up with the amount he wanted for the use of the society—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has my signature, and this is the signature of Mr. Gardner, my co<lb/>trustee.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner any authority to fill up those blank cheques for any other than the purpose of the society. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the secretary's duties defined in writ<lb/>ing in any rules or resolutions of the society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the objection could not apply to so recent a date; and also, that it could not be necessary to produce the rules for the purpose of showing that the prisoner had no authority to do a particular act; but if the rules had any bearing on the question, he submitted that evidence had been given of such a reasonable search for them, as would admit secondary evidence with respect to them. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMON SERJEANT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that there had not been suffi<lb/>cient evidence to dispense with their production; no notice to produce them having been proved to be served on the prisoner.</hi>) This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the printed rules—I have not, perhaps, seen the defendant with that par<lb/>ticular copy in his hand, but I have seen him with one like this—every member is obliged to purchase a copy of the roles—there is a stock of them kept at the office for all members; this is one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there more editions than one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think this is one of the last edition—I believe it was published in 1854—I have repeatedly seen the prisoner with copies of that edition—when any person has asked for a copy, I have seen him give them one—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. charged for them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMON SERJEANT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that it was admissible. The book was accordingly put in, and the 32nd rule read, defining the duties of the secretary, and appointing the prisoner to that office</hi>)—These has always been a minute book kept by the society, in which all the transactions were entered—whatever authority the secretary, or any other officer, had, ought always to be defined in writing, so that all the members might inspect it if they pleased—whatever order is given by the committee is entered in writing, so that all the members should see it—whatever order is made mast be by the general committee, and entered in the minute book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of any orders relating to the signing of cheques being entered in the minute book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There has never been an order signed in the minute book, I believe; when Mr. Ruffey wanted a cheque signed, he generally applied to Mr. Gardner and myself—I believe there was no order relating to the signing of cheques entered in the minute book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever authority Ruffey had in relation to cheques, was it not reduced into writing at the time of appointment as</p>

               <p>secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer that question—he never asked the commit<lb/>tee publicly when he wanted cheques—I believe he had not a general authority from the committee which was reduced into writing—he never applied to the committee for any specific cheques—I cannot say whether, when the secretary's duties were defined in the first instance, there was any resolution in writing; I do not think there was anything of the kind—I have been a member for above thirteen years—Ruffey was secretary when I came there—I think the society had not been founded a twelvemonth then—I believe his duties were defined before I came.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there was a rule with respect to the secretary; was that the rule that appears printed in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Ruffey had no authority whatever to fill up any cheques signed by the trustees in blank for any other purpose than the purposes of the society; he had no right to use it in any way, only for the benefit of the society; it was to pay the sick, and so on, for the use of the society—I and Mr. Gardner signed this cheque, as trustees—I believe the counter signature to be the prisoner's—it is payable to Messrs.

               <p>himself whenever he thought proper—he had Authority to fill up cheques, and pay himself; that was the way in which he paid himself—I dare say his salary amounted to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe he used to draw it quarterly—besides that, he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week lately for extra services—he paid himself that in the same way—I have never seen the piano—the hall is in the premises, but I have never seen the piano there, and it never was used for the benefit of the society—it might be in the hall now; I have never seen it since the sale took place; whether it is there or not, I do not know—I did not dance at the anniversary when the piano was used—I was there at the first anniversary, I believe it was on 4th Aug.—the piano was used then, but it had nothing whatever to do with the benefit society—I will not say whether it is in the hall now or not—I do not know whether it was there when these proceedings against the prisoner were commenced—the prisoner paid for the gas in the office—I dare say he would have to pay a portion for the society—we rent two rooms as an office, and a com<lb/>mittee room—the place is called the St. Pan eras Athenaeum—we have the use of the large room, or hall, by paying for it—we pay Mr. Ruffey for it when it is wanted—he drew the money for it—I do not say that he had authority to do it—he had a general authority to pay himself—our accounts have not been recently audited—I cannot say when they were last audited—I cannot answer whether there has been a settlement with the prisoner during the whole time he has been there, as to what was due to him, and what he had disbursed—the auditors are here, they will answer for them<lb/>selves whether or not all these cheques have passed through their hands—we paid Ruffey 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the rent of that portion that we inhabit—I believe he rents the Athenaeum—I do not know how he has been paid the rent—he has had the money at all events; he had the cheque book to do as he thought proper with it—he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for every person who took a ticket at the festival, that entitled them to a dinner—the crockery and glass used was not bought on account of the society, it was for Mr. Ruffey's own use—it was used at the festival; we have never had it since—I have not seen anything of it, and know nothing at all about it—we have had one dinner there since—I cannot say what crockery was used on that occasion—I do not know how much he was allowed for gas—he had a cart and four horses—I do not think he ever used it for the benefit of the society—I cannot say how the parcels were delivered, I do not know anything of it—I do not know whether he used his horse and cart for the purpose of delivering the parcels of the society—parcels went out regularly to the country agents, Mr. Ruffey sent them—it was his duty to make them up, and send them out.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to the prisoner. When parcels were sent into the country I used simply to enter them in the parcels book, under his directions—in the expenses book of 3rd June, here is an entry, in the prisoner's writing, of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid in respect of carriage of thirteen parcels to the country—the entry in the parcels book is identical—on 7th June, here is an entry, in the prisoner's writing, of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for four parcels—this entry in the parcels book is identical—in the expenses book, here is an entry, on 11th June, of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for thirteen parcels; the cor<lb/>responding date in the expenses book of that date is precisely the same—it was the prisoner's habit, on returning from the booking office, on each occa<lb/>sion, to enter in the book the amount paid—these particular entries are in his writing; others are in mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in the habit of receiving money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, subscriptions of members—the amounts were entered in the two books last produced, in the last case—I very seldom took money to the bankers—I am in the employ of the society still—I am not in the same situation as the prisoner was—I get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—an assistant clerk is employed there now—the sums received were disbursed by Mr. Ruffey, and by me, on his account, and the balance was paid into the bank—this entry of 3rd June in the rough expenses book is Mr. Euffey's entry—that contains the names of the places to which the parcels are sent—I am quite sure that entry is Mr. Ruffey's writing—in going through the books I have found several other cases in which there has been a charge for making up, porterage, and carriage of parcels, and which has been allowed to Mr. Ruffey—the parcels were made up with brown paper; they had to be packed and sealed, and carried to different booking offices, for various places in the country—I have myself made entries by the prisoner's direction for making up, porterage, and car<lb/>riage of parcels—he said that he claimed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for the parcels—he told me so—it does not appear to have been a uniform claim according to this—he said he had charged 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, that was his extra charge—it was not constantly the case that there were two parcels contained in one, it would occasionally happen—when it does occur it is mentioned in the book—I cannot tell from memory whether these parcels did or did not contain two of three each, but it is usual to put in the names of the places to which they had to go—there is a branch assurance society which the prisoner also had to manage as secretary, and to which he was in the habit of sending many parcels—sometimes the agents for the society also acted as agents for the life assurance branch—I cannot say the exact time that I knew of this charge for making up parcels—I imagine there has been a charge of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra made for parcels during the three years I have been there—this book did not go before the auditors—it is called the casual expenses book—it was kept in the office, anybody could see it—I know from what the prisoner told me that he made this extra charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am in the employ of James Lowden, of Addle-street. On the day before I was before the Magistrate, about half past 2 o'clock, I was resting in London-wall, with a bag containing tapes, needles, and worsted, and the prisoner Brown came up and asked me if he should carry the bag—I said, "No," because I had not got any money; he said that he would carry it without money—I let him carry it, and when we got to Camomile-street, I asked him if I should carry it—he said, "Yes"—I did so, and missed him—he came up to me again at the corner of the Minories, and asked me if he should take it—I said, "Yes"—Clarkson was then with him, and a little way the first time—when we got to the archway Clarkson took out his tobacco box, and Brown said, "Is that all the tobacco you have got?"—he said, "Yes"—Brown said, "Here is a little tobacco shop here"—they sent me in for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I came out before I was served, as I had a good deal of suspicion, and saw Brown with the bag on his shoulder; he said that it was all right, he was only waiting for me—I went into the shop, got the tobacco, and gave it to Clarkson—Brown was gone—I asked Clarkson where he had gone—he said, "Down that way," and I took the first turning to the right, then another turning to the right, and saw him with the bag on his shoulder—I ran up, and caught hold of the bag—he was not going the way that Clarkson told me; he told me to go towards the Tower, but I turned the contrary way—I said, "Give me my goods;" he said, "Oh, you young fool! I was going round to the tobacco shop again"—he set it down, three or four people came round, and a gentleman called a policeman—I did not see Clarkson again till he was in custody—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. On 21st Nov. last, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was contained in this envelope—I received it through the post—to the best of my belief, the letter is in the handwriting of the defendant—Captain Brooke was married to a natural daughter of the late Sir Thomas Mostyn.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has there been more than a sum of 2001. paid to him, or his wife, or child, or any one belonging to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on one occasion there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Captain Brooke, independent of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I understand that he went out to the Crimea, or Constantinople—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to fit him out—when I saw him on the subject of the non-payment, or withholding of this legacy, I told him that I should do the utmost in my power—I acted under the advice of my solicitor—I expressed my hopes that the defendant would for-bear to take any further means, I had taken the thing voluntarily on my<lb/>self—I do not believe I urged him, at the interview, to release the estates from the charge of the legacy, and to take my personal bond for the money—the estate was released, and a bond given—I never made him a promise that if he would do that, when my son became twenty-one years of age, I would pay him the money, and I could not exact such a thing from my son; all I said was, that I would do everything to the utmost of my power, and what is going on now will evince that feeling—my son became of age in 1851—I do not think I was afterwards sued on this bond; these matters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150018"/>
               <p>are entirely in the hands of my solicitors—I really do not recollect being sued on that bond, and instructing my solicitors to defend the action—I do not know whether I put Captain Brook, on that occasion, to the expense of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs in defending the action—I was told that I had got a verdict, and judgment against me for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I rather think that was just after my son came of age, but am not positive—I promised to do everything in my power, but no more—the Plashen estate is worth rather upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my son is in possession of other property which I received through Sir Thomas Mostyn's will; he has the Mostyn property, it was settled on him at his marriage—supposing that property to be unincumbered it would be worth about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I reside at Mostyn-hall, that is Sir Thomas Mostyn's mansion; and in town, I reside in a town house—I know nothing about the defendant's child by this lady, being unable to receive a fitting education of account of the poverty of his father—I cannot tell you how old the child is—the young lady never lived with Sir Thomas Mostyn; I never knew that such a person was in existence until after his death—I can<lb/>not state the sum I have raised on Sir Thomas Mostyn's property, or whether it is near 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—am I bound to answer what the amount of my debts are?—you must ask Mr. Westmacott—I do not say that I do not know something like the amount of my debts, but I cannot tell you the amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Westma<lb/>cott and Blake, solicitors. We have acted as solicitors for Lord Mostyn and the Hon. Thomas Mostyn, the son—the solicitors were Messrs. M'Cloud and Co.—we received all the papers, and have them—there are pro<lb/>ceedings at this moment in Vice-Chancellor Wood's office for the purpose of arranging this legacy for the benefit of the child—I know that Mr. Brook has made over his life interest in it, and that it is by reason of his insol<lb/>vency that the assignee claims an interest, because I have lately had to pay the official assignee under the insolvency, in respect of a portion of the interest, for which proceedings were taken on a bill given to Captain Brook—the whole of that inquiry was only for the benefit of the child—the encumbrances on Lord Mostyn's estates are very large, from which a diffi<lb/>culty arises in his meeting this claim—he took those voluntarily upon him—I have received two letters from Mr. Brook, and have written once in answer to the first—I received a reply, in which was an allusion to my letter—I have no doubt that this letter is his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand that you have received letters, you have never acted upon them in conjunction with Captain Brook, you have never seen him or spoken to him upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have done something in consequence of the receipt of these letters, but I never saw him till to-day—the Flashen estate has been sold—I really do not know what it fetched—it was before I became concerned, some years—I have mastered the subject of Lord Mostyn's affairs so far as regards the estates of which I have had the management, the Mostyn estate, the Corsysegoddon estate—I know that that estate fetched a very large sum—I do not know that the encumbrances were only 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was first of all an Act of Parliament, obtained under which other estates were substituted for the Corsysegeddon estate—a suit was then instituted under Sir Thomas Mostyn's will, by which all the parti<lb/>culars of all the estates were taken, and all the encumbrances ascertained—I do not know that the estate realized 144,0001.; I have not heard it, nor has it been communicated to me—I have heard that it was upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but have not heard that it was 144,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know from any Master's report, or any document in my possession—I have not heard of the encumbrances on this particular estate—I believe the Corrysegeddon estate to be worth upwards of 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lord Mostyn never stated, in my presence, that these two estates were only worth 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say that it is worth more than 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that does not include the encumbrances—there were certainly more than 45,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. encumbrances on that estate; I cannot tell you the amount; I cannot answer you whether there was 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because of the debts; when they were created there was a great deal more on the Corrysegeddon, but do not know whether more than 54,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was existing on the death of Sir Thomas Mostyn—the Corryse<lb/>geddon, in common with other estates, is mortgaged to more than its value in conjunction with other estates—I am aware of a personal bond of Lord Mostyn's being substituted; it was a deed of covenant, I think—I was not concerned in that action—Captain Brook, by his trustees under the settle<lb/>ment, obtained judgment for 23,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were Mr. Rochford Clark and Mr. Hyde Clark—I do not know whether the action was defended, or that the costs incurred by Captain Brook have never been paid to this hour—I have not seen the papers relating to this action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the consideration was for the settlement of the property on Lord Mostyn's son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I throw myself upon his Lordship—I am solicitor for the Hon. Thomas Mostyn, and in all these arrangements I was concerned for the son, and not for Lord Mostyn, on the settlement that was made on his marriage—I have no objection to state anything which his Lordship thinks ought to be divulged of the affairs of the Hon. Thomas Mostyn—I do not know the amount of the debts for which Captain Brook was in the Insolvent Court; I believe it to be considerably more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only know it from his schedule—I have his schedule in my hand, which you are very welcome to—I think Lord Mostyn's debts are about 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., since this bond which he took voluntarily on himself—I was not his solicitor at that time, and had nothing to do with it—a sum of 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has certainly not been raised on the whole property which he took, except by the accumulation of mortgages—sums have been raised to pay off the former debts—all the estates were encumbered with numerous mortgages, and my first duty was to get rid of them all, and put them in a single mortgage.</p>

               <p>unfortunately, has taken upon himself 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the late Sir Thomas Mostyn, very imprudently, believing that the estates were amply sufficient to pay; his personal estate was deficient, and all that kept Lord Mostyn in a state of embarrassment—that has been, in my judgment the cause of his present embarrassment—that was the primary cause of his inability to meet this present debt, and I may say that Mr. Thomas Mostyn is now raising a very large sum on his estates, more than 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of liquidating the debts of Lord Mostyn, and among others this present debt of Captain Brook; but Sir Thomas Mostyn is not liable for a single shilling of it, and in the event of his succeeding in doing that, cer<lb/>tainly a very large dividend will be paid—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been offered, but not secured—that is on the estates.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter was here read, as follows</hi>: "My Lord,—No notice having been taken of my last two letters, I conclude you have resigned what little right you had to be treated like a gentleman. One would suppose that the deep obligations you are under to me would cause you to act differently, but as you seem perfectly callous in mind, I shall now make proof of your body, and shall kick you, in the most public place in which I can find you; be<lb/>sides this, it is my intention to appeal to your brother peers as to whether the conduct of which I can prove you guilty, will not cause your ejection from your seat in their house. You may rest assured that if we both live, I will make you repent your villany; you shall not rob me, as you have done others, with impunity.")</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">submitted, that there was no evidence of publication; that this was a mere private letter addressed to Lord Mostyn; and the only way in which such a document could be deemed libellous, was by its having a tendency to create a breach of the peace, and in the present case the indictment contained no such allegation.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">on the same side) urged, that this was not an indictable offence; here was a sealed letter, sent to a certain indivi<lb/>dual; and although it might contain such language as would induce that person to commit a breach of the peace, which would be an indictable offence; this case was charged simply as a libel; there was no publication to the world, and therefore nothing to bring it within the law.</hi>

On 4th Dec., about 4 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners, standing still, in the Kilburn-road, about 300 yards from Elm Lodge—I said nothing—one of them said to the other, "Good night, Bill" and one went up the Kilburn-road, towards Elm Lodge, and the other towards Kilburn station—I am quite sure of them—I did not notice that they were carrying anything—I had seen Silcock before, three Saturdays previous, at the door of the Prince of Wales beer shop, which is about 100 yards from Captain Sellon's.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 27). I know Elm Lodge—it is in the parish of Willesden—on Wednesday, 3rd Dec., I saw the prisoners at half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—they got over a hedge in the Harrow-road, leading to some stables—they were about a mile from Elm Lodge, the nearest way across the fields—they walked along together to a small hay rick, and Silcock put his hand into the rick, and said, "The things are gone"—they then came up nearer to the stable, where? was standing—I ran out and seized them both—Ford said, "What are you taking me for? I did not put the things under the rick"—that was before I had had time to speak to either of them—I told them that they were the two I had been waiting for, and took them into the barn, where there was a bundle, containing five blankets, four large plated candlesticks, and all these things produced, except the work box and tea caddy—I said, "I shall charge you on suspicion of stealing these things"—Silcock said, "You will not be able to bring it home</p>

               <p>to us"—I took them to the station, and found the blade of a small dinner knife on Ford, this elastic shirt, and some lucifer matches, which exactly correspond with some produced by the cook.</p>

I never put the things under the rick"—I was examined before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>) it is "there" in this, but Mr. Fell might have misunderstood me—I have been twelve years in the force—Silcock said that he and Ford had got over there for a natural purpose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers in the General Post-office. On 3rd Dec. I made up a letter, addressed to Mrs. James, No. 2, Steers-court, Barbican—that is in Aldersgate-street district—I inclosed a sovereign and a shilling—I had marked them before I put them in the letter—I sealed the letter, and placed it in the box in the Post-office, in the usual way, having first put two stamps on it—I put it in the letter box in the large hall, about a quarter past 4 o'clock—I gave directions to Lubbock to bring me that letter, and he brought it to me within five minutes of the time I put it in—I afterwards gave that letter to George Green, one of the sub-sorters, next morning, and gave him directions what to do with it—the prisoner was employed on the morning of 4th Dec. in sorting the letters for the Aldersgate-street district—the letters are sorted before they come to him, and he divides them between the three men on that district—the prisoner delivers in that district; he, and Abbott, and Steele—this letter would come in the delivery of Abbott—the prisoner was engaged in dividing these letters from a quarter past 5 till about 7 o'clock that morning—I think on that morning they would leave to go to their districts about a quarter past 7 o'clock—the prisoner divided the letters to Abbott and Steele, and each of them would arrange and tie up his own letters—before Abbott left the Post-office that morning, I sent for him, and examined his packet of letters—the letter which I had sent was not in it—I think the prisoner bad-left before I examined them—I gave instructions to Smee and Roberts to watch him—in the course of that morning Smee showed me the letter which I had put in the Post-office the day before—it was unopened—I opened it that day before the Magistrate—I found in it the sovereign and shilling which I had marked—it was a test letter—there is no such person as Mrs. James that I know of—this is the letter, and this is the money—at the time Smee showed me this letter, he also showed me a letter directed to Mrs. Bryant, No. 37, Edmund-place, Aldersgate-street, London—that letter was in Steel's delivery—it was posted at Bath, on 3rd Dec.—it was in the Post-office, London, on the 4th, and would come into the prisoner's hands, and it was his duty to put it in Steel's parcel.</p>

               <p>those which he has to deliver himself—"Aldersgate" was marked on the letters—there are three boards, Nos. 1, 2, 3, at which those three persons would be making their arrangements—up to a quarter past 7 o'clock these arrangements would be going on, and then they would go on their delivery—I do not know that, after making these arrangements, the prisoner would have to go somewhere else for a minute or two—he had to clear packages for delivery—those packages are larger than common letters, and it would be his duty to clear away those in the course of the morning—that was his duty, not the duty of the other two—his letters would remain there till he had done that—he would go, leaving his letters, to do this—it is in a direct line—the other two sorters would be in their places while he was away—the time occupied in the delivery of these letters would be usually within the hour, and after that they call for a card, to show that their delivery is com<lb/>pleted—it is a common thing to have letters not delivered, and they are taken back in the bag in which they take letters out—I believe there was one other trap letter put out—it was in that lot which he passed over in it's proper course—no other person is engaged in sorting these letters but these three persons; they receive them all.</p>

On Monday, 8th Dec., a communication was made to me between 12 and 1 o'clock—in consequence of that I went to a bridge that crosses the railway, and saw the prisoners there, and five more boys—I watched them for some time; I saw Williams place 2 bricks, and M'Carthy three bricks, on two of the rails, one of the up rails, and one of the down rails, in a place where there is a very sharp curve in the line—this brick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what is called a clinker—I went down to the rail and took the prisoners into custody—M'Carthy said, "It was not me; it was the other boy, he put more on than I did"—Williams said, "No, it was you; you know you put nine on, and I only put seven"—what I saw them put on was five pieces—a train had passed by shortly before—trains run along that line sometimes every quarter of an hour: some trains more frequently—I gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

On that Monday I was acting as guard to a train—I passed that spot about 12.33—we struck against a lot of brickbats on the line—we threw them about in different directions—there is a life guard in front of the engine, which struck the bricks—they flew into pieces—I do not know whether they were bricks of this kind—I did not see them when they were on the line—they were broken in all directions, some pieces flew into the train, and some into the engine—we had passengers in the train—it was between Highbury and Kingsland, at a very sharp curve of the line—that was a very dangerous place to put them.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who did you employ in his place in the interval between when he first served you and the last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person named Pattison; I gave him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had not the duties to discharge which the prisoner afterwards discharged; he had the entire business placed in his hands—the prisoner, when he came back, had the same employment, but under my supervision—Pattison was not under my supervision; I do not suppose I entered the place then once ia six weeks or two months—I kept a supervision over my servant as master—with the exception of the master's eye, the prisoner had the same duties to discharge—a young man named Knowles was employed by me; his duty was to attend to the counting house, and enter all monies received—this green book was entered by him, this is not the cash book—here in an eatry here by Knowles of this identical cheque—I believe he received it before he handed it to the prisoner—Knowles would enter all cheques he, received, he took them under the instruction of the prisoner—it was not his duty to go to the bank with them, unless he was told by the prisoner, because the prisoner had the management while I was absent—there were no doubt a great many disbursements, which he was called upon to check—I do not know that he has sometimes gone short of salary, he has sometimes debited himself in his salary account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sometimes 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had my full confidence with regard to the busi<lb/>ness—if a small cheque of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not crossed came in, I should not have objected to his using it to pay a small disbursement—it would be a very extraordinary thing if he went to a neighbour to get a small crossed cheque changed—I should have no chance of seeing the crossed cheque come back to me, unless it was of my own drawing—if a crossed cheque had been changed, I should have expected some account of the money, and should have seen it entered by Knowles, if I used my eyes—I am the founder of the Plate Glass Company; the prisoner was not one of the early directors—it was founded in 1852—it goes on very prosperously—the deposit on the shares was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 17,000 were taken up—the bill was drawn on 26th May—they wanted money from various causes; it takes a considerable sum of money to found any large institution—we had made a call, which was to be answered in a month's time, and with that the bills would be paid—I never charged a farthing for discounting the bills—I did not discount them at ray banker's, they never parted from my possession—the first was a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I had no conversation with the prisoner upon that beyond what I have, stated, that I had lent it to the directors for a few weeks, and had made it payable to him, and perhaps he would endorse it—it was not in his name—he did not ask me for something for doing it—I did not say, "Why, it is safe enough; what difference can it make to you?" nor that I would see about it afterwards—some months afterwards I came with the two 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills, that was a renewal of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it took three months to pay the call; anybody connected with property knows that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150050"/>
               <p>calls are not paid at the time they are made—the call was honoured; it was not made so soon as we intended to have made it—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not relieve them, for they were not in a difficulty—the notes were payable to him—I did not make it one 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as before, because the directors said, "We will reimburse it as the money comes in, being out"—if a man has them in his strong box they are liable to go out—the reason why a man not liable for a shilling endorsed these bills was this: I was about to retire from business, and told the prisoner I thought there was an excellent oppor<lb/>tunity for him to start in life, and do well; it would take up to the end of the year to work up my affairs, and we were making a calculation as to what was required to enable me to retire, and put him in my position; there was a feeling of confidence, and I had no hesitation in asking him to endorse the bills, as he would stand in my position as stationer to the company: it would give him a sort of influence for the future, and enable him to continue the business—he was not to be liable to the company for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they were liable to him—considerably later than the endorsement was given I was sued for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know when it was, for I never received the writ—I believed the prisoner had paid the money, as he had received such ample sums in the business—he saw a man issue a writ, but yet never said a word to me until there was a judgment against me; it was served on him, and a few days afterwards he told me that it was served—I said, "It cannot be a proper service, unless it is on me; what is it?"—he said, "An account"—I said, "You have had ample money to pay it"—he said that he would go and see them; and the next thing I heard was that they had signed judgment—I did not receive a writ from the prisoner in a letter when I was in the country—I never sent him to Mr. Gresley, of St. Pancras-lane; I sent him with a cheque to pay the money the moment I heard of the position of the case—there was not another clerk of mine called Oliver at that time, but previously—there was a book called the cash book—he debits himself in this book 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his business costs—I sent to Mr. Gresley, and said that I had never received the writ, and he consented to take a cheque for the money, and to give him a guinea for the little expenses he had been at, and I signed it.</p>

I have got on account; but it is in the lump—this book does not contain any of the cheques; it does not contain an account of the whole expenditure of the society—the small items are in the long book, the steward's book—all payments go into the sick book from the steward's book—there were frequently instances in which he had small amounts of cash for the purposes of the society, without expressing them; but the accounts of cash, for all purposes, are booked—this has been done since the last trial—I expressed no dissatisfaction about the last trial—this has been done behind his back, and no notice was given to his solicitor that he might go through the accounts; you have to rely entirely on my accuracy; nobody was present on his behalf—any explana<lb/>tion might have been given—he was out on bail yesterday—Mr. Lewis did not give me directions; the society did—one or two of the directors were present—I went through it, and they checked me as I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Enfield on Friday, 29th Nov. I was out late that night—in the course of the evening I went to the Hollybush Inn—the prisoner was in the tap room when I went in—after I had been there about ten minutes he came into the bar where I was, and said to Mr. Matthews, the landlord, "Give us two or three lucifers, governor" Matthews turned round, and gave him two or three, or more; I could not swear how many—he put them in his waistcoat pocket—he then went into the tap room, and wished them all good night, opened the front door, and went out—I went out almost directly afterwards—the prisoner went straight across the road to Mr. Shewell's front gate, that leads up to Mr. Shewell's house—I could not swear which way he turned after he got to the gate—the place where I afterwards saw the fire is, I should say, about thirty yards from that gate—the gate is right opposite the public house—I staid there about ten minutes—at the end of that time the pri<lb/>soner came running up the alley from the direction where the fire afterwards was—I told him he was enough to frighten any one, coming running up there like that—he answered that I was like all the rest of the b—girls; he thought I knew a b—sight too much—he went into the Hollybush again, and I followed him in almost directly—from about twenty minutes to half an hour after I got in I heard the alarm of fire—A young man who was in the house opened the parlour door and gave the alarm—the parlour door opens into the road—upon that, all the people in the house ran out, except the prisoner and another man, an old man, who was sitting in the tap room asleep—the prisoner was in the tap room—there was no one in the tap room all the evening, only the prisoner and the other man, not while I was there—I went to the fire, and went and called my father up—I then came back to the Hollybush, and I asked the prisoner if he was not going over to the fire?—he said, "No;" he was not going to work at the b—fire for nothing—he was still in the tap room when I returned—he then went into the parlour, and I saw him take a piece of paper from the table and light it by the gas, and light his pipe—I said to him, "You had them lucifers from Mr. Matthews, and you came up that alley while I stood there"—the answer he made me was, that if I did not mind what I was saying I should get a b—prop—I do not know what he meant.</p>

I made the best of my way over to where it was—several were there before me—the first thing I saw was the horse being got out of the stable, which was close to the shed—there might be five, or six, or seven persons there at that time—I did not take particular notice of the number—I know there were several—the fire was simultaneous all round the stack—the general remark was, that it must have been set on fire—it was burning up like torchlight all round, about the same extent of fire in every part.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a very long address, commented upon the evidence, and stated that he had left the public house for a necessary purpose, and had merely gone a few yards up the alley; that while there he lizard voices further up, but did not see any persons, or know who they were; that he then returned to the public house, and when the alarm of fire was given, he assisted the others to put it out, and was then leaving when the policeman met him.</hi>)</p>

               <p>of money—not knowing whether any one was about in the house, or what it might be, I knocked at the door, rather gently at first—I received no answer—I knocked several times, and after several minutes two journeymen bakers, who were at work in the house, came down stain and opened the door, and said there were thieves in the house—it is a baker's shop—I went in and examined the premises—I found there had been thieves there, and that they had escaped by the skylight in the back kitchen, which was broken sufficient for a man to get out—it leads out on to the leads in the back yard, and to the back yard of No. 11, Beauchamp-street—I went out into Leather-lane, and placed several constables round the premises—I then re<lb/>turned to the prosecutor's house, and in the back kitchen found a bag in a hat, containing a quantity of copper money—another hat was hanging in the broken glass of the skylight—the socket that holds the bolt of the back door was broken, and the window bolt was taken off and placed against the table—they appeared to have broken in by the parlour window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costumier, of No. 18, Castle-street. The prisoner called on me on 7th Nov., and wanted a fancy dress for a ball, which was shortly to be given by Mr. Kemp—I showed him the book, and he chose one, the price of which was 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came in a brougham, with a pair of greys—I took his measure, and he left—about a week afterwards he called again in the brougham, and fitted on the dress; we then asked him for a deposit—he said, "Do you know I have been recommended by Mr. Kemp and one or two gentlemen; I pay no deposit, but immediately the goods are finished I pay you money;" and therefore we took his word—he came in on the evening before, and again on the evening of the ball, and looked at the dress—he said that it was very pretty, and very good, and said, "I suppose, old boy, you would like your money?"—I said,"If you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150074"/>
               <p>please, Sir"—he said, "I will give it you," opened a cigar case, took a piece of paper out, and said, "Here is your money's—I said, "You promised to give me ready money, and this is not cash"—he said,"I have just come to town, and have not had an opportunity to go to my banker's, but if you pre<lb/>sent this cheque there to-morrow morning, you will find that there is plenty of ready money there"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque, but he altered the figures at my place—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "William Stopher, Esq., 52, Cheapside. Please pay Mr. Nathan, or bearer, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account, Henry Stan bridge"—I said that I did not know a person named Stopher, a banker; he said that bankers sprung up continually—I should not have parted with the dress unless I had believed that it was a genuine document—he also had a sword worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have not seen since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it a fact that Mr. Kemp had a grand fancy ball that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the defendant put on this dress at my house, and left his own clothes behind—they are not worth the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are there now, and some articles of jewellery also—I did not promise to send them—he gave his address, "Westbourne-terrace"—I did not apply to his friends when the cheque was not honoured—I did not authorise any one to endea<lb/>vour to obtain payment from his friends; nor did. any one do so on my behalf, to my knowledge—I did not go to that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointed out by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MH. SLEIGH</hi>.) with a policeman, and say that if the matter was not settled I would give the defendant into custody for fraud—I went with a police<lb/>man, but not for that purpose—he said that he would call on me in the evening, but he did not—I did not wait till the evening, and then put the criminal law in force; the criminal law was looking for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of No. 52, Cheapside. I have been solicitor to the prisoner—on 16th July last, close upon 1,880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his was paid into my hands, to bis credit—it was paid to him in my presence, and left with me for his purposes—I had certain payments to make on his behalf, which I made, and rendered him an account about 23rd July, leaving him a balance of 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which, as he was going to Paris, he left with me, to be disbursed as he might orders—many orders came in, such as have been produced to-day, and I paid them—the last date on which I had any money of his was 20th or 21st Sept—on 17th Sept. I wrote to him at Paris this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he, at that time, had more than sufficient to cover the orders—it showed a balance of 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but on the 21st that balance was drawn out—from 21st to the beginning of Dec. I had no money belonging to him in my hands—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to him on 15th Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">This was a request not to draw any more money till he heard from Mr. Stopher</hi>)—I had no money of his on 21st Nov.—I had paid 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Court of Queen's Bench, in lieu of bail, of the money I had belonging to him, in an action in which he had been arrested for a debt—various letters passed; and negotiations ensued, with a view of settling that action, but they were abortive for a time—I had soon the prisoner's instructions to place myself in a position to defend that action if the sum of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was</p>

               <p>not accepted which was tendered; in which case he would be entitled to about 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was the difference—as far aft I am aware, that was the only available sum in my power—I saw Mr. Stanbridge about 3rd Oct, and explained that to him—a sum of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into my handa yesterday—I have some letters here which I received from the prisoner when he was in Paris, about 19th or 20th Sept.—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is dated the 17th, but that is a mistake evidently, for the post mark is the 19th, at Paris; and it came in answer to my letter of the 17th—this is the last letter I received from him in Pane—I received some in London (<hi rend="italic">The letter being read stated</hi>, "I have drawn for the balance, and in all probability I shall never be in England again."—<hi rend="italic">Some accounts were here produced Mr. Murray</hi>)—this is the first accouut—no letter was sent with this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this young man one of a very respectable family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have known the family for years—his father died in 1846; and in Oct., 1855, he had about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. produced by the sale of a reversion—he has been gay, extravagant, and thoughtless, and has no notion whatever of business matters—he had about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in eleven monthly which is all gone—from my knowledge of his family, and his respectability, I have lent him money when I have had none of his in hand—that was early in the year, before he could realise his reversion—he is only twenty-two years old—the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. could have been taken out of Court by special bail being put in—it would then have gone into my hands, and would have been available for his orders—my bilk of costs amounted to quite 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I did not know from him that while he was in Paris his groom absconded, and robbed him of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he never consulted me upon it—I had an interview with him on 3rd Oct., immediately on his return from Paris; and from that time I did not see him till he was taken into custody—he till has a remote interest in an annuity of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—his mother has a life interest in it, which she loses on marriage—in the account which I rendered him my bill of costs was deducted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee house keeper, of 50, Carnab-street, St. James's. In the beginning of July I had occasion to take proceedings against John Anderson, relative to a warrant of a watch which I had bought of him, and was introduced to the prisoner by a friend of his to carry on the action; he told me that he could do it for me, and it would be much cheaper than taking it to the County Court; and that if I sued him in person, and lost the action, they could come upon me for expenses—I retained him to take these proceedings, and on 4th July paid him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the issue of the writ, and on the 7th, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to have the writ resealed, as it was issued in the wrong Christian name; on the 9th he applied to me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in addition, saying that he could not always tell what a thing would come to; on the 10th I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he said he had been down to the Court to stop the defendant from preventing the issue of the writ, which cost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on the 6th Aug. I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for examining the defendant's plea, and he showed me a paper which he called a plea—he read it to me in the presence of Mr. Pigot, a butcher, who is one of the witnesses, and said that it was the defendant's answer to my declaration, but was not a sufficient answer, and he would try and see if he could not get the case put</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am porter to Mr. Sable, of No. 80, Coleman-street. About 5 o'clock, on the evening of 11th Dec., I was in a part of Mr. Sable's premises with the prisoner Hewitt—somebody whistled in the yard—upon hearing that, Hewitt went down directly, to speak to the man in the yard—it would be dark then, but there was a sufficient light thrown into the yard for me to discern any one—I did not hear him speak, but I saw him speak—he came back again to where I was—I was present when the doors were closed in the evening—I saw Hewitt, about 6 o'clock, move the truck near the plate glass warehouse door—that opens upon the yard as the large door fastened from within—the doors were closed when I left, and Hewitt left me about half past 6 o'clock—it was his duty to close them, provided he found that they were open—they are folding doors, but are divided into four—he was the last that went back into the premises, but we all left about the same time—in consequence of what I had seen, I spoke to my father—there is a lobby at the bottom part of the premises, in a direct line with the plate glass room door—that is on the ground floor—when you get outside the plate glass room you are in the yard—the door that is in the lobby you come out of last—the great gate that encloses the yard is in Coleman-street—the premises are at the bottom, and the door that I mean is in a line with the plate glass room door—when I heard this whistle, the prisoner was on the first floor—he went out through the lobby door into the yard—that is a side door—there is a door into the lobby, out of the plate glass room—I went out of the front door into the yard, and then went by the side door; that also opens from the yard into the lobby—from the interior of Mr. Sable's warehouse you can go into the plate glass room—the lobby leads into dif<lb/>ferent parts of the premises—I was not in the plate glass room—I came down the staircase that leads into the lobby—I and Hewitt came from the first floor down the staircase into the lobby—that lobby is beside the plate glass warehouse—Hewitt went into the yard out of the lobby door, removed the truck belonging to my employer, and moved it to the door of the plate glass warehouse—after that we returned again to the lobby, and went back again into the premises upstairs—he returned very shortly, and went into the general office, and took down the keys from the hook—I was then in the lobby as well—I, Hewitt, and the clerk then came away—I went home directly to my father—I did not see Hewitt do anything—I saw him lock the door when we were leaving the premises at half past 6 o'clock—I saw him lock the wicket door, and the door leading into the lobby—I did not see him do anything to the door of the plate glass room—I went to the station house that night, and there saw the truck, and the property that was in it—it was Mr. Sable's truck and glass.</p>

I know the house of the prosecutrix—I examined her door at half past 10 o'clock, tried it with my hand, and found it was fastened—about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock I found the door open—about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock the prosecutrix and a female friend came home while I was standing at the door—I saw the place was in great confu<lb/>sion, and a quantity of property was missed—I think the house had been entered by a key—I saw no marks of violence.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you very drunk that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not at all—during that evening I had drank some rum at a house in Tooley-street, just by the station—I do not know what time that was—it appeared I was spending the evening very comfortably—rum was the liquor I began with—I might have drank coffee before—I left Annerley nation at half past 7 o'clock, and got to London by 8 o'clock—it might be about half past 12 o'clock when I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How were you disposing of your time from 7 o'clock till half past 12 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my business; you have nothing to do with that—I came up to see a friend of mine—I do not know how long I was in the public house—it might be an hour after I arrived when I went into the public house—it would be impossible for me to say what time I left the public house—I went into the public house, and went back to the office to see my cousin—I was not aware what office he was in—I inquired, and they said they believed at so and so office—I went, but could not find him—I went back to the public house—I do not know how long I had left the public house before I met the prisoner—it was not immediately—it might have been an hour—I had two glasses of rum—I stopped a long while over one—after I left the public house I went to a place to get some refresh<lb/>ment—I did not fall asleep there—I was not in the house five minutes—it was in Tooley-street, in a coffee shop—I did not have anything there—I asked something of the waiter; he answered me in a very surly manner, and I came out—I mean to swear I only drank two glasses of rum—it was on Saturday night—I do not know what hour it was when I got to the strange house, where the twenty or thirty persons were—I never saw the prisoner before that night—when I came out of the strange house I had two half crowns and two shillings—the prisoner's hand was in my pocket, and another man's hand was in my pocket—the prisoner's hand was in the pocket where my money was—I do not know that I felt him withdraw the money—I did not feel my pocket just directly afterwards—I was rather in a curious situation—it was in Redcross-court—there was the prisoner on one side, another man opposite to him; the man that had got me by the neck, and the man that undid my handkerchief, and there were some more standing by, I do not know how many, looking on—I charged another man with this robbery, but when I charged him it was in the dark; he</p>

               <p>was taken to the station, and discharged there; I could not swear to him; I had another man taken before the Magistrate—he came to hear the charge against the prisoner; I looked round, and said there was a man very like one—I would not take upon me to swear that was the man—I would not swear against him; he was in the Court—I said that I should be able to recognise the other three—I went to the street, met a man, gave him into custody, and he was discharged—I brought him to the station, and when he got there he declared he had nothing to do with it—I do not know that I heard him say anything in going along—I was walking close beside him—at the police court I charged another man—the Magistrate wished me to look round, and see if I could pick out any; I looked round, and said, "There is a man very like him"—from his whiskers being shaved off and from his coat I thought he was the man, but he was not taken into custody—I come to London to see my cousin—I went after this to stop with my cousin in the Kent-road—I believe there was a gas in the court where I was robbed—I mean to swear I did not lose sight of the prisoner—the men all took different directions—I, knowing the prisoner better than the others, said I should stick by him from the treatment I got—he treated me very badly—if they had kept me in that position I should have lost my life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you get to town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 8 o'clock—I had a friend, and he left me, and after that I went to the public house—I did not see the prisoner till he met me in Tooley-street—I was in the public house till it closed—I was standing just in the house, I did not sit down—I was turned out when they closed—that was at 12 o'clock—I then went to the coffee shop—I do not know the sign of the public house; if I went to Tooley-street I should be able to recognise the house—I expected to find my cousin at the station, but I thought some of the porters might be coming into the public house—I did not inquire for him in the public house—I knew my cousin's address in the Old Kent-road—my cousin is in some receiving office—the inspector knows him very well—his name is Hoay—I am sure I never swore to those other two persons at all.</p>

On that Sunday morning, 20 minutes before 3 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" in High-street, Borough; it appeared to be at the back of the Town Hall—there is a turning there called Golden Last-alley, which leads by the back of the Borough Market into High-street—Redcross-court is further up High-street—when I heard that cry I saw the prisoner running from Golden Last-alley.</p>

               <p>8 o'clock—I heard Patrick Griffin hallooing, but I could not understand what he said—he said he wanted to see Richard Burchell—I was at my street door, which is next door to Burchell's—I heard the Griffins call to Richard Burchell to come out, and Patrick Griffin pulled off his coat to fight—some person came out and said, "Put it on," and he put it on again—he went away, and in a few minutes came back again—Burchell was at home, and he told the policeman to take him away—the policeman took him away towards the Grange-road—he persuaded them to go away—they went a little way, but came back again about ten minutes afterwards—it was then just upon 9 o'clock—when they got to Burchelll's the last time John Griffin ran in and kicked at the door, and called Burchell to come out—Patrick Griffin was at the gate—the door was opened, and Mr. Burchell came out and was struggling with John Griffin and Patrick Griffin, who had gone to help his brother, and Mr. Burchell picked up a brick and threw it at them—he seemed to me as though he threw it—I could not be quite certain about it, being dark, I could not see—I could not see who he struck, they were both close together—Mr. Burchell caught hold of John Griffin to pull him towards the door of the house, and Patrick went to catch hold of him to pull him apart again, and they all three fell together—I heard the people at the next door call out, "Murder!"—as soon as they fell, Abraham Burchell and three or four persons came out of the house—I did not notice Ryan—at that time the Griffins were on the ground—I cannot say what the three or four persons did—they came up to them—they were all close together—the next thing I saw was some of those three or four pulled Richard Burchell away and took him in doors—I saw Patrick Griffin then—he was lying on the ground, and appeared to me to be dead—he was insensible—he had called out before, "I am a murdered man!"—I did not see any blood that night, I did the next morning.</p>

Patrick Griffin was brought to the hospital, between half past 10 and 11 o'clock at night—he appeared to be insensible—on removing his clothes, I found a wound on the left side, between the eighth and ninth ribs—I did not probe it—it was about an inch in length—there was no doubt it had penetrated the stomach, as there was food around the flannel which he wore, next to the wound, and he vomited a little fluid about 4 o'clock in the morning, which was another symptom that the wound had penetrated the stomach—he lay in a very dangerous state for some time, but he is now apparently well—he had but one wound, but was in great danger for some time—it was doubtful whether he would recover—this knife was shown to me on the Sunday morning—it is just such a knife as might produce the wound—the wound was perhaps a little wider than the knife—I saw a cut in his coat, which appeared to correspond with the knife.</p>

I was sent for, and saw the deceased Cox at No. 20, Unicorn-square; she was in bed; she had received a wound in the upper and back part of the right side of the head—it was a deep seated wound, extending to the bone—I should say it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with a glass with a stem to it—I caused her to, be removed to the infirmary that same day—I should say the wound must</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Littleworth-end, Mortlake. I know the prisoner—in the beginning of Dec., I had a male child of hers in my care—it was about five months old when I first had it, and I had it eight or nine weeks—it was a delicate child—the prisoner was wet nurse at Mr. Carless's, at Richmond—I have a daughter living there—the prisoner told me, when she placed the child with me, that it was her own, and she wished to change it for the benefit of its health—she did not say whether she had a husband or no—she said the father of the child was a German, and had gone back to Germany—it was called Henry Robert—she used to come to see the child; generally on a Sunday—to all appearance she behaved very kindly to it—on Tuesday, 2nd Dec., she came between 2 and 3 o'clock—she said she had been after a situation in London—the baby was then lying in a little cot near the fire—she took the baby up—I had to go up stairs—I left no one there but the prisoner and the baby—there was no one else rending in the house—when I had been up stairs some minutes I heard the baby coughing very much—I came down stairs to receive a letter from a servant of Mies King's—I then went up again—I heard the baby coughing very violently when I was up stairs again, and I came down a second time to see what was the matter—I took it out of the prisoner's arm—she took it again instantly out of my arms, and hushed it, got it quiet, and laid it down in the cot again—when I took the infant I perceived a smell of turpentine, and I said to the prisoner, "What a strong smell there is of turpentine"—she said she thought the young woman that brought the letter might have brought it in—this was about twenty minutes after that—I did not smell any smell of turpentine when I came down to take the letter from the young woman—I had no turpentine in the house—the prisoner went away in about a quarter of an hour after she had taken the child from me—I was in the room when she went away—I had been up stairs again for about two minutes; she wished me good bye in a great hurry, as if she was flurried—the child was then in its cot, apparently asleep—about five minutes afterwards I went to the child, and took it out of the cot; its appearance very much frightened me, its little eyes were fixed, and its mouth foaming as if he was going into convulsions—it was sick; that must have saved its life—what it threw up smelt very strong of turpentine, and what passed through its</p>

I am a surgeon at Mortlake—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 2nd Dec., I was called on by Mrs. Keele—I went to her cottage, and saw the baby there—on entering the room, I smelt it very strong of turpentine, immediately I opened the door—the child was cold and pulseless, and quite comatose—it had vomited on the carpet, which I saw, and which smelt of turpentine—the child's breath smelt strong of turpentine—there was redness about the mouth, on the neck, and also on one of the eyelids, and the clothes about the neck were saturated with turpentine—I was told that it had had some medicine administered to it before I got there—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. KEELE</hi>. Miss King gave it some castor oil, and a little weak brandy-and-water—she was in the act of giving it when Mr. Palmer came in)—I ordered some salad oil to be administered to it, and to be put into a warm bath—I considered that the child had had turpentine administered to it by the mouth—in consequence of that, I gave information to sergeant Davis—I saw the child again in about half an hour—it was then much the same—I saw it again in about two and a half or three hours—it was then slightly better—there had been mucous diarrhœa, that smelt very strong indeed of turpentine—the secretion from the kidneys was mixed up with the evacua<lb/>tions of the bowels, and all passed together, and all smelt of turpentine very strongly indeed—I saw the child for the last time about 1 o'clock in the morning—it was then becoming more sensible, but it had very severe diarrhœa, still strongly impregnated with turpentine—I could not form any judgment as to how much turpentine had been given; considering the amount spilt on the clothes and about the neck—I should imagine there could not have been much less than half an ounce of turpentine used, so far as I could judge; some spilt on the outside, and some getting inside—no doubt the child must have taken some, or it could not have passed through the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just about 11 years, at Mortlake all that time—when I was called in I found the child pulseless and comatose—those are the ordinary symptoms of convulsions—I believe it had no teeth; the process of teething may have been going on—turpentine is frequently used as a medicine, in minimum, medium, and maximum doses—I believe it has been given to adults in large doses—I have read Dr. Duncan's works, but not of late years—I believe it to be the case that 4oz. has been given in one dose, without any perceptible bad effect, and scarcely more inconvenience than would follow from an equal quantity of gin—there are certain standard medical works on poisons—turpentine is not included in the list of poisons in those works—the smell derived from turpentine in the <hi rend="italic">fœces</hi> in not of a violet kind; the urine has that smell—in this case the urine and the <hi rend="italic">fœces</hi> were passed together, and the smell of turpentine pervaded the whole—I have not noticed that all the secretions have the violet smell, they had not in this case, certainly—the operations of the secretions are generally uniform—in this case the odour of the turpentine was so strong that it pervaded everything—the odour of turpentine is exceedingly strong—it is generally used medicinally for worms, we also use it as a diuretic, and for rheumatism; and in puerperal fever, both externally and internally—I never knew of its being administered for cough—I have known it used as an embrocation on the chest, but not administered—I know nothing about the practice in Germany.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is turpentine used as a medicine for children six months old? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew that it was at so early an age—I believe it has been used in infantile diseases—it is administered to adults for tape</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150109"/>
               <p>worm, I know no other case in which it would be largely administered—if the whole of the half ounce had been taken by the child, it would have acted as a narcotico irritant; I should have expected the child to have had irritation of the intestinal canal, producing diarrhoea and inflammation, and that it would also produce convulsions with stupor and coma; it would most probably have terminated in death—there is no doubt about it—it would act as an irritant poison, given to an infant of that age—convulsions resulting from the administration of turpentine would be the same as ordinary convulsions, the symptoms likely to arise would be the same as in ordinary convulsions—I believe that the child had taken turpentine internally—I judge so from the symptoms I saw at the time—them were symptoms of its being need externally as well as internally—I cannot say that the use of it as an embrocation would have accounted for what I saw—I saw nothing to show that it had been applied to the child for the purpose of curing a cough—the appearances were consistent with there having been an administration, and a part of it going outside and part of it inside—I could not form any judgment as to how much had passed its mouth, it would be impossible to answer that question; the half ounce if merely speculative on my part.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite confident that there was the smell in the faces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite confident, for I examined it on four occasions, up to the second day—that satisfies me that some turpentine had been taken inter<lb/>nally—the clothes were so saturated with turpentine, that they were wet with it—the room smelt very strong of turpentine; but I could not have mistaken that for the smell from the fæ, for the child was removed to the house of Miss King the same night, for greater domestic comfort; and there was the smell of turpentine the next day—what it had taken had produced the most serious symptoms, and if it had not been attended to as it was, I think it would have died—I think, if it had not been relieved, turpen<lb/>tine the it had taken would have destroyed its life—the brandy and water it had taken was so slight, and so weak, that it had very little effect one way or the other—I do not attribute any harm to that; I came in as they were in the act of giving it, and stopped it; I did not see how much it had—the child was comatose when I went in—turpentine would act as intoxicating, like any other ardent spirit.</p>

On 2nd Dec., about a quarter past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of information, I went to Mrs. Keele's house—on opening the door I smelt a very strong smell of tur<lb/>pentine; I saw the child lying in the cot—I have produced its clothes to-day—when they were delivered to me they were wet about the breast; they were given to me that day; I asked for them, they smelt very strongly in<lb/>deed of turpentine—near 8 o'clock that night, I went to Mr. Carlsss's house at Richmond—I found the prisoner there—I asked her if she had been to see her child that day; she said she had—I asked her if she had been using turpentine during the day, for any purpose whatever—she said she had not—I then told her she was suspected of administering oil, or spirits of turpen<lb/>tine, to her child, at Mortlake, and for that I should take her into custody—she said she had not done so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Cross-street, Bermond<lb/>sey New Town. I have known the prisoner about nine or ten months, he lived near me—on 13th Nov., he came to my shop and said, "I want to ask you a favour, it is not for myself, but for a particular friend of mine, it is to cash an advance-note for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he wants the money and he does not want to go to a Jew's, for he will have to take it out in clothes"—I said it was not in my power at present, but if he would call again I would consider of it—he called again in about an hour, and said, "Well, will you oblige me?"—I said, "I have been considering it, and if you think it is safe I will, but I shall have to distress myself very much to do so, for it is money that I have to pay away"—he said, "It is perfectly safe, I assure you, for I know the man as well as my own brother, I have sailed several voyages with him"—and he said, "You can take the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that Mrs. Gage owes you out of it, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound I will allow you for doing it"—Mrs. Gage is the woman he lives with—I did not give him cash, I gave him a note for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable at Wilson's, at Dock-head, on Saturday morning (this was on Thursday evening)—he said, most likely he should get it from Mr. Wilson to-morrow—I said, "You can please yourself about that"—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash, deducting the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for doing it—I saw him again the next afternoon—I always knew him by the name of Minton—I said to him, "Mr. Minton, I think I have done a very foolish thing by paying you that money; when I came to look at the note this morning, it was not stamped"—he said, "Oh, dear, is it not?"—I said, "No; perhaps you will be kind enough to call and put one on"—and he said, "I will"—he called, I think, next morning, and asked me for the note, and put a stamp on the back and signed this name, "Hudson," on the stamp—I saw him do it—I gave him the pen and ink, and stood by him while he did it—he said to me, "Shall I put my own name on it"—I said, "I know nothing at all about it"—he said, "I think it will be best to put the same name as is on the note"—I did not say anything, he did as he thought proper, I told him to please himself—when he gave me the note, I saw the name of Hudson on it—what he said was, "Shall I put the name Minton, or this name?"—I am sure he said so—he said, "Shall I put the name of Minton, or the name in which the note is made out?"—I said he might please himself—when I re<lb/>ceived the note from him, he said, "You will not have longer to wait for your money than a fortnight"—I met him several times after that, but nothing more passed about the note till it became payable—I think I let it be for some time after the fortnight, because it did not suit me to go for it—I met the prisoner on a Tuesday morning, and said to him, "I think, Mr. Minton, if I can make it convenient this afternoon, I shall go for that note"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185612150111"/>
               <p>said, "Well, I should not be in a particular hurry"—I said, "I don't know that I can go to-day"—he said, "Perhaps it will be as well to leave it till to-morrow"—that was all that passed then—I met him again about 4 or 5 o'clock that same evening; he said, "Have you been after that note?" I said, no, I had not, but my mistress was gone that way, and she was going to call for it—he said, "Good morning," and walked away—I went and presented the note at No. 23, St Mary Axe—I did not find any one carrying on business or residing there named Hill and Co.—I inquired at a great many offices and places, but could not find Hill and Co.—on that same evening, I went to No. 9, Queen's-road, Bermondsey, with a policeman—the prisoner lives there—I saw him, and said, "Are you aware that this is a forged note that you have given me?"—he said, "I am not aware of it"—I asked him if he could settle the bill with me—he said, no, that was not in his power—I said, "Can you let me have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "I can't, what time will you give me to pay it?"—I said, "I don't know, I want the money very badly, you know I distressed myself very much to let you have it; if you can let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it will be acceptable to-night"—he said, "I can't, but if you will let it be till 12 to-morrow, I will make it up and give it you"—I then gave him into custody.</p>

Mine is the Bermondsey station—I have known the defendant since this matter—I first saw him at the Stones-end police station on Monday, 24th Nov.; Mr. Perry, who came with him, said that they wanted a policeman to take a party into custody for stealing some horses and vans—having some previous knowledge, I asked him if it was the horses and vans that were in Castle-street—he said, "Yes"—I said that I believed it was more of a civil than a criminal affair, and he had better take some other course—Mr. Perry said, "I mean to give Mr. Cutts into custody"—Gadsden said, "We will give him in charge"—I said, "You had better consider of it"—next morning Mr. Perry and the defend<lb/>ant came to the Bermondsey station; Mr. Perry said that they wanted a policeman to take the wharfinger into custody—he then seemed to consider again—he said, "Well, I am not exactly ready"—I said, "Well, if you wish to do it, you had better do it while the Magistrate is sitting, but I advise you to consider again"—he said, "I am a professional man; I know my business"—I said, "Yes," and I appointed 2 o'clock, when I would have a constable ready to meet them—I waited some time at the station, but they did not come—I went to the station again about 7 o'clock, or half past, and found the prosecutor locked up in the cell—having a knowledge of the circumstances, I took substantial bail for his appearance the following day before the Magistrate—I cautioned the defendant at least half a dozen times—there was no Magistrate there when they came, not after 5 o'clock—Mr. Cutts was taken before a Magistrate next day, and discharged.</p>
