                  </hi> I am manager to Thomas Southey, wool broker, of 23, Coleman Street, City—the prisoner has been a clerk in the service for nearly twenty years—on or about 29th November the prisoner brought me this cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the words "Please pay cash" were not then upon it—I asked him what it was for, and it was represented to me as being a balance due to Mr. Foster in respect of an over remit<lb/>tance—Mr. Foster is one of our wool buyers at Bradford—upon that explanation I signed the cheque and gave it back—it was the prisoner's duty to take care that it went into Mr. Foster's hands—the words "Please pay cash" are in the prisoner's writing—I did not give him any authority to do that—he was joint cashier with another clerk named Hammond, who is Since dead.</p>

Q.</hi> Was he joint cashier, or was he in a subordinate position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, For the last two years they were joint cashiers, Hammond had been longer in the service, and had a larger salary; that was the only distinction between them—I have stated that Hammond was the prisoner's superior, but I added words which were not taken down, "if a longer service and a larger salary constitute superiority—I don't know that the prisoner was in the habit of doing whatever Hammond desired him—it was in the ordinary course of business to bring me a cheque to sign—Hammond died about two months after this—the counterfoils are here,</p>

               <p>and the cash-book—the counterfoil of this cheque is in the prisoner's writ<lb/>ing—all these counterfoils except two are in the prisoner's writing—one of those for 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in Hammond's writing, and another for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Mr. Southey's—the figures 269 on the counterfoil of the 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque are in Hammond's writing; that refers to the folio in the cash-book I should say—it is entered in the cash-book by Hammond and ticked off—it is a debt of 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Foster—the date is given correctly, the same day as the cheque was drawn—Hammond might direct the prisoner to fill up a cheque to get signed—since Hammond's death we have found certain irregularities in his accounts.</p>

                  </hi> I am a general shopkeeper at 11, Hart Street, Grosvenor Square—I received this bill for six guineas from Heath within a fortnight after its becoming due, to try and get the money for it—I applied to Mr. Oliver, but got nothing, it was in my possession, I think, three months—Heath told me to get the money for Mr. Braahier—I never saw Brashier about it—at the end of the three months I gave the bill to Mr. England—during the three months that I had it Heath called on me several times—on one occasion Heath and Brashier came together—they wanted to know what I had done with the bill—I told them that Mr. Eng<lb/>land had got it; that was the only time I saw Brashier in reference to that bill—that was after the October trial—I saw Heath many times while I had the bill, and he told me to get the money for it if I could—I told him I had applied, in fact he went with me to Mr. Oliver on one occasion for the money.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 13, Suffolk Street, Mile End, and am the wife of Joseph Banham—I am a visitor of the St. Bartholomew's Dis<lb/>trict Visiting Society, and am authorised to issue printed forms for the delivery of food, and sometimes written ones—I gave the prisoner a written order at my house in the very cold weather, some months before June—none of these orders are in my writing—I did not authorise way one to write them for me—I did not give them to the prisoner—they are something like my writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Mrs. Banham gave me an order at her house on 17th April, and another after, 18th May; she said that I was not to give them to anybody, as she only gave them to one or two whom she knew. On 2nd July I went with her to the shop, and told her she had given me the tickets; she said that she was very sorry I should say that, as she was likely to lose her situation if it was known, and it would be a great loss to her, as her husband was in bad health, and that was all she had to live upon; that it was much better to settle it, and asked if my father could help me. We went to the shop, and I told Mr. Laitcham I would pay for what I had had; he said that he wanted the money down. I said that I was not prepared. I cannot write anything like these tickets; what tickets I have had she has given me. I was remanded twice because she would not appear.</p>

                  </hi> I was formerly in the C division of police—I reside at 3, Market Street, Newport Market—since the tailors' strike took place, in April, I have been engaged in watching the proceedings of the operative tailors—I attended a meeting of the operative tailors at the Alhambra Palace on 22nd April last—I should say, from what I have heard the building will hold, that there must have been over 5000 persons present, perhaps 5000 or 6000; the defendant Druid was in the chair—I saw Lawrence and Adamson at the meeting—the meeting had begun when I entered, and was going on—Druid was addressing the meeting—I heard him speaking with respect to the tailors' strike, and the proceedings with respect to the master tailors; a portion of what I heard him say, after I got in first, was, that the new log had been sent round to a certain number of the master tailors, and that eighty-eight of them, I understood him to say, had refused to receive or accept it—I heard Lawrence take part in the proceedings; he moved a resolution, as I understood it to be—I always understood Lawrence to be the secretary of the operative association, up to lately, within the last month or so—I don't know it of my own personal know<lb/>ledge—he was sitting on the platform, and Adamson also—the resolution which Lawrence proposed was, as near as I can recollect, to the effect that the meeting was satisfied with what the committee had done in sending the new log round to the masters, and, as they had not received it, or would not accept of it, the meeting declared a general strike against them—that resolution was seconded by somebody—I did hear the name, but it has slipped my memory—it was put to the meeting by Druid and carried—I heard Adamson address the meeting, but I don't recollect what he said; I believe it was after the resolution was put by the chairman—there were other resolutions moved by other persons—I understood Druid, in the speech he was making, to say that shop committees would be formed, and pickets would be put on the masters, and he hoped the men would do their duty, and they would receive their instructions from their committees—that was said during the speech, they were not exactly the words perhaps—about the 24th, two days after the meeting, I was first employed to go round—Mr. Poole's establishment is in Saville Row; Mr. Stohwasser's, Mr. Meyer's, and Mr. Bennett's in Conduit Street; and Mr. Binney's, Mr. Manning's, and Mr. Haldane's in Bond Street—I observed at each of the shops where the men had struck, two or more men were stationed—in Conduit Street I have counted from fifteen to twenty-five men stationed, most of them in front of the doors, walking up and down, some on the opposite side of the road, most of them watching persons going in and out, to see if anybody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190028"/>
               <p>came out with any work or bundle, and they were generally followed by some of the men to see where they went to, and what they were—from the 24th April to the present time I have been engaged in watching those streets from time to time, and during that period I have seen numbers of persons as I hare described outside the master tailors' acting in the same way, standing outside to watch persons and following them when they came out—a greater number always collected in the evening, when the men came out from work, that, is, those that had not struck—the largest number of men I have seen was on 3rd May, in front of Mr. Stohwas<lb/>ser's, in Conduit Street—I should say there were over 200 at that time—I have seen some of the defendants acting as I have described at other places, but not at that time—I have seen all of them, except Druit, Law<lb/>rence, and Adamson, on picket at different places—when the workmen who had not struck came out of a night there was generally a great num<lb/>ber to meet them, greater than there had been during the day; and upon several occasions I have heard them call after them, calling them "dungs," and point to them, and say, "There you go," "We know you, we shall recollect you, and your name will be put down"—I have seen them hiss them, halloo after them, and follow them some distance till they got tired, and then come back again; they called them cowards and every name almost they could think of—that was the general conduct pursued from time to time—there are several public-houses, ten or a dozen, where they meet and have committee-rooms—I have sometimes seen the pickets there very early in the morning, but more in the middle of the day—the pickets generally go on about seven or eight—at the commencement of the strike I think earlier; at some of the shops about six; they are generally on about seven now, or from that to eight in the morning—I have seen both Druit and Lawrence at the Green Dragon talking to men that I have known do picket duty, both before and after—that is the place they call the Central Committee-room—on 24th May I attended a meeting at the Temperance Hall, Pollen Street, opposite the Hanover Square Rooms—I understood it to be a meeting of the out-door workmen, the operatives—I saw Adamson there; he acted as chairman—I saw a great many persons at that meeting that I had seen or picket, and I have seen some of them on picket since—Adam<lb/>son said that no doubt after the strike was over he should be a marked man, and so would a great many more that had taken a part in it, and that was all the more reason why the union should not be broken up—he spoke on for some time longer, but I don't recollect it all—I heard a resolution proposed; to the best of my recollection, it was that after the strike was over no union man should be allowed to work in any shop where a non-union man was employed; that was seconded, put by the chairman, and carried—on 29th May I attended a meeting at the Alhambra—as near as I could judge there were about 3000 persons there, Druit was chairman—I saw a great number of persons there that I knew and seen on picket, and whom I subsequently recognised as doing picket duty—I heard Druit speak for some time at that meeting; the principal portion of his time was occu<lb/>pied in reading letters, resolutions, and statements that had been made by the masters at their meeting on the Saturday previous—I understood that the meeting was called for the purpose of considering the truth of the statements made by the masters at their meeting on the Saturday previous—I did not hear Druit say anything about the strike or the picketing; that was said by another person—I heard resolutions proposed, and I heard a person say that, from reports he had received, the masters could only get</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190029"/>
               <p>about one-third of their work done, and if they could prevent the remainder it would learn the masters a lesson for the future, or teach them better for the future, or something to that effect; that was not said by any of these defendants—I heard Druit say in the course of the meeting that he had received a telegram from Mr. Blissett: he commenced by saying, "Glorious news, my boys; 80, 000 unionists at your back in the north," and he made some humorous sort Of statement, I could not say what it was, that a great number of persons grinned and laughed at, but I did not hear it—on many of the occasions I have spoken of I was in company of a person named Lambert.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who employed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> am employed by Messrs. Vallance and Vallance, the solicitors of the Master Tailors' Association—I was not a policeman when I was first employed, I had left just previous, I was not doing anything; I had only left the police about a fortnight—I am still employed by the Master Tailors' Association for the purpose of seeing the conduct of the men on strike—that is not the way I make my living; I did not expect this would last above a week or a fortnight; I never expected the strike would have continued so long as it has, or I do not know that I should have taken it—I am so employed until this is over, not longer—I did not go to the Alhambra with any one, I went by myself; I found the building full of people—they did not know me, or know that I was watching them; latterly I think they have known me, from seeing me about a good deal; they did not at first—I did not hear Druit read any letters at the first meeting—I think I heard some<lb/>thing of a letter they had addressed to the masters, asking them to come to terms and negotiate—I heard him say something about lock-outs and strikes—I can't tell all the words—I think he very probably expressed a wish that an early day should be appointed for a meeting for settlement—I have some recollection of it, but I can't say—I remember some talk about arbitration. (<hi rend="italic">After some further cross-examination as to what was said by Druit at the meeting, as to which the witness recollected but little, a pamphlet was by consent put in, said to contain a correct report of the meeting, and from which</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read the following passages</hi>.—"'Gentlemen, you will see the necessity for having a proper Time Log in as concise but explicit a form as possible, framed to set at rest the many disputes, whether they be in the form of lock-outs or strikes, which have been going on for some considerable time, and in the spirit of your resolu<lb/>tion and the proposition of such a log properly considered and agreed to by you, the representatives of the masters, and we the representatives of the journeymen tailors, will have a tendency to put an end to those painful proceedings called lock-outs and strikes: we desire it: you in your resolu<lb/>tion express the same desire, and we trust that you will name an early day when we can arrange for a meeting.' Our employers replied by assuring us that the above was in strict accordance with their wishes. After con<lb/>siderable delay a day was named, and we met, when agreements were entered into by which a discussion was to be conducted, one of the special stipulations being, that in the event of a difficulty arising an arbitrator should be called in. Well, gentlemen, we began our work. The first day we took the dress and frock coats; we went over every item minutely, no item was left, every one of which was fairly and honestly discussed. The masters seemed quite satisfied as to the conclusions at which we arrived, and even congratulated us at the close of the first day's proceeding on the manner in which they had been conducted. The results of our discussions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190030"/>
               <p>upon those garments was a reduction of the hours which we had previously considered was the proper time for making them, and a rise on the hours the masters considered was the proper time. The second day arrived, when it was evident that, after reviewing at their leisure the previous day's work, they forgot all their good wishes and agreements in regard to fair and honest discussion and arbitration; and equivocation, delay, with repeated changes in their committee—when practical men were substituted by those who knew nothing about a log. We urged the continuation of the discussion, till they were obliged to confess to us that they could not proceed, that they had no powers to depart from a log which had been put into their hands by the masters, and that, unless we were prepared to accept of it, with but slight modifications, the negotiations must be con<lb/>cluded. Such a course we protested against, and hence the cause of the position in which we find ourselves this day. After a series of com<lb/>munications which have passed between us since, in which they positively refuse to meet for discussion, as they first agreed, we have forwarded them copies of the Amalgamated Log, by which we have resolved to stand or fall, till they are prepared to do so. (Cheers.) Do not suppose for one moment, gentlemen, that I stand here as the champion of maintaining that log in its integrity, as I am convinced it requires revision, and is capable of correction; not because it is unjust or too high when taken as a whole, but because some parts of it are too high, and others are too low. But it is not our wish to enforce this log as a settlement of the question, if the masters will but listen to reason. We only wish to use it as a basis. Even the Masters' Log—wretched affair as it is—we are willing to take as a basis of discussion, if the masters will only agree to do so, item by item, so that we may be able to come at what is right for each. The point at issue is this—that while there was a distinct agreement between masters and workmen that no log be presented or enforced by either, but that a 'New Time Log' be discussed and drawn up by the representatives of masters and workmen, the masters have presented their log to us, with this message, 'That unless we shall accept of it, with but slight modifications, all negotiations must be broken up.' Since this decision we have used every means in our power to induce them to renew these discussions, and so carry out their agreement, but have failed. Your committee have there<lb/>fore considered that the only course they could pursue consistent with your honour and their integrity, commercially, socially, and morally, was, that we draw up a circular stating our proposed course as follows:—[Mr. Druit here read the circular we published in our last number, which was received with cheers, and proceeded]. This we have forwarded, with a copy of the Amalgamated Log, to eighty-eight of the principal firms of the West End and City, nineteen of which seem to have been endowed with sufficient courtesy to reply.") All that I hears of Mr. Lawrence was the resolution that he moved—I believe he went on addressing the meet<lb/>ing after that, but what he said I don't recollect; I heard it, but I can't call it to mind—I took no notes, all I am telling you is from my recol<lb/>lection—I was not employed by Vallance and Vallance when I went there on the 22nd; it was on the 24th I was employed; I had not the least idea of being employed by them then, I went in to see what was going on; I lived close by; I was passing, and simply went in as others might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Lawrence, as well as Druit, say that he by no means wished to stand by the Amalgamated Log, but simply as a means of getting the masters to a discussion upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> heard something about the dis<lb/>cussion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190031"/>
               <p>of logs, but I don't know what it was; I think there were some words to that effect—I did not hear him say that the masters had formed themselves into an association to defend their interests, and the men must do the same, and that they were each responsible for what they did; I don't think I heard anything like that, or that they were going back from what they had agreed to, and if they would not fulfill what they themselves had resolved upon, there was no course left to the men but to do what they were going to do by the resolution which he was going to propose—there was a good deal of discussion, Adamson and various other persons' spoke—Druit got up and spoke again just before I came out. (<hi rend="italic">The obser<lb/>vations of Druit were taken as read from the pamphlet as follows</hi>.—"The platform presented a grand unify of working men; not only did it represent the tailors of England and Ireland, but a large portion of the Continent of Europe as well. To complete the representation, he and his colleague, Mr. Blisset, would change their characters for a little and become dele<lb/>gates for the tailors of Paris. The chairman then read a resolution which had been unanimously adopted by a meeting of 10, 000 tailors in Paris, at which he and Mr. Blisset had the honour to be present, and which was entrusted to him to convey to the tailors of England. It was to the effect that an alliance be formed between the tailors of the two capitals for the purpose of rendering each other pecuniary assistance in cases of lock-out and strike. The meeting was then addressed by Mr. Colly, after which a resolution was moved and unanimously adopted, pledging the meeting to support their fellow workmen generally on the Continent. Now, gentlemen (said the chairman), it is my duty to give you such information as is necessary for the discharge of your duty in your pre<lb/>sent position. You have now cast the dye! You have struck! You must now consider your responsibility. In regard to the work you have in hand, we have always made it our duty to act strictly in accordance with the law, so we shalI do now. He then stated that full in<lb/>structions for the conduct of the strike would be circulated, and stated that all men who had work in hand should ask to be permitted to finish it. If the masters refused to give it the contract in regard to it was broken. He said they must go at once and form their shop committees, and put on their pickets; they must be as willing and as anxious to do their work properly as the executive committee were. The committee would be faithful in doing their duty. He impressed upon each of them the necessity of being the same. Let no one shrink from his duty, or seek to lay it on the shoulders of another. Let nothing either fall from your lips or take place in your actions likely to lead to coercion. If men will not cast in their lot with us, let them go and do so with the dis<lb/>honourable employers.") I recollect a great portion of that, but I was not there at the end of his speech—I recollect hearing a Mr. Neale speaking, and somebody asking some questions about out-door workers, and the chair<lb/>man said something to this effect: "Of course we cannot guard ourselves against dishonourable men in our midst, any more than we can against masters. If men will act dishonourable, or will not act along with us, let them unite themselves with the dishonourable among the masters, and we shall be well rid of both." I suppose "both" meant mastcrsand men, ac<lb/>cording to what you have read there, but I did not understand the mean<lb/>ing of it.</p>

We hold by the masters' first resolution, and we want the masters to understand that the strike will terminate as soon as they consent to meet aud discuss the question.

                  </hi> I am a pensioned sergeant of the police—I accom<lb/>panied Mitchell while he was watching these different places—I watched all the masters' shops at the West End—I went out sometimes early in the morning and sometimes late, not always at one time—I watched Mr. Poole's among others; sometimes there were as many as forty or fifty pickets there, at other times five or six, it depended on the time of day, there were most in the evening—they kept sharp watch on the door, close to the door, smoking their short pipes—if they saw any of the men that were at work inside come out, they would point to them and to one another and say, "That's him!" "There he goes! "—sometimes we could hear what they said; I have heard them call them curs, cowards, and dungs—I have seen them go into the public-houses in the neighbourhood which the tailors have occupied during the strike; there are several of them—I have seen the pickets change relief there after they have been on duty for a certain time, and leave and go to the different lodges or public-houses, and after being there I have seen them leave again and go back to the same point—I have not seen anything particular done when persons have come out of Poole's with parcels—it has been more at Stohwasser's and Smallpage's and Bennett's—when the outdoor workmen have called for their work I have seen the pickets follow them as they come out certain distances till they met other pickets, and they have told them where they came from—I have on one or two occasions heard what they have said, that he or she had got work from Sraallpage's; and on that the other pickets have followed them and taken up the chase, and the old</p>

               <p>picket would return to his post; I have seen that occur on several occa<lb/>sions—at the first part of the strike the pickets were on duty as early as five o'clock; there would be perhaps three or from three to four or five on each shop—some mornings there would be more than at others; in the middle of the day they would increase to about six or seven, and in the evening part up to as many as twenty, thirty, forty; in fact I have seen as many as 150 in one street—some would parade up and down the foot<lb/>way, and if the police in uniform came to disperse them they would walk up and down in the middle of the road; this applied to the three shops I have mentioned and likewise to Mr. Smallpage's, there was no difference made—I never heard them say anything to the persons who came out further than point and beckon, and generally two of them followed up close—if it was a female they would follow her more closely than they would a man; they would leave the street altogether—I cannot say that I have ever seen anybody come out with a bundle who was not followed—they have not done so much following lately, but I have noticed the people who come out generally keep a very sharp look-out and try to get away from them—I was present on one occasion in Marlborough Street when a woman with a bundle ran into the police-court for protection; two pickets were after her at that time; that was at the latter end of June or the commencement of July—the same conduct was pursued at all the tailors' shops who would not receive the strike men—I have frequently seen customers come to the doors of tailors' shops in carriages, and the pickets have generally got near the door and stood there till the customer has gone into the shop and waited till they came out again, unless the police in uniform came up and sent them away—they have stood quite close against the door and on the steps; in fact I have seen them sit on the steps smoking their short pipes: that has been a common practice at the different shops—I have seen two or three at a time, there has been one sitting down and two talking to him, leaning against the railings right against the door steps—they would sit there until such time as they saw a police<lb/>man coming along, and then they would move; and when the policeman was gone they would return to the same point—that was continued pretty much throughout the day, principally in the middle of the day—in the evening, when the men knocked off work, the pickets mustered all hands, and when the men came out they would follow them and say, "Here they come, the cowards"—they would say so to each other, not to the men themselves; it was said loud enough for the others to hear—they said, "Here they come, the cowards; is not he a dung? that's him," and they have followed them whichever way they have gone; in fact, I have gone with them as far as half aud three-quarters of a mile, they have been afraid to go away by themselves—I have seen Smallpage's men followed by about half a dozen—I was not sufficiently close to hear what they said when they were following them, because I was with the workmen—the collection of men of an evening was more at Smallpage's, Stohwasser's, and Meyer's—these were the three shops principally picked out—that was carried on very strong for about three weeks or a month—I have seen as many as 100 or from that to 150 of an evening, pretty well every evening during the three weeks or a month, more so twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays—we have noticed, too, the same kind of language has gone on on all these occasions—after a time the pickets got acquainted with us, but the same matters went on to the same extent in our presence; they paid very little attention to that—we were pointed at after we gave our</p>

               <p>evidence at Marlborough Street—I have seen the five last-named de<lb/>fendants at Smallpage's and that neighbourhood on picket duty at different times in the day, in the morning and in the middle of the day, and of an evening, the whole of them—I have seen them at times when this lan<lb/>guage has been used—I have seen Levine and McDermot follow persons once or twice, and I have seen them both present while this language has been used.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman and salesman to Mr. Poole—when the strike took place, of all our indoor men only two remained—there were close on 500—these two were allowed to remain because they were very old, and one was deaf and dumb—pickets were put on our establishment directly—it was my duty to watch these pickets as much as possible—I had several applications made to me personally from workmen, who would have been very glad to come to our firm, if it had not been for the pickets—we sent out work at times, and the pickets followed the persons who took it—I did not hear much said, but I saw a great many motions made to them—that has continued up to the present time—it interfered with our getting work done a great deal at the beginning.</p>

                  </hi> On 1st July, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was in Endell Street, and had just passed Short's Gardens, when a man came in front of me, made a snatch at my watch chain, and broke it from the watch—I held my hand on my watch—I put up my stick, and was about striking him when the chain broke—the prisoner, I firmly believe, and another stood close at my elbow, and directly the chain dropped I was pushed backwards; I pitched on my shoulder and elbow, and my arm was broken—I saw three of them—I got up as quick as I could and went to Bow Street Station, and then to Charing Cross Hospital to have my arm set—I was sent for on Wednesday morning, went to Bow Street, and selected the prisoner out of fourteen or sixteen others—he sat in a corner—I told the policeman there was one man there who I did not like the looks of; he said, "Go in again, I will go with you," and the more I looked at him the more I felt convinced that he was the man—I should be very sorry to take a solemn oath, but it is the impression on my mind that he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> I am potman at the Navarino tavern, Dalston—on Saturday night, 6th July, about 11.30, the prosecutor and prisoner were standing at the bar drinking together—the prisoner said that he reckoned himself a Roman Catholic, and Callaghan said, "I am a Protestant"—the prisoner made some threat of an assault which I did not hear, and the master put him out, but he came in again, and called his friend Martin out, and Martin and himself and Callaghan all went out together up Navarino Grove—when they were about forty yards from the tavern I saw the prosecutor and Coleman <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> I ran up directly, knowing that the prisoner had got a dagger-knife on him, as I had heard he had produced it at the bar—Callaghan had just tumbled on the floor, and the prisoner had got the knife, just going to strike him again—I did not see him strike him first—I knocked him down, that he should not use it a second time—he got up, ran round the field, and went in doors to No. 7, he and Martin together—I helped Callaghan up—he said that he felt very faint, the sergeant came up with a light, and said, "Take him to the hospital."</p>

"—he said, "Yes, it is"—it had been handed to me by 341 N; I had it in my hand at the station, and he said, "I took out that knife to defend myself; several men attacked me; and I would do it again."</p>

                  </hi> I am a waiter at the Salisbury Hotel, Salisbury Square—on the afternoon of 21st July, about half-past three o'clock, I was in Holborn Hill—a boy had been bit by a dog and it attracted my attention, so that I crossed the road—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of my pocket, and saw it in his hand afterwards—he immediately made off—I followed him and caught him about thirty yards off—he gave up the watch—I still followed him through Brook Street into Fox Court, where some women tried to stop him—he got away and went into Feathers Court and into No. 2—I had not lost sight of him up to that time, but I then lost him for about five minutes—I had had him in view for about five minutes—I know he is the same man by his features—I had plenty of time to notice him—once he said he would knock my b----head off if I went after him.</p>

"—he ran down Gracechurch Street as far as Bishopsgate Street, where he was stopped by a police-constable, and I gave him in charge—I never lost sight of him for a moment—I am quite sure he is the man—the locket and chain were never found—my cost was torn, and my vest as well.</p>

Stewart was taken into custody on 26th June—from information I received I went with another officer to Lower Thames Street, and saw the prisoner; I took him into custody, and charged him with stealing a case of cigars—he said he knew nothing about it—he said that Stewart had had his truck without his permission—I took him to the station and placed him at the side of Stewart—the inspector read over the charge, and asked if Stewart had anything to say in reference to the charge, and he said, "Yes; I will tell you the whole truth. Mr. Magnus employed me in the morning to get some cigars from the docks; I was afterwards instructed to take them to Southampton Row, and I went to Brennan and borrowed his truck, and told him what I was going to do. He said, 'I know where to get rid of those cigars.' I refused to have anything to do with it at the time, but I got the cigars from Mr. Magnus. When I was passing Mark Lane Brennan met me, and said, 'The old man,' meaning Mr. Magnus, 'has gone up Billiter Street.' I went, by the desire of Brennan, up Fenchurch Street and Bishopsgate Street to Artillery Lane, where I remained outside a public-house, and Brennan went away and came back with three other persons. They gave me something to drink at the public-house. After that Brennan took hold of the handles of the truck and we went together to Hoxton, the three other persons following on the other side of the way, where the cigars were taken to a small beer-house; they were left there. I came with Brennan back to 1, Hackney Road, where 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for the cigars; I received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I and Brennan went in company to East Smithfield, where I got drunk; and we separated, and did not meet again till the next day." Stewart said, "You know very well it is true what I say"—Brennan was then detained at the station, and I took Stewart with another officer to find out the beer-house at Hoxton, which is kept by a person of the name of Rothschild, where we made a search and found nearly the whole of the case broken up in pieces, and there were a lot of things which had reference to Rothschild, but not to the prisoner—Stewart has pointed out the public-house where the money was paid; it is 1 or 2, Hackney Road.</p>

                  </hi> I was formerly in the C division of police, and have been engaged in reference to the tailors' strike almost ever since it occurred—on 22nd April I was present at a public meeting of the operative</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190056"/>
               <p>tailors, held at the Alhambra Palace, and saw Partridge, Bailey, and New<lb/>bury there taking part in the proceedings—resolutions were proposed, seconded, and carried in reference to the tailors' strike—a resolution made by Mr. Lawrence had reference to the strike, and Mr. Druit in a speech he was delivering said that committees would be formed, and pickets would be put on the shops of the masters—I observed two days after the meeting that the shops were picketed—the master tailors' establishments are in Conduit Street, Maddox Street, Saville Row, and that immediate neigh<lb/>bourhood, and this picketing was at the establishments in those various streets—some shops had two men on in the fore part of the day, and in the middle five or six, and at some establishments I have seen twenty towards evening, and if any one came out one or two of the men outside followed them to see where they went and to find out their names and addresses, and I have seen them annoy persons by calling them <hi rend="italic">dungs</hi> and cowards, and hissing them, saying, "There they are; there they go" and so on—I have counted thirty-five persons at one time outside Mr. Poole's establish<lb/>ment—they were journeyman tailors; a great many of them I knew to be tailors—the persons who went out of the tailoring establishments were journeyman tailors, and out-door workers who came to fetch work to take home—I have seen all the prisoners performing that duty, except Part<lb/>ridge, Bailey, Shorrocks, Newbury, Stokes, and Ormerod—I recognise all the others as having seen them at various times and places doing picket duty, which commenced somewhere about seven in the morning and terminated about nine, but it depended on the time the shops closed, some close earlier than others—the persons performing picket duty resorted to the Blenheim Arms, Blenheim Street, Marlborough Street: and the Grapes, and Ship, in Carnaby Street; the Nag's Head, in Marshall Street; the Burlington Arms, Old Burlington Street; the Coach and Horses, in Conduit Street; the Lion and French Horn, Poland Street; the Nag's Head, Stafford Street; the Catherine Wheel, Little St. James's' Street; the Red Lion, York Street, Jermyn Street; the Grapes, Union Street, Bond Street; and some others—they resorted to those houses when they were leaving picket duty—they generally begun to collect there about ten in the morning—I saw more at that time than any other—they kept there off and on all day—the pickets would sometimes be relieved for a couple of hours—there were also com<lb/>mittee-rooms; the head meeting-house was the Green Dragon, King Street, the room there was called the Head Centre—I also attended another meet<lb/>ing at the Alhambra, on 29th of May, of the union men, the operative tailors—there were, as near as I can guess, about 3000 present—Partridge was there and Shorrocks, they both spoke—resolutions were proposed and se<lb/>conded, and speeches made in reference to the strike and the picketing system—one of the resolutions proposed was supported by Shorrocks—I also attended a meeting of the operatives at the Temperance Hall, Hanover Street, on 24th May; about 250 people were present—Newbury, Stokes, and Ormerod were there, and speeches were made and resolutions passed with reference to the strike and the picketing system—Newbury spoke and gave assent to the propositions—I attended another meeting of the same class of persons at the Sir Robert Peel, James Street, Oxford Street, on, I think, 14th June—Stokes was present—there were not 100 persons there, perhaps about eighty—there were resolutions and speeches in reference to the strike, and Stokes spoke about the tyranny of the masters in sending some of the men to prison, and said if the grievance between the masters and men had merely been the <hi rend="italic">time log</hi> it would not have happened, and called upon all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190057"/>
               <p>those present who were not unionists to join the union, and to look out for any shops on strike and let the committee know—he spoke for some time longer, but I do not recollect it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a pensioned police sergeant, and have been in the police nineteen years—I was employed by Messrs. Vallance and Vallance to accompany Mitchell, and watch what was going on at the tailors' shops—I learnt what tailors' shops were struck against, and visited most of them during the day—I have seen pickets at Messrs. Poole's, in Saville Row, as early as five o'clock in the morning, two, three, or four pickets, and they increased in number as the day advanced to eight or ten; in the middle of the day and towards evening I have seen as many as forty—they were always pointed out to me as tailors—I have seen them at other establishments engaged in the same way—they would stand in the morning two or three against the door, sometimes I have seen them sitting on the steps; if they saw a policeman coming they would move up and down; after he was gone they would take up their position again—I have heard them call the workmen leaving Poole's in the evening curs, cowards, and dungs; that has occurred repeatedly—there were also pickets at Messrs. Stohwasser's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190058"/>
               <p>in Conduit Street, who conducted themselves very offensively indeed; when there was no one to drive them away they would surround the door steps, sitting on the door steps and leaning against the area railings; and when a policeman in uniform came by they would get up and walk up and down, and when he was gone they would go back, and when workmen came out they called them cowards, curs, and dungs, and pointed and said, "There they go! "—that has been the course when the workmen were leaving in the evening—that was the course of proceeding from the com<lb/>mencement—that was continued nightly at the first part of the strike, but it has not been so bad lately—I watched other tailors' shops, Mr. Small<lb/>page's in Maddox Street, and Mr. Bowater's in Hanover Street—the same course has been adopted there continually; there is Mr. Carter's in Hanover Square, and Mr. Bennett's and Mr. Meyer's—I have seen the persons go to the public-houses named—each person was kept on duty two hours at a time; I have seen them in the middle of the day as long as four hours, it appeared to be a sort of double relief which came on—they would come from the public-house or assembly rooms, go to their pickets, speak to the others on picket, who would go to the public-house, and report themselves much the same as they relieve guard with soldiers, only they did not march—I have seen people carrying away work, followed by pickets, and have followed to see what took place—I have seen them follow until the parties knew they were followed, and they have gone through public-houses with two entrances to get away; that has occurred frequently—I have also seen them followed till they came to another batch of pickets, and then they handed them over to the other batch—that appeared to cause annoyance to the work people; if it was a female she seemed very much frightened, I saw one woman run into Marlborough Street Police-court and two pickets after her—it was chiefly women who came to fetch work—I recognise all the defendants as pickets except Partridge, Bailey, Shorrocks, Stokes, and Newbury, and I have seen them all speaking to the pickets excepting Stokes and Shorrocks; they went up to the pickets in the streets and spoke to them, and I have seen the pickets pull out a book and show it to those who came up, and then put it into their pockets—I have seen the defendants at the Green Dragon thirty or forty times during the strike, Shurmer, Tampling, and Druller were three of the pickets, I recognise them as being before Stohwasser's at the latter end of May and June, and on many other occasions continually—on one occasion, May 3rd, I saw them in front of Stohwasser's, there was what they call a general <hi rend="italic">row; </hi>. saw a great crowd, and when Mr. Stohwasser's men came out a man, named Simpson I think, and his son were stopped and attacked by the pickets, and spit upon, and called dungs and curs—the three I have men<lb/>tioned were present and taking part in it, pushing among the crowd, and calling out the words I have mentioned—the police interfered.</p>

Smallpage's, Stohwasser's, and Poole's—lam able to identify them all as pickets—I have seen forty pickets within these three weeks watching Mr. Poole's shop—I did not count them—I have seen all the de<lb/>fendants at different places, some at Poole's, some at Stohwasser's, some at Hanover Square, and different places—the mob amounted to 150—I separate from the crowd what I call pickets—I have seen Maurice there frequently; none of the others—he is the only one I have seen in the middle of the day at Poole's, but I have seen all the defendants on picket duty at the several shops the same evening, some at one place and some at another, but not all at the same place at the same time—I have seen forty on one shop—the defendants were all on duty the same evening at different shops—I have never seen them all at one shop—I have seen Maurice at Saville Row—I can point out where I saw the others—I have sometimes counted the numbers—persons stopped to see what it was, and have entered the crowd.</p>

               <p>near to the Arcade he used that language, about the middle of Cork Street—he left the other pickets and followed me, and used that filthy language—there is a public-house close by—he used generally to sit on the railings of it, and he got off the railings—besides the occasion I have spoken of, I have seen Knox with the other pickets in Cork Street at various times.</p>

                  </hi> I am a journeyman tailor, working for some time for Mr. Bowater—after 2nd April the establishment was picketed, sometimes by three or four, sometimes more—some of the men annoyed me very much, but Ormerod is the only one I recognise—they were watching the people that went to the different shops, and on people coming out they watched where they went to—Ormerod followed me from Piccadilly to my house—we went in a public-house, drinking; he followed me and another one in, and offered to bet us six to one that we did not work on the Monday—they did not use offensive language, or call me any names.</p>

                  </hi> I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—I examined the prosecutor at about half-past six, and found he had a lacerated wound on the back of the hand, about three-quarters of an inch in length, and extending from the soft parts down to the bone—I also found a small wound in the back, which penetrated among the muscles ly<lb/>ing near the spine—this wound was not more than a quarter of an inch, but was an oblique wound, and extended inwards about an inch and a quarter—there was not much bleeding from it—it was not a dangerous wound—it would be physically impossible to inflict such a wound as the one in the back, with this knife—it might have caused the wound in the hand—the other blade of the knife might have caused the wound in the back.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live at 26, Burton Crescent—I am also surgeon to the E division of the police—on the 21st July, at about a quarter to one in the morning, I examined prosecutrix at the station—I examined her hand, but did not see her leg for two or three days after—she was suffering from incised wounds on the thumb and finger, on the outside, about one inch and a half in length, and reaching to the joint of the finger—one blow would have caused the wounds—she fainted in the station—I dressed the wounds and sent her home—next day I saw her at the hospital in Gray's Inn Road—the finger is not yet healed, and I doubt if she ever gets the use of it again—the other wound is well—I examined the scalded wound on the 29th July—she did not companion of that before—there was a blister.</p>

                  </hi> I am a china dealer at Whitechapel—about half-past one on the morning of the 10th July I was going along the Whitechapel Road towards my home with my two brothers—they were on a few yards in front—one of the females accosted me, and I was seized from behind by the throat, and I was thrown on the ground, and seven or eight people began kicking me—I am not able to speak to any of the prisoners—I had a watch and chain in my waistcoat pocket, and about £3 worth of silver—a policeman came up whilst I was on the ground, and three of the prisoners were taken into custody—when I got up I missed my watch and chain, and some silver from my pockets—four buttons were torn from my waistcoat—on the morning after the examination at the police-court I found my watch in the breast-pocket of my coat—it was not there on the previous day to my knowledge.</p>

About half-past three on the morning of the 17th July I was in Johnson's Place, which is about 250 yards from Westbourne Park Villas—I saw Harding coming from the direction of Westbourne Park Villas, and was going in the direction of Cirencester Street, where the prisoner Lewis lodges—a few minutes afterwards I saw the other two prisoners on the towing-path of the canal—they were also going in the direction of Cirencester Street—they wore great coats—shortly afterwards I saw all the prisoners together, Paul and Lewis without the great coats they had previously worn—they stopped at a coffee stall—Harding had a dead snake in his hand, which he said had bitten him—Paul and Lewis then went towards Westbourne Park Villas, and Harding crossed over to the next street, which also leads to Westbourne Park Villas—after he had turned the corner I saw him peep at me—I went after them, but lost sight of them—about a quarter-past seven I saw Paul at the end of Cirencester Street, coming from the direc<lb/>tion of Lewis's house—Harding was behind about 150 yards—I took hold of Paul—I afterwards went to Lewis's lodgings, No. 38, Cirencester Street, aud found all the things produced, which have been identified by the prosecutor.</p>

"—I said, "If it is your house I will soon get out of it"—I tried to get out, but they would not allow me—when I did get out I was immediately knocked down, and received two or three kicks in the side and two or three severe blows on the head—I could not state who dealt the blows, but Condon was the man who knocked me down—I cannot state positively that Ryan is one of the men, but I believe him to be one—I called out, "Police!" but they knelt on my throat and took my purse out of my pocket—there were 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse—I have not seen the purse since—I got up and was knocked down again—they ran away—I met two policemen, and we pursued the prisoners into Great Peter Street, and ultimately Condon was</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor—I know Keyser, I spoke to him upon the case, because some friends of Egeberg came and asked me if I could do so, as he was entirely innocent of the affair—I walked with him arm-in-arm for three-quarters of an hour—he asked me to have a glass of "cooper" with him; he took me to the Coach and Horses, at the corner of Conduit Street, and then I asked him if he was certain Egeberg insulted him as he had stated—he said he was not certain—I spoke to him a great deal more, I asked him the reason why he appeared—he said because he had promised Mr. Wolmerhausen—I asked if he wished to go and see any one belonging to the Tailors' Society and state the reason—he said he did not mind, so I sent for a gentleman up at the society, Mr. Maurice, and he left me standing at the bar and went away</p>

                  </hi> I was secretary to the committee of the Opera<lb/>tive Tailors' Association—I knew nothing of this blow given to Keyser till he came before me in company of Maurice—Maurice came to me in the committee-room, and said there had been an assault committed, as he understood—Keyser was not present at that time—Maurice stated some<lb/>thing to me in German which conveyed to my mind that he was wishing to settle the case—I neither know German, or French—our committee-room consists of a large room and a small side room—Maurice came and called me, and we went into the small side room, all three together, and Keyser communicated to me in French, through Maurice, an inclination to settle the case—Maurice spoke to me in English, he interpreted for Keyser—about that time we had come to the decision to take no part in defending violent acts, and we asked our solicitor to draw up a pamphlet to issue to our members, instructing them in the law—when Keyser came before us and wished to settle it, we felt there was an apparent innocence, and I dis<lb/>tinctly refused, through Maurice—Keyser addressed me in very fair English, and said that for the consideration of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week he would leave off, but he could not for less, and the payments at that time were only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I informed the committee of it, and they said, they would undertake the defence—I do not know that working tailors are subject to stiff legs; as far as my knowledge of the trade goes, they are as straight in their limbs as any other class.</p>

               <p>was there to fetch me, that he could better explain in my language—I went there, and he told me he wished not to work against the strike, only he worked in the City for Simpson's, the slop shop, and he went to the West End to try and get more wages, that he had taken work for Mr. Wol<lb/>merhausen, and he did not know that shop was on strike—I told him it was, and he said if he had known it he would not have done it, and said, "How shall I manage now to get away? "—I said, "Come with me to the committee-room, and we will see Mr. Lawrence and explain the matter"—we went and had a talk between the three of us—he said, "If you can promise me how much I shall have a week I will give up"—he was told we gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a man and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a woman—he said that was rather small, but he would think about it, and give me an answer in an hour's time—I waited for him two or three hours, but he never came back—that was the same day the case was at Marlborough Street—I saw him again, and said, "You promised me to come back in an hour's time"—he said, "Well, my dear friend, I cannot help it: a clerk from Mr. Wolmer<lb/>hausen and another gentlemen came to my place and took me away by force. I must go to Marlborough Street. It is my fault I know, but I will try everything I can not to get much punishment to the prisoner"—this conversation was in Lawrence's presence, but we spoke in German andLawrence does not understand German—we offered him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said he could not take it, and would give me an answer—he said, "If you could give so much for me and my wife I would leave off," and afterwards he said he would go back to his old shop again (Simpson's) if they would have him back—I saw him coming out from Marlborough Street, and he said to me, "You see I cannot help it, the two gentlemen are after me"—I wished to speak a few words to him, but one of the clerks took him by the arm and said, "Come on," and took him off in a cab.</p>

About seven o'clock on the evening of the 10th July I found the prisoner drunk in High Street, Tottenham, and locked her up—from information I received I asked her if she cashed an order—she said, "Yes"—I asked her if it was addressed to her—she said, "Yes," and that her name was Eliza Howard; that she was coming along a road, and sat down by two men who were eating bread and cheese; that a carriage passed and something dropped from it, and the men said that there was something which she was to read, and she found two letters and opened them, and one of them contained a post-office order for a guinea; and the men said, "You have as much right to it as any one," and they waited outside while she changed it, and they got stupidly drunk.</p>

               <p>watch chain, and said, "Let us have this"—I grasped my pocket, but the watch was not there—at the same moment a man behind me put his arm round my neck and held me back—I thought it was useless to attempt resistance, and occupied myself with intently looking at the prisoner, with a view to his identification—the prisoner broke the chain with his hands, and they all ran off together—it was a silver hunting watch worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—only part of the chain was taken—I ran after them, crying, "Stop thief!" and saw them run up Bedfordbury—I followed them, and at the bottom of Bedfordbtiry found a policeman—I told him of my loss, and he went up a court, up which the prisoner had been seen to run—I went to Bow Street station the same evening, and on the next Monday I was sent for to see some prisoners, but the prisoner was not among them—on the following Friday, 5th July, the prisoner was placed in a row of fourteen men and I picked him out of the lot—I have not the slightest doubt of him; I swear positively to him.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 35, Great St. Andrew Street, and have been in the habit of dealing with Mr. Radley for coals for the last twelve months—the prisoner has been employed there pretty nearly all that time—I remember 29th June, because I was there for coals that evening, and because I was out with a person who was ill—the prisoner weighed me half a hundred weight of coals—I waited for the boy to come in to carry them—it was about eleven o'clock, I know that, because I went on an errand, and came back again, and I went a second time, because it was getting late.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bombardier in the Artillery quarters at Woolwich—on 24th July I was on duty and met the prisoner at Rope Yard Rails about a quarter to twelve o'clock—he was not going towards the barracks—when he saw me coming he stood with his back against the wall—I walked up and asked him if he was on leave—he said he was—I told him to show it to me—he said that he was on leave for seven days, and had lost it—West came up and said, "See what he has been giving to me," and produced one shilling first and then six shillings—I asked him how he accounted for it—he said he had changed a sovereign in Powis Street—that is 150 yards from Beresford Street—I asked him to show me the place—he said that it was no use, he could not find it—I only found a halfpenny on him—on the way to the barracks he said that he lived in Cambridge Cottages—all soldiers who live there have a cottage of their own—I left him with a picket outside, went in, spoke to his wife, searched, and found a spoon and a piece of metal, answering to the description of this money, a little powder, a small bottle, the contents of which I do not know, several pieces of old rag, a piece of glass stained with powder, and a piece of zinc—they were on a top shelf, covered with some clothes—the prisoner said that he knew nothing of the spoon or the zinc—I took him to the guard-room, left him there all night, and next morning went to the Royal Artillery canteen, and received a bad shilling, which I gave to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> I am a corporal of the Royal Artillery, employed at the Woolwich canteen—I did not know the prisoner before 18th July, when he came there about nine in the evening for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling—I asked him if he knew it was bad—he said, "No"—I asked him where he got it, he said, "From the pay-sergeant"—I told him he would have to wait and see the manager of the canteen, and while I was going round the counter he disappeared—I marked the shil<lb/>ling and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Heath Cottages, Woolwich—on Sunday evening, 4th August, I saw the prisoner in a beershop—I had known him before—I called for a pint of beer and paid for it, and I asked him to have some—I then asked him to come home and have some supper—he had an opportunity of seeing my purse when I was paying for the beer—I went home to my lodging with him—my landlord saw him, we went up into my room and locked the door—my purse was then in my waistcoat pocket—I then went to bed and the prisoner slept by my side—when I woke tip he was not there—my trousers were turned inside out and my money was gone—he left my purse with some tin tickets in it—I afterwards saw him again and said, "You have stolen some of my money"—he said, "Here is the money, you can have that"—I gave him into custody—he wanted to say that I was drunk.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Smyth, of St. James's Steam Plough Mills, in the hamlet of Hitcham—on the night of the 17th July our dwellinghouse was broken into between half-past eleven and a quarter to six—my husband got up at that time—the house was secured when we went to bed—I came down at a quarter to six, and found the back window open—the latch had been slipped back—we missed pro<lb/>perty to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I identify the property produced as mine—these articles were in my house the night before.</p>

I remember this house being broken into—on the 18th July I received a description of the lost property, and from information I received I went to the prisoners' van, which was then standing on West Green, Hitcham—I saw Stockwell there, and asked her who was in charge of the caravan; she said, "I am"—I asked her if she knew Jane Smith, and she said, "Yes"—I asked if she was aware she was locked up; she said, "No"—I then told her I was a police constable, that Jane Smith was locked up, and that I had come to search the van—I asked her if there was anything in the van that did not belong to her, and she said, "No"—I commenced searching the van, and she said, "If there is anything here, I know nothing about it"—the first thing I found was some pieces of silk—I asked her how she accounted for them, and she said she had had it for a long time—I also found these articles that have been identified by the prosecutrix—I found them under the bed in a large box—on the 24th July I went to Stockwell's house, and on the mantelpiece I found a pawn-ticket, and in consequence I went to Mr. Putnam, and he gave me a shawl, which was part of the property lost—on the 2nd August I apprehended Smith at the House of Correction, Wandsworth, wearing a jacket which was stolen from the mills on the night of the burglary.</p>
