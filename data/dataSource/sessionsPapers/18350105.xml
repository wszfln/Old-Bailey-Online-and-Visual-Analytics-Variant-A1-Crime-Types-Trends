                  </hi>. I live with my brother at No. 2, Hooper-street, Westminster-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. I went out about half-past nine o'clock in the evening of last Saturday week, the 27th of December—I came home about ten o'clock, and found the stable window broken open—it joins the house—it is a spare room which we make a stable of—the hinge was broken off, and half the window ledge taken out—I found the street door open which leads to the stable—I found it open when I came to it to go in—the street door was shut at half-past nine o'clock when I left home, and the stable quite secure—I had seen the window of the stable about half an hour before I left, and I passed it as I went out—I had fastened it before I went out—I returned about ten o'clock, and found the street door open—I went in, and found the clothes taken from the bureau—I missed two coats, two pairs of trowsers, 2 waistcoats, a silk handkerchief, a memorandum book, and a pair of glaves—the bureau was in the parlour—the drawers of it were shut when I went out, but not locked—I had seen the things safe</p>

               <p>ten minutes before I went out—I went to the door and gave an alarm—a policeman came, and I gave a description of a person whom I suspected—the prisoner was employed by my brother, who keeps a coal shed—it is my brother's house—his name is Henry Dark Pimm—the prisoner had been in his employ three or four years, on and off, I believe, to carry out coals—he did not sleep at the house, but lodged in the same street as the coal shed is in—I had left nobody in the house when I went out—my brother was out—I live with my brother—his shop is in the same street as the prisoner resides, but we live in the next street to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of Emma Pimm, and live with my brother in Hooper-street. The prisoner left the shop about nine or a quarter after nine o'clock—I was in my brother's shop at the time—he was going home to his tea—he had just come back from taking some coals out—I called him back from his tea afterwards to take out some coals, and by the time he had weighed the coals my two sisters came by—it was then about half-past nine o'clock—they hallooed out to me, "Eliza, I shall not be long, I am going into the New Cut to get something for supper"—he asked me who that was—I said my two sisters, saying they should not be long, they were going to get something for supper, in the New Cut—he then said he would take the coals out—he took them, leaving me in the shop—as near as I can guess, he was gone about ten minutes, and when he came back he said he had not finished his tea, and would go home and finish it—that it was on the hob—he went home as I thought, and I never saw him from that time till the policeman took him—it would not take five minutes to walk from my brother's shop to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information from Emma Pimm, and went to the house hearing her give the alarm of robbery—I found the stable window, which is attached to the premises, had been broken open—I examined it—the lower part of the hinge was torn from the stone cill, and the stone cill was laying on the ground—the window is about three feet from the ground—the stone cill was torn out—that must have required some force—the front of the house is considerably dilapidated, and it would not require a great deal of force to get the cill out—I went into the parlour with the first witness, and she told me what she had lost—suspicion rested on their boy who carried out their coals—I went into Francis-street, which joins Hooper-street, and overtook the prisoner going home—I knew him—this was about a quarter or twenty minutes after ten o'clock—I said to him, "I have a charge of housebreaking against you"—he answered, "I do not know what you mean"—I told him his master's house had that night been entered, and he was the supposed youth—he said he had not been near the premises, for he had been on an errand for his mother—I took him into custody—he had none of the clothes about him which had been stolen—he unbuttoned his jacket, and said he had no clothes about him—I did not search him in the street—I had men<lb/>tioned clothes to him—on our way to the station-house I was walking on his left side—I felt him tear something from his trowsers with his right hand, and he said to a boy who was walking on his right hand, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, take this, I will give it to you"—I immediately stopped him in the street, and his hand was between his thighs—I had hold of the other hand—I took from his thighs a watch fob—he had let go of it—when I took it from him, it was between his thighs—there was half-a-sovereign, three half-crowns, and two shillings in it, which I produce—I asked the boy what he had</p>

               <p>handed to him—he said he did not know—the boy merely called out," Here, policeman, he has offered me something," and the prisoner took his hand from the boy, and put it between his thighs—this fob must have been what he offered him—at the station-house I asked him to account for the money—he said a Mrs. Perry, in Baker-street, had given the money to him to give to his mother, to take care of, for she did not wish her husband to know she had that quantity of money about her—after he was locked up, I went to Mrs. Perry's, in Baker-street—she is not here—I went to ten different pawnbrokers' shops that evening, and could find no property—on Monday morning, the 29th of December, the prosecutor and myself were in the yard at Queen-square office—at that time the prisoner was locked up at the office—he sent a messenger to his master that he wanted to speak to him—the prosecutor and I went to him, and all the prisoner said was, "Henry, I will tell you where the clothes are"—that was the first that passed—neither of us said a word to him before that, for we could not see him—he was in the cell—we did not say a word to him except giving him to understand Henry Pimm was at the door—he said, "They are at the nearest pawnbroker's shop, on the left hand side of the Surrey theatre, in Blackfriars-road"—I went to that pawnbroker's shop, and found all the property except two waistcoats.</p>

On Monday morning, the 1st of December, the prisoner came and asked if I would buy a live pheasant—I said I would—he went away, and brought another man with him with a pheasant in his possession, and having received information that Mr. Alderman Atkins had lost a bird of that description, I went to the Alderman—Mr. Lane came down from there and asked the two men where they came from—they both said, "From East Grinstead"—Mr. Lane turned round to look at the bird, and the prisoner ran off directly—the other ran immediately after him—he was overtaken and brought back, but the prisoner escaped—I am quite positive of his person—I asked them how they came by it—they said they caught it in a wire—Mr. Alderman Atkins and Miss Atkins afterwards saw the same pheasant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Jeremiah Woods, a hosier, living in Bond-street. About twelve o'clock in the morning of the 13th of De<lb/>cember, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for flannel waistcoats and shirts, which I showed him, at about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—he asked for some about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said they would do—I packed up two waistcoats and two shirts, by his direction—I was to carry them to No. 28, Hyde-park-corner, I think—he gave me the name of—Morton, Esq.—he then left the shop—he had stood close by the window in the shop, and this piece of silk handherchiefs was in the window near him—I took the parcel myself, and looked first in Oxford-street, to find No. 28, Hyde-park-corner—then crossed the park, but could find no No. 28, in Park-terrace or street—he had not paid for the goods—I returned home—it was then dark—I went to the window in consequence of what Mr. Woods said, and this piece of handkerchiefs was gone—they were worth 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 13th of December, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I saw a mob running in Lower Berkeley-street—they were crying, "Stop thief"—the prisoner was run<lb/>ning from the mob—he crossed the Edgeware-road into Connaught-square, and I stopped him—he said, "Let me go; I have done nothing"—I said, "Then you need not be afraid"—in a few minutes, a young man came up with a bundle in his hand, and said in his presence, "I give this man into your custody; he has been at our shop obtaining goods under false pre<lb/>tences"—I took him to the station-house—on searching him, I found these four handherchiefs in his pocket, and three all in a piece, in the crown of his hat.</p>

I had not the handkerchiefs, and went for them—he was to sail for Ireland next day, and I was to go and get them, and to select for him two night-shirts and waistcoats. I went to the gentleman's shop, and asked him if he had any flannel waistcoats—he showed me some. I asked for night-shirts; the gentleman who sent me for the order told me to get large ones—the gen<lb/>tleman had not them long enough—he produced some—I told him to take them to Morton, 228, Hyde-park-corner. Mrs. Williams, his cousin, was to sail to Ireland with him, and she told me to select two shawls for her and her sister. I went to Redmond's in Bond-street, selected some, and told him the woman would meet him at 229, Oxford-street. On my way, in going to take the handkerchiefs to the gentleman, I met a gentleman with the parcel, I said, "Did you take the shawls to the lady?"—He said, "No, for there is no lady there." I said, "Come with me, I will take you to where the lady is." I took him to the place, and asked if Mrs. Williams had called. The servant said, "No;" he was so enraged with me, I wished him to go where Mrs. Williams lived; but he gave me in charge of the policeman, who asked if he had got the shawls—he said, "I don't choose to be humbugged in this way." The policeman said, "I shall not take him without some charge." I wished to go to the station-house—the policeman refused to let me take hold of his arm to get out of the crowd—they were ill-using me. Somebody said, "Run away—don't be ill-used in this way." I ran away, and this man ran after me, calling "Stop thief!" The next policeman came up with the witness, and I was glad to throw myself into his hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Marylebone. On the 22d of December I met the prisoners together, just by the Duke of Wellington public-house, at the corner of Grosvenor-place—I turned back, and watched them down Grosvenor-place—I saw the man go to the corner of Chapel-street, and wait there—the woman went backwards and forwards four or five minutes, then went up some steps and stopped, then came down the steps to the man—they stood close together—I could not see whether any thing passed, but she came back to the house again, and was going backwards and forwards—I saw her go and stoop down an area, then go over to the man again, and come back—I watched them very closely—I saw her going backwards and forwards to another house for eight or ten minutes; then go up the steps, come down, and go to the man—I then followed, and took them into custody—I found one pot in the man's pocket, another in his hat; and a soldier, whom I had been talking to, found a pot under the woman's arm—she cried out, "Oh! Keys, Keys, do not take him; he knows nothing of it"—I took them both to the station-house.</p>

On Friday morning, the 2nd of January, I and the prisoner Merriman were in my master's shop from ten minutes before six o'clock to about ten minutes after—we were left alone in the shop—Merriman asked me if I was going to have any coffee—I said I did not know—he came to me and said, "I will toss you for some"—I tossed, and won two cups of coffee, which was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling to go and get it and pay for it—he told me to have mine at the coffee-shop and to pay for his—I went out to the coffee-shop by the Arcade in Piccadilly, and had some coffee—I re<lb/>turned to the shop in about five minutes, and saw him altering some shoulders of mutton, changing the places where I had hung them—I said, "What are you changing them for?"—he made no reply, and went out—he came back in about five minutes, and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, a person named Stone called, and in consequence of what he said to me, I examined the mutton and missed a shoulder—it had hung up in the part where he was altering them—I had hung it up myself—I saw that shoulder of mutton at Marl borough-street—I knew it by a mark on it—it is in Court—it was in its proper place in the shop when I tossed for</p>

In consequence of information I received, I watched the shop of Mr. Spreckley on the 2nd of January, in the morning, and a little before six o'clock I saw the shop door open, and two men come out—in a few minutes afterwards those two men came back with a cart—while the cart stood at the door, I saw Jenner come down Albemarle-street with a basket under his arm—he crossed over Piccadilly and went towards the Green-park—he came back again and went up Al<lb/>bemarle-streetagain, and looked into the shop-door—the cart was gone away then—he went half-way up the street, crossed over, and stood there for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then went back to the shop and stood at the corner of Piccadilly—I went past him, and saw the basket was empty, except a cloth—he walked past the shop, stood there a few minutes, and while he was there I saw a boy come out of the shop—directly the boy got into Piccadilly, the prisoner Jenner ran across the road into the shop with the basket under his arm—he came out without it and went towards Piccadilly—while he went towards Piccadilly, I saw Merriman come out at the shop door, and look up and down the street—he then went into the shop, and came out with the basket full, and a cloth over it—he placed it on the step of the next door, and went to the shop door again—Jenner ran over to the shop door, and had some conversation with him—then Merriman went inside the shop, and Jenner went and took the basket from the door.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ—it was his business to go about the town, sell goods, and receive money—my son delivered the goods to him in the morning, and it was his duty to bring back the goods or the money—on the day before the officer took him, which was in December, he came into the warehouse where I was, and said, "A fine morning, Sir"—I turned and said, "Yes, and a fine game you have been playing with me"—he fell on his knees and said he hoped I would forgive him, and give him two years to pay the money back—I said, if I gave him that privilege, he would rob me to a greater amount still.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 24th of December, I lived at No. 188, Strand. I occupied the house myself—it is in the parish of St. Clement Danes—I have a shop, and deal in furs and skins—on the 12th of December, I was called down to speak to the prisoners—they had asked to see some fur col<lb/>lars before I saw them—they were fur collars, of black lambs—they spoke French—I showed them some black lamb-skins—they selected two, with great nicety—they were a great while about it—they said they would leave them, and I requested them to mark the skins, as they were to leave them—they said that was of no consequence, for they were not suspicious, like the English—there were some common boas, lying across the counter, which were not good enough for them—they asked if I had any sable boas—they called them "sable"—I said, "Yes," and requested them to come back into the back shop—they went with me into the back shop, and I showed them some boas—I opened a drawer in which they were—they looked at several, and when they came to the prime sable tails, Kehn brushed up the hair, and said they were very nice, and they would bring their ladies to<lb/>morrow to select some—I showed them some muffs, which they looked at, and on looking back, I saw Kehn twist a boa round his hand, take the ticket off it, and show it to me, asking whether that was the price—I told him, "Yes"—after looking at the muffs, they departed, and took out a sove<lb/>reign, and paid for the skins 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all they bought—they went away—I went back into the back shop, and put away my boas—I instantly missed one of the best boas—I called to my daughter, and said I had been robbed—there were no boas lying about, when I first went into the back shop with the prisoners—they were all in the drawer—there was nobody in the back shop, besides myself and the prisoners, from the time they first went</p>

The prisoners called on me, in Bond-street, on Saturday, the 13th of December, between three and four o'clock—I had received from my father, on the previous evening, a warning, cautioning me to be on my guard—when they came, they showed me a parcel, and unwrapped it—it was two black lamb-skins—on seeing them, and the prisoners answering the description, my suspicions were ex<lb/>cited immediately, and I looked for our private mark on the back of the lamb-skins—not understanding the French language perfectly, I did not understand whether they wished to sell the skins, or for me to show them a piece of the same kind—I found our private mark was not on them—I took them into the back shop to gain further time, to make up my mind what to do—Kehn followed me into the back shop, and the other remained at the door of the shop—Kehn seemed to wish to take the skins out of my hand, and by his manner I supposed he meant that he would get them somewhere else—he took them from my hand, and walked into the front</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Abraham Harrison Dry, a pawnbroker, in St. Martin's-lane. About three o'clock on the 6th of De<lb/>cember, the prisoner came to the shop with another man—he asked if I spoke French—I said "A little"—he asked if I had any brilliant rings—I</p>

               <p>told him I had, and showed him a tray with a quantity of diamond rings on it—they were all diamond rings—he tried on six or seven—they were fastened on the card, and I took them off for him to try on—there was a diamond ring, marked 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had noticed—I took that off the card—there were none of his size, that would go on his finger—he asked if we had any more—I showed him another tray, with very few diamond rings on it—I turned round to reach that tray from the window—I took one ring off a card in that tray—he tried it on, and asked his companion to look at it—he said he did not like it—he returned me the ring; the other one said in French, "Let us go," and they went—when they were gone, I was putting the rings on the card again, and missed a brilliant ring, which he had tried on, of the value of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a single brilliant ring—there was a single brilliant ring besides that, but this was a different shaped stone from the others—we had not another of that size and shape—the apprentice was serving at the other part of the shop, which is ap<lb/>pointed to the pawnbroker's business, and the prisoner was in the sale shop—there was no other customer in the shop besides the prisoner and his companion—the apprentice was in the sale shop, but he was on the same side of the counter as me, but not near the place—he was a yard from where the rings were—he was serving somebody at the end of the shop, and came to the end of the shop that I was at, to go to the till to help himself to money—it is quite impossible that the apprentice could have taken the ring—I missed the ring about three minutes after the prisoner and his companion left the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Milton, near Newport Pagnell, in Buck<lb/>inghamshire.

On Monday, the 15th of December, I bought a bullock of Jonas Payne, for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid for it at Jones's, the bankers, within half an hour of making the pur<lb/>chase, which is the usual manner of dealing—I did not take it away for some time—I went to my drover and pointed it out—I saw him mark it with ochre, not with a letter, but a private mark—I paid the money at Jones's to the credit of Jonas Payne—I did not take it into my posses<lb/>sion till after I had paid for it—it is usual for me to put the letter "P" on all the cattle I purchase—I am at Smithfield every market day—per<lb/>sons could see how I managed my business—the bullock I bought arrived at home—I have known the prisoner three or four years, and have seen him at Smithfield pretty often—he formerly used to work for my drover, and he has driven cattle to my place—I did not agree to buy a bullock for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in partnership with him, and share the profit between us—I have not spoken to him for years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Allcock, a drover, at Smith<lb/>field. On the 15th of December I had 14 oxen under my care, belonging to Jonas Payne—I know the prisoner perfectly well by sight, but not by name—I remember some person coming to me that day for a bullock, in the name of Peachey—as near as I can guess, it might be twelve o'clock—I cannot say the prisoner is the person—I do not think I can identify the man who drew it—I do not think I delivered it myself, but somebody came respecting a bullock for Mr. Peachey—I went to Jones's, the bankers, and made inquiry there whether a bullock was paid for in the name of "Peachey"—I did not mention any sum—in consequence of what I learnt, the ox was delivered—two were delivered in the course of the day in the name of "Peachey," but I was not present when Mr. Peachey's, of Brix<lb/>ton, was delivered—it was afterwards that his was delivered—I remember the hide of the bullock I delivered—I saw that hide down at Rudderford's slaughter-house, Lambeth-walk, and afterwards at Queen-square—I am certain it was the hide of Payne's bullock, which had been delivered in the name of "Peachey"—it had a large "P" on it, exactly as Mr. Peachey, of Brixton, marks his—I should not have delivered it if I had not be<lb/>lived that it was paid for—nobody represented to me that the price of that particular bullock had been paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say Mr. Peachey had the mark of "P" on his bullock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is his usual mark—I had 14 bullocks—they were all marked by the drover's mark, which is a very small "P," but this was a large "P"—they had only one "P" on before they were sold—Mr. Peachey's and this one had more than one "P" on, I believe, when I parted with them—I will not take on myself to say that there was not more than two—it is customary for the purchaser to put a mark on it—I swear to Jonas Payne's drove mark—not to the large "P," every one has got the mark on it—I had some in my care three markets Mondays and Fridays—they had the same mark as those I had the preceding Monday—I can swear this hide is one of the 14 I had that Monday, by the drove mark—I had none of Jonas Payne's since the 14th—I had before, but they had a different mark—the hide I saw, was one of the fourteen I had in my possession—I did not see the second ox delivered—I know another Mr. Peachey; but we have transactions with no other.</p>

On the evening of the 1st of January, I was passing my husband's warehouse in York-street, and saw Abraham Phillips standing inside the warehouse gate—I stood to watch, and saw the prisoner put a bag of rags on Phillips's shoulder—I followed him into a shop in Shoreditch—I went into the shop, and he was going to sell them—he put them on the counter, and a boy belonging to the shop was coming out to attend to him, but I asked for the master—the mistress came, and I claimed them—I got Russell to take Phillips with the bag, which I knew to be ours.</p>

               <p>Tipper took me up for walking along the street, and I would not <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> any thing to drink—the other officer took me for carrying some chairs on my head, which had been given me to carry—I was taken to the Compter and to Guildhall—I was committed by the Alderman for a month to Bridewell—I did not produce the person who gave me the chairs.</p>

On the 31st of December, I was coming down Kingsland-road, just at the corner of Union-street, and saw the prisoner, Rolt, drop one shoe just at the corner of the street—he tried to throw another shoe down the area next door to Mr. Bacon's—the policeman had hold of the prisoners at the time—I picked up both the shoes; gave the first that he dropped to the policeman, and took the other into the shop, and put it on the counter—Mr. and Mrs. Bacon and the policeman were there—Rolt afterwards tried to put a boot down the area in a handkerchief—he let it fall—he tried to put it down, but could not—he threw it down—I took it up, took it into the shop, and put it on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About twenty minutes after fire o'clock, on the Slat of December, I was in Union-street, Kingsland-road, and saw two boys who I believe to be the prisoners, at the prosecu<lb/>tor's shop window—I did not see their faces—it is a very dark spot there, or else it would have been lightenough to see their faces—I watched them nearly half an hour—during that time they crossed and re-crossed to Mn Bacon's shop—at last they stopped there three or four minutes, and walked away quickly, which excited my suspicion—I ran immediately to the shop—the prosecutor was at home—I asked him if he had lost any thing from the window, previous to my looking at it—I had not seen enough of the boys to swear to them—I found the window broken—he said-some shoes were taken out—I went after the boys, but they escaped at the time—I went round Hackney-road, and Kingsland-road—I then returned to Mr. Bacon's shop, and told him I could not find them—I then went to the top of Union-street, and there saw the two prisoners nearly together, not two minutes' walk from Mr. Bacon's—directly I got round the corner, I saw Gadby with one boot in his hand, looking at it—I said to him, "Where did you get that boot from?"—he said, "My father is a shoemaker"—at that moment I saw his left hand at his coat, as if he had something under it—I said, "That will not do for me, give me the others"—upon which he gave me another boot—at this time I saw Rolt, and said, "Stop," and collared him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050070"/>
               <p>—they were very close to each other—I had not collared him an instant before Barnardier brought me a boot, and said Rolt had just dropped it—on going down Union-street, towards the prosecutor's shop, I saw Rolt endeavour to put another boot, with a handkerchief round it, down an area—Barnardier took it up—the prosecutor identified them.</p>

Q.</hi> How long was it from the time you discovered the window broken, to your seeing the two lads at the corner of Union-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty minutes—I had lost sight of them all that time—I have no doubt when I first saw them, that Gadby was examining the boot, he had in his hand—he was not talking to Rolt, Rolt was just behind him—I suppose they were on the look out for me—Gadby never said the boots had been given or sold to him by Rolt, in my presence—I know his father is a highly respectable man—he is a bricklayer, not a shoemaker—when he said his father was a shoemaker, it was to avoid my inquiry no doubt, the prosecutor is so frequently robbed; if I clear the boys away, the moment we go off the beat he is robbed.</p>

Last Friday evening, about half-past six o'clock, I was with Prince, at the house of Mason, No. 13, Neville 's-court, Leather-lane—while there, I heard a knock at the door—I opened it, and in came James Gooding, the prisoner—he inquired for Mason—he had a bag over his shoulder—I asked him what he had got in the bag; he said old metal—I asked where he got it; he said he bought it of a man in the street—I asked if he knew the man he bought it of; he said he did not—I searched the bag, and found two metal screws, two caps, and seven flanges—I put the bag on one side, and told him he must consider himself in custody—I called Prince, who was about the back premises; and then I heard another knock at the door—I opened it, and in came the prisoner Jones—I asked him who he wanted—he told me he wanted his mate—he was going away, I told him to come in—Prince came up and laid hold of him, and brought him into the house—he was on the steps, and we thought his intention was to go—when I told him to come in, he said, "Oh, never mind," signifying that he would not come in; and he was in the act of turning round to go—I did not hear exactly what he did say—I heard him say, "Oh, never mind"—he was in the act of turning round to go away, when Prince came and took him—Gooding was in the shop at the time—when we got him inside, Prince asked him what he had got about him—he said he had got nothing—Prince unbuttoned his clothes, and, in searching him, found some metal concealed under his waistcoat—I then heard another knock at the door—I opened it, and in came the prisoner Rumble—I do not remember what questions Prince put to him; but I saw him find some metal concealed under his clothes—we secured the three prisoners, sent for assistance, and took them to the watch-house—I did not remark whether they spoke to one another.</p>

Come along in; have you any thing about you?"—he said, "I have not"—I tapped him on the body and said, "Now strip;" and on Jones, I found nine pieces of metal, and the name on Rumble—it was in the form of the stomach—they had it under their waistcoats, next to their shirts, slung over their shoulders, and this piece Rumble had in his hat—the prisoners were all put into one room together—they did not ap<lb/>pear to be acquainted with each other.</p>

Mr. Braithwaite was employed some time ago, casing some tank columns with copper—the copper was bought in sheets, and made to fit the columns—we had to make some alterations afterwards, as the copper was carried too high up the columns, and we cut oif six pieces, which I took charge of—I kept them in the counting-house, till within the last fortnight—the last time I saw them was about last Wednesday week—they were then in the store-room where I had taken them to—this is one of those pieces of copper which I placed in the store-room—I know it, because instead of being copper pipe, which is the general material we hare on the premises, it is copper sheets, which were lapped instead of having a joint, and sol<lb/>dered afterwards; we faced them first with anti-corrosin, and part of the paint has run down the copper; and I also know it by this peculiar joint—here is red paint, which is anti-corrosive paint, inside it, and here is one corresponding piece, which I brought from the brewery this evening—it exactly matches the other, except in length; in diameter it is nearly the same—I missed in particular these six pieces, and I have missed within the last six months a considerable quantity of copper—the firm is Harvey, Combe, Delafield, and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, and lodge at No. 3, King-street, Brick-lane. On the 23rd of December, I asked the prisoner to help me to carry some soot—I received a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and two shil<lb/>lings for it, and gave him one shilling—I went and drank a little beer with him, and asked him home to tea—we had three pints of beer there—I left the sovereign in my wife's care—about seven o'clock I was going to fetch some errands in with the half-sovereign—I saw her tie the sovereign up in the corner of a handkerchief which was round her neck—we had a quartern of gin—the prisoner left about a quarter before eight o'clock—he said he was coming back in about an hour and a half, and said, "You have got your money safe in the corner of your handkerchief?"—he did not return—I asked my wife where the money was afterwards—I untied her handkerchief, because she could not, and then there was a sixpence, instead of a sovereign—she had had no silver at all—I went to look for him for about three hours that night, and then went to bed—I got an officer next morning, and found him—I have not found the sovereign.</p>

This is a plaster-of-Faris mould, for the purpose of casting sixpences—there are upon it the impressions of three sixpences—both the obverse and reverse sides of them—it is a mould in which sixpences may be cast, and I think has been used for casting them—by closing one on the other, they will form three sixpences—there is a channel down which the metal is poured in a state of fusion—the metal is easily melted in a pipkin like this, and laded out with a pipe—this pipe has some metal in the tube of it now—it is a mixture of tin and antimony—these twelve sixpences are all counter<lb/>feit, and I believe have been cast in this mould—this file is used to remove the small spray from the coins when made—these pieces of metal are called <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>, they came out of the mould produced—I have tried them to it, and they fit exactly—they are removed with a pair of scissors or a file—this Roman cement is not used in coining, that I am aware of—here are twenty-seven counterfeit shillings, and two good ones, which appear to me to have been used to make a mould, in which the bad shillings have been made—this half-crown is counterfeit, the other is good.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Isaac Russell's Defence.</hi> When they came, they seized hold of me, and put the handcuffs on me, in bed—they asked me to get up, and took me to the other side of the room, placed me against the window, and ransacked my place all over—the night before, about seven o'clock, or half-past seven, my wife went to get something for supper, and two young men named, Harris and Davis, called and asked me if they could leave these two bags there? I said, "Yes"—I went to the yard to wash myself, and when I came in, I put on my coat and handkerchief, and said I was going out—they said, "Put these bags away"—I said they could put them away—they put them in the cupboard—I left them there—I went down White Cross-street, and saw no more of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were servant to the prisoner for some time? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes, about ten months—I directed a search to be made in his house—I told the officers where they could find the counterfeit coin—I used to work there at the soda-water, and any thing, in the cellar—the first time I knew the coin was bad, was between three and four months ago—I thought it was very dishonest—I was not certain it was counterfeit—it was about a fortnight ago I first knew it to be bad—I gave information on Tuesday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you become certain it was bad? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beard a woman call him a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>—I do not know her name—I saw her go by the shop—they had fallen out about some meat, which she came to buy, and she called him a b—y <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>—I had never seen her before, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw this coin, between three and four months ago, did you ask the prisoner any thing about them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw them first in a cellar opposite, in a box, and then I saw them in the mouth of an oven, where he baked his cakes—these are not one-third of what I first saw—he brought them from the cellar opposite in hie apron—I did not tell him I had seen them—I did not think it was my business—he brought them from the opposite cellar in his blue apron, to the mouth of the oven—I did not speak to him about it—I did not know whether it was bad or good—I do not know whether an oven is a usual place to keep such things in—the prisoner did not discharge me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean he did not discharge you for theft, and tell you so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I left of my own accord—I did not ask the prisoner, to give me a character—I did not send my wife to him—I left because I was sent into the cellar to get some coals and soda-water—I took the coals and the soda-water into the parlour—I put the coals on the fire, and my mistress said that was not the place for the soda-water—I then took it into the shop—my mistress sent her daughters and son out to rifle me, to pull me about—I thought it was to search me, to see if I had any thing about me—I should think one daughter is about sixteen—the son is the youngest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now do I rightly undestand you, that you were never charged with theft by any of the family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Charged;" never discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever accused, or taxed, or charged, by any member of that family, with stealing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was omce a piece of meat lost—I was asked whether I knew any thing at all about it, and I said I did not—I was not charged with stealing it—I was not asked whether I stole it, nor told I stole it—I left last Sunday week, which was more than three or four weeks after that—it was two ribs of beef, not the top ribs—the prisoner himself spoke to me about it—Mr. Solomon was present, and, I believe, Mrs. Shannon—I</p>

               <p>was taken into the parlour—it is not very large—I forget whether Mrs. Shan<lb/>non was there or not—I believe another woman was there—I do not know who she was—it was a woman who came to buy meat—she was not bargain<lb/>ing then, but she had a basket there—it was six or seven weeks after the beef was missed, that Mrs. Shannon sent her daughter and son to rifle me—it was on a Saturday night, and I left the next morning—I did not leave at the time, because Mr. Shannon was not at home—I did not leave when I was charged about the ribs of beef, because I had not another situation, to go to, but I had when I was rifled by the daughter, a situation in Goulston-street—I was never taxed by any member of the family with stealing beef, or any other meat, and was never asked but that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after you heard the woman call him a smasher, did you give information? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell, it might be two or three weeks—I did not go before, because it did not strike me whether it was good money or bad—I suspected it when the woman called him a <hi rend="italic">smasher</hi>, but I did not give information sooner, because I was not <hi rend="italic">right down</hi> certain that the money was bad; but afterwards I was at work in the cellar, sawing wood, and the stool did not stand steady; I found it stood upon a loose stone—I took np the atone to make it stand steady—I saw the apron and the money in it—I looked at it, and the money was cankerish—I had seen bad money before, nailed on counters and tables—I had seen this money first in the cellar opposite—then Mr. Shannon brought it over—then I saw it in the oven, then in a hole in the wall—when I saw it in the mouth of the oven, I had not the curiosity to look at it—it was not loose, it was in the apron—I saw him take it out of the box—he had sent me to that cellar to more some wood—he came over, and said, "What is it o'clock?"—I said "I do not know"—he said, "Go and see"—I went, and as I was coining down, I heard a jinking with this money—he was on his knees, taking it out of the box into his apron—it was loose in the box—I saw him take something out, and I heard the jinking—I did not see it—I saw it in the mouth of the oven, in this apron—I felt it, but did not open it—I never saw such, a heap of money together before—I did not send my wife to the prisoner for a character, nor to beg that I might be taken back.</p>

ELLIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You brought the coals and soda water np, and put the coals on the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I put the soda-water down—Mrs. Shannon came out of the yard and went into the parlour, and when. I went into the shop, the daughter and son came and began to rifle me, and tried to knock my hat off—I said, "What are you at? if you are so full of your play, I am not"—they did not tell me why they did it, but brought a broom out, and poked about me—my hat fell off—Mrs. Shannon came out and picked it up, and said, "John, you may go home"—I went, and that next morning I came to work as usual—I then saw my master, but I thought I would not say any thing to him, till my mistress came down—when the servant came down, I said, "Gillman, I will not stop; I have lived in places where I can have a good character, I will not stop"—about half-past eight o'clock my master told me to go to breakfast—when I came back, my mistress was in the parlour—she began to abuse me—I told her of her sending her daughter and son to search me—she said I was a liar, and told me to go to hell—I told her I would go, and went away—my master was standing in the parlour at the time—I had been paid on the Saturday night before my master went out—I had had no disagreement with my master that Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in John-street, Cambridge Heath. I have known Hatwell five years—he told me to make him some clothes, and he brought me a pig—I did not see Kenny till the last—Hat<lb/>well came to me again, and said he had got another pig for me—I asked if it was as good as the first—he said, "Yes, rather better"—I was to make him a coat for two pigs—that was the agreement—I did not know what two they were, but he came to me, and said, "You will want a couple of pigs"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will tell you what I was thinking of; if you will make a fustian coat, I will find you a couple of pigs"—he then came and said he had a sow and pig, which he could put me in reasonable; but I found it would not suit me, and dropped that agreement—he then said I should have two store pigs—he came on the Monday before Christ<lb/>mas, and asked if the coat was done—I told him not quite, but if he would go with me, and fetch the two pigs, the coat should be ready against he came back—he refused—I told him I should keep the coat till I had the pigs—he came the next morning, and I was called to him—Kenny was with him, and so he was the evening before—Hatwell then asked if</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in the parish of West Ham, in Essex. I went out on Tuesday, the 23rd of De<lb/>cember, about eleven o'clock, leaving a gold watch and chain, seal and key, and a mourning ring, on the table in the surgery, at the back of the shop—I returned home aboit a quarter to one o'clock, and was informed they had been stolen—the female prisoner was there in custody—I asked her who had given her the basket of lemons and oranges, which she had when taken—she stated that a man in black gave them to her to hold, and then ran away, and she had never seen the person before—while I was in convers<lb/>tion I was informed that the male prisoner was taken—I then went out, and saw him in the custody of the constable of West Ham—he was then taken to my house—I asked him what he had done with the property he had taken—he said, "What property?"—I then begged of him to state the truth, and tell me where he had placed what he had stolen—he was then searched, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on him, but no portion of the property. I then went out of the room, and heard him in conversation with Mrs. Fenner, who was in the house when the property was stolen—she was endeavour<lb/>ing to persuade him to acknowledge where he had placed the property—I held him say, "If they would let me go I would tell where I put it"—on hearing which, I entered the room, and told him if he would tell me where he had peaced the property, I would do all I could that he might not be punished—he said he was afraid I would not keep my word, or he would show me—I then said, "Well then, you must take your course, I am no liar"—he then said if the handcuffs were taken off he would company me and one officer, and show us where he had Placed the pro<lb/>perty—I said, "Do so, and all that man can do for your discharge I will do"—he then accompanied us to the marshes, where he had been taken, and said he had plunged them, with his left hand, into the ditch, both the watch and the mourning ring—he was allowed to go into the ditch, and was searching about from one ditch to another for three hours, but we be<lb/>gan to suppose he was merely losing time, and refused to remain any longer—he still swore he had placed it in the second ditch, and was then taken away in custody—I have not found any part of the property—the ditches have been searched.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Mr. Vallance's—I had charge of his house. On Tuesday, the 23rd of December, I was in the surgery—a gold watch, and gold chain, seals, and key, and a mourning-ring, laid on the table—I left the room about twenty-five minutes after twelve o'clock—I shut the surgery door, and went down into the kitchen, which is under the surgery—the outer door of the house was open—I was gone two minutes at the outside, when I thought I heard a footstep over my head, in the surgery—I directly came up and saw the prisoner Green leaving the front door, with a basket under his right arm, with oranges and lemons in it—I thought it appeared very strange, his leaving a house without either knock<lb/>ing or ringing—I went and looked into the shop, and then saw the surgery-door open, which I had shut when I went down—there is another door leading to the kitchen stairs, which was likewise shut—seeing the surgery-door open, I directly missed the watch and rings—I then followed as quick as possible, and saw Green give the basket to Allen, who turned her head and saw me coming—she said something to Green, what I cannot say, and then Green ran—I directly went up to Allen and asked where the man was who gave her the basket, and what he ran for—she said she did not know, she never saw the man before in her life—I cried, "Stop thief"—I took hold of Allen, brought her into the shop with me, and sent for an officer—she still declared she had never seen the man before, and that she had not broken her fast—it was then half-past twelve o'clock—I took the basket from her hand in the street, and placed it in the shop till the con<lb/>stable came—the constable wished me to search her—I did so, and found a half-crown, some halfpence, and the key of a door in her pocket—I then asked her how she could say she had no means to break her fast, when she had money in her pocket—she had said she had no means to break her fast—I asked her what brought her to West Ham—she told me, to look for shoe-binding, which she had inquired for at one shop, as she said—John Green was brought back about half-past one o'clock, to Mr. Val-lance's shop—he was then nearly up to his shoulders in mud, from the ditches he had been jumping in—I then asked him how he came to take the property—he appeared to be very confused, and said, "What property?"—I told him the watch and ring which he had taken from Mr. Vallance's surgery—he ihcn burst into tears, and said, "If I tell, Mr. Vallance will prosecute me"—I said, "You had better tell what you have done with</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On this Tuesday I saw both the prisoners at Plaistow, about a mile from Mr. Vallance's—the woman was between four and five yards behind the man—they were walking in the same direction—I saw them for, perhaps, two minutes, not more—I did not see them speak together—they went on—the man had a basket—this was near twelve o'clock, perhaps a quarter or twenty minutes before twelve o'clock—they were going towards West Ham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and carry on business at No. 37, Crosby-row, Walworth-road, in the parish of Newington. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, and always treated him like a brother—he has been at my house for two months at a time—on the 16th of August he had been staying at my house for some days—we went together to Brentford on the 15th, and returned home together—he slept that night in my first floor room—it was on Friday—on Saturday morning, the 16th, my breakfast was brought into my bed-room by the prisoner—he said, "Are you going to get up?"—I said, "No; I shall not get up yet"—he said nothing about leaving at all—not at any time—I did not see him again till the 9th of December, when he was in custody—I found about half-past twelve o'clock that morning that my cash-box and its contents were gone—I went to his brother-in-law after him, and gave notice, offering a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>—on Monday, the 18th, I received a paper parcel by the Woolwich carrier—this is the parcel, it is in the same condition as when I received it—when I last saw my cash-box, the lease of my house was in it, also this policy, and these letters, which are in the parcel, delivered to me by the carrier—there was an address on the parcel, as also on a second white cover, which it has—I have often seen the pri<lb/>soner write, and have a great deal of his writing—I have seen him write frequently—I believe the address on the white paper to be the prisoner's writing—it has the appearance of it—the writing on the brown paper is similar to the writing on the white—I believe that is in the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing—when we were at Brentford that day, the prisoner mentioned that he was in great difficulties, and was indebted to the landlady 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he must go and pledge, to "raise the wind."</p>

               <p>—I have seen her since—she is very ill in the country—she was vexed with me for going to spend the evening with the prisoner, and left—the left on the Sunday previous to the 16th—we had words about my going out with the prisoner—I said I would go out—she said if I did, she should be very much offended, if I went out and spent the evening with him—I did not expect she would leave—she took her things away with her—she did not tell me what she took away—my wife had no quarrel with the prisoner—she never approved of his conduct, he being a wild rackety young man, and I being a married man—he had no quarrel with my wife—I have frequently been out with him to the theatres and other places—he used to pay for himself; and we went to taverns—we supped and drank together there: he paying his share of the bill, and I mine—there was no one present when he told me he wanted money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's mother, and was living with him.

               <p>he must have gone through the shop—there is a side door, and when I went into the parlour about twelve o'clock, I found it half-open—I had left the key in the cupboard, but the door was closed—I had the key of the cash-box in my pocket—the cash-box was then gone.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the prisoner to pay you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no engagement made—he was to pay me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for his bed-room—he lodged with me ten weeks—I did not know that he pawned any things while he was there, till the prosecutor found the duplicates—I take lodgers at any time, and keep them as long as they will stay—I may take them for lets time than a week—I do not take them by the day or night—I never had one stop so short a time as three days, nor as a day and night—I will not swear that I have not had them so short as three days—my circumstances have nothing to do with the prisoner's case—my lodgers generally pay when they leave the house—I do not take in strangers—I take none, but what are recommended—they pay when they please—I never asked the prisoner for any rent at all, that I will swear, nor any of my lodgers—I have kept the house fifteen months—I have lost money by the house—the prisoner paid me a clean £5 note about one o'clock—he came home about one o'clock, packed up his things, washed and dressed, and was a long time in his room—he went away about half-past four o'clock—I do not know how far my house is from the prosecutor's—I do not know Walworth—I do not know whether there would be any difficulty in a per<lb/>son getting a £5 note changed, between ten and twelve o'clock—I was present when the duplicates were found in his portmanteau—Mr. Penrice called for me, and I came with him—I am quite sure there was no one else with him—I did not tell the magistrate it was a clean note—he asked no questions about it—I was not asked any thing about it before I came here, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not communicate that fact to the gentleman behind me, and was it not put into his brief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I do not know how the gentleman could ask me whether it was dirty or clean—I do not recollect whether I told that to Mr. Warner or not.</p>

On the evening in question, I assisted Gale in taking charge of the pri<lb/>soner, while the policeman was gone after another man—the prisoner said he had never been in the shop, and Mrs. Herbert was mistaken—the police<lb/>man then brought back another man, who had the seven biscuits, with him—the policeman asked him where he got them from—he turned and said, "From that man," pointing to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "You did not"—the prisoner at that time produced a piece of coin resembling a so<lb/>vereign, and while the policeman was questioning the other man, I saw the prisoner put it into his mouth, and swallow it—I said, "Policeman, he is swallowing something"—the policeman caught him, but it was too late—the prisoner was then searched, and a good half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—I saw this bad half-sovereign, it was placed on the edge</p>
