I keep a coffee-house ac 266, Bow Road—at 11.15 on 7th April I went to bed, leaving the place downstairs all secure—at 11.50 I heard a knocking; I came down and saw the prisoner in custody—afterwards I noticed notching on the beading of the door, and scraping on the bar that crosses it, as though some sharp instrument had raised the bar, and the door been forced open—there is a night latch and the bar on the door, but the latch was fastened back and the bar was the only fastening—if the bar was lifted up by a sharp instrument, the door could be opened—there are inner folding-doors which were not fastened—I searched the coffee-room, and missed this piece of bacon, worth 4s. 6d., from the show-table—I found the bacon thirty feet from the table—I had seen the prisoner once before, a few days previously, as a customer.</p>

               <p>same as the last—I followed that load from our place to the West India Station weighing-place with two detectives, and kept it in sight till the weighing was done—it is a narrow lane, and the van must come back again—I stood at the corner by the public-house, and some of them went in, I think, Long and young Butler went in, and the carmen went outside with the horses—when I got hold of the fourth ticket I went to the car men with the two detectives, and the van was drawn back to the weighbridge, and weighed—I did not see Long again till he was in custody—the weight was 2 tons 16 cwt. 2 qrs. net; the gross weight would be 18 cwt. more—the last load was light wrought; that was 25s.—the false weight would diminish our receipts by 30s.—there were two loads of heavy cast; the second was bottom bars which were put in—the cheating of a ton of heavy cast would be 51s. in favour of the Butlers—the second load was heavy cast; that would be £21 1s. in their favour; and the third the same—those three represent £7 13s., and adding the 30s. makes £9 3s. which we lost by the false weight—I asked Moore how he accounted for the deficiency, alluding to the last load; he said it was done by arrangement with the party who paid him for the weighing, and he thought there was something wrong, and remarked so to his mate he showed me the 4s. which Long gave him for weighing; 1s. for each load—I told Moore I was very sorry to see him placed in such a position, and asked if he did not think he had done wrong—I asked him to give me the actual weights, and he wrote this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from a slip of paper which he had in his desk—I gave him to understand that I knew all the weights, but did not show him the four tickets—the paper he wrote shows one ton on the first load, a ton on the second, a ton on the third, and 1 ton 1 cwt. on the fourth load—the clerk from the Midland Company brought the book to the Police-court—young Butler and the driver of Wiseman's van were taken to the station, but they were both discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not ask young Butler for any explanation before I gave him in custody, all the part I saw him take was to accompany the carman on his rounds; he was loading the van with the rest, and some of my men helped—I told the inspector at the station that I had no wish to detain young Butler—I swore my information at the Police-court on 2nd April, on which young Butler was arrested—I had seen Messrs. McDougall in the interval, but had no fresh information—I did not suggest that the iron should be weighed; Long suggested that, and I agreed to it, provided we sent our man Towersey as well—we have a weigh-bridge of our own for carts, but I do not think we could have got those vans on it—they were weighed by Moore on a weigh-bridge on which coal is weighed—I have not sold iron for the firm before—I have only been two months in London—I allege that Moore has put down on this ticket less than the true amount that went out—he gave me the true weight from a slip of paper, but the Midland book was shown at the Police-court—I told Moore he had acted very foolishly and wrongly, but he gave mo the impression that he did not see that; he said that he did not know who the iron came from, and did not say where it was going to—I did not ask him if he knew that it belonged to me—he did not say that he did not know who Butler was—Moore was not locked up by my directions; our solicitor charged him—a week elapsed before</p>

               <p>the prisoners were arrested—Moore said that he did not see anything wrong; it was customary to do anything which the man who paid him asked him—I said I would exonerate him for one load, but not for three—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the Midland book—Moore showed me a cash-book the second time, in which ho entered the amount he received, twopence a ton, which is paid at the weigh-bridge; he had credited the Midland Company in his cash-book with the full amount due to them—he gave them credit for the true weight—I got a cheque for £50, and they got goods from me value £30; we have got the £20 still; we have not squared accounts yet—we charge Long, and make him pay for the very goods we accuse him of stealing—we intend to charge Butler and Long £30 for the goods sent out—if this account was squared it would have been paid on the weights shown on these tickets—we have the money in hand, but no documents have passed between us since—there are no entries in our books about it.</p>

               <p>with Long to the Midland Railway bridge, and took the tare of the van—another man weighed it, not Moore—Long said, "I have given Moore a shilling, and I will see you later on"—that load was heavy cast—I returned to our wharf and got another load, and went with it to the weigh-bridge again; that was burnt bars—I saw Moore weigh it—I entered the weight 6 tons 4 cwt. 2 qrs. gross, 4 tons 13 cwt. 2 qrs. net—I then received from Long these tickets for those two loads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he asked me to give them back to him the first thing in the morning; I gave them to Mr. Gordon—Long said, "Can I come at six in the morning? and will you put some lead in then?"—I said, "No, we don't load vans till after breakfast," which is eight to half-past eight—he came next morning with a one-horse van and the same carman; I saw it loaded—he asked me for the tickets—I said, "The delivery clerk has not done with them"—the gross weight was 3 tons 11 cwt. 2 qrs., and the net 2 tons 13 cwt. 2 qrs.—I did not go on the van, I walked to the wharf, where Long showed me a thing called a devil, with a pot on the fire, and said if I would let him have the lead, he would soon get it out of sight, and he would see that I got to no further trouble about it—we use a great deal of lead—I went back with the van to the weigh-bridge, and tared it, and this ticket No. 2 was given to me by Long—I went back to McDougall's, and got another load of light wrought, which Moore weighed; the gross weight was 3 tons 14 cwt. 2 qrs., and the net 2 tons 16 cwt. 2 qrs.—Long asked me to get a load ready by nine o'clock next morning, so that he should not have to wait; he said, "I will square up with you in the morning," and gave me the fourth ticket—I gave both the tickets to Mr. Gordon—I did not follow the second van—I saw Long ten minutes afterwards, he said that he saw Mr. Gordon, and he came back and put his hand in his pocket, and said, "Take this and clear out"—I do not know what money he had in his hand, I did not take it—he left me at a kind of trot, sharp—I told Mr. Gordon everything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at a coffee-house in Chelsea—I have been a steamship steward; my last trip was on the <hi rend="italic">Arawa—on</hi> 19th November I was discharged from that, and nave not been in any similar employment since—the prisoner Peters is my wife—on 19th November I married her at a registry office—a woman named Seymour and the prisoner Millington were present—I had known Peters since about August—she was then living at 47, Milton Terrace—Millington lived in that house as a lodger—after our marriage I became the occupier of that house, and my wife lived with me, and Millington continued there as a lodger, my tenant—a servant named Scrivener was in my employment—in November I had £400 in the London and County Bank at Aldersgate—on 18th January I drew out that £400—£250 of it was in two bank notes of £200 and £50—after my marriage I found my wife and Millington were too familiar together—I spoke to her about riding in hansom cabs with him; she made no reply—from 10th to 24th January I lived with Bertha Seymour at the Portland Hotel—my wife told me to go; she told me to clear out, and said I had been nothing but a worry to her since we were married—I sent my wife £3 by a cabman on the day I left her, but I had no idea then of leaving her; I was going back that night—I was responsible for the rent of our house—on 24th January I met my wife at the Aldersgate Bank; she asked me to come back with her, and I did so that day—I asked her on the Sunday to go and get some luggage from the Portland Hotel, where I had been living—she did so, and brought it back to me—she knew that I had the cash I drew out on the 18th—on the 27th January she asked me to let her take care of it, because I was going out that night—she only had possession of it that night—she gave it back to me on the 28th—I did not give it back to her again at all after that—I used to carry it about in my breast pocket in a leather wallet from 28th January to the morning of 5th February—I remained as occupier of 47, Milton Terrace up to 1st February—then when I came back from town she told me she had got no apartments, and that she should go to some friends named Anglis, and I could go to an hotel—I went to the Grosvenor Hotel till Monday, the 3rd—on Sunday, 2nd February, she called on me twice at the hotel—on Monday, 3rd February, I and she went into fresh lodgings at 2, Gunter's Grove, occupying a bedroom on the top floor and a sitting-room on the ground floor—I there kept the wallet with my bank notes in a collar-box that was in a clothes box, in our bedroom—I had one key to the box and my wife the other—she knew at Gunter's Grove that I had the money there—my clothes and hers were in the box, linen—on 4th February Millington came to Gunter's Grove about half-past eight, with Anglis and his wife after I left Milton Terrace I believed Millington lived with Anglis—on 4th February he stopped with us from half-past eight till half-past eleven or quarter to twelve in the evening—my wile was there—all Jour of us left to have a drink—I and my wife returned to our house and slept together—next morning, 5th February, I told my wife I was going out to make negotiations for a public-house business—I had received cards</p>

               <p>from Charles W.

On 27tn January when I dined with them we were all sober, except the prosecutor; after dinner he went with me for a drive; Mrs. Peters and Millington went out before us—it was on Sunday—I could not say that the next day at the Kensington Barracks he was intoxicated—two days after, on the Tuesday, I went to Milton Terrace and asked Mrs. Peters if she would return Annie Seymour's clothes—after some conversation Mrs. Peters said to her husband or in his presence, "There is the man; if he wants the woman let him go for them himself"—I said at the Police-court, "If not in drink he never appeared to be sober; he was not in possession of his senses"—I have not seen him and Seymour tipsy together, nor drinking together—I am a friend of Seymour's—I don't think I ever saw him in her company.</p>

At three o'clock on 5th March Mrs. Peters surrendered to me at Mr. Dutton's office—there was a warrant for her arrest—I took her into custody without the warrant, as it is a case of felony—I told her the charge was for stealing on 5th February £250, the property of her husband, from 2, Gunter's Grove—she said, "I did not steal the money, he gave it to me."</p>

About eleven o'clock on 12th March I arrested Millington in a public-house near Rochester Row Policestation—I had previously that morning seen him outside the Court—I told him he would be charged on a warrant with conspiring with Louisa. Peters and stealing £250 in notes, the property of her husband—he said, "All right, don't hold me; I will go quietly"—I took him to Rochester Row—the warrant was read to him; he made no reply—I searched and found on him this document: "Louisa Peters,—I entrust to Mr. R. J. Pettitt the sum of £50 as surety for his being bail for me, the same £50 to be returned to me on my appearing to the recognisances at Westminster Police-court, March 12th, 1890."—I found no money on him.</p>

Mrs. Anglis—Millington was not living anywhere particularly then—I saw him on 1st, not on the 2nd—when my husband was ill he had sleeping powders left with him—I told Seymour to give them to him—I went out on that day with Millington—I left my husband because Seymour was continually insulting me, and I thought I should get into trouble over it—I left in consequence of her conduct—I took no notice of what my husband said about a business—he said on the morning I left he was going to look for a business—I told the young lady I should be back at five or six that day; I did not feel inclined to tell her my business—from the morning of 26th January to the 5th February the money was in my possession, and never left my possession—there was a wooden box in our bedroom at Gunter's Grove; I never saw a collar box inside it—I did not have a key to the box; there was nothing of mine in it; my things were going to be sent on—I was at Brighton till the 12th, living with. Millington in the name of Coleman; then we came back to London—I spent what I thought belonged to me, and Millington lived with me—I did not have any place to live at after we came back to London—after I was charged I went to Anglis's and lived there with Millington; my hand was in a sling, and with my permission Anglis took the three £20 notes from my pocket; that was part of the change from the £200 note—my name was Williams; I have gone by the name of Coleman.</p>

I am employed at the post-office, High Street, Whitechapel—on April 1st Lyons came in and produced an identity paper and an Army order, I cannot say for how much, because I did not look at it—I looked at the height, 6 ft., on the identity paper, and asked him if ho was a pensioner—he said, "No"—I said that I could not pay anybody but the pensioner—he said the pensioner had gone to sea, and went out—that was between eleven and twelve o'clock—he took the order and the identity paper with him, and came back in five minutes with Brown—I said, "I thought you told me the pensioner had gone to sea—he said, "It is a fresh pensioner, I have about half a dozen, and they all owe me money"—I said to Brown, "Are you Mr. Bonny, the pensioner?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him to sign the money order, but he signed the wrong paper; I told him so—he said, "All right," and signed the money order—I scratched out his signature on the identity paper—I asked Brown how long he had been in the service—he said, "Eight years"—I looked at the identity paper, and it was seven years and some months—I asked him again if he was Mr. Bonny—he said, "Yes"—when he had signed it he gave me the order, and I was going to pay him, but he told mo to pay Mr. Lyons; I said that I could not do that, I must pay the pensioner himself; Lyons called Brown back, and I paid him the £4 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they both left—Bonny came in in the afternoon, and brought the identity paper, and asked if I had paid the order; I gave him some information—he called first between two and three o'clock, I think.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Messrs.

I am agent to Mr. Green, the owner of, 70, Finsbury Pavement—in May, 1889, Huntley called on me about taking premises there at £45 a year—they were £50, but we accepted him at £45—I asked for references, and he gave four; two were Bent in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated from</hi> 38<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, <hi rend="italic">King William Street, May,</hi> 1889. <hi rend="italic">It said he would give</hi> £45 <hi rend="italic">a year rent, and gave as references, A.

Park and Co. by Mr. Huntley, and that I wanted to know something about them; he said he was respectable, and had sufficient means to pay the rent; but Huntley was not accepted on these two references—we wanted them to pay in advance; they could not, and then the matter fell through for a time, and then they sent further references: one in Southampton Buildings and the other in Newington Butts; we wrote, the replies seemed satisfactory, and then Mr. Green agreed to let to Huntley—I saw this agreement afterwards, signed "Herbert Huntley" by the prisoner Huntley, in the presence of William Johnson—I have seen Johnson about the offices at 70, Finsbury Pavement—at the top of the door was put up, "The United Kingdom Mercantile Society, Huntley, Secretary," and "Johnson and Son," and "Biggenden; "I could not say whether there was any description to him—the first half-quarter's rent was paid—the next half-quarter was not paid, and we distrained; we got that, and we had to distrain again for the third half-quarter—in January, 1890, in consequence of difficulty in getting rent we agreed to forego the rent if he gave up possession—after Huntley had been there some time the name of "Fenton, Commissioner for Oaths," was added.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now a prisoner at Wormwood Scrubs, under sentence for obtaining goods by false pretences—I know Robinson; I came to London with, him in May, 1888—he told me he was going to stay with his brother at Notting Hill—in June, 1889,1 was acting as traveller for the Midland Brush Company; also for Mr. Cohen,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189004210055"/>
               <p>a leather merchant, and for Mr. Hawkins, a saddler, and for Messrs. Lebert and Prince, sauce manufacturers, of Tottenham Court Road—about the first week in June I called and saw Robinson at 139, Lillie Road; his brother told me he had opened a shop there; about a fortnight later he gave me an order for £12 4s. 6d. for the Midland Brush Company—I took the particulars in a book at the time, and afterwards wrote it out—the terms were at one month—at the same time he gave me an order for Lebert and Prince for 18s. worth of sauces—Robinson gave me a bill two days after the goods were delivered; that was returned—he then wrote to me, and I went to 70, Finsbury Pavement, Mr. Huntley's office; he was introduced to me as Bobinson's solicitor—I told Robinson in Huntley's presence that the firm's bankers had refused to take the bill—a fortnight afterwards I got a second bill from him; Mr. Bowe, one of the partners, gave me permission to get it in my own name, and if I could get the cash I was to send it on—I drew the bill in my own name, and Robinson accepted it, payable at his bankers—I paid it in to my own bank, and they sent it back to me (I had a banking account of my own)—they would not discount it—I tried two other places, and then gave it to Mr. De Pass—at the time Robinson gave me the second bill he gave me an order for sponges and wash-leathers, which I sent on to Mr. Cohen, to the amount of £12, and he also gave me an order for a set of harness, which I sent on to Mr. Hawkins—he sent a cheque for that set, and ordered two sets more at £12 for himself; he said he had another place at Battersea, and he was going to have an extra pony—they were to be sent on 7th February—he told me that Mr. Huntley kept the pony at his private house—I sent that order on to Mr. Hawkins, and an order for another party, who was introduced to me of the name of Johnson, on the same occasion, in the same place, on the second floor—that order was not executed, I found out that they had no ponies, so I countermanded the order—there were about ten or twelve of these men at Finsbury Pavement, and as I sat there reading a paper I overheard several things, which opened my eyes; Mr. White was one, and a Mr. Sutton, Huntley, and Robinson, and several others—I heard that Huntley had not a pony, nor Johnson, and that if they had the harness they would have sold it to a marine store dealer in Bethnal Green Road; the marine store dealer was there, and another in Bethnal Green Road—I countermanded the order after hearing that—they were talking to themselves in the bar, and I overheard them; I was not taking any part in the conversation—I told Mr. Hawkins not to send the harness unless he got the money, and he wrote at length to Huntley, and then they said they had not ordered it—when Robinson gave me the order he said he had been very fortunate to get in with some Mark Lane people, and he had opened an account there, and Huntley had given the reference—he afterwards said that my bank was a very bad one, and he pressed me to join his, and Huntley would be a reference for me, but I did not do it—Huntley was present at the time that was said—after that, when I went to Robinson's shop, I asked him where the brushes were that had been supplied—he said he had sold them to an oil and colour man at Westminster somewhere; and some time after he told me he had sold the sponges to the same man—I received no payment for Mr. Cohen's</p>

               <p>goods, only a bill of exchange; that was for the three accounts of Cohen, Lobert, and De Pass; I sent that bill on to Mr. Cohen, and he gave me the change, deducting the amount of his own bill; I put the change in my bank; afterwards I gave it back to Mr. Cohen—Robinson told me afterwards that he opened his account at the bank with £30 which he had received from advertising for an assistant, who Mr. Huntley had got him, with the £30 cash as security.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Spital Square, Bishopsgate-in August, 1889, I was in business in Duke Street, Aldgate, as a sponge and leather merchant—the last witness was a traveller for me—on 3rd August he brought me an order, in consequence of which I sent some sponges, worth £3, to Robinson—on 20th August I got a further order for leathers, value £8 15s. 6d., from Cousins—I sent those goods to Robinson—on 26th August Cousins brought mo this bill—I discounted it, deducted my own amount, and paid the balance to Cousins—before the bill fell due, Cousins was arrested; he did not return the balance to me—afterwards I went to Robinson's shop, in the Lillie Road, because one day, being with Detective Couchman, we called at the shop, 99, Whitechapel Road, where we saw some of my leathers in the shop window—I asked Robinson what he was going to do about paying me—he said I had an acceptance of his—I asked what he had done with the goods—he said he did not think that had anything to do with me, as the goods were his, and what he had done with them had nothing to do with me—I told him what I had seen, and he said he could do what ho liked with his own</p>

On 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> October last we had a traveller in our employment named Clifford. On 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October, in consequence of an order given by him, we sent a case of eggs to the prisoner, Robinson, at 139, Lillie Road; the value was £4 16s. 1d., the account I sent him is produced, and" marked 'No. 50.' A few days after Robinson called on us for another case of eggs; I told him he could not have them until he paid for the last lot; he said he would send me a cheque next day. I said he would have the goods next day when he sent the cheque next morning, or within a day or two, A man came bringing the cheque produced marked 'No. 51; I thereupon handed him a second case of eggs, value £4 13s. I paid the cheque in our bank; it was returned unpaid. I then wrote three letters to Robinson, but received no reply. I was then introduced by Clifford to the prisoner Huntley at my own office. Huntley came himself, and introduced himself as a debt collector. I instructed him to take a criminal prosecution against Robinson. Huntley had given me to understand he had a solicitor working for him; I also instructed him to collect two other accounts against persons named Cutting and White. He told me he knew Robinson; subsequently he told me, after I called on him two or three times, that he did not take a criminal prosecution against Robinson, but would take out a summons for debt against him; this conversation was at an office in Finsbury Pavement. I called several times to see him; the action was getting on, he told me; he was proceeding with it. I got no money or satisfaction from either of the actions. After a time I took all the actions out of his hands; I paid their charges, and got the receipt produced, marked '52'. I afterwards placed Robinson's matter in the hands of my solicitors; they got judgment against him, but I recovered nothing.</p>

I am a confectioner, of 123, Houndsditch—in the beginning of November last, in answer to an advertisement of mine for a commission agent, Robinson called on me—he wished to sell my goods on commission—I asked who he was, and to give me references—he said he had a little shop of his own in Lillie Road (I believe that it was</p>

               <p>managed by his wife and children), and he had plenty of time to himself, and could devote it to getting orders for me—he said he was going to market, and buying other things for cash—he gave me Clarke as one reference, and I believe Huntley as another—I wrote to Clarke, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated November</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th, from</hi> 47, <hi rend="italic">Bassein Road, and stated that he had known Robinson for some years, and recommended him to the agency</hi>)—I was satisfied with that, and did not write to Huntley—on the faith of this I appointed him to get orders for me—he brought a few orders, which, on inquiry, I did not execute—on 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> November he came for some goods; he said he would try <hi rend="italic">to</hi> sell them in his shop—he had one lot of six boxes, for which he paid about ten shillings there and then—after a time he came for more, and I let him have two lots, worth thirty shillings, and I gave him one month's credit—at the end of the month I wrote for the money, but got no reply.</p>

I am salesman to John Rucker, provision merchant, 16, Water Lane, City—in January last I was introduced to Robinson at a public-house near Mark Lane, by a person who stated in his presence that he was a respectable, hard-working man, representing one or two houses on commission, and that his wife kept a provision shop at Fulham—a little time after that the same person brought me an order from Robinson for margarine, which I suppied to Robinson to the value of £12—this is the invoice, dated 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> January, stating the terms, fourteen days—before the fourteen days had expired Robinson called, in a general way of business; I don't think he had any special matter on hand—at a subsequent interview he suggested that he should represent me; he thought he could get orders, and I was willing to allow him a commission on good orders; he said he had some customers of his own that he would like to keep to himself, and he thought he could get sufficient security to satisfy me as to getting the money—he gave me as a reference, Mr. Fenton, solicitor, 26, City Road, who, he said, had a case of his wife's in hand; that she participated in a jointure or an estate, by which she was to get some money; about £400—he also referred to Mr. Clarke, 47, Bassein Park Road, who, he said, was an architect, living in his own house, which he had built for himself, and who had already been security for him for £50 or more, and he thought he would have no objection to be security for him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me—I wrote to Clarke on the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, and received this reply dated 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)<hi rend="italic">:</hi> "Although I have known Mr. Robinson some years, as a good business man, I cannot enter into any guarantee for him until I have talked the matter over with him"—Robinson arranged with me to meet him at Fenton's office on the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> February—I found Fenton's name on the street-door; I made inquiry, and went to an office on the first floor, with the name of Walsh, I think, not Fenton; but I saw Fenton there and a clerk—while I was there Huntley came in—I told Fenton that I had come to speak about Robinson's affair; Huntley immediately took me on one side, and said, "I have that matter; it rests with me; Mr. Fenton is so very deaf, he can't hear a word that is said"—he was very indignant with Robinson for not keeping his appointment—I was about to leave when Robinson came up—Huntley said that Robinson had some business with them, in which his wife was interested in about £400, and he could have an advance on that estate if he chose, but he would have to pay heavily for it; that he had had a previous advance of about £20 to relieve him, from a judgment order, the note of which he showed me, and he could have a similar advance now—on the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> he told me that Robinson himself had also an interest to a similar amount, of £400—Robinson was not present then-after the interview on the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, when I got back I wrote this to Fenton.

M Robinson—on the faith of that I supplied him with goods to the value of £14 4s. 5d. to start with—the first bill would have been due in about a fortnight; I did not present it; he was in custody before it became due.</p>

Barrett, of Tanmead Road—he said, "I never went to Tanmead Road; I never saw the margarine; I know nothing about it"—I then went to 47, Bassein Park Road; I searched the house, and found a number of papers, including a bundle of County Court papers, summonses, judgments, and committal warrants from various County Courts, for small sums, 6s. 9d., 9s. 7d., 7s. 6d., 13s. 2d., and a notice from the Hammersmith County Court for commitment in default of payment of rates; I also found this bundle of letters, from Robinson to Clarke (<hi rend="italic">These were put in and read</hi>)—I also found a bundle' of letters addressed to Clarke from different firms, inquiring as to the respectability of various persons—on 3rd March I saw Robinson at the Police-station, in custody—I read the warrant to him; he made no reply—I afterwards went to his premises 139, Lillie Road—I found very little stock there, about a pound of tea in several canisters, a small quantity of coffee in canisters, a considerable quantity of French coffee in tins, 3 lb. of sugar, several cheese boxes and butter tubs, empty, and a small quantity of butterine or margarine—the shop was fitted up as a provision shop, but all the tins were empty except those I have mentioned—the principal stock consisted of earthenware, and a number of sauces and pickles—I also found there this banker's pass-book and cheque-book, also ten full parcels of butterine, and an empty bottle; and in Clarke's house I found another bottle of pickles, the greater part of which "had</p>

Brims was there, Conner, a boy named Hall, and Milton—after the prisoner had said this Howe turned round, and the umbrella went in his face—Lamb had the umbrella in his hand, walking with it in the ordinary way, with the bottom end on the ground—as soon as Howe turned round Lamb up with the umbrella like that (<hi rend="italic">describing the action</hi>)—he used both hands—Howe never spoke; he went right back—as he laid on the ground I thought the umbrella had gone in his mouth—I saw it go in his face, I did not see where it went—Howe was lifted on to the knee of Rushbrook; they call him <hi rend="italic">Knacker</hi>—I saw blood come from his mouth—Lamb walked about two yards away, then turned back, with the umbrella in his hand, and said, "Instead of the end I did give you, I ought to give you this end; such dogs as you ought to be dead"—he then walked away about twenty yards, and stopped there till the constable came and took him in charge—Blackman was not there when Lamb came and touched Howe on the shoulder; he came up when it was all over, and the man was put on the van—this is the umbrella Lamb used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blow was a deliberate charge, like with a bayonet—Howe was a shade taller than Lamb—I had seen Howe about two o'clock in the day; he was the worse for drink then—I did not see him fighting with Wilkins, I went down there when it was all over—I did not see him fall down or taken into Fisher's coffee-shop—I say that Lamb up with the umbrella and jobbed it into Howe's face—I have said, "Howe was not trying to hit Lamb when Lamb did this, he had not time to; Lamb did it as soon as he touched him on the shoulder"—Howe had his coat on, he had his handkerchief round his waist—I did not hear him say that he would fight <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> Lamb—Dalton and Brims were not holding him—from first to last he never approached to make a blow at Lamb, he did not raise his fist or in any way threaten him—<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> Butler is my father, he is in, the market—I first gave an account of this matter the day after the inquest—I went there, but they would not allow me in—we all went to the Treasury; before going there I had been to the King's Head, and I gave a statement there to Mr. Thompson, the solicitor's clerk, and he took it down in writing—Conner was there, and Hall, and Milton, and Biggs—I did not see Carter there, We talked it all over there in the presence of Mr. Thompson's clerk—that was the first time I had heard any statement by others, or made one myself—it was very nigh a fortnight after that I went to the Treasury; Thompson's clerk was there, I said the same there as I had said at the King's Head—on this Saturday it was rather rainy, and the pavement was slippery—I did not hear Lamb say, "I will see you</p>

Come and see me to-morrow, I win give you more"—he stopped in the market till he was arrested.</p>

I was carman to Mr. Osborn, of the Borough Market—on the afternoon of 15th February I was in Dunnington'a coffee-shop about five—I saw Howe there, and after he left I saw the prisoner go and push open the door of the Harrow and look in—he then turned round and saw Howe by Butler's stand—he went across to him, touched him on the shoulder, and said, "Come and see me to-morrow, when you are sober"—Howe turned round, and Lamb prodded the umbrella into his face; he fell backwards—Lamb walked away about four yards, then returned and said, "Instead of giving you the end I have given you, I ought to have given you the other end.</p>

                  </persName>. I live at 41, Church Street when I am in London—I am an able seaman in the merchant service, and am a member of the "Sailors' and Firemen's Union—at half-past nine p.m. on 13th December last year I met the prisoner and Pleasance at London Bridge Tavern—I knew Pleasance before, but not the prisoner—we referred to the gas strike, and then I referred to "Wilson—Hornsley said he was a b-y fraud—I said I would not-believe it till it was proved, and Hornsley said he could prove it, and he then produced a pamphlet, the same as this. (<hi rend="italic">The pamphlet was read: it accused Wilson of perjury, lying, and incompetent, dishonourable, and felonious conduct</hi>)—after he had read passages from that libel I asked him for a copy of it—he said I would get one soon enough; there were 12,000 of them in print, and I would get one after the gas strike was over—I afterwards spoke of it on board ship, and they advised me to go and see Wilson—I went a voyage, and when I came back I was told Wilson wanted to see me—I saw him, and afterwards went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not in Wilson's employment—he pays my expenses in coming to London—I have not been serving the Seafaring Union, and received wages from them, only on this case—I have not been employed by Wilson, and paid money to make inquiries—I did hot know the prisoner had been president of the Tower Hill branch—I went to sea the day after I saw this pamphlet, and I went from London to Sunderland—that is where the head office of the Seafaring Union is—I saw Mr. Wilson—I knew nothing of Abbott, the man who wrote the pamphlet, at that time—I saw in <hi rend="italic">Seafaring,</hi> the organ of this society, that Abbott was being prosecuted for writing this—I know nothing about the dispute between the Tower Hill branch and the head office—I knew Pleasance was the secretary—I had been his shipmate—I heard he had been expelled from the secretaryship of the Tower Hill branch—I do not know there are 2,000 members of that branch, or that there are eighty or ninety branches—there are fifty-four or fifty-five branches, regulated by the executive council in Sunderland, I have heard—I have heard there are more than 90,000 members—I have to pay 5d. a week subscription—I don't know that the Tower Hill branch demanded a statement of accounts from the executive—I don't remember telling Pleasance I was a spy in Wilson's employment—I won't undertake to say I did not say it, but I am not a spy—I asked him to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me a copy of the pamphlet after he had read it, not before he read it—I did not know it was in existence till he read it—we talked about the gas strikes—I took no notice of the conversation till the prisoner said Wilson was a b——y fraud,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189004210086"/>
               <p>and then I said I did not believe it—he said nothing about Abbott—he said, "If you don't believe it, here it is in print," and he pulled out the pamphlet—I had not read the pamphlet in <hi rend="italic">Seafaring;</hi> I never heard of it till he read it to me—I believe the greater part of it has been published in <hi rend="italic">Seafaring</hi> since we were at the Police-court—I believe that was after Abbott was tried—it was headed "Abbott's Friends in Trouble," it was somewhere about March, I think, I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was said there were about 2,000 members of the Tower Hill branch—I don't know if thirty-five left when Pleasance was expelled—after Hornsley said this to me I went a voyage to Sunderland, came to London, and went to Bilbao; I was away seven weeks—I arrived home on 31st January, and went before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 174, High Street, Sunderland, and am general secretary of the National Amalgamated Sailors' and Firemen's Union—I have seen copies of this pamphlet—I am the J. H. Wilson referred to—I was present at Durham Assizes when Arthur Abbott was prosecuted for publishing this as a libel before Mr. Justice Day; no plea of justification was filed; I was the prosecutor—he was defended by Mr. Milvain, Q. C., convicted, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labour—he signed his name to the pamphlet—I think ho had assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I prosecuted Abbott for the libel, and four other men for publishing it—the prosecutions against the four fell to the ground, as the witnesses were not present; that was not my doing; the Bill was before the Grand Jury at Durham—I should say there are about 80,000 members of this society subscribing five pence a week—I am founder of the union and secretary; there are twenty men on the executive committee—the secretary of the Tower Hill branch, Mr. Pleasance, Hornsley, and fifty-six members have been expelled within the last six months—I don't Know if Hornsley was president—you have not shown me the minute saying he was elected; when the prisoner was expelled he was an honorary member—our half-yearly report was published at the end of June last year, showing the total amount received at the head office from each branch, how much was spent, and how much was in hand; the report was submitted to the annual conference in Cardiff, at which ninety delegates from all parts of England were present—I have never forwarded to the Registrar of Friendly Societies any report or statement of accounts, and I don't intend to till the report comes out next June; then it will be due—the union was formed in 1887; the secretary's salary is £250 a year; the solicitor receives a halfpenny a week from all the members, for which he has to provide legal assistance for all members throughout the country—when the rules were amended that rule was rescinded at the request of the union—the registrar had registered it—I have submitted to the executive council every quarter a financial statement, and they have approved; and the resolutions passed by the executive council have been sent to every branch of the union—the financial statement has not been sent to every branch, by direction of the executive council—an annual report is now being prepared for circulation—it was not a subject of complaint by many branches—we did not suspend or expel those who complained—Pleasance and the prisoner were not expelled for that reason; they never asked for one—I never had a word of complaint about the balance-sheet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189004210087"/>
               <p>or statements—I have prosecuted the secretary of the Tower Hill branch for detaining books of the society—the branch has not met and refused to expel him—fifty-six members of the branch have been expelled—we cannot recover the books; there is an appeal pending about them, I believe—before I started the union I was a hotel proprietor for over five years; I gave it up when I went to the union—that is the reference to the cook-shop—the fifty-six men we expelled we were convinced were not working for the union's interest, but for persons employing them at a price to try and break up the onion—I dispute that there was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> dispute between the Tower Hill branch and the union—I wrote telling Pleasance he was expelled—when Martin reported what the prisoner and Pleasance had stated in this public-house, that Wilson was a fraud, and so on, the matter was brought under the attention of the executive council, and they stated that if Pleasance had any complaint against the general secretary, it was his duty to send his complaint to the general council, my masters—we had a meeting, and expelled Pleasance without asking him for his explanation; it was according to the rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This book is kept under my control—I see it constantly—by this minute I see that the executive heard the charge against Pleasance and others; and a resolution was passed, giving me notice to give Pleasance a month's wages in lieu of notice, and he was to give up the books and property of the union—I sent that communication to him, and he replied that he would not give of the books and property; and I heard they complained that we had given them no opportunity of being heard, and then I called the executive together to give him a chance of being heard, and gave him notice of the meeting, but he did not appear, and he was then expelled.</p>

On March 30th, about 7.30 p.m., I was with Sergeants Comber, Cox, and Brogan at the corner of York Road and Sutton Street, and from the knowledge we had of the prisoners we watched them, and followed them to the Lion tap; they came out, and we followed them, stopped them, and said we were police officers, and suspected they were in possession of counterfeit com—they both attempted to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> away—I seized Abel; Sergeant Brogan held him, and I searched him, and found in his right trousers pocket these five counterfeit florins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with paper between the bottom and second one, but not' between the other three, and in his left trousers pocket sixpence in silver—I asked him to account for the five bad ones; he made no reply—I saw nothing thrown, but I saw Cox pick up a florin.</p>

               <p>in West Square, Kennington Road, with Comber—I saw the prisoner enter the city Arms—I looked through the crevices in the door, and saw him talking with Ade, Beeves, and Davies in the bar; they were all in a group—they remained ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then came out and went up Brook Street—we secreted ourselves in a doorway, and when they got within fifty yards of us we came out to meet them—immediately on seeing us they crossed the road, and went to the corner of Kennington Road and Brook Street, and into the bar of the Tankard public-house—I and Comber followed, and said, "We are police officers, and we suspect you are in possession of counterfeit coin; stand still, we shall have to search you"—Coker made a rush to the street door—I had an umbrella; I told him if he did not go back I would knock him down—we called on the landlord to assist us—he came over the bar, and dropped the bolts of both doors—I asked him in the prisoners' presence to lend for assistance to the station—we got assistance, and arrested all four prisoners after about three or four minutes—I found in Reeves's left trousers pocket a counterfeit half-crown loose—I asked him what account he could give of it; he made no reply—I searched Coker, and found a florin, eight shillings, two sixpences, and 1 1/2 d. all good in his left trousers pocket——at the station I searched Beeves, and in his coat-pocket found two packages, one of which contained this base half-crown in this paper, and the other contained eight base half-crowns separately wrapped in paper—I received nine counterfeit half-crowns separately wrapped in two slips of paper from the female searcher, and also a purse containing sixpence and threepence in silver and 2 1/2 d.—I received those in Davies' presence; she said nothing then, but she made a statement at the Police-court—I had known Coker before 20th March—I had seen Davies for about a month before—I have seen them together in the street, and go into 8, Great Charlotte Street, Blackfriars Road together—I have known Coker as an omnibus conductor in the London General Omnibus Company—I saw him following that occupation almost daily last year, and the early part of this—I hire seen Ade on the knifeboard of the omnibus with him for some months—I have seen them enter dining-rooms, together on several occasions during the same period.</p>

On 16th March, at 12.45, I saw Cain moving from the side window of Mrs. Hutchinson's coffee house—I turned my light on him and On the shutters, which were closed, and apparently all right—he went into 1, Marshall's Place, where there is no outlet—Nolan and his parents live there; that is ten; or twelve yards from the side door—I heard the fastenings either bolted or locked—I went a short distance down, and returned and examined the shutters; they were not fastened; I opened them and found the window open, it had been forced, the catch was standing upright—I rang the bell, Mrs. Hutchinson admitted me, and' I found Nolan in the bar, lying on the floor apparently asleep—I shook him-and asked him what he was doing there; he did not reply—I sent Mrs. Hutchinson for assistance, and she returned with Blexam, who I left with Nolan, and went to Marshall's Place and saw Wood come from No. 1—I told him I should take him in custody for being concerned with a man inside for breaking into the house—he said, "I don't know anything about it, I have just come out of 1, Marshall's Place"—I said, "Do you live there?"—he said, "With Mrs. Welsh"—I went there and saw a female, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you know this man?"—she said, "Yes, he has just been here"—Mrs., Welsh was not to be found there—I said, "Is he your husband?"—she said, "No; the one with no boots on is my husband"—Nolan had no boots on—Mrs. Hutchinson said she had missed some dolmans, and I found these two dolmans at 1, Marshall's Place, on a bed in the front room ground floor, and a quantity of sugar—the prisoner Nolan occupies that room—as I left the house, Cain came up—I recognised him as the man I had first seen, and told him I should take him in custody—he said, "I don't know anything about it; I have only just come up"—at the station he said, "I was just asking what was the matter when he" (pointing to me) "took me by the neck—Nolan said "How about those two who told me there was a lot of money there? Not these two"—Wood said nothing—Cain lives in Arnold's Place, seven or eight minutes' walk from the coffee-shop.</p>
