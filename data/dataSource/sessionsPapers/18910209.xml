On 20th January I was at the corner of High Road, Knightsbridge; Bradstock called my attention to an omnibus; I got on top of it; Groves was about to come down—somebody said, "A lady has lost her purse; do you know either of these two men?"—I said to Groves, "You here! where is this purse?" he said, "I know nothing about it; and this man is a perfect stranger to me," pointing to Beaumont, who was sitting immediately behind the prosecutrix; told Beaumont to get up; he did so; I looked under his seat, but could not see the purse—I said to Groves, "You come down"—he went down the steps with me, walked a few yards down the pavement, and said he knew nothing about the purse—a large crowd collected; he walked into the crowd with me, and the omnibus proceeded about twenty yards up the High Road; I saw it stopped, and saw Beaumont in custody—I directed Bradstock to take Groves, and as he walked out of the crowd the timekeeper Coney handed me this purse containing a sovereign, two shillings, three sixpences, 5 3/4 d., and three keys, which the prosecutrix identified—on the omnibus Beaumont said he was going to get down at Sloane Street or Sloane Square, but at the station the inspector asked him where he was going, and he said, "I was going to Charley Mitchell's boxing entertainment"—he did not say where, but the Washington was mentioned, and he said, "That is the place"—I have never seen the prisoners together before.</p>

In August, 1889, I was lodging at 30, Redan Street—I know Clark—in August I wrote this name, James Thompson, on this withdrawal application—the prisoner asked me to do so, she said the money was her little boy's; his name is not Thompson—I also wrote the words James Thompson on another piece of blue paper like this—I knew I was signing a form—I gave it to the prisoner—she told me afterwards what she did with it, I cannot say when—she said she was going with those two forms to take the money out for her little boy.</p>

On 19th January I saw the prisoner at 30, Redan Street; I told, her I was a police officer, and should take her into custody for forging and uttering two Savings Bank warrants in August, 1889, for £5 each—she said, "I never forged them. I own I had the money. A woman named Happy Turner, who used to lodge with me, said she could forge anybody's name, and she forged them. "</p>

I am single, and live at 14, Henley Terrace, South<lb/>wark Street—I lived with the prisoner four years, and have had three children by him, one is living—I ceased to live with him a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas—on January 5th I saw him at three p.m., he followed me from Upper Ground Street, over Blackfriars Bridge, to the Ludgate Circus post-office—I then went away to sell my papers in Queen Victoria Street—he followed me there under the railway arch, and I spoke to a constable—I saw no more of him till 5.30, when I went for some papers to Stonecutter Street, Farringdon Street, and saw him by the post-office—he ran at me, and Fanny Doyle got between us, he hit her on her mouth and behind her ear, with his fist, and immediately afterwards dropped a white-handled knife apparently from his sleeve he picked it up, and I said, "Mind, Fanny, he has got a knife"—he went across the circus to the Albion public-house, and we walked after him to speak to a constable for him carrying a knife; he made a run at her again, but she slipped away, and he caught me by the fringe in front of my hair, and held my head between his legs, and stabbed me behind my ear—Doyle said, "Take him away, he has got a knife"—he got hold of my hair and shoved me, and I nearly fell back—I bled very much—he ran away, and I went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and had the wound attended to—I then went back and sent a young woman into a coffee-shop which the prisoner uses, to see if he was there—he was</p>

               <p>there, and I charged him, and went with him to the station—when the constable took him he said, "Look what she has done for me"—he said that he had a mark under his eye, but I could not see it—he told the constable I struck him, but I do not remember doing so—my wound has healed, the doctor took the strapping off on Saturday morning—I had to stay at home for three weeks while it was healing—when I left him he said, "I will do for you before long"—I left him because he would not support the child, and lie was always knocking me about—he had not been drinking that I know of—there was a policeman on duty at Ludgate Circus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the 5th battalion of the King's Royal Rifles, stationed at Huntingdon—in February, 1888, I was serving as sergeant in the 4th battalion when they marched from Peshawar to Umballah—I remember Bacon, the prisoner, and Downs being at Umballah, and all three in the camp together—Bacon was the provost-corporal of the battalion, that is a military policeman; his duty was to patrol the camp at night—I remember the night of the murder of Downs; he was off duty that night, and had leave to go into the city if he wished—I saw him in the afternoon; he was then dressed in a suit of charkee, which used to be worn then in the morning or afternoon for drill purposes; at night you could wear what you pleased, you would then wear black clothing—Downs was just the same height and build as Bacon—you would take them for twin brothers, the only difference was that one had ginger hair, Downs had the lighter hair—having leave to go into the city, he would go at any hour he liked after afternoon parade at five—he would have to be back by ten—in going to and from the camp to the city he would go by the main road, past the military gymnasium—the latrines were attached to the camp, about twenty yards from the tent the prisoner slept in—I do not remember seeing the prisoner on that afternoon—the night was a dark night—I was in camp about a quarter to ten that night—I heard something, in consequence of which I went to Downs' tent in the F company's lines about 200 yards from the gymnasium—I there saw Downs lying on the ground, half in and half out of the tent, his throat being cut—I saw a scar on one side of his head, but at present I cannot say whether it was the right side</p>

               <p>or the left, as if he had been hit with a stick—his body was taken to the hospital, about 600 yards from the camp—he died either whilst being taken there or on his admission—he had on what we call a Guthrie jacket, a jacket that was served out to be worn at that time, that was a black coat with red facings—I can<lb/>not remember what trousers he had on—the privates were provided with four suits of clothes, two of charkee and two of black, and four suits of white; eight suits altogether, that would be the regulation allowance, they would be numbered with the number of the regiment—razors are supplied, also marked—the clothes are marked with paint, and the razors with a hot iron—it was a common thing for the men to have clothes in excess of the regulation allowance—there was a <hi rend="italic">kit</hi> inspection every week, at which every man, in order to pass muster, had to show everything he had, I mean his clothing and everything served out to him from the stores; if he had more than the regulation allowance nothing would be said; he might have more; if he had not enough he would get fresh clothing out of the stores—if he had more he would not have to show them—he could buy at a bazaar—those things would not be numbered—he could also buy from one of his companions—if he lost his razor he could get another out of the stores, that would be numbered—he could buy a razor in the town, that would not pass at the inspection, he would not produce it, if he did no doubt he would get into serious trouble; the inspections were very minute, they took place every Saturday—there was one on the Saturday before Downs' death.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I do confess that on a night early in March, 1888, at Camp, Umballah, East Indies, I did wound, by cutting his throat with a razor, one Private Downs, of the F company 4th Battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, after 9.45 p.m. on that night. I can't give the exact date. I obtained per<lb/>mission to go to the latrine. I went out and secreted myself behind some trees on the main road leading to the military gymnasium, knowing at the same time that one Lance-corporal Bacon, police-corporal of the battalion, would pass that way about ten or eleven at night, and having resolved to do the said corporal an injury, I took a razor in my pocket, and also carried a heavy stick at the same time. Shortly after 10 p.m. I observed a soldier pass along the common. Thinking he was the police-corporal I made a rush at him from behind, and struck him with the stick; he fell senseless to the ground. I then drew the razor across his throat and left him lying on the ground, and I made off, as I heard someone coming. It being dark at the time, and the man not speaking when I struck him, I did not observe but that it was the police-corporal I bad assaulted; nor did I know until after my return to camp who it was. hen I heard, coming in the camp, of the men talking, I listened, and heard that Private Downs, of the F company, had been taken to the hospital with his throat cut. I had no grudge or ill<lb/>feeling towards Downs, but after the deed was done I kept quiet, not being suspected, as all the talk in the camp was that some natives had</p>

               <p>committed the deed of which I now confess. I never told any person of my having been out. Before returning to my tent I took off my clothes and hid them, as well as the razor and stick, in the hollow of a tree in a wood that adjoined the camp. Any person acquainted with the camp could pass in and out on a dark night without being seen by the sentry on duty. I came home to England in March, 1889, and have been wandering about from place to place. This crime seemed to haunt me, and not being able to get any work, as I received a very bad character in the Army, I did not know what I could do. I seriously thought of the grave nature of the offence I had committed. I resolved at last to give myself up to justice and confess. I am very sorry for what I have done by causing the death of an innocent man.")</p>

I am clerk to John Pullen, a fruit-sales<lb/>man on commission, in Covent Garden Market—between June and Novem<lb/>ber last he had three clerks, Ward, Winskip and Williamson—Ward was a salesman, and Winskip and Williamson were inferior clerks to him—it was their duty to keep Mr. Pullen's books—there was a commission book kept by Ward generally, and occasionally by Winskip, and a sale book kept entirely by Ward—the ledger was kept by Winskip, and should accurately show the state of the account between the prosecutor and his consignors—the dissecting book was kept by Williamson; it consisted of entries of the quantity and quality of the goods received, with the initials of the consignor—the ledger would be posted from the commission and the sale book—blue sheets were made up daily by Winskip, and forwarded to the consignor every evening, naming the quantity consigned and the quantity sold—either Winskip or Williamson would post them to the consignor—it was Winskip's duty to make out weekly sheets which summarised the blue sheets, and gave the position of the account at the end of the week, and it was Ward's duty to check them—those weekly sheets would be brought to Williamson to bring to Mr. Pullen or to me, and on the faith of that cheques would be drawn and handed to Williamson—it was no part of my duty to check the weekly sheets with the books, that was Ward's duty—it was not Pullen's custom to check them, he always relied on Ward—Mr. Pullen was away ill from August 23rd to October, 1890, and the weekly sheets were sent to his house, sometimes by me and sometimes by Williamson, and he would rely on them and draw his cheques—I have examined the books carefully, and produce a summary of names and amounts for which cheques have been drawn for matters which do not appear in the books—I have had the counterfoils of the cheque books, and the business books, and find that from 19th July to 25th October, 1890, forty-six cheques were drawn; and paid by being passed through his account; for £300, for which there is no entry in the books—I produce twenty-three of the forty-six cheques of which I have the counterfoils; one is to the order of J.

Preaux" in the prisoner's writing—he had no authority to endorse cheques—it was never brought to my know<lb/>ledge that he was endorsing cheques of my master's—this cheque of September 27th for £7 19s. in favour of P.

I live at 25, Newcastle Street, Strand, and am a cook at the Savoy Hotel—about twenty minutes to twelve on the early mor<lb/>ning of 20th January I left the Savoy Hotel, and went into the Cleopatra's Needle public house, Herbert Passage—I came out of there about ten minutes past twelve with a friend; a woman selling matches accosted us; my friend bought a box of matches, and said "Good-night" to me—I went round the corner; the woman followed me, and when I got to the corner of Beaufort Buildings I turned and gave her a penny to get rid of her—while giving her a penny I was attacked from behind by three men, one of whom was Thompson—they knocked me down and knelt on my chest, and Thompson tore my watch-chain away—I had on two watches, which I protected, and prevented them taking; he punched and kicked me, and the other two also punched me, and took £1 10s. in gold, 7s. 6d. silver, and 2d. out of my pocket—I don't see either of the other two men in Court—I called out "Police!" and policemen came up—the two men other than Thompson called out, "Look out, here is a <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>" and then they made off—Thompson tried to get away, but I stuck to him till the constable came up and took him into custody—he was taken to the station and charged—I was a good deal hurt; I did not lie up, but I thought for a few days that the bridge of my nose was broken, it turned black, and was swollen; it is not broken—I did not have a doctor, I went to business next day.</p>

               <p>January I was on duty in Carting Lane with another constable—I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" from the direction of Herbert Passage—I ran there with the other constable, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and the prisoner leaning over him—King and the other man were standing there—some one called out, "Look out, here is a <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> "—I took the prisoner into custody—Xing and the other man ran away—on Saturday, 24th January, I went to Bow Street station, where I saw King, and identified him from among about eight others as one of the two men who ran away—I was present when he was charged—I have no doubt that he was one of the men; I knew him before—Thompson was searched; nothing relating to the charge was found on him.</p>

Herbert Passage is outside a public-house, and is one of the most brilliantly lighted spots in London; Carting Lane is not magnificently lit up—I was 80 or 100 yards from the place from which the cries came—I tried to run up without making a noise—the other constable was in uniform—we got within twenty or thirty yards before they could see us—the two men running off were not more than two seconds under my observation—I had seen King before—I did not let the other officer know that I knew King before—I gave a description of the two men before seeing King at the station; I gave no description of his complexion—this is the description I gave the same night: "First, age 25, height 5ft. 7 in. or 8 in., full round face, fair moustache; dress, dark clothes, long black overcoat, hard felt hat; the other, age 27, height 5 ft. 8 in., light moustache, hard felt hat, dark overcoat"—I had a good opportunity of seeing their faces—I am positive that the prisoner is one of the two men concerned in the robbery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">took time for consideration, and on the following Thursday, in giving judgment, said: The principle which governed cases of this description could not be better stated than in Hawkins Pleas of the Crown, Book</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">, c.</hi> 25, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">and guided by the principle there laid down, it became necessary to inquire: First, whether this was a statutory offence; and secondly, whether the Statute creating the offence had prescribed a particular remedy in such terms as to exclude, either expressly or by implication, a remedy by indictment. Upon the first point there could be no room for doubt or controversy. All the offences charged against the defendant were imposed, not by the Common Law, but by the Registration Act of</hi> 1843. <hi rend="italic">No doubt some of the sections of the Reform Act were repealed, but the</hi> 76<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">section had not been; and, it was urged, but for that section, an overseer in the lapse of the eleven years between</hi> 1832 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 1843, <hi rend="italic">would be indictable, because where a duty was created by statute and no remedy was provided, he would be indictable; but that</hi> 76<hi rend="italic">th section expressly provided that a Jury might award any sum not exceeding</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">and that proviso excluded the notion of indictment. The duty created by the</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">section of the Act of</hi> 1843 <hi rend="italic">was, in fact, a new duty, or a newly-created duty, and for a breach of that duty a specific penalty was enacted by way of fine. From a careful consideration of all the sections, the conclusion he had arrived at was that this was a case in which the specific remedy provided by sections</hi> 51 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 97 <hi rend="italic">existed, which otherwise would be by indictment; but that indictment was manifestly excluded by the statute itself. <rs id="t18910209-214-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and carried on works at West Ham in the name of Dunn and Co. up to January 1, 1891—Tyler and Co. are now carrying them on—they have always been called the Stirling Chemical Works; I built them, and have carried them on for eighteen years—I have a process for forming, purifying, and concentrating phosphoric acid, which I have carried on over twenty-eight years, and always used platinum vessels for the purpose, made by Johnson and Matthey—I issued this circular which accurately describes the vessels, two days after the robbery. (<hi rend="italic">Giving the dimension of the vessels</hi>)—that is very accurate—on November 10 I issued another circular, showing the shape of the vessels pretty well—that is printed on the blank page of the former circular—Griggs had charge of the keys from twelve o'clock on Saturday night till Monday morning—it would take seven minutes to walk to Griggs' house—we work from Monday morning to Saturday at midnight—we do not put the furnaces out—this iron is one of the six—it is prevented from falling off by the <hi rend="italic">lugs</hi>—there are no screws; the ring is bolted into the platinum, and there it remains till it is worn out, or till the platinum needs repair—they were put into a safe on Sunday nights; they were at work all the rest of the time—I heard of the loss of the vessels when I arrived at the works on Monday morning; McKenzie came to me—there was no mark of violence to the premises or to the safe—on January 71 received a telegram from Johnson, Matthey and Go., asking me to go and see them—I did so, and I saw Mr. Sellon the next day—on January 19 I went there again and saw the defendant there—I had never seen him before—Mr. Sellon said, "This is Mr. Bruce, and I should like you to have a talk together. I have brought you to see Mr. Bruce, to see what is to be done in this matter. You had better go into a private room and talk it over; I have received 100 ounces of platinum from Mr. Bruce"—I went into another room with Bruce, and said, "Mr. Bruce, this is a very serious matter; can you tell me what induced you to buy this platinum?"—he said, "I was offered 55s. an ounce for it, and I thought 5s. an ounce was a good business"; that means a good profit—he said he had paid £250 for it—I said, "Of whom did you buy this platinum?"—he said, "I do not know the name of the man, but I think it is Burgess or Bruges, or some such name"—I said, "Have you his address?"—he said, "No, I don't know where he lives"—I said, "Did you take a receipt for the £250 you received?"—he said, "No "—I said, "Will you tell me how you paid him?"—he said, "I paid him notes and gold"—I said, "What sort of notes?"—he told me, and I said, "Of course you have got an entry in your books of this transaction?"—he said, "No; I have not made any entry "—I said, "It is assuming a very serious aspect, but I should like to know if you can help us to recover the remainder of our platinum?"—he said, "If the man comes again I certainly will give him in custody at once"—I said, "If you are successful in enabling us to recover the remainder of our property I shall be disposed to look more leniently on</p>

               <p>your conduct; I shall send an inspector of police to you in a day or two; that is the inspector who has had charge of the robbery from its inception"—I said, "When did you buy this platinum?"—he said, "On the Tuesday or Wednesday after Christmas"—one thing I have omitted; I said, "Who offered you fifty-five shillings for this?"—he said, "The Sheffield Smelting Company"—I said, "I shall go and see them," and I went and saw Mr. Morton, the manager—I had not then seen the 99 oz., I had seen a little piece—I know of no works but ours in which platinum vessels are used for the purpose of making phosphoric acid, but some persons may make a small quantity—these vessels were made from my sketch and instructions; I have never seen any like them—using them gives a peculiar whiteness to the interior surface of the platinum, the whole of the inside is equally whitened; there is hardly any difference, and the outside on the lower part under the rings is blackened and rendered grey when it is exposed to the fire—where the iron ring is round the vessel it would be less exposed to the fire—I saw no <hi rend="italic">lugs</hi> among the old iron—a little phosphoric acid clings to the vessel, either combined or uncalcined—I believe these three hundred pieces of platinum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be portions of those six vessels, the greater part, if not all of them, show that peculiar whiteness on one side, and the appearance of the action of the fire on the other, and again I tell it by the thickness, by the gauge—I have not applied any chemical test to see whether phosphorus was deposited on the interior of our vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All that I can speak to is whiteness inside, fire outside, and thickness of gauge—I speak of the gauge simply by feeling it—the thickness of these pieces coincides, so far as touch is concerned, with the thickness of our dishes—scores and scores of dishes and platina stills are made in different parts of the world—the thickness of this is the same as ours—I do not know that ours went from gauge 10 to gauge 7—that was not in my evidence, but it was made a point of to the Magistrate—I have not examined the gauge of any of these pieces; I am told that it has been done, but I have not been told that there is not a single piece here answering the description—I have not received any information of any further portion of bur platinum being found—I have not heard of what is believed to be a portion of it being purchased in Paris—Brummell, the man who had charge of the dishes, and I, examined these 99 ounces the week after I caused the prisoner to be arrested—I should not know the piece which I had seen when I took that step—the piece was something like this (<hi rend="italic">selecting one</hi>)—this has the whiteness, the colour on the other side, and the thickness—the rolling was not a feature of my identification—a point was made before the Magistrate of the rolling, but not before the prisoner's apprehension—I gave no evidence about the rolling; I said, "In the course of my conversation with the defendant, I understood that this platinum had been rolled, and he said, 'Most persons in our trade have rollers, arid I have a little hand roller myself'"—the matter was tested in my presence by being rolled through the defendant's roller, to see whether grooves or ridges would appear—I do not know the result; it was to be examined by experts, and they did not point it out to me—I do not know that they got a ridge or a mark which did not correspond, showing that it had been rolled through another roller—the black marks on these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090047"/>
               <p>pieces are precisely similar to those on my foods, and the inside whiteness also—they would be the same, and the thickness also, in all platinum vessels used anywhere for phosphoric acid—I do not know that forty houses in Glasgow alone use such vessels—the whiteness is caused by the action of the hot acid on the platinum—I have never tried if nitric or sulphuric acid would do the same—it is not roughened; there is no dis<lb/>turbance of the surface to the naked eye—as the platinum does not lose a quarter of an ounce in ten years the action must be extremely small, but just perceivable—the mark on this piece is more in the nature of a furrow than a ridge—I never saw the ridge to which reference is made—I make acetic, muriatic, hydrochloric, fluoric, formic, and several other acids—fluoric acid is made in iron and leaden dishes, not in platinum—no copy of this circular was sent to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had no platinum vessels besides these six except a little experimental one, two or three inches in diameter, weighing three-quarters of an ounce—these vessels were only used for phosphoric acid—I have not heard of the loss of any other platinum vessels—we communi<lb/>cated with Johnson and Matthey as far as I know within a few hours after the theft; they had seen the whole 300 pieces at the time of the conver<lb/>sation, but I had only seen one; I relied on their statement—I left the actual scientific measurement to Mr. Sellon—the defendant was present when the roller was used, and his junior Counsel and two solicitors; I think there were six persons present altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Johnson, Matthey and Co., and pay special attention to their large chemical apparatus, which in<lb/>cludes the manufacture of platinum dishes—Mr. Dunn's dishes passed through my hands—the gauge is recorded in the books; they varied from ten at the bottom to seven at the top, the lugs being thicker metal—these pieces of metal on the table were submitted to me; I went through twenty-five or thirty per cent, of them, and found the thickness was an easy ten, and ranged down to practically seven, and one piece was as low as four; a large number were above six—in my judgment the pieces had been rolled—an experiment was made with Bruce's hand roller; that is not the article with which the ridges were formed—there was no object in using a roller except to destroy the identity; it was not done for any commercial purpose—rolling would reduce the thickness of the plate—I found marks of rolling on all the pieces—I have been at Johnson and Matthey's twelve years—I have never made any other dishes of this sort or form; they were made specially to Mr. Dunn's' order—the whitening indicates that it has been used in chemical manufacture—platinum stands a greater heat than any other metal—I never knew platinum in this state to be sold as a commercial transaction, or saw it in this state—the purchase of old metal would not come under my notice—we get it in very smooth highly polished sheets of a uniform gauge—if Mr. Dunn's dishes were cut up and rolled I should expect them to be dirty on one side and crystalline on the other; identical with this appearance—I cannot say from these pieces in what form they were before they were broken up; there is nothing to show whether they were cylindrical, but they had formed a vessel, because of the crystalline appearance on one side and the dirty appearance on the other—no such vessel has been made since to my knowledge—I know no large manufacturer of such things in England.</p>

They were examined with a fair gauge used in our business—7 is thicker than 10; the maximum is practically 10, which is as thick as a piece of cardboard, about the 30th of an inch—the difference between 7 and 10 would be a 10 or 12,000th of an inch—I could tell the differ<lb/>ence by feeling it with my fingers; I may be wrong in my decimals; one would be very stiff and the other very pliable—these have been rolled in what are called rough rollers; that would not necessarily reduce the thickness—I recognise the ridge on this piece; it must have been a powerful squeeze to make that—I showed the Magistrate fifteen or sixteen pieces containing this double ridge—I was present at the subsequent experimental rolling; I fed the roller—the result of it was that the defendant's roller, which had been taken from his shop, would not make the marks; it did make a mark which was not to be found there—this roller must have reduced the height of the ridge the 10,000th of an inch, and probably more—this piece is now nine gauge.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Johnson, Matthey and Co.; we manufacture platinum articles—I am not aware of any other such firm in England—we sold dishes to Mr. Dunn at different times, specially made to his drawings and order—I had been absent on the Continent, and in July Mr. Wills told me he had seen a piece of platinum, and I told him I should like to see a piece; he brought one, and it gave me the impression of metal which had been cut up, and not by a workman, because that would bear the polish of the original metal, scraps actually cut off—I have only once seen platinum in this condition, and that was a stolen parcel—my suspicions wore immediately aroused, and I gave instructions to telegraph to Mr. Dunn, bearing in mind the robbery which had been committed two or three months before—after the interview with Mr. Dunn a sample was procured; I examined it and sent it into the laboratory to be tested, but it was so small that no trace of phosphoric acid could be detected, and I wrote to Mr. Bruce asking him to bring the whole 100 oz.—he called on the 16th, and I told him I had strong sus<lb/>picious that the 100 oz. were a portion of some stolen metal—he expressed great surprise, and I asked him how he came into possession of it—he said he had made an advance upon it—I asked him whether he would allow the whole bulk to be sent over to us that I might examine it—he assented, and I sent Mr. Wills to bring it, which he did, and I sent a receipt to Mr. Bruce—I divided it in half, and sent one half into the laboratory to be tested for phosphoric acid, the other half was sealed and put away—I watched the results, and saw precipitate of phosphoric acid—I then asked Mr. Dunn to call on the following Monday, the 19th,. and asked Mr. Bruce to call at the same time—I did not speak to Mr. Bruce till I took Mr. Dunn to him—one was shown into one room and one into another, arid then I said to Mr. Bruce, "This is the owner of the platinum, you had better give him information how it came into your possession"—after they came out, Mr. Dunn said that Bruce said he had given £250 for it in notes and gold—I formed a judgment as to what the prices were, because there were 100 ounces, which is an unusually large quantity; 100 ounces would never be offered as cut up platinum, and from my examination of the gauge, and the traces of phosphoric acid, I came to the conclusion that it was what we had made up for Mr. Dunn, because if there had been any other robbery, we should have heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> 100 ounces being offered for sale in any country struck me as being very large—a large quantity of metal had been stolen, and this answered in every particular to what would be the condition of the stolen metal if cut up and rolled as this has been, and we knew of no other stolen metal, whereas if any other had been stolen in England or throughout Europe we should have known, and it would not occur in any ordinary commercial transaction—I do not know the prisoner, but I have ascertained that he is a jeweller and optician and gold and silversmith in Clerkenwell—I im<lb/>agine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090051"/>
               <p>no notice was sent to him of this robbery, and though we knew of it, it is very unlikely that he did—the material I saw was such that if not rolled it would correspond with the stolen stuff, and the rolling was extremely superficial—the whiteness inside and the fire outside and the thickness of the metal were the three points—all stills, in addition to the whiteness, would have a different colour inside from the action of sulphuric acid; the metal is uniformly gauged, and therefore you would not in 100 ounces get a variation in gauge, such as to show in these pieces; then the work in which they are used is entirely different; this metal has not been subjected to the ordinary incrustations which occur in making sulphuric acid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an analytical chemist, a Member of the London University, and a Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry—I have been occupied for some years in testing materials for sulphuric acid—on 27th January I received from Johnson and Matthey ten ounces of platinum, which I took away to my laboratory and subjected to analysis—from the surface of the metal I obtained one-sixth of a grain of phosphoric acid—I am an agricultural chemist, constantly engaged in testing soils for phosphoric acid, and one-sixth of a grain is a considerable quantity—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a precipitate representing half the quantity I found—the yellow powder is due to one-twelfth of a grain of phosphoric acid—I re<lb/>turned the ten ounces to Johnson and Matthey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not begin by treating the platinum with some acid; I subjected half the quantity to the action of boiling water, which dissolved a small quantity of phosphoric acid, and, having got out all that was soluble, I afterwards removed the rest by the addition of dilute nitric acid—I am not aware that in the course of many manufactures carried on in platinum vessels phosphates of various kinds are pro<lb/>duced—there is no phosphate of silver in these crucibles and platinum dishes; I should have detected silver if it had been there—this is not phosphate of silver—the surface of the platinum contained oxide of iron on the surface, which would temporarily fix it, and would account for it not coming away with the water—when phosphoric acid is strongly heated it assumes a very hard and crystalline formation—there are three varieties of it—any considerable quantity not deliquesed would be visible—the surface was covered with oxide of iron; that would make phosphate of iron—the iron would take up a good deal of water—the phosphoric acid would to some extent find its way into the platinum unless it was burnished, and in that condition it would be easily removed by water—there would be nooks and crannies from which it would be difficult to remove it—all platinum vessels subjected to heat get a dulness, and that is the whit<lb/>eness—it is a molecular alteration; a physical change—I cannot say that the phosphoric acid was free—phosphoric acid proved to be present, but whether it was there when I began, in the form of free phosphoric acid or in some combination I am unable to say—it would not be a phosphate unless there was phosphoric acid; it would not be phosphate of lime; the only material I could find likely to be combined with</p>

               <p>it was a little iron, which was on the surface—arsenic would give almost the same reaction as I found, and therefore I was very careful to examine the precipitate, and there was not the least trace of arsenic there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am an analytical chemist—this platinum was sub<lb/>mitted to me for analysis—I did not obtain any phosphorus or phosphoric acid—I converted it into phosphate of silver; that was obtained from the phosphorus in the metal—I did not treat it with nitric acid; I made the phosphate of silver—it is quite possible that the platinum was contami<lb/>nated with phosphorus which had never been used in the making of phosphoric acid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I did not know that it had been used for making phos<lb/>phoric acid, but I was asked to test for phosphoric acid or phosphorus, and I was told that it might have been stolen—I am one of Johnson and Matthey's chemists—the phosphorus might have been in it or in any form; platinum does not contain phosphorus, but old platinum vessels are liable to contamination by phosphorus—I do not know why phos<lb/>phorus should appear in platinum, but it may appear on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">WADDY</hi>. We are general analysts, but I do a little in platinum—I am unable to say whether this piece of platinum had phosphoric acid free on it—old platinum dishes are used for various chemical operations, and will occasionally become contaminated with phos<lb/>phorus without phosphoric acid being made in them; the mere fact of phosphoric acid in some form being found is no proof that they have been used for making free phosphoric acid—I applied my test to the surface, but the platinum is porous and the test would penetrate some distance in—it is possible that though not used for making phosphoric acid there may be some trace of phosphorus in the vessels—in ordinary laboratories we use platinum for making fusions, and these vessels might retain a trace of phosphorus, because there had been phosphorus put into them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My second examination was on 23rd January, of 25 oz. of platinum from Mr. Risden; I had examined one of the small fragments first—the next was 50 oz., and the last 25 oz.—I always applied the test to the surface—I did not know before my second examination that Mr. Dyer had been employed; I knew that he was making a test, but I forget how I heard it—I think I knew it on 31st January, the last time I gave evidence—I did not put any phosphorus in—I did not dissolve any phosphorus or platinum—I got the phos<lb/>phorus off the platinum—I did nothing inconsistent with Mr. Dyer's statement—phosphorus had been on the platinum, but I cannot say phosphoric acid—I did not report that there was phosphorus after my first test, but after my third.</p>

The result of my evidence is that I found phosphorus there, but how it got there I do not know—if the piece I examined had formed portions of a vessel in which phosphoric acid was made, that would sufficiently account for the presence of phosphorus.</p>

I am a bootmaker of 23, New Road, Commercial Road—I am a director of the Sun Loan and Deposit Company—I have been treasurer since August, 1890; the society lends money and receives money on deposit upon which interest is allowed or charged—we require application forms to be filled up with the names and addresses and sureties of the borrowers, and all particulars—the company was formed in March, 1889—the prisoner was the promoter and the managing director—in September, 1889, Mr. Marks was appointed secretary, and the prisoner's duties were transferred to him—up to that time the prisoner kept the books: the "Deposit and Repayment Book and "Loans and Savings" or "Repayment of Loan Book—since Marks' appointment it was the prisoner's duty to attend at the office, 16, Osborne Street, from eleven to four, and three nights in the week from four to seven, and three nights a week from seven to ten to inquire as to and receive loans—I attended with a director to receive deposits and pay loans to those whom the prisoner, after inquiry, passed—the prisoner received the money and put it into a till, and entered the amount in a book—in February, 1890, the directors passed a resolution that the prisoner must not collect moneys, but should sit in the office to receive repayments—on 2nd September the prisoner handed me four promissory notes and four application forms—this No. 907 was one—I am referring to my private book, where I enter money I receive and pay—I entered this transaction at the time—the prisoner should have handed me £53 4s. 9d., the amount of repayments and savings shown by the books to have been received on several nights—we added the amounts up which were shown in the book—most of the entries are the prisoners—I went through the book that evening with him—I sign the; total in the book when I receive the money from him—I gave him credit for three out of four promissory notes for £10 which he produced and said were paid out by him—their numbers were 907, 908, 909, and 910—I handed him 909 back, and said it was not satisfactory, and he said, "I have made a mistake; I have not paid this one "—he took it away—those notes would reduce the amount due from him by £15 5s. 9d.—on No. 907 was advanced £8 9s. 11d.—he handed me the balance, £37 19s. in cash—in<lb/>structions were given him not to do duties outside the office—I asked him how he came to pay those loans, and why could he not wait till I got to the office—he said the borrowers wanted the money to buy goods</p>

                  </hi>. I have been secretary of the Sun Loan and Deposit Company, 16, Osborne Street, since September, 1889, under the super<lb/>vision of the prisoner as managing director—I enter loans in the ledger—Nos. 907 and 883 are entered in the corresponding pages, showing the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090058"/>
               <p>weekly payments—on 1st October, 1889, this agreement in my writing was signed by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">For service as managing director</hi>)—in February last the directors resolved the prisoner should only receive re<lb/>payments on the premises—in August I examined the books for arrears—he requested me to go through the books, and we gave him the bene<lb/>fit of £4 8s., which was doubtful—Stein came back to London on 25th August—I was with him and the prisoner that evening at the office—Stein handed me application forms and promissory notes, which I entered in the ledger—in No. 883, Lazarus Levy, of 7, Wharton Street, Hackney Road, is the borrower—the sureties are L. Rossen, 13, Greenfield Street; Samuel Latner, 9, Vine Court, Whitechapel; and Joseph Alexander, 97, Cannon Street Road—the loan was £10, to be repaid 5s. weekly—I find on September 12th a repayment entered of 10s.; and on September 19th of 5s. in my writing, from the day-book—the day-book entries are the prisoner's—the 12th is an entry of two instalments—I gave the notes to the prisoner, whose duty was to put them in the inner drawer of the safe—I had no key to that drawer—the prisoner had the key—there were two keys to the outer safe—I had one, the prisoner the other—on. 2nd September I was also present with Stein and the prisoner—I entered the particulars of No. 907, loan of £10 to Simon Borisof—it was the prisoner's duty to send notice of arrears—after 2nd September I found no notice had been sent to Simon Borisof, although his weekly pay<lb/>ments were in arrear—I sent out this notice—Borisof came to the office on the evening of 10th November—we had a conversation there as to promissory note and application form No. 907—when the prisoner came in and said, "I have brought you one sovereign which Mr. Borisof has given me to pay in, and 6s. from Mr. Hyman"—I said, "Where is the book?"—I meant the depositor's book, so that I could enter the money—he felt over his pockets, then said, "Oh, I must have lost it somehow"—the book is similar to that produced, in which the repayments are entered weekly or monthly—it is kept by the depositor, and signed when they bring their money, and the entry made in the day book—I said, "I cannot take the money, because I do not know the number"—he said, "Oh, I know the number, I can give you the number, it is 907"—I said I would enter it in the customer's book when he brought it next week, and "I daresay it will be found by then"—I entered the receipt of £1 at 907 in the ledger—on the 17th there was a meeting of the directors—I had sent a notice to the prisoner—he did not attend—I saw him the following morning at the office—Mr. Bowman came in—I heard him say, "You have not robbed us enough, but you have gone and forged this note"—the note was lying on the counter—the prisoner said, "Well, and if I have I will pay for it"—Stein came in soon after Bowman—that afternoon the prisoner offered to deposit £63 of promissory notes to settle the matter—I said I could have nothing to do with it; I had no power to settle one way or the other—from going through the books I found the repayments of Lazarus Levy's loan were in arrear—a notice was sent to Levy in consequence—he came to the office—I and other directors searched everywhere for his note of 25th August—we could find no trace of it nor the application forms—I found in ledger, page 452, Levy had been a previous borrower of £6 in January, 1890—of that £4 10s. had been regularly repaid, and the balance of 30s. paid in August.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I thought on 17th November I had finished my ledger, and then found ten more pages, I was not muddled—these notes ran up to No. 890—there may have been five or ten other entries, but practically the ledger is my work—the prisoner did not complain of my mistakes—he left on 12th October—the directors gave him notice—he was suspended on 7th October, then the matter was discussed—he had not intimated his intention of going away, and the resolution of the 12th stood—since that day he did no more duty for the company—I did not mention Borisof's repayment of £1 on 10th November at the Police-court, because I did not think it important till the case went on—I should have said it had I been asked—this is my letter of October 22nd, wrongly dated August 22nd. (<hi rend="italic">This was a notice to the prisoner that his resigna<lb/>tion having been accepted, that he must not receive money or act for the company</hi>)—the prisoner was suspended, and the directors would not go to extremes on account of the intimation that he would resign on or after 12th October; we had no ill feeling, and wanted to meet him in every way—I did not know the prisoner had started a loan office—I cannot read Hebrew, I am English, I read English—I saw a card like this with the address 64, High Street, Whitechapel—I do not know how far that is from the "Sun" office or Osborne Street—the prisoner setting up a loan office would have been a matter of indifference to me—I helped to make up the balance-sheet of 1889—it showed a profit of £300 on the year, I don't know whether it is £99 or £50 per cent.—that was on a turnover of £3,000—I could tell you from the balance-sheet; the profits are not so great, there are bad debts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The balance-sheet has been investigated, showing an assumed profit, and a loss of £500—the prisoner made out the balance-sheet of 1889—two guineas were paid me for my time—this is the balance-sheet to December 31st, 1889, showing £1,612 15s. 8 1/2 d., and liabilities £1,442 8s. 5 1/2 d., or a profit of £170—that was found to be erroneous—it was the prisoner's doing—on 24th October these forgeries had not been discovered—a sum was left in the company's hands to meet the prisoner's deficiencies—the books were examined to ascertain them—there was then no question of fraud.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 66, Ridley Road, Dalston—I am a warehouseman by occupation—I have known George Culmer about twelve years—I know his brother Frederick and other members of his family—the prisoner first spoke to me on the subject of fires about October, 1889—at that time I was living at 106, Spa Road, Bermondsey—I moved from there to 133, St. John's Road, Hoxton—he said that having a fire would be a very profitable transaction, that it would put money in my pocket and his, and he advised me to take out a policy of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090069"/>
               <p>insurance, and that sort of thing—he said the plan was to set a place on fire where the goods were not really worth anything, or only a few pounds, and then by a method known to him give them a higher price than they were worth, and of course great benefit would accrue to himself and me also—he said, a few baskets and sheeting, and paraffin oil were the chief factors; the sheeting was to be saturated with paraffin oil, and he would undertake to burn the place out, so that there should be no detection—he did not give me a practical illustration of how the place was to be set on fire—he mentioned a tape and candle; it was to be placed at his discretion—he said a common paraffin lamp would be broken, and the fragments of the reservoir would be put about the room, and the glass in the same way; that was to give the notion that an explosion had taken place—he spoke of several fires that he had figured in, I think Clyde Road, Tottenham, was one, Winchester Street, King's Cross, another, Southwark Bridge Road, and Tredegar Road, Bow—I insured my furniture in Spa Road in the Westminster Fire Office—I afterward moved it to 133, St. John's Road, Hoxton—I gave notice to the office, and the policy was transferred there about the middle of November—it was in Spa Road that Culmer spoke to me about fires, he spoke in a general way, of course he enlarged on the subject further on, giving more particulars, but in October, 1889, quite at the end, Tredegar Road was mentioned—he spoke to me on different occasions—while we were at St. John's Road he suggested that I should have a fire there, that was in October—I should say I moved into St. John's Road about the middle of November; the fire at that place was suggested before I went there—on the 14th December, about five in the afternoon, Culmer arrived at my place, and brought with him a sack containing some burnt clothing—he said, "Everything is now ready, all you have got to do is to clear out of the place, I will see to the rest"—he had his brother Fred with him—I left the house about half-past five with my wife and child, leaving the prisoner and Fred there—I came back about eight and found that the fire had taken place—the contents of the room were more or less destroyed by fire—that was the first fire I had been connected with—I made a claim; I followed Culmer's instructions in everything—he said if I was asked if I left a light when I went out, I should say "Yes"; if asked "What did you leave?" say, "Oh, a paraffin lamp alight"—and I did so; I was asked that question by the assessor—I sent in a claim for £119, my policy was for £100, this is the policy—Culmer introduced a lot of burnt articles, clothing, and that sort; he said the stuff he had bought and burnt cost him a sovereign, the stuff he had brought in the sack; on the claim it showed something like £20 or £30; it was merely an exaggerated claim—the value of the things in the two rooms was from £15 to £20—the contents of one room were utterly destroyed, the other room was severely scorched—£63 2s. 6d. was paid in settlement of the claim—£211 gave to Culmer; it was the agreement that he should have one-third—I also purchased furniture of him to make good what I had lost—the rest of the money I had—about 16th December I went to 44, Richmond Gardens, Shepherd's Bush—Culmer invited me to go there; he said a fire would take place there very shortly, and he wished me to seethe affair; he took me to view the furniture, and such like—he said he had procured a policy in the name of Frederick Wilson, and his brother would assume that name and</p>

               <p>represent himself to be the owner of the goods there; that the fire would take place in a day or so; he was waiting for the transfer of the policy, which was originally taken out for 22, Church Road, Islington—I went and saw the furniture on the 16th, and stayed the night—some of the things were partly burnt; a chest of drawers and some clothes were more or less burnt—he said that furniture had come from Tredegar Road, a mahogany table, picture frames, and various things—on the 18th December, the night of the fire, I went with Culmer's wife to Richmond Gardens, not to the house—we were on a bridge at the back of the house, and saw the flames from the house; and about twenty minutes after I saw the prisoner and was in conversation with him—I saw his brother almost an hour after—before the fire I had seen the prisoner—it was arranged that I should not speak to any one; if I saw them I was to take no notice—when I reached Richmond Gardens George and his brother were in front of me; on seeing me they went ahead—after the fire we went to a public-house, and the prisoner said he was afraid it would be rather an awkward affair; that his brother Fred was quite new to the business, and he thought perhaps some query might arise—after that I went home—I remember the rooms at 250, Tufnell Park Road being taken by Fred Culmer—he purchased some furniture from me; he bought the salvage of the St. John's Road fire, and gave me £5 for it—on February 10 I was with the prisoner when he bought a sofa, a pair of palliasses, and I think one or two picture frames; he gave half-a-crown for the sofa; it was only the frame of it, and I think the palliasse cost about 3s.—I saw them taken to 250, Tufnell Park Road—the day after some cheap new canvas was bought in Hoxton, six or eight yards, and a gallon of oil was procured in New North Road—I went to the house on the 11th, about four in the afternoon—the policy there was in the name of Herbert Brown—that night the prisoner saturated the canvas with the paraffin oil, and wrapped it about the furniture, and soaked some men's clothing, and one or two pieces of sheeting; he then produced a piece of common tape, soaked that with oil, and fastened it to the canvas; one end of the tape rested on the floor, to that he attached a very small piece of candle, the lamp was broken, and strewed about the place—the candle was lit by George, and then he, Fred and I left the room—about five minutes afterwards I am the fire, I watched it—I remained with George, Fred went back to the house—on 9th April, 1890, I was asked by Mrs. Culmer to go to 36, Paign<lb/>ton Road, Stamford Hill—George told me that a fire had taken place there; before that I had beard that a fire was to take place there, and about ten days or a fortnight after I saw that a fire had occurred there—I saw a man named Kelly there, the prisoner was there at the time; Kelly and the prisoner took away the salvage; Mrs. Ingram was there, and the carman who moved the furniture—Kelly assisted with Culmer; part of it was taken to 38, Ringcroft Street, Holloway, and the remainder to 13, Madras Place, Holloway—I remember Culmer taking a house in Dalton Street, Camberwell; he went there from Holloway Road—I saw the furniture at Dalton Street; I had seen that furniture at St. John's Road, Hoxton, at Tufnell Park Road, and at 36, Paignton Road; it had been through the fire—a policy was taken out by me at Paignton Road, at Culmer's suggestion, in the name of English for £100 on household furniture, wearing apparel, and so on—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090073"/>
               <p>the place was set on fire on 1st June, about two in the morning, by George Culmer—three or four gallons of oil was used, and one or two egg chests—I was in the first floor front room when the fire broke out—there were one or two baskets, some sheeting, and clothing, and one or two pieces of canvas; we ripped up the staircase in various parts, and also a portion of the wooden partition parting the back room from the staircase—on this occasion Culmer suggested that there should be a new departure made; hitherto it had been arranged that every person should leave the house before the fire; then he said, if we stay in the house, it will produce the notion that it was a hairbreadth escape—in this point of view I agreed with him, and when that fire broke out Culmer and his wife escaped by the back room window, and got on to some outhouse to reach the ground—I left by the first floor-front window by the aid of a sheet; I think I sewed a piece of blanket to it—I made a claim for that fire of £94 6s. 3d.; this is it; it is my writing; I simply copied what Calmer had already written—the contents of the place were the property of Culmer, not mine; they had nothing to do with me at all—the claim was made as for my property—that claim was settled for a sum of £75—the fire was supposed to break out in Culmer's portion of the house—I was supposed to be the lodger, renting the first floor front—the fire undoubtedly broke out in his part of the house, and broke through the woodwork; the woodwork having been partly removed—Culmer had £50 of the £75; I had the other £25—in August I took a room at 39, Thorolds Road, Fulham, with George Culmer—with his assistance I brought the furniture from Whitmore Road, Hoxton—a policy was taken out in the name of Frederick Richards; the furniture there was Culmer's, but I represented myself as the owner—that place was set fire to by George Culmer on 20th August—I was with him when the preparation was made for the fire with the oil—it was done in the same way as before—I saw articles brought there which had already been burnt, brought there in a bag—a tape and candle were used as before, a lamp broken and strewed about the place—I re<lb/>mained in the house when the fire took place—I found that the landlady and her son were in the room overhead, and I thought it best to remain in the house—I went to the back of the house, and remained about five minutes—I heard the crackle and the fire breaking out—a man knocked at the door and said the house was on fire, and I then ran up stairs and got the landlady and her son down—I made a claim of £86 in respect of that fire, and received £50 in settlement—Culmer had £34, and I had £16—I owed him a few shillings; of course I gave him the odd shillings—the cheque was paid to me, and I cashed it and divided it—this is the claim I sent in—the value of the property in the house was, I think, about £10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had nothing to do with a fire before Culmer men<lb/>tioned to me about setting fire to houses—I first communicated with the police on the subject about the end of September, 1890—I did not give information to Inspector Dinney the day Culmer was taken—there was no quarrel with Culmer about money or anything of that sort, I am quite certain—he did not refuse to lend or give me certain money that I wanted—I left Whitmore Road to go through the fire at Thorolds Road—we started in partnership in Whitmore Road; it was not dissolved exactly; it was in this way, when we started there we took in an equal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189102090074"/>
               <p>amount of money; I threw in altogether about £15; he did the same; that money was exhausted; I had no more cash; Culmer supplied what was wanted—I have been in the St. John's Road fire, Dalton Street, and Thorolds Road—in Dalton Street I was on the first floor when the fire actually burst out, and I got out of the window by a sheet and blanket fastened to the bedstead before the actual outbreak; it was all arranged before the outbreak; we got it all ready—I cannot tell what became of the sheeting and blanket; it was waving like a flag, and it went during the fire; it remained there I think when the fire was put out, on the morning certainly, but next day the sheeting had disappeared—the fire broke out about two in the Sunday morning—I returned on the Monday; the sheet had then disappeared—I had attached the sheet to the bedstead; there was a piece of blanket; it was not much—the height of the place was up to the middle of this window from the floor; not quite so high, perhaps—I should say about the height of the top of the first floor; I had to drop some little distance—Culmer was very wide awake at the time the fire broke out; he was at the back of the house; leading off the back room was a small ante-room; through that he and his wife made their escape; prior to the fire I used to sleep in the back room, and he and his wife in the front; after the fire I saw the insurance people as to the claim; I signed the receipt in Culmer's presence, in the name of F. English—the next fire was at Thorolds Road; that was the next on the list—I don't think I was any further advanced in it by that time—I represented myself as the owner of the goods in that case, and got the money paid to me, and I signed the name of Richards; I received £16 out of that—I really can't tell how many times I signed the name of Richards—I only took two names; wait a minute, the first assumed name was English, and the second was F. Richards, no more; I represented myself as a brother of Fred Culmer in Tufnell Park; I did not call myself Culmer, but Frederick Brown—I did not sign anything then except on the occasion I have mentioned; I have always gone by the name of Whitehead—until I met Culmer I had never had anything to do with fifes—I was warehouseman at Perkins and Son, Bermondsey Street—I have known Culmer twelve years; but I had lost sight of him—at the time he introduced the subject to me in October, 1889, I was working with Perkins and Son—I was in that employment eleven years; I gave up it in December, 1889, because of the St. John's Road fire; I had got a few pounds out of that; I cleared something like £20; I had a little more of my own in hand, and I thought I could enlarge on that, go into business for myself, that was why I left the employ—I went into partnership with Culmer in July, 1890—I travelled the country from the beginning of January, 1890, till about the middle, not more; I was taken ill then and I had to return, and I gave it up—I am working for myself now; I am making dentifrice—in 1889 I made jewellery; I started in the early part of 1890—I had some money of course; I bought the stock myself—I was in that line about ten days or a fortnight; I was taken ill and had to give it up—after that I went into dentifrice; I manufacture it myself.</p>

I carry on business with Mr. Peach, at 7A, Gloucester Street, City—we supplied the prisoner with goods prior to July last year, and about £400 was owing to us in July—I communi<lb/>cated with the prisoner, and he called on me on June 17th and July 8th—I told him the account was larger than it had ever been before, and I wanted to know his position—he said, "I have never been so busy as I am now, or doing so well; I have very large orders from wholesale houses, and will pay you next month the whole amount as soon as I can get the goods delivered"; that was £300 or £400—he begged me not to stop his credit, and said that he was perfectly solvent; and I lot him buy further goods to the amount of just over £90; I would not have done so if it had not been for his absolute certainty about his position.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have done business with him not quite four years, to the extent of £1,500 or £1,600—he paid all that he owed me, except for the goods he had this year—my debt in this bankruptcy is about £450—I did not write him a letter saying that I had a cheap parcel of goods; my traveller may have called on him from time to time, and done his best to sell goods—the conversation was in July, 1893, in consequence of a letter I wrote to him saying that his account was heavier than it had ever been before, and requesting him to come and answer some questions—I did not have a specially cheap parcel of goods—I heard the evidence at the Police-court, but I have given evidence to-day for the first time—I am not mixing up anything which I heard the witnesses say; I made an affidavit many months ago when I tried to make the man a bankrupt—I did not succeed, because you got Justin front of us by ten minutes—MESSRS. Pritchard and Englefield prepared the affidavit—this is it, but I am under the impression that I made another, stating the facts, I cannot be certain—I have been in communication with the trustee and the other creditors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Phillips, Politzer and Co., of 35, Queen Street, and am the trustee in this bankruptcy—on 8th July last the prisoner called on me and proposed to buy certain matgolian skins for £255 15s.—while he was negotiating for the price I was compelled to go out, and on my return I found that the skins had been sold to him on four months' credit—as he owed us £700 before that, and the goods had gone, I sent and had the cart called back, and they came into the house again—I then caused a memorandum to be written to the prisoner, requesting him to call on me—he did so, and I said that I understood he had made a further purchase in our warehouse that morning, and I found that his account was about fully as much as I cared to give him; I should like to hear from him what his position was—he said his position was perfectly sound and good—I said that he had had a lawsuit at the end of the previous year, which must have cost him a good deal of money, and that made me feel that I ought to ascertain how he stood—he said it only cost him £300 or £400, and had not</p>

               <p>interfered much with his business, in fact, he sail, "If these were goods I could obtain at public sales I should not come to you at all, as I could buy them at a public sale for cash"—I said, "If you have cash for a public sale you might find some cash for me as well"—he said, "Well, will give you some cash, say, £100, that is £70 down, and £30 at the end of the month, in July"—I then agreed to let him have the goods, and my porter brought back £60 instead of £70—I let him have the goods in consequence of his statement that his position was perfectly sound and good—I subsequently saw Mr. Rice, one of the creditors, at his office, and in consequence of a communication from him, I sent for the prisoner on 17th July, nine days afterwards, and told him there were rumours in the City that he was about to stop payment, and as he owed me a large amount he had better give me a straightforward answer whether there was any truth in the rumours or not—he replied, "There is not any truth in it whatever, I am perfectly solvent; the rumours were spread by two boys who I have discharged, and I am prepared to pay any of my accounts with an extra discount of 10 per cent. "—I asked if he had the money to do it—he said, "Yes, by sending out statements, and allowing an extra discount to my customers, I can obtain some money"—I advised him to do so, as it would put a stop to the conversation in the City, which would be apt to injure his credit—he called a private meeting of his creditors about a fortnight afterwards, July 31st—I have received proofs of debt against his estate of about £7,400, and the invoices of goods supplied to him by the creditors have come into my possession, and among them several of Messrs. Martin and Son, between 20th May and 1st July; they are of seals—my firm supplied him with 100 seals—I have an invoice here for 90 sealskins from Messrs,. Muhlberg, dated June 2nd, and two of 2nd June and 6th July, for goods supplied by Messrs. Uhlman—on 3rd June he bought 90 skins for 40s. from Mr. Muhlberg, and sold them within ten days at considerably under that price—his business was not that of sell<lb/>ing skins in the whole, but purchasing them to manufacture; he had no business to sell skins at all—the sales to Cohen were of skins in the whole—the skins which were in his business at the date of his bankruptcy realised about £1,100—he stated that they cost £2,000.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has put down £7,087 for the goods which I offered for tender—£3,787 17s. 11d. would not represent the total amount which he would have realised according to his books—I cannot tell you whether £2 8s. was the proper. price for the muff-bags, I am not a manufacturer, and his books are no guide; I did not waste my time with them, I looked at them to see—I sold the muff-bags in a lump, which he had bought at 24s. or 23s.—I employed the best men I could to do it; two or three of the members of the committee who were in the trade—the goods were submitted for tender to the largest houses, and the highest bidder got them; there was no reserve—I have had transactions with him under three years—he paid me about £700 in 1889, I do not think it was £1,000, and then I gave him a further credit of £900, and did not get my money; that is my claim—I had no conversation with him about securing my debt, I was in the Isle of Wight; my brother or partners may have done so—I may have said something to the prisoner about it being troublesome for him if he did not find security; I did not say anything about making it hot for him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 158, St. George's Road, Peckham—I am a stone carver—the numbers are even on one side of the road and odd on the other—my house is next to 156—about half-past nine on the evening of 18th August, 1889, afire occurred there—I got into the house the back way, and put it out—before that I had seen Mrs. Thornton with her daughter and a little boy leave the house—I was standing at the front door; they left a few minutes before I discovered the fire—Mrs. Thornton is the prisoner—the fire was burning in the back parlour, which they made a bedroom; it was a great blaze when I first went round—I put it out in a very short time—there was burning in several parts of the room—after the fire was extinguished I found there was no furniture upstairs, only downstairs, the parlour and bedroom—I had been in the house before—on one occasion Mrs. Thornton came home one evening and sent the boy to say her door was open, and she was afraid; would I go in and see if it was all right, and I did—I should say what was in the room was of the value of about £8 or £10; the amount of damage by the fire was about £5—the prisoner came back that night very late; there was no one with her.</p>

Peckham—I found that a fire had occurred in the back room, ground floor—I saw the assured, Mrs. Thornton; I cannot identify her—she made a statement to me—I saw on a chest of drawers the remains of a paraffin lamp—I supplied the form on which the claim was sent in; the person came to the office, and the agreement to accept a sum less than £100 was signed in my presence—I believe the money was paid; that would be in the hands of the office.</p>

I am landlord of 89, Great Dover Street, and live there—on or about 1st May, 1890, the prisoner, with another woman, came and took two rooms on the second floor—she gave the name of Mrs. Cranley—the rent was six shillings a week—she took possession about the 6th May—she was visited there by her daughter—on 10th July, 1890, I saw the prisoner leave the house about twenty-five minutes to nine in the evening—I left at twenty minutes to nine—within three minutes after I heard of the fire—I ran back, and saw the flames coming out of the second floor window—the firemen came, and the fire was put out; we threw a lot of water on before they came—the fire was in the prisoner's front room—upon looking at it afterwards the fire appeared to be most in a cupboard opposite the window; the whole of the cupboard door was burnt down, which would measure something like five feet across by eight feet high—I noticed the iron part of a lamp standing on the corner of the table and the receiver broken on the ground—the prisoner came that evening about half-past eleven—I met her at the door, thinking, of' course, that she would be very much upset; I broke it to her in the quietest manner I could—it did not seem to upset her—I said, "I am very pleased to know you are insured, as the fireman has found your policy"—she said, "I should not have been insured if it had not been for a friend of mine"—she remained at my place for a little while; we made her up a bed in the parlour, and she remained that night—on the following Tuesday she gave a week's notice, and removed on the following Thursday, about nine at night—I never saw the contents of the room before the fire.</p>

               <p>have from time to time had conversation with Culmer and Wheeler on the subject of a fires, as to the mode in which houses could be set on fire—I was in the habit of visiting 38, Ringcroft Street, which was rented by Warren Ingram; I have seen Culmer and Wheeler there, Mrs. Cap<lb/>sey and Loveday; I could not fix the number of times, but on several occasions—I understood from Mrs. Ingram that Loveday had an income—I have seen him there in the daytime on one or two occasion", also in the evening—in July, 1890, Mrs. Ingram in Culmer's presence spoke about Loveday having a fire—I was then living at New North Road, Hoxton; I heard it spoken of on two or three occasions; Mrs. Ingram spoke of it—the conversation generally took place at 38, Ringcroft Street; she said that it was Loveday's house that was to be fired—on 12th August I went to Ringcroft Street about mid-day—Mrs. Ingram, Wheeler, Mrs. Capsey were there, and Culmer; and later on they were joined by Mrs. Culmer; I was shown a telegram during the afternoon; Mrs. Ingram said, "I have received this from Loveday, and I shall do the job to-night; you see it is all right to start at ten; I shall manage to bring it off about that time"—it was so arranged that Loveday should leave early in the evening, and go to some place of amusement—she spoke about a fire in general, and of a key in particular; she said she had received a key, or that Loveday had sent the key of his house—she said that George Culmer was to do the business with her assistance; I had nothing to do with it, simply I was invited to go and see the show, simply as a spectator—about seven that, evening I started to go to Walthamstow with Mrs. Ingram, Mrs. Capsey, Mrs. Culmer, George Culmer, and Wheeler—we got there about half-past eight—we first went to a public-house called the Cock; we remained there, I daresay, about half an hour, and from there we went to Hoxton Road, the six of us all in company—I went as far as the gate—Culmer and Mrs. Ingram went into the house; Mrs. Ingram appeared to open the door by what I could see—they stayed there some forty minutes I should think—the other women were at the other end of the street—I was outside the house on the opposite side; I saw them come out together—Mrs. Ingram went ahead; Culmer went a few steps and then he joined me—Mrs. Ingram passed me without speaking—Culmer said, "It's all right, it will be off in about five minutes"—we walked up and down, and I should say in about five minutes the fire broke out—I saw the flames come through the front and the back on the top floor; it burnt very furiously for about a half hour, or rather more—the usual scene followed; people rushed in and tried to get things from the bottom of the house, and succeeded in saving many things—eventually the local brigade arrived and assisted to pit the fire out—I stayed there until it was nearly out, about three-quarters of an hour after the out<lb/>break; it was then practically extinguished—the women disappeared—I did not see them again that night at Walthamstow—Culmer and I went to 13, Whitmore Road—later that night I saw Mrs. Capsey and Mrs. Culmer there—prior to the fire, on the day of the telegram, Mrs. Ingram had explained to me that there was some difficulty in getting Loveday to settle the date of the fire, and she was very glad it was finally arranged.</p>

               <p>two in the afternoon, I was with Inspector Dinney in Park Street, Holloway, and saw the prisoner; I told him I was a police officer, and held a warrant for his arrest, for being concerned with several others in conspiracy and fraud for obtaining money from various fire offices—he said, "Yes, right; I had a fire at Walthamstow, in the name of Taylor; I got into it, I must get out of it"—I conveyed him to Hoxton Police-station, where he was detained till eleven at night; I was then about to convey him in a cab to Southwark Police-station—he said, "How many of the others have you got? Have you arrested the one who informed against us?"—at Southwark station he was charged; he made no reply—I searched him there, and found this book on him, containing the names of Mrs. Ingram and George Culmer, and there are some figures opposite Culmer's name, "£2 10s. 7d.," and "piano £6"—on 10th November I went to 97, Northcote Road—I examined the front bedroom, first floor, carefully; on the right-hand side going into the room I saw a heap of rags; I examined them; they were partly burnt, and smelt very much of paraffin—I have some of them here—the bedroom door was very much burnt—on the landing there was about half a bushel of rags, saturated very much with paraffin—they were about a yard and a half from the other rags, quite unconnected with each other; both had been on fire—the back bedroom door on the same landing was also very much burnt—on searching the room I found on the table this burner of a lamp, it is a new one, only used once or twice, there was no wick to it—the curtains of both rooms were very much burnt, and some dresses—the table, where the lamp was found, was not burnt at all, and there was no paraffin there or on the floor; about a yard away, on the floor, there was a lot of paraffin; that was almost connected with the heap in the front bedroom—I saw a wardrobe with two dresses in it partly burnt, they were about three yards from the heap on the other side of the room—the cupboard of the wardrobe was not scorched at all—there was a night-commode standing against the wall; that was burnt almost to a cinder, but the wall and the floor beneath it was not scorched—Mr. Dinney made a note of the other things there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was four days after the arrest that I went there; I knew the salvage man was in—he said nothing about the rags before I went there; I pointed them out to him; he said, "I never make examina<lb/>tion; that is your business, not mine"—he is put in to see that nothing is removed—the rags were ordinary rags, such as you could buy at a marine store dealer's, two heaps of about half a bushel each—they would be obvious to any business eye; I should think any person would notice them—there was no one in the house but Ansell; I took a note of what the prisoner said when I arrested him—he gave the correct address, 97, Northcote Road—I do not know that Taylor is the name of his step-father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assessor to the County Fire Office—I was employed by that office to make inquiries with regard to this claim made in reference to a fire that occurred at 7 Blenheim Cottages—I went to the premises the day following the fire; I saw it had been a very severe fire; the house contained seven rooms, and it was very severely damaged—I found subsequently that three of the rooms were unfurnished; there was furniture in four of them 4—I saw the prisoner at my office at Kennington—I inquired the origin of the fire—he told me he was away from the premises; that his wife was the last person to leave, she left about two hours before the outbreak—I inquired if he could throw any light on the origin of the fire, and he replied that two lamps were left burning on the premises, one in the back parlour, which was used as a bedroom, and the other in the kitchen, and he suggested that one of those lamps was the cause—this claim which I had before me was for £167 9s. in respect of that fire, for furniture, wearing apparel, and household effects—there are a great number of items—I agreed the amount of loss with him at £133 12s.—the head office afterwards, on my advice, negotiated the surrender of the policy with him—I went to the premises a second time when the statement of loss had reached me—I saw the remains of a lamp there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I hardly came to the conclusion, after inspecting the salvage, that the loss occasioned by the fire was £133 12s.; the fire was of so severe a character that I had to take much of it for granted; one makes every possible inquiry—the payment of the money was withheld for some days, because I was informed he had had another fire in Plevna Road—afterwards the money was paid as the best means to settle the thing—that is the usual case—I made the best settlement I could; I was not authorised to refuse entirely—I report all circumstances that come to my knowledge to the office; I reported all in this case, and yet the office paid; I told them I could give no tangible evidence—I have had twenty years' experience in examining and making assessments—I sometimes see a summary of Captain Shaw's returns in the newspapers—there are be<lb/>tween 2,000 and 3,000 fires a year in London—I do not know if between 300 and 400 of those are caused by the explosion of paraffin lamps—when I went into the premises the day after the fire it was dark, and I could not see very well—after I received a statement of the loss I made a minute examination—I did not examine the remains of the lamp—the statement about the explosion may be perfectly true—all a company contract to do under a policy is to indemnify the assured for the loss sustained, and therefore if a chair worth £3 is burnt to the extent of 25s. we pay 25s.—sometimes the chair would be replaced; buildings are frequently reinstated; but it is very unfrequently done with regard to furniture and wearing apparel—I saw whatever remained—I saw the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The office would not send anyone to see Capsey's things before the policy for £150 was issued, it would not be worth while, un<lb/>less circumstances roused suspicion—in a great measure there is no means of testing a claim after a fierce fire; any metal things would be left—I did not hear from the prisoner that he had had another fire, but I found on inquiry it was his brother's, not his—I have no recollection of his telling me his occupation.</p>

I know Mrs. and Mr. Ingram, also Mrs. Wheeler: they used to visit me at 6, Hazelwood Road; they did not live with me there, but they lived with me for some time at Nassau Road"—I said, "You will be further charged with wilfully and maliciously setting fire to 7, Church Crescent, Hackney, and other dwelling-houses"—ho made no reply—he was taken to Southwark Police-station and charged; he made no reply—I mentioned the names of Mr. and Mrs. Ingram to him, but I can only find the name of Culmer in this warrant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last fire in the indictment was in October, 1889—I arrested him outside the house—I am positive ho said, "They were all right," after saying, "I have had two fires"—I did not put any question to him before he said that.</p>

About 8 o'clock p.m., on 21st November, I arrested the prisoner on a warrant in the Caledonian Road—I read the warrant to him; it was for conspiracy and defrauding insurance companies—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took him to Whitehall Place—I said, "You will be further charged with being concerned with George Culmer and others, in wilfully and maliciously setting fire to a dwelling-house at 34, Arkley Road, Walthamstow, and other dwelling-houses"—he said, "I have lived at 34, Arkley Road, but I am innocent of any conspiracy"—I showed him the proposal form and the claim in respect of the house in Arkley Road—he said, "Yes, that is my hand writing. I wrote out the claim; I did not write the proposal, and I know nothing about it"—there was other conversation, not relating to this matter—he gave the address 31, St. James' Road.</p>

Ingram, District Post Office, Essex Road, London, England—it professes to have been posted in Melbourne—he said, "I got it from my wife," she has warrants out against her for being concerned in several of these fires; Mrs. Wheeler, her mother, was convicted a few days ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired schoolmaster, of 6, Elm Road, Stratford—on 23rd January I came to Stratford Town Hall to hear an address by Sir Charles Russell, and shortly after joining the crowd, people gathered round me, and as I got to the first step the crowd pressed me a good deal, and I found Hunt holding me close; I turned round and saw his face, and said, "What are you holding me in that way for?"—he said, "Oh, I want you"—I wrested myself free, and got into the crowd—I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse containing about £10—I told a policeman, who told me go to the station; I did so, and saw the two prisoners there, and I recognised Hunt—I have no doubt about him.</p>

I live at 113, Leytonstone Road, Stratford—about half-past seven on 23rd January I got to the Town Hall, Stratford, to attend a political meeting—a number of people were outside, I had great difficulty in getting in; I was hustled and pushed about a great deal—I had in my right-hand trousers pocket a purse containing two £5 notes, a half-sovereign, one shilling of the new issue, and I believe two sixpences—I lost my purse that night—this is it, I did not have it in my hand at the Police-court—I have had it about eight years—about two years ago I altered it, as it used to open in my pocket, and now one of the frames stands above the other—I no doubt lost it getting into the hall, but I did not miss it till next morning—I was up all night with a sick grandchild, and the first intimation I had of the loss was finding my pocket broken down—I went to the Police-station about it next day; I saw my purse there some time afterwards.</p>

On 23rd January, about half-past seven, I was outside the Town Hall, watching a crowd going into a meeting—I watched the prisoner, and saw him putting his hands round persons' trousers and waistcoat pockets from behind—he entered the Town Hall, and went right through the passage, and came out of the side door where people get in by ticket, pushing himself in a very suspicious manner among people who were trying to enter—the meeting was upstairs; he did not go upstairs—he came out of the side door and round to the main entrance again, and I saw a man not present strike an old gentleman on the hat, and I saw the prisoner immediately put his hand round and snatch his hand away—then he forced himself into the building again—I got on to a fence, and saw him making his way up the stairs—I went in at the side entrance, and saw him and the other man rushing down the stairs into the side lobby again; they were only up there a few minutes—I saw him when at the bottom, of the stain put his hand into his right-hand pocket as if putting something in—he was making for the back way again when I and Bradford caught hold of him and the other man—we were in plain clothes—I said, "I am a police officer, and I don't like your movements here"; and I said I should take them to the station as suspected persons; the prisoner made no reply—at the station I found he was wearing this chain with a box lid at the end—in his trousers pockets I found 10s. gold, 1s. 6d. silver, and 2d.—I was about to search his breast pocket when he snatched this purse out and said, "There is nothing in that; it is an empty purse"—I laid it down on the inspector's desk, and it was opened by the inspector—he made no reply to the charge—I also found on him this book, which he termed his diary—it is an almanac, from the Blind Beggar public-house, Whitechapel Road—I was not there when Baker came to the station—I was there when he identified the purse after the prisoner was committed for trial—I have had it in my possession ever since—the name of the other man who was with him all through this is Smith.</p>

I'll kill you"—then I struck him on the nose—he turned to Elliott, who was stooping to pick up my cap which the prisoner had knocked off, and struck him twice—he struck him on the mouth—another man was squaring up to me—they spoke to each other, and ran away, singing out, "When we get you outside we will kill you"—I went on board my ship—Elliott gave information to the police.</p>

On 1st January I went, with the other witnesses, to Hitchin, and concealed myself, and waited for the train to come in—I saw a horse-box attached to the train—I saw Burdett come out of the railway station—Smith detained him, Hearn took hold of him, and then I came up—he said, "What is this for?"—I said, "You will be charged with stealing those two horses from Chingford "—he said, "Why don't you go after that other man?"—I did not see any other man; he was by himself when I arrived—we took him into Hitchin railway station, where Hearn asked him his name—he said, "I refuse to tell you"—I searched, and found this padlock key in his right-hand trousers pocket—I said, "What is this the key of?"—he said, "I refuse to tell you "—I also found a small pocket-book in his coat pocket, in it was written, "Prince Albert, Prince of Wales, Chingford Hatch, Essex;" the page was folded down—that afternoon I went with other officers to 8, Globe Street—Burdett had not given me that address, and I had no sus<lb/>picion he had anything to do with it, but I had received in<lb/>formation—we found there in a stable at the back of the house two ponies, one of them had been clipped and recently docked—you have to take horses through the house to the stable—Saunders came out of the smoke-hole, it is a place where haddocks and herrings are cured—I asked his name, he said "Saunders,"—I said, "You answer the description of a man who was seen taking two horses to King's Cross Station this morning, and I shall arrest you on suspicion for being concerned with Charles Burdett in stealing those horses "—he became very much agitated, and said, "I was not at King's Cross "—Prince came in just after that, and pointed Saunders out as the man he had seen with the horses that morning; he said so—after that I went to 18, Boundary Street, the address Burdett had given; he lives there—I there found in a chest of drawers in the back parlour five head collar ropes and three new halters, which appear to be the same as these others—that evening I went to Hitchin with Mr. Young, and I was with him when he saw the horses—on the afternoon of 2nd January I went with another officer to the Butlers' Arms, Butler Street, Bethnal Green—I had not received information from Burdett as to his occupying a stable there—It is a low part of London—I went into the yard at the back of the public-house—I found this key opened the padlock of the second stable on the right in</p>

               <p>the yard—I went in; the stable was very filthy; there was a great deal of recent horse-dung there, no straw—the state the horses were in when they were taken to Hitchin was consistent with them having been some time in this stable—the long hair on their legs was matted with it, pretty well up to their knees—no horse was in the stable, only manure and A horse-cloth—I saw the landlord, John Foxhall—I was present when the prisoners were charged with stealing two horses, the property of Mr. Young, and with receiving them—they made no reply.</p>

I am sergeant of the dock police at the Royal Victoria Docks—on 12th January, about twenty minutes past seven, I was on duty, and my attention was drawn to Creagh and Jeffers by one of Pickford's vans—I went up to it and saw the prisoner, who told me a case had fallen off the van—I said, "What is the matter?"—the prisoner said, "It is all right, Mr. Kitching; it is me; a case has fallen off my van into the road, broken open, and a quantity of the kidneys shook out; I took this cloth off one of the sheep, tied it up at the bottom, and put the kidneys in"—I examined all the cases, and found them all securely</p>

I am a widow, and live at 4, Turner's Retreat, Ber<lb/>mondsey—I have children living with me, one named James—I have known the prisoner three months; it may have been a little more—on Boxing Day I was out drinking with him—I went home about 7 o'clock with Mrs. Kirby, leaving the prisoner outside the Cow public-house—we went upstairs, and about 9 I went down and found the prisoner there asleep—I woke him up and asked if he would have a bit of supper before he went home—he made no answer—I went to the cupboard and got a knife to cut a piece of meat on the table—he took the knife into his hand and made some remark about my being out—I gave him a saucy answer, and he made a hit at me with the knife in his hand—I put up my shoulder, and as I shoved the knife I felt it get in my throat—he was sitting in a chair at the time; he got off the chair and made the hit; he was behind me—I called up to Mrs. Kirby, and she came down, and I went to the hospital with her—I was there three weeks—I left the prisoner in the room; he was very drunk—I had been in the Cow with him that evening; there was no wrangling there, only the drop of drink made him disagreeable; nothing out of the way—we were disagreeable with each other.</p>
