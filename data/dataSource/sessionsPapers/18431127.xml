                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Benjamin Foreman, and keep some refreshment rooms at No. 138, Holborn Bars. On the 22nd of Nov., shortly after eight o'clock, the prisoner and another came into our place, and had some refreshment—they bespoke a bed for the night, and mentioned the names of my friends, to induce us to take them in—they went up to bed between half-past nine and ten, on the upper floor—my room and the ser<lb/>vant's are also on the same floor—when I went to bed, at twenty minutes after eleven, I found one of my drawers had been forced open, and missed from it a half-crown and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no more money in the drawer—I afterwards saw a half-crown taken from the prisoner's hands by the police<lb/>man, and am sure it was the one I had lost, because it was new, and was marked on the edge—eight persons besides the prisoner slept in the house that night—I had more valuable things in the drawer—there was a small jewel<lb/>box, which was not opened, and clothes—I valued the half-crown because it was given me—I cannot swear to the shilling—I can swear decidedly to the half-crown—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live at 4, Dunning's-place, Dunning's-alley. On the 8th of Nov., in consequence of what my son said to me, I went home and found a pair of my trowsers on the ground, which I had left on a chair—I missed from the pocket two pencil cases, a brass chain, and silver thimble—I missed two candlesticks, one from the table and one from the cupboard, the snuffers and tray from the table, and two brass pins from the mantle-piece—I went with Griffith to 2, Dunning place, and saw him pick up under the stairs two pencil cases, and a brass chain and pin, which were my property—these are the articles—there are three rooms in our house—I occupy two, and a woman underneath occupies one—I have the rooms to myself—there is a street-door to the house open to both parties.</p>

That does not state that I asked him to give me what he had given me before—I was never asked the question, nor about going to have half-and-half at the public-house—I have never been a witness before—I was never found out before—I went before the Magistrate for the purposes of justice, not to, get myself out of the scrape—I cannot say how much I have stolen from my father within this last six months—I am single—after leaving my father I got my living by working for him—I worked for Mr. Brown, an undertaker, in the Edgware-road—I had so much a job, sometimes about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a-week—my father did not know I even got that—there is a back room to the prisoner's shop—I had not endeavoured to persuade his wife to buy these things before he came home—I swear that—I had not offered them to her—she did not ask me where I got them from, or whose they were, nor did I say that night to her or the prisoner that they were my own, what I had in my business, and for which I had no longer any use—I think I took three pairs of hinges, but only two were found—I forgot the third pair—I have been a carpenter, and in the course of that time have used hinges and screws—the prisoner knew I had been a carpenter—we once worked on the same job, and my father also—he was a bricklayer at that time—I do not know how long the prisoner has had this shop, I think from July to November.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under butler, at 25, Hyde Park-gardens. On the 9th of Nov. I had been to Drury-lane, and on my way home met the prisoner in John-street, Edgware-road—we walked up several streets till we got to Burn-street, Edgware-road—we went up an entry there, and were there to<lb/>gether some time—the prisoner said, "If you will wait a minute I will be back again"—I remained there about two minutes—she did not return—I missed my watch, chain, seal, and key—I was sober—I heard a door next to where I was standing, shut too—I called a policeman—he opened the door, went up stairs, and the prisoner came to the room-door when he knocked—I said, "I will swear that is the woman that stole my watch"—she said, "I have done no such thing, I have not seen it"—I went down to the door and waited, and the policeman called out, "It is all right, I have found the watch"—I did not see it found—she was taken to the station.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 11th of Nov., about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the shop of Mr. Wright, cheesemonger, Tottenham-court-road, on the bacon side of the shop, and had half-a-sovereign in a piece of paper, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two half-pence in my pocket—there was a great crowd in the shop—while I was at the counter a boy came to me, and from what he said I felt in my pocket, and missed all my money except 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the boy went out, and fetched the prisoner in—I said I had lost half-a-sovereign—he said he had not been in the shop, and afterwards said he came in to look for his sister, and he had a half-sove<lb/>reign which he could well account for—the constable was there—only a shil<lb/>ling, two penny pieces, and a few half-pence were found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tottenham-place, and work for Mr. Wright. On Saturday, the 11th of Nov., I saw Mr. Catchpole come into he shop—the prisoner followed her in—I had seen him and another before, outside, keep quite close to the ladies, who looked at things in the window—at one time he came very close to them, which made me suspect him—when he came into the shop I watched him, saw him go quite close to Mr. Catchpole, and lift up her gown—she turned her head, and he dropped the gown—he took it up again, put his right hand into her pocket, held it up with his left hand—he let her dress fall—I turned my head to a customer, turned again, and saw him walking out very quickly—I went and asked if the prosecutrix had lost any<lb/>thing, ran out immediately, and brought the prisoner back—he had two com<lb/>panions—one of them whistled, and the prisoner said, "Why the <hi rend="italic">deuce</hi> don't he come?"—I gave the prisoner in charge for picking a lady's pocket of half-a-sovereign—he was taken into the shop, and the prosecutrix said, "I have lost half-a-sovereign"—he said he had half-a-sovereign of his own, which he could well account for—I did not hear him say he had any other money—he said nothing about halfpence—he put his hand into his pocket, drew it out, and said, "There is all the money I have"—I did not see what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Bond and Co., No. 8, Finsbury-place South. William Dimsdale Child is one of the partners—we had books in the warehouse belonging to the firm of Whitmore and Wells—previous to the 15th of Nov. I observed the internal part of three of those books cut out, and made a communication to my employer—on Wednesday, the 15th, there were others of those books in the warehouse—the warehouse door was kept open during the day—about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening I was in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the warehouse, which is on the ground floor—I went up towards it, and heard persons talking; and as I was on the top stair of the kitchen, a man rushed past me towards the street door, and escaped—I had fastened and chained the street door about half an hour before, when my employer left—I got a cutlass, and sent my wife for a policeman, who came, and he and I entered the lower warehouse together—we found the prisoner standing, I think, on the second stair of the warehouse, and on the third stair were these two ledgers, which I am certain had previously been in the ware-house—I gave him into custody—I had not fastened the warehouse—next morning I saw some footmarks in the yard—a person, by getting into the yard, could get into the warehouse, by the back door, which is always left open during the day—he would have to get over a wall nine feet high to get into the yard—the wall leads to West-street, Finsbury-circus—there are four rooms—these books were kept in the third room—there is a door, which was open—he would not have to go through any door to get at them after entering the back door.</p>

The flap was partly across the pavement and partly across the opening—it was lifted partly off—it was fastened underneath with a chain—I saw him come right up out of the cellar, he bent his body double, gave a whistle, and ran un<lb/>derneath the wall—I suppose he bent his body to hide himself from me—I then saw a man who was standing in a dark corner nearly opposite, and he ran with him—I followed, sprang my rattle, and never lost sight of the pri<lb/>soner till he was stopped in Commercial-road by Baxter, between 200 and 800 yards from the house, Smith came up and took him in charge—I had walked over the cellar flap a quarter of an hour before, and it was secure as it ought to be—I afterwards went to the station, and got the prisoner's boots, took them to the cellar, and under the flap was a little dampish dirt, which had got through the cracks of the flap, a couple of inches thick—I found foot<lb/>marks in it corresponding with the right boot exactly, and there was a mark where the left foot had stepped, which corresponded with the left boot at the toe—it was only made by the toe—I found some lucifer matches in his waist<lb/>coat pocket.</p>

On the 24th of Nov., between two o'clock and half-past in the morning, I was in Park-lane, perfectly sober, and, near Grosvenor-street, I saw the prisoners before me—when I got within about fifteen yards of them they both parted, allowing me to go between them, one on one side the path, and the other by the curb—when I got about a foot in advance of them, I received a blow on the right side of my head—I cannot tell which of them was on my right—I staggered and fell, and, while falling, cried out, "Murder"—they both instantly ran off—it was very light; there is the reflection of six lamps from the park lodge, besides the usual lamps—while on the ground, two per<lb/>sons, and, I think, three, came up to me, as if they came out of the shade of the railings; thinking them of the same party, I called, "Murder," which kept them back—a policeman came up in about two minutes, and raised me from the ground—Utting, a policeman, directly brought the prisoners to me—three minutes could not have elapsed from my receiving the blow and his bringing the prisoners to me—I knew them directly to be the men I had</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, in the parish of St. James, Clerk<lb/>enwell—it is my dwelling-house. On Saturday night, the 15th of Oct., I went to bed about one o'clock—I was the last person up—the premises were all safe—I saw that the back parlour window was shut in the ordinary way—about twenty minutes after one I heard a noise below, but did not go down at first, thinking it might be the cat—I heard it frequently—I slept on the second floor—I ultimately came down about an hour after I had gone to bed—I came into the passage—I could then see into the shop—I saw a light there—I had left no light there—I saw the two prisoners in the shop—Caylor had a candle in his hand, and Harvey was standing at his side by the window, at a glass case, which was open, and which contained watches, rings, and plate—they had their backs to me, and did not see me—I walked into the shop, went up to them, and said, "Hallo, thieves!"—upon that they turned round, and I saw them both very distinctly—the light almost immediately went out—I was on the side of the counter on which customers stand—Harvey was on the other side, and he ran on the opposite side to where I was, made his way into the parlour, which is on the same floor, and was gone—he did nothing to me—Caylor was going in the same direction, but on the side of the counter on which I was—I put ray arms out and stopped him—he caught hold of ray throat with his hands, and said, "D—n you, let me go, or I will knock your b—y life out"—I only had on my stockings, trowsers, and slippers—I held him as well as I could, but he threw me down—I still held him, and we rolled over—we both got up again—I was obliged to let go of him while I got up, but as soon as I got up I was on him again—we again struggled, and I was again thrown down—he kicked my leg, and bit mo just under my ear—I bled very much, more from the throat, from his nails, than any when else, and I was very much bruised and cut about the face—we struggled for a long time—at last he succeeded in getting to the baek parlour window, which was open—he threw me down, and, while I was getting up, he was getting out of the win<lb/>window—as he was on his hands and knees doing so, I caught hold of his leg, which caused him to fall back—he seemed to support himself somehow with his legs across the window-cill, and I, being very much exhausted from the severe bruises I had had previously, could not hold him well with both legs, so I held him by one, and with the other he kicked me in the face, chest, and about the head, a good many times, till at last I fell on the parlour carpet, and he fell on the stones in the yard—as soon as I could recover, I jumped out, pursued him, and got hold of him again in the yard—we then struggled again, and he threw me two or three times—he ultimately got on the dust-hole, which is about three feet and a half high, and has a tree by the side of it—I caught hold of him by one leg, and with the other he kicked me, about the head and body till I fell—his legs wen then released from my grasp—he got upon the wash-house, and then on the kitchen—at that moment a policeman came, and shortly after he was taken—there is a water-butt in the next yard—both the prisoners had hats on when I came into the shop—a piece of candle, and some lucifer-matches were afterwards found in the shop—I saw</p>

I fastened up my shop-door and all my premises—it is my dwelling-house—I put the key of the shop in my pocket, and went to bed—next morning William Donoghue, my foreman, came to my bed-room for the keys—I gave them to him—in a minute or two after he returned, and made some communication—I went down, and found that my shop had been broken open—an entry bad been made at the shop-door—there were marks of violence on it—I missed from three shelves, some cloths, kerseymeres, and doeskins, which had been placed there the previous night, and two rolls of brown beaver and olive cloth from the counter, about seventy yards altogether, which were safe when I went to bed the night before—the lock of the shop<lb/>door had been wrenched off, the shutter wrenched from its fastening, the screw gone, and a square of glass taken out—the door was to, and appeared as usual outside, but was only on the latch—in my judgment the breaking was decidedly from the outside—a portion of the beading beneath the shutter was broken away, and the part injured was daubed with mud—I saw some spots of tallow near the lower bolt on the floor—my desk, which was a fixture on the counter, was broken open, but I missed nothing from it—there were papers in it, and I saw spots of tallow on them—the value of all the property lost was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>Finsbury-market—I saw the elder male prisoner in the shop, it was a tailor's shop—he was asked where he got the cloths from, that he had sent to be pledged at Mr. Attenborough's—he said he had bought them by patterns of a man named Hodges, I understood, but am not confident, and something was said by him about taking us to the man—in about twenty minutes or half an hour young Bradshaw came down stairs, on being asked for—before he came the elder Bradshaw had repeated the same thing, that he had bought them, I do not know that he mentioned Hodges again—he said that patterns had been brought to him, and he bought them by those patterns—I think nothing was said in young Brad<lb/>shaw's presence about these cloths—they were taken into custody, and taken to the station—the elder Bradshaw asked if any body owned the cloths—I said "I believe I do"—I swear positively to all these produced by Pawley being my master's property, and part of what was missing, except the piece of black which has been cut—we missed black of exactly such quality, appearance and dye—here are two pieces produced by Wentworth which are my master's, and part of what were missing—here are two yards and five-eights of list produced by Beaumont, which I believe to have been cut from the beaver, one of the six pieces I have spoken of—it corresponds in quantity as near as can be—there is about a trowser's length gone from one or two of the pieces—these small pieces of cloth produced by Dewer correspond exactly with some of the missing cloth, and also with some of those pieces which are produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Richard Bloxam, who lives at No. 40, Cadogan-place. It is his dwelling-house. On Saturday, the 11th of Nov., I took the plate in a basket up stairs into the dining-room be<lb/>tween live and six o'clock, I put what had not been used into a basket, and took it down into the pantry between seven and eight o'clock, and about eight there was a knock at the front door in Cadogan-place—I answered the knock, and found a person there who asked for a Captain Atkins, who has been dead some time—the man went away on my answering the question—in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes there was another knock—I was in the kitchen at the time—there was a light in the pantry—it was rather a loud knock, and could be heard through the house—I went into the area, and an<lb/>swered the person, and found a man there who said he had a message for me—I went part of the way up the area steps—he then said I was not the person—I believe it was the prisoner Manning—he hnd a dark coat on, and a cap—he said it was a dark young man he wanted to see—I told him to go to No. 42, I thought there was a dark young man there—Eliza Simpson was in the kitchen at the time the knock came—I did not see her while I was talking to</p>

               <p>Manning—the kitchen looks out into the area—the pantry is at the back of the house, and the kitchen in front—you get into an open yard at the back of the house, through a back door, and then there is a washhouse at the end of the yard—there is a wall dividing the yard from Cadogan-mews—there is a door in the wall, which is kept locked and bolted inside—I had locked and bolted the door the day before, and taken the key into the drawing-room—I sleep in the pantry—I did not miss the plate till next morning—there were twenty forks, twenty spoons, and two sauce ladles all silver, worth upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went into the back yard leading to the mews, and found the door in the wall was pulled to—the bolts had been drawn, and the door unlocked—I ob<lb/>served foot marks near the door, in the inside—they appeared to have been made over-night—they were about two feet from the door, such as might be made by a man dropping from the wall, which is about eight and a half feet high outside, and about ten feet inside, the ground being lower—on the next night, Sunday, Manning was brought to the house in custody—I thought he was the person who had come on Saturday night.</p>

We have only been there eight weeks, and do not keep the house—the prisoner lodged upstairs in the same house, with his parents—on Monday, the 13th of Nov., between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I took a sovereign out of my bottom drawer—there were fourteen besides—eight were wrapped up sepa<lb/>rately in dirty yellow paper, an old almanack—it was in a pocket-book in a drawer—while in the act of counting it, I saw the prisoner looking in at the door—I cannot say whether he saw me counting it—I locked the drawer, and put the key into the small drawer—the eight sovereigns remained in the paper—I went to the drawer again on Tuesday, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, to pay my rent, and missed the eight sovereigns—I did not see the prisoner that day—he left home on Monday night—I saw him run out at the door—he did not come home that night—he always used to come home—this was the first time he missed, that I know of—I did not see him again till Wednesday night—I saw no more of my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged with the prisoner's wife. I understood he was in the Union workhouse—he came home on the Saturday afternoon before this happened, and was sitting at tea with his wife and children when I came home in the evening—I went out about nine o'clock on Monday morning, and re<lb/>turned about seven in the evening—the prisoner then had his two children—the boy Henry was across his lap, and the little one between his knees—he was sighing for about a quarter of an hour, and then he asked if I could lend him a penknife to mend a pen—I told him I could lend him one, but I was fearful my son had spoiled it, but as it was I would lend it, and I gave it him—he opened it, looked at the blades, and said they were very dull, but he would sharpen it—there were two blades—he shut the knife, and put it into his pocket—he used to behave particularly kind to his children—his wife came in shortly after—he said to her, "Ann, this child will not trouble you long," meaning Henry—he spoke of that child—she said she had thought so a long time—the child had been consumptive for a long time—it was about six years old—he asked her if she would give him a stone to sharpen the knife upon—I believe his eldest son gave him the stone—I saw him sharpen the knife upon the stone—he afterwards went and laid across the bed, while his wife and children had their supper—they had sausages—there were some put away for the prisoner, but he did not have any—they went to bed, I think, about ten o'clock—I slept in the same room that night—somewhere about twelve o'clock I heard the child Henry cry very loud—the prisoner's wife said, "Michael, what are you doing to the child?" and she said, "My God, he has killed my child!"—I did not hear the prisoner speak, there was such confusion in the room from the wife and children screaming—the wife said the child was stabbed, and, before I could call the police, the prisoner began to cut his own throat—his wife screamed out that he was cutting his own throat—I went and called for the police—I afterwards looked at the child, and saw blood on its shirt, but did not take particular notice of the wounds—I did not see the knife again till I saw it in the policeman's hand at the hospital—the prisoner had asked me on the Sunday if I bad such a thing as a penknife to lend him—I told him I had—I did not lend it him on that Sunday.</p>

On Friday, 24th of Nov., I had two pieces of cheese on a board outside my shop window, with a ticket on them—I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I had placed it there, and saw it within twenty minutes after at a house in White Bear-gardens, where I went with the policeman.</p>

I was in my father's shop, and saw the prisoners waiting outside Mr. Hellen's shop, which is nearly opposite—I watched them, and saw them speak to each other—Smith put his hand on the cheese, as if going to take it—I had occasion to turn round to speak to a person in the shop, and when I turned round again they were running away, and the cheese was gone—Smith had on an apron, which he held up, and it had a bulk in it—I told my brother which way they had run, and he ran after them—I am sure the prisoners are the persons—I knew them well before by sight.</p>

I was at my window about one o'clock in the day, and saw the prisoner Cundick take a sack containing oats and beans mixed, a nose<lb/>bag with oats, beans, and chaff, and a bag containing oats, beans, and chaff from the wagon of Mr. Matthews, and cross the road with them to his own</p>

               <p>stable—the prisoner Slaughter was at the wagon when he did it—I went over, and told Cundick he had done wrong in buying the corn of that man, which was not his own—he said he was not aware that he had done any thing wrong, and was sorry for it—I told him not to touch it till I fetched Slaughter across to the stable—I told Slaughter he had done wrong in selling his horses' provender—he said he was heartily sorry for it, and hoped I would look over it—I told him to carry the sack back to his wagon, which he did—they were taken to the station—Slaughter there said he had found the sack containing three quar<lb/>ters of a bushel of oats and beans as he was coming through Stratford—I sent my brother officer back to Cundick's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Ann Matthews, of East Ham. Slaughter was our carman—on Saturday the 18th, he was sent from Smith<lb/>field-market with three horses to get a load of manure, for which he had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was allowed a nose-bag of corn and chaff for each horse, and a sack containing about four bushels of mixed corn and chaff—he was not allowed to barter it for dung, and save the money—in case the horses did not eat all, he should have brought it back with him, and it would be given to the horses in the stable—I saw the mixture at the station—it was the same quality which he had—the sack he had the mixed provision in belonged to my mother—the other sack was marked "S. Hammond, Upminster," to whom it belonged, but the provisions it contained was ours, and had been given out the night previous by the foreman—I have brought a sample from the granary, and compared it with what is produced—it is the same pro<lb/>portion of mixture and the same articles—they are white Irish oats, termed Irish birds—the beans are split, and there is a small lump of clay in them.</p>

I told him to keep it on; when we got to the Constitution, he pulled it off, gave it me, and told me to pawn it; he took out his pocket-book, and I went and pawned the coat, brought back the money and duplicate, and put it on the table before him; he pushed it away, and the money was spent in drink, and I went home; in the afternoon Ciscell came and asked me for the duplicate, and said I was a pretty fellow not to give him any of the money. I gave him the duplicate, and went with him to the prosecutor; he pulled off his waistcoat to pawn, and the witnesses had part of the money; after that they talked about giving me in charge, and we were going to make up the money among us, as a good many had part of the drink, to get the coat out again.</p>

On Thursday, the 26th of Oct., he told me to take a package of goods from the West India Docks—the prisoner was standing by the cart at the time, and his brother was there—by directions of Conyngham, I took the package of goods to Cornhill—when I got to No. 16, Cornhill, I found in the lower part of the house the business of a tailor carried on by Challis and Co.—I went into the shop first—they told us to put it in the passage—I put it in the passage—the pri<lb/>soner's brother assisted me—the prisoner was sitting in the cart—the package was placed in the passage of the private door—Pickiss, the lad, showed us where to put it in the passage—I did not go in to get the bill receipted, the prisoner's brother did, and I went in behind him—he went into the shop with the delivery paper—I had it from him before he came out—I saw the paper signed—I then went on to Princes-street, with the prisoner and his brother they left me there, and said, "Good night"—I never saw them again till the prisoner was taken.</p>

On the 3rd of Nov. the prisoner came for a bag of biscuits that had been left in the morning by mistake—we had none—after he was gone I missed a walking-stick and umbrella from the hall—no one else had been there between the time of my seeing them safe and missing them—I went down stairs to inquire about the biscuits—the umbrella was my master's—the stick belonged to Mr. M'Nish, a friend of my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was warehouseman to John and James Baylis and Co., in Gutter-lane, in Feb.—I had been with them since the 7th of Jan., and left in June—they were in the habit of receiving crapes in an unfinished state from Mr. Hardisty, by the Great Western Railway, twice a week—they came in a box, which was returned—this invoice arrived by the post on Saturday, the 18th—the box it referred to never came to hand—I never remember, during the course of business from January to June, any instance of any goods not coming according to the invoice, or any loss, with this exception—Baylis and Co. never disposed of any articles in this state—I have looked at all the marks on this invoice, with reference to the marks on these goods, and they correspond.</p>

I attended the first examina<lb/>tion of the prisoner—he made a statement, which I took down and read over to him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Seven weeks ago last Sunday the crape was sent to me tied up in a parcel; it was directed to me at No. 3, Lambeth-square. The man rang the bell; I went and answered it; he asked me if there was a man named Rowland lived there; I said, 'Yes, I am the person, what have you got there?' he said 'There is a parcel for you.' I asked where it came from; he shut the door, and walked away. I did not know who the crape belonged to; I never saw the man before or since. I took the crape up stairs, put it into my box, and turned the key on it. I went to my situation on the Monday morning, and have not seen the crape since till now."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the employ of Matthew Cotes Wyatt, builder, Dudley-road, Paddington. On the 22nd of Nov., about seven o'clock in the morning, I was in South-crescent, watching some houses for him—I saw the prisoners with some others—they filled a bag with some chips and some bricks of wood out of an area in Southwark-crescent—I did not see them go down into that area—the prisoner went up Radnor-street with the bag—I followed and asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I said he had got some property of my master's, and he had better go back to him—there were two others with him, who ran away—he went on to Star-street—he stood a few minutes, and then threw down the bag, and ran—I ran after him, and the inhabitants went and shook the wood and chips out of the bag—they took out the pieces of quartering, and said, "Thank God, there is the principal part gone"—there were a great many people about, and they ran away with the bag—I picked up the remainder of the wood—I am sure the prisoner is the boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to William Turton Newton, and another, of Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. The prisoners were employed by him, Sharp at a journeyman plumber, and Walker as his labourer—it is the custom for them to work in pairs—my masters were building in Lowndes-st., Lowndes-square, Chelsea—about five in the afternoon of Tuesday, the 14th of Nov., I went there—the plumbers work till half-past five—I went into the second floor front room, and found them both—Walker was in one corner of the room, with his face to the wall and his back towards me—he appeared to be button<lb/>ing up bis clothes—Sharp was standing about six feet from him—he was not at work, and was quite near enough to see where Walker was—I asked Walker what he was doing there—Sharp replied that his brace button was burst—Walker gave no answer—I went up to him, ordered him to turn round and let me see whether he had got any thing—he turned, and was walking into another room—I told him to stop and unbutton his waistcoat—he did not do it—I opened his waistcoat and found a bar of lead, and a bar of solder rolled up in lead—I said, "This looks very like a brace button being broken"—he had a belt round him, which was taken from him at the station, that would enable him to carry these things—it has a strap to expand or con<lb/>tract according to circumstances—Sharp remained in the room during the whole of this, but did not say any thing—it would take a man a quarter of an hour to roll the solder in the lead and put it on this belt—the lead would have to be cut open first—it is pipe, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the solder about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in the medical line, in Trevor-terrace; I am a surgeon and general practitioner. The prisoner came into my service on the 12th of August—he resided in my house—I had no reason to be dissatisfied with his honesty till the 30th of Oct., when I had a commu<lb/>nication from Esther Bryan, my servant, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his brother on your wife's watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—his brother had spoken to me about the high price I was paying for drugs, and he said that he could, for ready money, purchase drugs far cheaper than I was buying them, and if I liked, be would purchase those drugs at a low price, at wholesale houses, in large parcels, and I should borrow money of him, as he was in the habit of lending money on interest, and that was the way he employed his capital, and I should give him a bill—I never had given a bill—I did not notice it, and I said, "You shall have this watch (which I believe was the one I have in my pocket)for a few days"—and another time I gave him a bill, which I was not accustomed to, which I think was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect the amount that was advanced on the watch—I think it was about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was when he first came into my service, in the autumn of 1842—I make no me<lb/>morandum of these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I take it for granted that this money was all paid back in the lump, and not by instalments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that—I think the bill was for two months—whether it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent on the watch, I do not know, and whether I paid it by instalments, I cannot tell—when the term expired, the bill was settled, but how, I do not recollect—I believe I gave him the money—I do not distinctly recollect—the first arrangement was, that he should buy the drugs, and 1 should owe him the money, and pay some in<lb/>terest; but afterwards he was to have a larger quantity, which I believe came to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was willing to avail myself of a loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of buying at cheap houses—I knew when the prisoner came to me that he was a married man—at least I believed so—I said be might as well let people suppose he was single as not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After a little while did you suggest to the prisoner that he should buy or hire a Clarence carriage for you to ride in, and you would pay him by instalments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I said as he had a coach-house, and he kept a pony and chaise, whether it was worth his while to keep a larger carriage, which I would pay him for the use of, for two hours a day—I spoke of a four-wheel headed chaise—I looked over his coach-house, and said, "This would not do in case I were to keep a Brougham"—I never in my life instructed him, when the wholesale druggists called, to offer them bills instead of money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever with him to purchase quantities of candles, and soap, and tea, and sugar, on your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I suggested, as he had a pony and chaise, if he was to go into the City and make these purchases at the wholesale houses; then when he brought them home, I would take them at cost price, or a portion of them, so as to be a mutual saving to both fami<lb/>lies—the prisoner was to buy those things with his own money—I do not know that I told him I had not the present means of paying for them—it was the proposal that he should pay for them with his own money, because I had not the present means of paying for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember any time wishing to postpone the payment of Esther Bryan's wages, from a deficiency of pecuniary matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have never been applied to by her for wages when I have not been prepared; but my wife has sometimes said to me, "I wish you would let Esther have her wages up to this date, "and I have told her it was not convenient to pay them at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long before you gave this man in charge had he taken a house in your street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not aware he had taken any house—I do not know now that he has—I had not reason to believe that he had taken a house, or was about to take one, to commence business—I have reason to believe it now—I heard it the morning after he was taken—three persons told me—Mr. Chester and the hair-dresser, and a servant, and my wife told me—I will swear my wife had not told me before—at the examination at the station, there was the copy of a letter showing him to be in treaty for a house in the road, two doors from me, but that letter I did not see at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you this question, and permit me to suggest to you to be cautious how you answer: When the wholesale druggists applied for their bills, due the preceding Christmas, did you not authorize him to ask the people to take bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—two of my creditors sent word to know if it would be convenient to send for their bills—I sent word it would be conve<lb/>nient, and if I did not give them their money in two or three weeks, I would give them bills, which I did—I did not tell the prisoner, that if the servants of any of the wholesale druggists applied for their accounts up to the pre<lb/>ceding Christmas, I was unable to pay them, and to offer them bills—I never had any communication with him on the subject of my wholesale druggists' accounts, except those bills I am speaking of—those two bills were for 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I certainly do not know that a fortnight before he was given in custody that he told my wife, as well as Esther Bryan, that he was in treaty for a house—the sundry-men never call at my house for the purpose of buying drugs—I told the prisoner, when 1 gave him in charge, that these goods were mine, and I could prove it by the papers—I have mode inquiry about the paper of the man that sold it me—I believe his name is John Croft—he is an oil and colourman, aud I believe lives in the Kent-road; but I bought this in my shop—he is not a sundry-man—a sundry-man supplies leeches and pill-boxes, and things of that kind—I asked him whether he could not identify that paper—he did not tell me it was impossible to do so, that he had above eighty reams, and was in the habit of selling it at various places—he said he did not understand the manufacture of paper—I said the proper way of distinguishing it was by the water-mark—he said he had no means of distinguishing it, because it was not his manufacture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take any wrapper from any of the drugs you know by the paper, and tell the Jury your means of distinguishing the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By holding it up to the light you will find there are minute lines which designate the paper, but by way of distinguishing the paper I produce this piece from the drawer, and that exactly corresponds in form and size, edge, and in character.</p>

On Tuesday Davis and Mead brought thirty-six trusses of straw—I received them—they took three away, one took two and the other one, in two carts—I said they had better leave them, I was sure they were sent to make up short weight—Davis said they were to take them home for litter, for their own horses.</p>

When this case was decided, I applied to Mr. Parker, our legal adviser, as Mr. Dunkin wanted to impound the receipt, whether we had authority to do so, and after taking advice, I said I did not think I could—I insisted on its being given up to the defendant—one Commissioner said if he was an honest man, he would leave it in the bands of the chairman, and then he handed it to me—I requested the clerk to seal it up—on the 6th of Oct. it was said that the debt was debarred by the statute of limitation—the prisoner said he did not wish to take the benefit of that, and would pro<lb/>duce the receipt—we examined the prosecutor's books very minutely before we gave our decision—I believe nine Commissioners were present when the case was decided.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Green-bank, Tooley-street. On 24th Oct, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was at Havill's public-house, the King's Head, Green-bank—I went into the tap-room, and saw several people there—the prisoner was there when I went in, smoking his pipe—he had a pint of ale and a glass before him on the table—I knew him before—he filled me a glass of ale, which I drank—-another working man went in with me—the prisoner drank with us both—I cannot tell how much he drank, but we had three pots of beer between four of us—the wife of the man who went with me had come in before we had done drinking—after being there some time, several people came in—the prisoner's wife came in a little before nine, with a baby in her arms, and her mother came in directly after—when his wife came in she put the baby out of her arms into the prisoner's arms, and <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up—she scolded him—I cannot tell her exact words, but she got hold of the hair of his head behind, and punched him in the face very hard—I cannot tell how many times—I think thirteen or fourteen times in the face—I cannot recollect what she said at the time, but she was crying, and was very much bad tempered with him—I do not recollect her calling him names, but the mother called him a murderer, a Greenacre, a man-eater, and a whoremonger, and, after her calling him these names, he called her a b—y w—c—she then ran and got hold of a quart pot, abused him as much as she could, came towards him, and hit at him with the pot—I got hold of her, and told her neither man or woman in the house should injure him—I prevented her striking him—his wife and mother kicked up a <hi rend="italic">gallows row</hi>, and at last the landlord turned them out—the prisoner then had the baby in his arms, and was smoking his pipe—he shed tears, and said, "Tears cannot Help but come down"—after that he went outside the door, as far as the corner of the house, with the baby in his arms—I told him to come into the tap-room again, and we would have another pot of beer, and to bring the baby in, as it was too late at night to have it out—he came in, and when he got in a woman offered to take charge of the child—he gave it her, and she suckled it—she did not keep it above two minutes, I think, because she had a baby of her own crying—when he had the child back, there was a little girl, an aunt of the child, there—we told him to give the child to the aunt, and she would take good care of it—he gave it her—she had it for a few minutes—the aunt's mother came in and <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> her up—the aunt was the sister of the prisoner's wife—the mother-in-law came in and <hi rend="italic">blew</hi> the aunt up, and hit her on the shoulder—she came in again, and made the girl give the child to the prisoner, which she did—they kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and the publican turned the lot of them out—the prisoner shed tears, and said again, "Tears cannot help to come down"—when we had been there some time, he said he wanted to go out—we did not want him to go out, fearing the child, which he still had, would catch cold—he told Havill, the publican, he insisted on going out—Havill told him to give the child to the woman who had suckled it before—he said he would not, and nobody but himself should do for the child, it was his child, and he would do for it himself, and nobody else should—he asked Havill's liberty to go out—Havill spoke to him—I cannot say what he said, and we got up to let him pass by—he went as far as the bar,</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Valentine and Orson public-house, Long-lane, in the parish of Bermondsey. I have a cellar, the door of which is outside the premises—it is usually secured by four bolts inside. On the 26th of Nov., at ten o'clock at night, I saw that door bolted safe—I went to bed about a quarter before eleven—about two o'clock a constable's rattle awoke me—I got up, went to the door, went into the cellar, and found a board forced off the door from the outside, that would enable a person without to draw baek the bolts, and let themselves in—none of my property was stolen—getting into the cellar would enable the parties to get into the house—I afterwards went to the station, and saw the prisoners in custody.</p>

I was out on business—I returned home about half-past three o'clock, and I let myself in with a latch-key—I went up stairs to bed after having chained and secured the door—after I had been in bed a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I fancied I heard a slight noise outside my chamber door—I listened, and heard it repeated in my dressing-room adjoining my bed-room—I opened the door, and saw some person there—I closed with him immedi<lb/>ately, and tried to secure him—he resisted as much as possible, and was as much as I could manage—after calling out to Mr. Lodge and the servants, further assistance was procured, and he was eventually secured—it was the prisoner—he bit me very violently on the shoulder and arm, and struck me with his fists as hard as he could—I got other hurts in the struggle, and cut my knee very violently—after some time a light was brought, and he then said, "Oh forgive me, master"—he had been in my service six months since—immediately he was secured I went down into the area with a policeman, and found the larder door, leading into the passage and up stairs, open—that was secured over night by a latch which only opens from the outside—some wire gauze which had been over it was forced out at one corner, by which means the door was opened—there is a very small circular window under the steps from which a small pane of glass had been broken, and we had pasted a piece of paper over it—that paper was forced through, and the window opened—that could have been done from without, and that I conjecture was the way he got in—he could then force his person into the larder—I found a pair of shoes immediately under that window, which we took up stairs—the prisoner</p>

               <p>having no shoes or stockings on, they were put down for him, and he imme<lb/>diately put them on and went out of the house in them—he did not claim them exactly—he was searched on being delivered over to the police, and some lucifers and a tap was taken from him with a key to it, which would present the appearance of a pistol—it was exactly the same shape.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 10th of Nov. I was working for the prosecu<lb/>tor, at No. 11 arch, Waterloo-bridge—the prisoners were at work there, from six till half-past six o'clock—I saw them leave together—Ellis had two saddles, a breeching, and a pair of hames, on his left shoulder—Westwood assisted him in carrying them out—I saw them leave the arch with it—they did not come back—I was there till very near nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Commercial-road, Lambeth, very near the arches of Waterloo-bridge. About six o'clock on Friday evening, I saw Ellis with a saddle on his shoulder—he stopped and looked in my face, and I saw the curl on the side of his face—he was carrying harness—it was slipping, and Westwood went and helped it up—I was afraid of my winddw—I saw the brass of the harness—I can swear more to Ellis, because he came to my shop frequently, and the other not so often.</p>
