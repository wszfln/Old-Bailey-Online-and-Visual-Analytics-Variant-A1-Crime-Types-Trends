I bought these things ( producing them) of the prisoner; I cannot remember the day of the month exactly, I believe it was about the 6th of March; one of the sheets Mr. Dobbs swears to, but I am positive it is not his; there were three coarse sheets; I sent for some black silk to mark them, as I thought to keep them for my own family. I gave him 26 s. for one parcel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210004"/> and 4 s. for some pieces of cambrick; I thought he had been an old clothes man.</p>

               <p>Q. That sort of lace?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, and asked the prices of them. There were about twenty odd cards in the drawer; she asked me if I had any other pattern that was about 3 s. or 4 s. a dozen; I shewed her one or two more about that price out of the same drawer as I took them out of; I laid them on the other side of the drawer from where she stood; she then took up this parcel of her own which had the patterns pinn'd to it, and laid it upon the laces that I had taken out and put on the other side of the drawer, and then she asked me what was the lowest price of the lace which matched her pattern; I told her 4 s. a dozen; she asked me if I would take 3 s. a dozen, for she wanted a pretty deal of it; I told her 4 s. was the lowest if she was to take the whole card of it; she then took up this parcel she had laid upon the laces in a very particular manner which struck my attention as it lay upon the laces on the other side of the drawer; she put the under part of her hand close underneath and brought it over in a very stiff manner, and laid it directly before her; seeing the parcel going in this stiff manner struck me, I endeavoured to look under it; I stooped with pretence to look in the drawers but could not see any lace; she then asked me what quantity of that little edging would trim a little cap; I told her it depended upon what kind of cap it was; she then said cut me three-quarters of a yard; then she said no half an ell will be enough, which I cut off; she then asked me for some coarse cat-gut; I think a quarter of a yard or a quarter and a half of coarse cat-gut: we keep the cat-gut in the counter; I asked her to lift the parcel off while I lifted up the counter; as she took the parcel off I kept my eye upon her: I observed her as she drew back she put her right hand under the parcel which she took in her left hand, and immediately I saw a quick motion under her apron; the moment she had disengaged her hands from her apron, her hand went into her pocket immediately, and she took out some money; then this parcel which was so stiff before in her hand was hung very carelessly upon her hand; she threw down the money that the lace and cat-gut came to, which I believe was 7 1/2 d. seeing all these operations confirmed me very strongly in my suspicion that she had got a card of lace; she said then is that the lowest price; I said yes; then she said, I shall want a dozen and eight yards of lace, which I must send my young woman for to-morrow morning; then she wished me a good afternoon, and away she went: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210005"/> went to the door; I went found the counter, catched hold of her hand, and said, I wanted to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she then?</p>
               <p>Gunston. There is a sash door, she had got on the outside of the door and was just turning round to go; as soon as she came in, I said, Ma'am, you have got a card of lace, or something that don't belong to you; she denied it; I then took her into the back counting-house and charged her with it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any people in the shop besides?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Mr. Green was serving two ladies; she immediately fell down upon her knees, and begged for God's sake I would have mercy upon her; I desired her to sit down in a chair; she refused, and fell down directly upon her knees again, and made a motion by which I thought she wanted to disengage what she had; I then pulled her up rather rough, and pushed her down into a chair to make her sit down; I then put her apron and gown by and she first thing I saw sticking out under her stays was this piece of gauze (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Court. That has nothing to do in this case.</p>
               <p>Gunston. Then I felt under her stays and pulled out this card of lace (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be Mr. Green's?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, very well; for that very morning I took it on return from a milliner that had it the night before to shew to a lady; she begged still very hard for God's sake I would forgive her, and let her go, and she pulled a little box out of her pocket which she opened, and threw about eight or ten pieces of gold upon the table, which she begged I would accept if I would keep this affair secret; which I would not do; I then secured her; Mr. Green came back into the counting house and asked her name; she said it was Shipley, and that her husband was an attorney in St. Mary Axe; Mr. Green went back into the shop and brought two ladies with him; while Mr. Green was gone, I said, what could be your motive for doing this? she said, poverty: said I, that is impossible, you have gold here in plenty, you do not seem as if you was in any distress; you do not know, said she, what distress there is in a family: almost directly she clasped me round the body, and said I am not a married woman, for God's sake make it up and I will give you twenty guineas if you will make it up.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, well, you need not mention every</p>
               <p>little circumstance! you charged a constable with her?</p>
               <p>Gunston. By this time the ladies came into the counting-house where we were, and Mr. Green asked them if they knew her; they said yes, and were sorry to see her under these circumstances; Mrs. Tonge said, Ma'am, you do not know me; she said yes, and her name was Tonge and that she lived in Fleet-street; Mr. Green said how could you tell me such a falsity; she said, Lord, Sir; would you have me tell the truth at this time. I was sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon the lace?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, the number of the card, and a private mark of what it cost us; it is Mr. Green's marking; I know it to be his property.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she came into your shop to buy lace and did buy it?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That she had a parcel like that you describe?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her lay it upon the card of lace, did you attempt to take it off, or speak to her about any impropriety you observed in it?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I had no reason nor no right to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you wanted to lift the counter, in order to see under it, she removed it?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was something particular in it, but you saw nothing under the parcel itself?</p>
               <p>Gunston. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not saw nothing of the lace till the time you mentioned you took it from under her stays?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always talked the same of this story as you do now?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Or did you say before the sitting alderman, that when she moved it across the counter, you saw part of the lace hang down?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I did not, sir, because the card was pinn'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the lace is taken from a card, do you put other lace upon the same card?</p>
               <p>Gunston. If it is the same pattern; if not, we destroy the old mark; and put another on again; it would be very extravagant else to use a card to every lace.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know when that was marked?</p>
               <p>Gunston. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210006"/>Q. It may have been marked a great while before for any thing you know?</p>
               <p>Gunston. It was marked when that lace was put upon the card.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the reason for your saying it was marked when the lace was put on?</p>
               <p>Gunston. When we have a card that has been used before, we cut off the old mark, and mark it afresh with what that cost.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know them to be your own cards?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is by the mark you know what to ask?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes; it is marked with the prime cost, and we know what profit to ask.</p>
               <p>Counsel. When you sell a whole card you sell card and all?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Sometimes we sell it card and all, sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is the box it was in?</p>
               <p>Gunston. It is a drawer; it might be four or five inches deep.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you laid the laces, when you took them out, upon that side of the drawer farthest from her?</p>

               <p>Gunston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put it over the drawer next you?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, a cross the drawer, and covered the laces with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The card of lace I certainly took up with my parcel; I had my gloves on, and upon my word I knew no more that I had it then you do; it never was under my stays, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Court. How many yards was upon this piece?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Seventeen yards; it cost Mr. Green 8 d. the yard; it cost him 11 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. I thought you asked her 4 s. a dozen?</p>
               <p>Gunston. That was a narrow edging she was bargaining for, not for this.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you not satisfied, by what you saw the woman do, that she had stole the lace?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, every circumstance confirmed my suspicion.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not mean whether it gave rise to a suspicion, but was you convinced in your mind?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I was convinced in my mind she had got something, but I did not know what.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith in Long-acre: I have known her ever since 1761; great part of the time she has kept a milliner's shop in Fleet-street; she is in a large way of business; I never heard but that she dealt fairly and honestly, and bore the character of an honest woman.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burcher. I have known her between 13 and 14 years; I thought her character a very good one. I keep a shop with my son; she had a house of mine two or three years before she went into business; she paid very honestly; I have bought things of her, cloaks, and every thing; this is a litigious thing; I do not think she would be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot pass by such evidence as this without taking notice of it: have you heard what Gunston swore, that he took this piece of lace from under her stays?</p>
               <p>Burcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, and can you think that owing to a mistake?</p>
               <p>Burcher. We have had many mistakes in my shop, and ladies have carried things into their coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What under their stays?</p>
               <p>Burcher. In their laps some how.</p>
               <p>Court. Now suppose a fine lady was to come into your shop, and you should miss some jewels, and find them afterwards, half way down their stays, would you think that a mistake.</p>
               <p>Burcher. We have found this mistake and taken them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you upon your oath believe, supposing that gentleman has swore true, that this was a mistake?</p>
               <p>Burcher. I know nothing of that gentleman, I am sure it amazed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why then do you put such a construction upon it?</p>

               <p>Barnet. No, only tied or buckled with a strap; I never lost a card to my knowledge; I have, when I have been ill, sent her up a dozen or so, and she has sent me down the money for a card; I never missed a yard of those cards that I left with her. I would have opened an account with her, but she would not suffer me to do it.</p>

            . I was present at the examination of Mrs. Tonge, at Guildhall: Mr. Gunston said when she took up the lace she put her hand under the parcel; and he said he saw the corner of the lace and the corner of the card stick out; the card was his word.</p>
               <p>Nebemiab Ward. I understood it in the same light upon the examination as the last witness has given his oath, that in taking up the parcel; he said he saw the lace, or the corner of the lace, I understood him so.</p>
               <p>Q. The other said the corner of the card?</p>
               <p>Ward. He said he saw the corner of the lace hang down.</p>
               <p>Court. You are coming here upon words, that is the whole, to shew that this gentleman said at the Lord Mayor's different from what he has now said; now can you recollect the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Ward. As nigh as I can recollect he made use of the expression of the corner of the card being seen under the parcel; he took up the paper and said he saw the corner of it hang down, or out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the word?</p>
               <p>Ward. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said the corner of it?</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Gunston. Do you recollect what you said?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes, I do; it did not come into my mind when I was upon my evidence; I said before Alderman Sawbridge, that in order to be certain, after the stiff moving of the parcel, I did endeavour to see if I could discover any thing under it, I put my head low down, and thought I discovered the corner of the card but saw no lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here?</p>
               <p>Gunston. No, he is a quaker; therefore I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of those ladies here?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I thought there was no necessity of their coming here; they saw nothing of the transaction, but only spoke about her person.</p>

               <p>Holyer. Yes; she asked me for an article called glossy cat-gut; I shewed her some; she bought one yard to the best of my remembrance at 20 d. and paid for it; in the same paper of cat-gut was contained a piece of gauze like this.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom had you that piece?</p>

            . I took her into the back room behind the shop, in order to search her; when I got her into the chair, I put her apron and gown by, the first thing I saw was this gauze sticking about the middle part under her stays, and held between the stays and her body; I pulled it out, and said, hollow! what have you got here? she said this is some gauze I am going to shew to a lady: said I this is an odd manner to take gauze to shew to ladies under your stays, I am afraid you have taken it somewhere or other; she then said it was her own gauze; I opened a little parcel in her hand to see what she had been buying, and in it I saw some glossy cat-gut; I then called for our apprentice, and bid him go into the neighbourhood, and enquire who had sold a lady that cat-gut; he went to two of the neighbours, and they had not sold any; then he went to Mr. Langstone's, and then Mr. Holyer and Mr. Addington both came up; I said Mr. Holyer do you know this piece of gauze? he said no; we had such a piece of gauze in the parcel, I will go home and fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the piece of gauze to Holyer?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes. I forget whether Addington and he both went, or how, but Addington brought the parcel soon after; Holyer said, before the parcel was opened, if there is a piece of Paris net in this parcel this is not our's; the parcel was opened and the Paris net was not there; there was none.</p>

               <p>Q. It does not seem to be rumpled.</p>
               <p>Gunston I have kept it in a box in my custody from that hour to this.</p>

Mr. Green's young man came into our shop, and asked me whether there had been a lady at our house within a few minutes to buy some glossy cat-gut; I said, yes; he said come to our house to look at her, for we have found some Paris net upon her, which we imagine is stole from somebody; I went immediately and Holyer followed, and I went home for this paper; when I came to see the lady at Mr. Green's; they asked me, was this lady in your shop?

               <p>Addington.

               <p>Q. Was that all the gauze you had in the house?</p>

               <p>Addington. It is Paris net gauze.</p>

               <p>Addington. Yes; there is plain gauze and figured gauze of various denominations, but this we always call Paris net.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it gauze?</p>
               <p>Addington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Gunston it was my own when he took it barbarously from me; he never charged me with it before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner's counsel to Gunston. Did not she tell you it was her own gauze?</p>
               <p>Gunston. She said so at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be charged with this before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I only charged her there with the affair of the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was mentioned then before the alderman, but about the lace?</p>
               <p>Gunston. Yes; I did mention it before the alderman, but he said that was nothing to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any gauze of her own?</p>
               <p>Gunston. She had a little parcel she bought at Mr. Langstone's; I returned it before the alderman, and what she bought of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Gunston wanted to keep it all from me, but the alderman obliged him to give it me back, for that part is my property.</p>
               <p>Court to Holyer. After that woman had been in the shop, did you shew any of the glossy gauze, or any thing in that paper to any other customer?</p>
               <p>Holyer. No; the paper was not opened from the time she was in the shop till it was opened in Mr. Green's compting-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Addington. Was you in the shop?</p>
               <p>Addington. Yes; from the whole time the prisoner was at our house till I went to Mr. Green's, and I am certain it was never opened from the time it was shewn her till I carried it to Mr. Green's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you went from your shop to Mr. Green's before you came back?</p>

               <p>Addington. Not a minute; I ran there and back directly, and it is very near.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>It is my own property; they took it from me: Mr. Gunston has a particular spite towards me, and I believe there are people in court that he should say to, that if it was possible he would have my life. I have witnesses to prove that, one is a servant maid; her mistress was uneasy about me; she was surprised, as all the world must about a woman of my reputation: I might have been trusted with thousands. In regard to this woman, she is only a servant maid, that has lived with a lady I have worked for many years; she was frightened with the news, and sent her servant to Mr. Gunston's to buy pins, and know the truth of it, and he was pleased to say desperate things of what he would do to me: Mr. Sumpter has heard something of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. I do not think that is very material; we had better rely upon her good character.</p>
               <p>Court. As the woman has stated this to the jury, you should either retract it or endeavour to prove it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Then, my lord, we will ask Mr. Gunston.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gunston. Have you declared at any time, that you would hang her if it was in your power?</p>
               <p>Gunston. To the best of my knowledge I never said such a thing: I might have said she deserved the full of the law, as being an old offender and well known in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about hanging her, cost what it would?</p>
               <p>Gunston. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, that if she got off one indictment you would hang her upon the other?</p>
               <p>Gunston. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not to that effect?</p>
               <p>Gunston. No. I have said, that as being an old offender in the trade, I was afraid if lenity was shewn to her, and that if the affair was only laid for transportation, she would get at large; I said, if it is laid capital, she may get off for transportation; that she may get out of the kingdom. For I cast one in this court once,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210011"/> and she obtained a pardon, and a week after she came to the door and abused me.</p>

On Friday the 16th I went to drink tea, and left my man in the shop, the prisoner came in for a pint of salt; she flung down her money, and said she would call again for the salt; I came into the shop, and said to my man, Thomas, there is one of the hams gone since I went in to tea; he said there had been nobody in the shop but the woman for the salt, that was to call again; I desired him to stay in the shop and I would go into the counting-house and put an apron over the window and watch her motions; she came and asked if it was ready; my servant said no; and while he was putting the salt up with his back towards her, I saw her pop down and take one of the hams up; she had several other little things; then she went out and I followed and stopped her, and said you have something belonging to me; she said I have not: I put by her cloak and took the ham from her.</p>

            . I am bricklayer to the society of Lincoln's Inn: I was sent for to measure the place where the lead was taken from, and was directed to go to justice Welch, to measure some lead that had been stopped at a broker's; I did, and found it tallied in length and breadth with the place from whence the lead was stolen.</p>
               <p>John Brown. This lead (producing it) was brought from justice Welch's, yesterday, to the grand jury, and left at Mr. Clark's till this morning. I stopped Edges with this lead on his shoulder, in Hog-lane, and brought him to justice Welch's; I thought from the quantity it was stole; Edges told me Coleman and Dowling were concerned in stealing of it, and directed me to his house in Mutton-lane; I went there and found him in a two pair of stairs room; he jumped out of the window, and I took him in the yard. Dowling confessed before justice Welch that they were all three concerned in the robbery; I found this ladder (producing it, about five feet high) on the staircase, where the lead was stole from, with about 14 lb. of lead; Dowling said it was his ladder; it has the initials of his name upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any light?</p>
               <p>Munie. Yes, from the sky, and from the the lamp, I could see very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Webb is the man, that held you by the arm?</p>
               <p>Munie. Yes, he held me while the other took the money out of my pocket; after they had took my money, they desired me to uncase, and they took off my great coat and walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any pistol?</p>
               <p>Munie. I did not see any; I read about the 5th of March, an advertisement that the two persons were in custody, that had taken a great coat from a person; I went to justice Welch's on the 6th, and found the coat there. I knew it to be my coat. (The coat produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

On the 12th of April, between two and three in the morning, the house was broke open; it was all fast when we went to bed; the shutters bolted, the sashes put down, and padlocks at the bottom of the sashes; there was nobody in the house but Mr. Baker and myself; I lye in the back parlour and he up stairs; I was the last up. I heard the breaking of the parlour door; I thought it was a noise from the wind which was very high; my parlour door was open; I saw a light and three men; the little one of the prisoners (Oates) immediately put his hand upon my mouth, blast you, says he, if you stir or speak, I'll blow your brains out, I have a loaded pistol here; then he took the pillow from under my head, and clapped it on my mouth to squeeze me down; I said for Christ's sake do not murder me! take what you find; he made no answer, but called to the other men to put out the light; I always burn a rush light, and by mistake I suppose they put their own out; they put out both lights; then they went into the sore parlour and fetched their tinder box, flint and steel and turn screws, which they brought with them, and came and struck a light on the other side of the bed where the escrutore was. All this time Oates was kneeling on my bedside; then the other two broke open the bureau and took what money they found there; there was as nigh as I can remember 12 l. of gold and silver; I saw the money the day before; I looked it over on Saturday night before Mr. Baker paid his men. Then they took the plate out of the closet in the back parlour; there were the pieces mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); Collins asked if I had any thing to drink; I said I believed there was some rum in some of the bottles; but there did not happen to be any, so they took a bottle of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see Collins then to know him?</p>
               <p>Baker. No; I knew him by his voice: just before he asked me if there was any thing to drink, as Oates was kneeling upon the bed, Collins said to him, Strangle the bitch, blast her; then Oates asked me if I was alone in the house; I said yes; he said are you sure; I said yes; for I was afraid if they found Mr. Baker they would kill him; then the other two left Oats centinel over me whilst they went down stairs into a parlour on the ground floor; they broke open an escrutore there, and took out a tray, a silver cream pot, a green purse with about three guineas and a half or four guineas in it, and in a box about twelve or fourteen shillings in silver. (Repeats the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment). Oats still kept guard over me, and asked where the candles were; I told him in a box under the stairs; then he asked where the key of the outer door was; I told him behind the door, hung upon a hook that the chain was put on; then he called one of them to bring his shoes and put them on as he was kneeling on my bed; then he said if I stirred or made an noise for near half an hour, there were several more of them, and they would come back and blow my brains out; then he said you have got a key to your room door, I will lock you in; then I asked how I should get out in the morning; he said, O blast you, somebody will let you out in the morning; they unbolted the door and all went out at the outer door; they found great difficulty in breaking the house open. I believe they might stay in the house about three-quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Oates's face?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes; I never took my eyes off, and shall never forget it; I have never slept since. I observed he was pitted with the small pox.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear as to his person?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes. We were informed the same morning that they were taken in Duke's Place, offering to sell the plate; I went to Sir

             should know two of them, one that knelt upon the bed, and another by his voice; when he was examined, Sir John put several questions to him that I might hear his voice, and I immediately knew Collins's voice; it is a remarkable voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very well satisfied as to that man to his voice? +</p>
               <p>+ Collins has a remarkably deep voice.</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say to the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Baker. The other I never heard speak; he lighted the candle and was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. In this confusion and terror you must certainly be in, could you make observations upon the dress of the men?</p>
               <p>Baker. They had all great coats on; the great coat that Oats had on when he knelt upon me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210018"/> was exactly the colour of the coat Collins has on now, about brick dust colour. They said they were three unfortunate fellows, they came for money and money they must have; I said I am very sorry for you, so am I says Oats. I really was very much composed; I was not so much discomposed as I am at this moment. Oats said just before he went that I might thank God that they did not serve me as Mrs. Hutchings, at Chelsea, was served.</p>
               <p>Q. from Collings. Whether you know any of my features?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, only his voice; I did not see his person.</p>
               <p>Q. from Oats. In what manner did you distinguish my features?</p>
               <p>Baker. I looked at you steadfastly the whole time you leaned upon me; he held what he called a pistol to my face, and said, blast your eyes, you bitch, don't stir, don't stir; and pushed it into the corner of my eye; the moment I heard them gone from the door, I put too the private brass bolt of the door, and then knocked up the people in the house; I then went down and found the street door open: they got in at the fore parlour window adjoining to the steps; they broke first a pane of glass at the top; then the window shutters, the bottom of the sash was padlocked within side; they broke the glass, then the padlock.</p>

I said I would give him 6 s. Spooner said, d - n your eyes, what do you offer 6 s. for the ring, it is worth a guinea; I put the ring on my finger and said I would go for a pair of scales and weigh the plate; I went immediately to Sir

Mr. Blake came to my house the 24th of February last, and told me Kipling, who had been our porter, had robbed him, and that on searching his box he had found some books, and asked him how he came by them; he said his master in Yorkshire gave them to him; I told him I had missed two books, one Advice to a Friend, the other The Oeconomy of Human Life; he said they were two of the books in the box; I went with him; the constable was there; we opened the box and found the four books; they are all mine; I took them out of the box.</p>

I am a constable: the prosecutor came to Mr. Blake's; I happened to be there; he said he had missed some books, and described two or three of them to me; the prisoner was then at the Compter; I went to him for the key of the box and found these four books in it; they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

            . I sold the prisoner some nails; I don't know the day of the month when I sold them, but it was the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the beginning of March, was it a week in March?</p>
               <p>Lee. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many nails did you sell him?</p>
               <p>Lee. As many to the best of my knowledge as came to a 5 s. 3 d. and 5 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lee. In Whitecross-street, Bunhill-row. I have been an ironmonger almost 30 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of nails were they?</p>
               <p>Lee. I have some in my pocket out of the same bag they were out of; these are the three sorts he had of me (producing three sorts of nails); the other nails produced never a man in England can distinguish them to swear to his own work.</p>
               <p>Court. Yours seem to be thicker than the other.</p>
               <p>Lee. A whole bag of them nails are not made by one man, and so they will vary.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the nails, and see how they run in general; they appear to be considerably less to me than your's, how do you sell them, by the pound?</p>
               <p>Lee. They are not sold by the pound, they are sold by the thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they a thousand?</p>
               <p>Lee. They are dearer than when I was in the country: I came from Sturbridge: they are now sold at about 1 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousand did you sell to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lee. About 4000; I received 5 s. 3 d. and 5 s. of him; we call them three-penny brads.</p>
               <p>Q. Three-pence a thousand?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, we give them that title.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your brads town made?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; they came out of the country; some I get from Sturbridge, and some from other places.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's business?</p>

When she was brought back to the shop she begged for mercy, and said she had never robbed them but three times in all her life; the number that was upon this piece of lace was six.</p>

            . I live at Bishop Stortfort, in Buckinghamshire. I came to London to bring some lace on Easter Monday; I came by the Aylesbury Coach to the Bull in Holborn; a man followed me, like a countryman, and said how do you do, you are a countryman as well as I am; said he I came from Thame, and brought some sheep to sell; he said he had a sister lived at a great gentleman's house, and wanted a piece of lace; and if I would go with him he would help me to a customer; that it was a great house, and they would buy a good deal perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. You was wiser I dare say than to go with him?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes; I went along with him; he went into a house, first some where in Oxford-road; he called for a pot of beer; then he went out with pretence to fetch his sister, and returned and said she would be there in half an hour; we sat down; he talked about ploughing and sowing, and in a little time came in two more men; they are the men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say or do?</p>
               <p>Friday. They said nothing to us for some time; at last one of them, and the other man began talking; he said he belonged to a ship and he would buy some lace of me but he must go to such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know you had any lace to sell.</p>
               <p>Friday. The man told him, and I had my box with me; but I must go with him to the Noah's Ark, for his wife was to meet him there. I went with him to <placeName id="t17730421-26-crimeloc150">the Noah's Ark in Oxford-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there a back door to the house?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes; I went out at the sore door; my box was found upon Dennison. (The box of lace produced by

            ).</p>
               <p>Friday. Here is my mark upon every piece; I have reckoned it up; there is about 35 s. worth wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burn. Whether you did not lay some money with the other man?</p>
               <p>Friday. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man give you money he won of Dennison?</p>
               <p>Friday. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose any money?</p>
               <p>Friday. One of them asked for some change; I pulled my silver out, and he stole some of it; but that was neither of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he take?</p>
               <p>Friday. To the best of my belief 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you get it again?</p>
               <p>Friday. I was in a fright.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not gamble?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burn. Whether you did not lay your box against thirty guineas, or against any sum?</p>
               <p>Friday. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you told any body when you came back, that you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Friday. When I went into the house a man stood with his hat off; he said what do you want; I said the gentlemen that were here; he said, O, they are gone; so I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not enquire after it?</p>
               <p>Friday. The man was so snappish with me, and I thought it was of no use as they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only reason you did not ask for your box?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Ward of Farringdon-within; I produced this box and parcel. On Easter Monday between two and three o'clock in the day, as I was going along Thames-street, I passed a gang of notorions thieves, which I knew to be such, having detected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210029"/> them before; I took no notice of them till one came up to Dennison, and said, d - n my eyes and limbs let me carry the box; he d - n him again, and said he should not carry it; hearing this language repeated I thought it proper to detect them. I ran to the Rose and Crown at Queenhithe, and tapped at the window, and a brother constable came out; I shewed him the people; he was of my opinion, and we pursued them; they took up Garlick-hill; we followed them; I believe they perceived they were pursued; they all seven went into the Card-maker's Arms at Garlick-hill; I went in and put my hand upon this box, which was in a bag, and said to Dennison, my friend, what have you got here? I am of opinion you have got a box of lace which you have not come honestly by, who does it belong to? he answered I don't know; why said I, don't you know how it came here? he sa id, no; I said, is there none of you gentlemen know any thing about this box? they said no, all of them; the seventh man he ran away; I know him to be a sharper; he brought in Simms another man: there was but one person when we went into the house besides ourselves, and we charged him to assist in the king's name; he was very fearful; some gentlemen came in that had been at the vestry and assisted us, I brought a coach from Cheapside, and took Burn and another man (not him at the bar) and carried them in the coach to the Poultry Compter; when I got out of the coach; I desired the man that is not here to follow me, and told the young man to keep a strict eye upon Burn; the moment that I turned out of the coach, the young man, that was in the coach with me, called out, he has thrown something out of the coach window; I bid him run round and pick it up; he went round and picked up this small parcel of lace (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Friday. Here is my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Duncastle. This parcel was sealed up when it was brought to me; they were carried to different goals that night, and before my Lord Mayor afterwards.</p>
               <p>Burn. That piece dropped out, I did not throw it out; it dropped out of my great coat pocket; it belonged to this man at the bar; he played thirty guineas against it.</p>
               <p>Duncastle. We insisted at the public house we would search them, therefore I suppose it was upon that account he threw it out.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward of Faringdon-within; I went in pursuit of the prisoners; the little man had a box under his arm going up the hill; they turned about seeing us, and knowing us I suppose, went into this public house; Dennison pushed the lace from him upon the table, and seemed as if it did not belong to him; all the six denied that the box belonged to any of them. While my brother constable was gone to the Compter with one of them, Burn wanted to go to the, but the gentlemen would not let him; they said he should have a close stool, so he had a large chamber pot which was in the room; he had not been long come back before he put his hand into his right pocket, and had this piece of lace in his hand ready to give to one of his comrades; I said what are you about, sit further, you are going to shift what you have got; I immediately took it from him. (The piece of lace produced and deposed to by the prosecutor); I took from one of them this bag; (producing a purse that cannot be easily opened with counters in it.)</p>
               <p>- Lewis. I keep the Noah's Ark.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether after he came in again, he said any thing about being robbed?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there is a back door to your house?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; it goes into the stable yard, and also into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether we did not all go out at the front door?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I cannot tell; but two of them that were like farmers went out first; a young man in the tap room went out after them, and two men were left in the parlour when I came back; I did not see any go out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Squire. We have advertised this lace a good while, and last Sunday the owner came; we went to this gentleman's house, and enquired whether such people were there on Easter Monday; he said several people were there that he did not like, and bid his wife look sharp after them; I said to him do you know which way they went; he said he stepped out of the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210030"/> and saw two on the other side of the way and three on this side, subscribing these two men as near as could be, the one with the bag on his shoulder, the other walking by him.</p>

               <p>Lewis. The two countrymen went out first; they that went towards Cavendish-street had the box; they were the people that went out last.</p>
               <p>Burn's Defence.</p>
               <p>The man laid his box against thirty guineas; he opened the lace; he said it was worth thirty guineas, and I believed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. Old clothes. I saw this gentleman take two pieces of lace, black and white, out of the box, and call a party if he had got all of it; they said no, not a quarter of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you heard this pretty conversation?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. In my Lord Mayor's office; I saw it when a man jumped out of the window at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you there?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I knew a good woman that was taken up as a vagrant; I went in behalf of her, and I saw this man take two pieces of lace out, a black and white piece; the black this width, that might go round a cardinal, and pieces of paper wrapped round the middle of it. I saw this constable put the two pieces of lace in his own pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I believe eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been pretty intimate together?</p>

               <p>Q. But I ask you?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I am certain and sure it is not so.</p>
               <p>Q. So you happened luckily to be at my Lord Mayor's about some poor woman taken up as a vagrant, and your friend Burn happened to be there?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I did no see him till he came out.</p>
               <p>One of the witnesses. She has brought him victuals frequently to the Compter.</p>

            . About half after six o'clock a lad belonging to Mr. Elling of Hounslow, called me, and I saw near a hovel of Mr. Elling's some feathers of ducks, which occasioned suspicion. Two men were in the hovel; I asked them if they had any poultry to sell; they said they had; the four ducks and two geese were produced; seeing them, and suspecting the quantity of poultry were not come honestly by, I offered to secure them, but they ran away; the ducks and geese were seized and led to Brentford; they were delivered to one Gatfield, a constable. I went before Mr. Drinkwater, a justice of the peace; he ordered them to be left in the custody of Mr. Lewis at Brentford.</p>

            . I live near Mr. Smith: I lost a great deal of poultry. From the alarm of a man's being taken under suspicious circumstances, I came to look at the poultry, when they were in the possession of Mr. Lewis, and when Burgess was there. I saw them ducks and geese left in the possession of Lewis; the prisoner said he bought them at Maidenhead; afterwards he said he had them at Berry, a village four miles of.</p>

I met the prisoner in custody, in Shoreditch, going to Clerkenwell Bridewell; I knew him directly; I asked them how they came by him; they said he had been before Justice Wilmot and nobody would swear to him: I said I could safely do it; I knew him perfectly well; the prisoner was sent to gaol, and the Justice came in soon after; I described the horse and pistol to him; he looked at the pistol and found it answered; he was brought back to the Justice's that day; I attended, and I went to Sir

Early in the morning on the 31st of March, my servant came up to me, and informed me my house was robbed; I got up immediately and came down; that was between five and six o'clock; I found the window shutter of the compting house broke open, which is part of my dwelling house, an adjacent room to the parlour; they both join.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go out of the parlour into the compting house?</p>
               <p>Rauston. Yes; the bolt of the shutter was broke and wrenched off; the window was pulled down, and the shutters put easily too; it was nearly shut; the sash was not fastened down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how this window was left over night?</p>
               <p>Rauston. Yes, it was bolted; I examined the compting house just before I went to bed; they could get no farther; they broke open two locks in the compting house desk, and took out a bowl of halfpence, about 3 s. worth; then I presume they proceeded to the parlour; there were two locks there broke open, and 10 l. in cash taken out of the closet, a silver pint mug, a silver watch capped and jewelled; the maker's name Fish, at the Royal Exchange, a silver salt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210037"/> six silver table spoons, two tea spoons, a pepper box, two pair of silver shoe buckles, one pair of silver knee buckles, between 13 and 14 yards of Irish linen, four razors and a case, with horn handles tipped with silver, four yards of long lawn, a canvas bag with a parcel of tickets; I swear to 60, I suppose there were 100; with regard to the copper tickets, the morning after the robbery I was sent to, and informed that Burch had thrown something into a poad in Mrs. Harrison's cow layer, Gray's-inn-lane; I imagined it might be the copper tickets; I got some people to drag the pond this day, and the drag brought out this bag (producing a canvas bag); this was in my desk; I kept them in it. I found seven yards of Irish linen at the house of

               <p>Maidman. I would not take a hundred for it. I was told on Wednesday my mare was gone: I went to Hockley-in-the-Hole, to one Mincher's who keeps a dog house, and buys horses to kill, and left a description of the mare, and desired him if it was brought there to stop it; that was the same morning I lost it; in about an hour after Mincher and his master came to me; I was not at home; I went there and saw the prisoner and the mare. Before I saw the mare the constable asked me if I should know it; I said yes, and described the marks beside her ear: she had a running like an evil, had been blooded and it had festered, and one of her legs behind had a tread of another horse and was lame. I secured the prisoner.</p>

When on the house he had the lead in one hand and some slating in the other hand; he was pulling the lead, and as the lead came up his head came up and he saw me. I saw the place afterwards; the lead was ripped all round the gutter, and the lead was gone from the ridges. This chopper was found on the Thursday; Comer owned he used that chopper to rip the lead round.</p>
               <p>Q. So he had ripped the lead some days before this?</p>
               <p>Austin. Yes; and the beadle set me there to watch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Fountain or Ward?</p>
               <p>Austin. I saw two or three repass before that and went and told the officer of the night, and they bid me give a sharp look out; I cannot say they are the men.</p>

I was a prisoner for debt in the Compter: on the 27th of last February, soon after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting on a bench in the tap room; he was brought in for some quarrel in the night or something; I went up stairs, then I came down again with a Mr. Essex a brother debtor; and I saw the prisoner sitting upon the same bench; I observed one of the felons seemingly busy at his coat pocket; and I went throught the tap-room into the back kitchen; I was going to mention it as soon as I got into the kitchen, but a woman there said she thought it was a pity nobody took care of that poor man who seemed to be in liquor, for the felons were busy about his pockets; I went to him, tapped him on the shoulder and said my friend, step this way; he went with me into the kitchen; I said what have you in your coat pocket? have you lost nothing? he put in his hand, and said no; as he stood up I saw there was a piece cut out of his breeches; and his pocket was cut; I said why they have cut your breeches pocket, he looked and said, Lord bless me so they have; I asked him if he had any money; he answered no, nothing but a bit of per; several of us thought it was a shame the felons should use him so bad; so we advised him to go up and complain to Mr.

               <p>Q. What time of day was this?</p>
               <p>Morris.

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did not hear him say a word; one thing I have omitted; while I waited for Mr. Baron's coming in after I had found what things they were, the prisoner walked in the yard with me, and begged for God's sake that I would secret those things, and I should never want for a guinea; Mr. Essex and I were walking together; the prisoner signified he had something to say to me; Mr. Essex walked on and then the prisoner said what I have just mentioned. I made him no answer at all.</p>

               <p>Morris. No, I did not; when he spoke to me to secret these things, he said he hoped that the person that cut his pocket would not offer it for sale, for if he did he would be stopt, for they were clippings; he did not say of what, nor did I ask him; I did not say any thing to it.</p>

               <p>Morris. Yes; I did not go before my Lord till the 30th of March; then I was examined and bound over to appear here.</p>
               <p>He was asked on his cross examination; whether Essex heard the prisoner ask him to conceal the circumstance of his having given him the things; to which he answered he believed not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about it?</p>
               <p>Baron. I am not sure whether I did or not; he was carried to the Mansion-house about two hours after on account of what he had been taken up for; I acquainted my Lord Mayor with what had passed about these things and produced them in Martin's presence; Martin saw them and said he found them in the middle of Hatton-garden; he was remanded back to prison touching this matter; my Lord Mayor sealed them up with three seals and I set the initials of my name by the side of the seals, and my Lord Mayor kept them; I received them sealed up from my Lord Mayor last Thursday, when I opened them before the Grand Jury; and I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodging?</p>
               <p>Baron. Yes; he told us where his lodgings were; one was No. 1 Huggin-alley, Wood-street; I found nothing particular at that place but a piece of a flint and a pot and a piece of stick; it was something of a melting pot, a small round pot with a hand in to it, it had some kind of cement in it, and it appeared to have been on the fire; and a piece of thin stick was in the pot; he had another place at St. Giles's which he gave the key of, in Nottingham-court, at the Red-Lion; I found there small hammer, a piece of file, a piece of box wood the same sort as that exactly, only it appeared to be a little more used in the same way as that is; I delivered these things to

               <p>Baron. Yes; a man who has since turned out to be one Draper; that was a fortnight after the first examination; he said on his first examination, he could produce a person to prove it; it was on the 13th of March; Draper came there and said he saw him pick them up; they disagreed in their accounts of the place, and my Lord Mayor would not let him be sworn.</p>

               <p>Sage. I know of none but edging of money; this file appears to have been used in filing of gold; this piece of box is what the coin has been run upon for the purpose of edging the money; it is put in this grove, and the box is run over it, which makes the impression upon the edges.

               <p>Q. And these scales are only common scales?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are scissars they have in every stable to cut horses heels?</p>
               <p>Sage. I think they would cut either a guinea or a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not any strong pair of scissars do that?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes, every pair of scissars of that kind.</p>

On the 26th of March I missed one of the silver spoons that were in my care: the prisoner was a milk carrier that served the family. A man came in the afternoon from the Rotation Office, and asked me if I had lost a spoon; I said we had; he said if I would go to the Rotation Office at five o'clock that evening I should see the woman that took the spoon: I went there; the spoon was produced; it had my master's cypher upon it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in West-street, Seven Dials: the prisoner offered me this spoon (producing it) on the 25th of March; I stopped her; she said it was a family spoon of her husband's; I asked her if she would go before a magistrate, and swear it was her property; she said, yes, and went eagerly; when I came to Mr. Welch's office it was shut up; I kept the spoon, and told her if she would come next day, and bring any body to prove it was her's, she should have it; she came next day and brought another woman, who said it was the prisoner's property, and gave her a good character. I would not deliver it up but took her before a magistrate; she there said she found it in Mr. Steward's passage.</p>
