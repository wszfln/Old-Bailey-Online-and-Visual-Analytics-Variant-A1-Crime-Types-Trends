                  </hi>. I am an usber at Worship Street Police Court—on Saturday night, 20th June, about 11.15, I was at the arrival platform at the Moorgate Street Station, leaving a train that had just arrived—the prisoner and two others got out of the same train, and passed out at the wicket gate before me, leaving some three persons between me and them—they immediately turned round to the left of the wicket gate, which was bolted halfway—the prosecutor was leaning with his arm on the gate, smoking his pipe—they all three surrounded him—I tried to get through to secure the three, but I was not able to do it—the prisoner took a watch from the prosecutor's left waistcoat pocket, and passed it to one of the other two men, who immediately tried to make his way behind the pro<lb/>secutor—the prosecutor turned sharp round, and seized him with his right hand, and as I rushed up <hi rend="italic">to size</hi> him on the left, he threw the watch between my legs on to the platform, among the people's feet—I called out for someone to pick it up, which they did, and gave it to one of the railway officials—I still kept hold of the man, and assisted the prosecutor and a constable with him to the station—at the station I gave a description of the prisoner—on 8th July I was sent for to the station, and saw the prisoner in the yard there, amongst eleven others, and I picked him out—he had the same coat on, and the same coat over his arm, but instead of a hat he had on a French peaked cap—I have not the slightest doubt of him; I would have picked him out of a thousand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not hear any argument going on before I saw the watch taken—you went straight up to the prosecutor, snatched his watch, and passed it to the other man—his name was Cook, and he has been convicted and sentenced to six months—there were three of you together—the third man was stopped on the third stair, and brought back by the policeman, but he was let go, as I did not see him take the watch—you were let go as well.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing close to the barrier that led on to the arrival platform—there was an argument taking place there concerning a man who had not paid his fare—I. stood listening to it—there was a second man taken, he was let go at the top of the stairs leading into the street.</p>

Mr. Molloy, of Hanley, in an action brought against him by Mr. Pugin—that action went on for some years; I think nearly three years—he claimed commission as architect and as builder also—the action ultimately went to arbitration, having been in existence nearly three years—there were an immense number of items—the case was called on for trial about 3.30, before Mr. Justice Brett, and when he saw the items he said he thought it had better go to arbitration, and it was referred to Mr. R. E. Turner—the particulars delivered in the action were about 138 folios—I don't consider that that arbitration was decided in favour of Mr. Pugin—we had to pay the costs of the whole of the action, but let me explain how it was—we had certainly to pay the costs of the trial, that follows from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> award—my clients had to pay their own costs of the reference and one-third of the plaintiff's costs—Mr. Pugin recovered 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the commission on his contract.</p>

Field, Roscoe, &amp; Co.—I told them my story and put the matter in their hands, and they have had charge of the legal proceedings from that time—I received these letters of the 12th, 17th, and 19th May—they are all signed by the defendant—I have no doubt about it—they are not written by him, but are signed by him.</p>

               <p>have to be supported by his friends whilst absent in America—I swore that because I had been told that by his brother-in-law—I did not know as a fact that at the time I swore that affidavit that he had gone to America, he was going, and I made an affidavit that he was going, and it was to get security for costs before he fled—from the time I dismissed him as architect he has sent me messages calling me a liar, and stating that I had defrauded him—the first of these letters is March 25th, but I had received letters before that, and they annoyed me enormously before that—I am a man of peace, and therefore would not feel disposed to commit an assault upon him—of course I am not ignorant of the number of times he has been before Police Courts, and I must feel that he has stained his father's name, and I do feel very strongly although I don't express myself so—I have not said that I was in possession of material that would send him to Portland and the bulks—I was dining with a friend of mine and a French friend, and after dinner we were talking together upon the subject, and I said I had consulted an eminent lawyer who said that the affair would be sufficient to send him to prison—I did not use the words, my lawyers "regard it as a fraudulent attempt to get money from me for which he ought to be sent to prison"—I have not said that I would prevent him from getting any work from Government, certainly not—I said his own acts stood in his way, and it was his own acts that would deprive him of them and not mine—I did not say that I would call the attention of those in power to his work, and he would not get work—I did speak to Mr. Gladstone about the extreme worry and annoyance I had gone through, but I said nothing to Mr. Glad<lb/>stone which would affect him as one who he would receive public work from—he was a competitor for some work, but there was not one who said "We can trust him," and they would not put him on—I am sorry to say that—I did not say that to Mr. Gladstone—I don't know that there was any conversation about this matter at all—I told Mr. Gladstone that he had given satisfaction, being an architect and builder too.</p>

                  </hi>, M.P. I have known Mr. Herbert for 20 or 30 years—he paid a lengthened visit to my brother-in-law's residence during the winter, and we had much conversation upon many subjects; amongst others he once or twice I think spoke to me of Mr. Pugin—I should say very confidently that he said nothing to me which would have prevented his getting any of the public work—I do not retain the details of his conversation—the subject matter was altogether painful, and one which excited my concern—Mr. Herbert is a very old friend, and Mr. Pugin one I had known less, but of whom I had heard in a general rather than in a particular respect—the conversation was certainly to the effect of describing to me the sufferings and annoyance which he had endured, and which he said had gone beyond all measure, so that he felt himself bound to resort to the law—I am morally certain if he had spoken to me a syllable on any such subject as the capacity or noncapacity of Mr. Pugin to receive public employment I should have remembered it, and I should say, with very great confidence, he never said such a thing—I may say that the office I held did not make it necessary for me to select archi<lb/>tects</p>

I carry on business at 84, Strand, with Mr. Harrison Frodsham as watch manufacturers—my predecessor was Charles Frodsham, and he used a particular trade mark "Charles Frodsham, 84, Strand, London"—upon succeeding to that business I purchased it and the right to put his name on the watches—that license was in writing from the trustees—in purchasing the business I purchased the license—we now use the name Charles Frodsham and put it on all our watches—we sell watches besides those of our own manufacture, but we put "Examined by Charles Frodsham"—we do not put the name on any watches that we have not either made ourselves or examined, and we also put "84, Strand, London"—in the beginning of March last Mr. Ford of the Poultry brought a watch to be repaired—I produce that watch—it is marked "Charles Frodsham, 84, Strand, London, 14881"—there was no name on the face—it had had a name but it was rubbed off—it is the custom to mark the principal parts of the watch inside, and that should correspond with the number on the watch—the number on the case is 438, and the number on the watch is 75438—I took the watch to pieces when it was brought to me to be repaired—I made that watch for Mr. Lloyd in November, 1865—I never saw it from that time until I saw it in the Strand—when I made it I was carry<lb/>ing on business in St. John Street Road—I have the book here relative to that watch—the manufacturing number which I stamped on the works of that watch when I made it was 75438—the date is November 10th, 1865—at that time I was not a member of the firm of Frodsham—I have only been so three years—I put the name on that watch of "W. J. Lloyd, London"—there is a slight mark on this plate of the beginning of the letter "N" for the word "number," that is all, the other has been filed and taken out—my employer was Mr. Lloyd—the number I engraved for him was 5438 instead of 75438, leaving out the 7—when I manufacture for a small maker I put on a smaller number—it is not a consecutive number in Mr. Lloyd's books—I am able to say positively that was the identical watch that I made—Lloyd is a watchmaker, and inasmuch as it would have looked suspicious for Lloyd's number to have been 75438 I left out the 7—throughout the works the number 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 75438, but the number that is seen is 5438—I had dealings with Mr. Frodsham before I went into his business, when he put his name upon a watch which he had not made himself, after the watch was completed he would spend 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more in timing it and examining it—he would not even trust to me to finish them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Parnall as foreman in the cutting department—Betts has been four years in the service as salesman, and Taylor was for seven or eight years up to November last in my department—he left early in November, and started in business in High Street, Kingsland—up to 12th December last he was a customer at Messrs. Farnham's for ready money, and after that up to 1st June he was a customer on credit—I have seen him there frequently during that time pur<lb/>chasing of Betts among other salesmen—on 1st June I saw him there making purchases of Betts; on that occasion I particularly noticed them—I saw one piece measured by Betts, not in Taylor's presence, after he had gone—he was with Betts about a quarter of an hour that day—after leav<lb/>ing Betts, Taylor went into another department and purchased something; I only saw him in one department after Betts—in the course of the after<lb/>noon I caused inquiries to be made at the entering desk and then went to our head clerk, and also to the packing department; I there found six parcels from Betts' department addressed to Taylor—I took one piece away and measured it, it was 20 yards—it was not the same piece I had seen Betts measure; this is the piece—these are the six pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

               <p>that were in the packing-room—after measuring that piece I communi<lb/>cated with the head clerk, and next morning, 2nd June, I went to a drawer of Betts' in the counter, and found there these two pieces of paper; they are Betts' writing—the sis parcels-were left in the packing-room all night, and were sent to Taylor's next day by Vale, the porter—it is customary for the packers to leave one end of the parcel open—these parcels were not open at one end when I saw them in the packing department—they were all tied over.</p>

Parnall's on his premises?—he said no, only those two pieces he brought away the day before—I then sent for Mr. Williams, who is in Messrs. Parnall's employ—Taylor said that he never bought more at a time than would make a pair of trowsers or a waistcoat or a suit—Mr. Williams came and said, referring to those three parcels, "This is Messrs. Parnall's cloth"—Taylor said "Yes, you are quite right. I bought them of Betts"—I said "How long is it since you had them?"—he said "About two months ago"—the top one was I believe marked 9182, and I asked him how much the quantity was—he said "That I bought for 3 yards and I have used 3/4 of a yard"—Mr. Williams measured it, and I measured it also; it is 4 1/4 yards now—the second piece is numbered 7443—he said "I bought that about the same time for 7 yards," and that he had not used any of it—it measured 8 3/4 yards—he said "I bought the light-coloured cloth for 10 yards and used 1 1/2 yards of it"—it was measured and contained 13 yards—I asked him about the invoices—he looked on his file and said that he could not find them, and I looked after<lb/>wards—while I sent the officer for one of Mr. Parnall's men Taylor referred to a piece of cloth and said "When we go to a firm they sometimes do give us a yard or two in; you need not say anything about that"—I said "I would rather you would not say that, because whatever you say to me I shall have to mention at the Police Court"—I took him to the station and took charge of the cloth, the buckles, and the braid—on 3rd June, after he was remanded, I made a further search and found this piece of braid on a shelf under some velvet in the shop—Betts wanted to see me—I went to the station and he gave me some information about the braid—I then saw Taylor, showed him the braid, and said "Betts says that you were there with him on the Monday and asked him to get you a piece of braid and you understood that he was not to enter it"—Taylor said 'That is quite right; I shall say nothing to you, what I have got to say I shall say to the Magistrate up stairs"—he also said "I have been seen at the Old Bailey and have been told all what you have found, so you see it is no news to me"—I had previously cautioned him.</p>

Taylor; total, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have entered the ready<lb/>made clothing as well—that would be entered by somebody else, but it went into the same invoice which was made out and sent with the goods—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Betts came to me with a piece of paper with the lengths on—he sometimes came with them in a book, sometimes on a piece of paper—he calls them over to me, I don't look at his paper—the lengths are measured before that—a parcel may contain 100 yards or 10 yards—there is no check that I know of, but I should not like to say—I do not send in the account, the ledger is in the counting-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I was in Messrs. Parnall's service about five years as warehouseman and salesman—Taylor was a cutter in the service when I first entered—he left last November—we knew each other—after he left we were rather friendly; and he invited me to go and see him at his shop, 80, High Street, Kingsland—on one occasion when I was there an end of silk attracted my attention—I recognised it as being in the prose<lb/>cutor's stock previously—I told him so, and he said "It is not worth while saying anything about it now, I have had it by me these twelve months and am afraid to use it in case it should be recognised"—he also said that he would show me how I could make a pound or two for myself—I asked him in what way?—he said "When I order any goods you can send mo longer goods than I order and charge them the lowest price, and if there is any difficulty about it, we can settle it when you come to see me again, I can make it right with you"—this was about the beginning of December, before he had opened the shop—Lam sorry to say that I fell in with his views, and the first parcel he had was early in January—I entered the parcels in fictitious descriptions and less lengths—the mis<lb/>description was to account for the size of the parcels; 10 yards of pilot would make as large a parcel as 20 yards of fine cloth—he told me if I did it in that way that would account for the size of the pieces—I should think our transactions amounted altogether to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I caused to be delivered goods 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in excess of what he was charged, and I have received from him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4 garments, and a length of alpaca—I cannot remember any particular instance before June 1st—on June 1st he came to the warehouse—he had told me previously that he was coming—he selected the goods which I have here and asked me to do the best I could with them—they would not make a very large parcel, and if I would let him have them he would see me next night and make it all right with me—six or seven pieces were selected—these memoranda (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the purpose of entering the goods are in my writing—he brought a pattern and said he wanted a quarter gross of mohair and three gross of trim<lb/>ming</p>

               <p>braid—I got some braid from Mr. Knocker and three gross of buckles—it was my duty to get those goods and get them entered with the cloth, and I described the three gross of buckles as a gross and a half—I gave the braid to Taylor and he put it in his pocket, and said "I will take this with me, it is not worth while entering this"—I mis-described the articles as to quality and price—this memorandum agrees with the invoice—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was found in my desk is in my writing, it is a correct list which I was to keep in case I was interrogated—Taylor told me to say that I had made a mistake in entering them—I used to see him at his shop in the evening sometimes once and sometimes twice a week—I had not stolen anything when he spoke to me about making a pound or two—I never stole any other things but those I sent to Taylor—I was in the cloth line before I went into Parnall's service—I was with Moses &amp; Levi two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never stole anything but what I stole for Taylor, but Mr. Watts told me that he had suspected me for some time—he did not say how long—some silk was lost from the alpaca department eighteen months ago—I was told to look for it but it was never traced—they thought it might have got between the fixtures—it was not under my control, I had not charge of the alpaca department, but it was adjoining my warehouse and you might call it the same—they did not examine my books—I am sorry to say that I fell a very ready victim—I fell into it thoroughly and made my fictitious entries under Taylor's guidance—he was a cutter when he was in the firm, and I have an idea that he knew all the rules of the establish<lb/>ment; he found out a good deal by questioning me—he gave me directions how best to steal the goods and how to secrete them—I told Mr. Watts that the goods would not reach 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not tell him I had received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides clothes; I said that I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and I thought it amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now because I have been thinking it over—I have been in custody six weeks—whenever I stole anything I made an entry of the genuine transaction for my own desk; they are not in my desk now, they would be destroyed after he got the goods, because there would be no further reason to keep them—I first became a thief about January 10th—the largest amount I have stolen at one time is 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but never to this extent before—this is 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on one occasion Taylor came and paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the cashier—one of the foremen, Mr. Leonard, a cutter, lived in Taylor's house, and he sometimes saw me when I went there—I made no secret of being there—the house is two miles and a half from the prosecutor's place.</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police, and reside at West Ham—on the evening of 10th June, about 7.50, I was called to the police-station and saw the deceased there on a stretcher—I examined him and found that he was dead—I saw no marks—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next morning about 11 o'clock, but saw no marks—the brain was very much extravasated with blood and congested—the lungs were healthy, the heart flabby and weak, the liver slightly enlarged and, in my opinion, diseased—I do not think that had anything to do with the cause of death—I cannot say what was the cause of death—the state of the brain was consistent with a blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.</hi> Death may have arisen from various causes, it might have been from apoplexy, the giving way of the vessels of the brain—the heart was in such a state of disease as to render death likely at any moment, but I should not have expected to find extravasation of blood on the brain from disease of the heart—from the condition of the liver I should think he had been a hard drinker—I saw no signs of a blow either exter<lb/>nally or internally, but, unfortunately, I never saw the body afterwards—I was very ill at the time—I would not pledge myself that death resulted from a blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Rotherhithe—on 17th May, about 10 a.m., I examined Hewson's head; it had been dressed and strapped up; I found three wounds on the right side, one was an inch and a half long, and another about an inch—they were clean cut wounds down to the bone—in wounds of the head you have them very clean cut in consequence of the resistance of the bone—they might have been inflicted by a policeman's staff—he is still under my care—he is still incapacitated from duty—they must have been very severe blows—he also suffered from inflamation of the throat, which might have been occasioned by the pressure of a man's hand.</p>

On Saturday night, 13th June, about 12.30, I was on duty in High Street, Borough, and saw a man named John Bryan there with some other men—I was with Constable Gillett 215, on the other side of the road—John Bryan was with four or five other men and three or four females making a noise, holloaing, and singing—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130055"/>
               <p>across the road and asked them to go away—Bryan said "Who are you? I am a detective; I am doing my duty as well as you," and he refused to go away—I said "You are making a nice noise, go away"—he struck me underneath the chin, and knocked me down against the shutters, and ran up Red Cross Court—I followed close after him, and when he got a little way up the court he said "Come up here, you b----, and I will slaughter you"—I followed him about 60 yards, and he ran up Little' Red Cross Court, which is up two steps, and went into the first door on the right—as the door came to, I made a run at the door and forced it open—when I got inside the place was all in darkness, and he struck me in the breast inside the door—I got hold of him and brought him out of the door; he was struggling and trying to strike me—I got him by both arms and as I got outside the door we both fell together down the steps; he falling on the top of his head—I never drew my staff at all—it was all done in a moment, and I had not time to think of my staff—I did not say in the passage "You b----son, I have been looking for you a long time and I have got you now"—I never knew the man before—I did not make a blow at him with my staff, strike the wall and break it—I fell over him down the steps; the other constable came running up the court, and we took the prisoner to the station—we did not stop in Red Cross Court hardly half-a-minute, being a very bad rough neighbourhood, we never should have got the man out—at the time we were in the hall or the front of the house I did not see the prisoner or any woman come down the stairs with a lighted candle in her hand—not a single person was present that I saw—Bryan did not say "I will go quietly if you will let me" not a word of the sort—I did not strike him in the hall—when we had the struggle outside and fell to the ground there was no one present but Gillett, and he came up and helped me to help the prisoner up—I never saw any one till we got out into the High Street—when we were in the court the prisoner was not at the door with a candle and in her night dress—if anyone had come into the passage with a lighted candle and in their night dress I must have seen that—the court is very dark and if anyone had been looking out of the door I might not have noticed them; but if there had been a candle I must have seen them—the Court is under an arch and the top is very dark, and I should have seen a light—the door of the house opens right into the room.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am divisional surgeon—at the request of Mr. Benson, the Magistrate, I examined John Bryan's head on 15th June, about 2.30 p.m.—I found a large contused wound on the left and rather on the back part of the head, about 2 inches long—it is always a difficult question to say whether such a wound was caused by a blunt instrument or by a fall; but from the position, I am inclined to think it was from the blow of a policeman's truncheon—I should say it was struck from before, backwards—the cut was across the head, not along it—I asked the man to show the position, and he did so—I examined the wound first without asking a question—I was merely asked by the Magistrate's clerk whether it was a truncheon blow or from a fall—that was the only guide I had to it—I examined the wound carefully, without asking a question, and after doing so I asked the man how it was done—my opinion before I asked a question wag that it was from a blow, but yet it might be produced by a fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen a good many dozen truncheon wounds before—it was very like a truncheon wound—from the position it was more like a truncheon wound than a wound caused by falling on the pavement—I should think it had been bleeding—the place was swollen, and I have no doubt that blood had come from it, although I did not see it—the blow that caused that contusion must have been one of considerable violence—it was from 2 to 3 inches down the head.</p>

White<lb/>combe" and I wrote the rest—I told her I was very sorry I could not pay her the balance then—she said "Oh, never mind, we are never short of money; I have been at this business fourteen years and never made a mis<lb/>take yet, in fact there was a man who used to live in Bermondsey Square and had apartments there who started some few years ago with nothing hardly, and he has made so much money by it that he will take very little of us now; he is almost independent"—I told her to call again on Satur<lb/>day—she said that most likely she would see me in the latter part of the next week; that there were two boats coming from Hamburgh to London, from which they got the goods, and that she was very busy this time last year and doing a rare trade—I paid her 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on account, and it was put on the same receipt—she said that she had made a mistake the previous night and signed her right name, and she had better scratch tha out and write her false one, and she scratched out the name and signed "M. Hall" underneath it—that was in my private house—a detective was present; he got into a cupboard when he heard her knock—I had been in<lb/>clined to have the door open at the previous interviews so that the detective, who was in another room, might hear our conversation, but she suggested that the door should be shut, and it was through that that I had the de<lb/>tective in a cupboard on the second occasion—when she came-in I asked</p>

               <p>her whether she had anything; she said "No, not yet, but my husband is out to night and will be out late, and I shan't know till he comes whether we shall have anything or not"—she spoke again about the four men in the gang, <hi rend="italic">lumpers</hi> who bring these things ashore—she said that the things were brought to her house, and there was a secret passage leading from her house to another, and that they did not bring them to her house till the goods had been sold by the sample, and that the things were generally brought ashore at 11 or 12 o'clock at night, and sometimes 1 or 2 o'clock—a deal of conversation passed, as the police told me to draw as much as I could out of her—the man in Bermondsey Square was referred to again, and she said "Do you know that party?"—I said "No"—she said "He lives over the water, and rides about in his carriage"—there was one skin over, and I asked her what she would charge—she said "We will not be particular about a skin. I will charge you three halfpence for them"—she said that she was in the habit of taking about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week at various places from publicans and chemists—she also said that she did not know what they were going to get till they got them; sometimes it was grebes and sometimes it was ermine—she said "In the case of jewellery we take the stones out and burn them, and in the case of skins we cut the marks out and burn them, so that they should not be known"—she also said "I would rather bring them here as it is handy for me, because there is the 'bus hire over the water, and another thing, we have to be very careful what we are about"—I paid her 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time, the balance of the account—she gave me a receipt, I said that I was very sorry I could not pay her at the time—she said "Never mind, we shall understand each other better in future"—I have seen her since she was in custody—I went to her house, 31, Gedling Street, that evening, 30th April—the police advised me to do so—I saw a little girl outside the door—there were some gloves in the window for sale—I went in with the excuse to buy a pair of gloves, saw her there, and she introduced me to her husband—I said "I suppose you have not been able to get any<lb/>thing lately"—she said "No, sometimes it is a month and we don't get anything, but we may get something within an hour from now; through the strike taking place last year we have lost a great deal of our trade"—that was the strike on board the boats—her husband said "Sometimes they like a change, and don't bring them to us but to other places"—the female prisoner brought out some tobacco and I bought 1 1/2 lbs. for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said that they had a great deal of that, and the man said so too—I said "It is a bad job you have not been able to get anything lately"—he said "Yes, it is a very bad job, but I will come round and see you as soon as I get some<lb/>thing "—he also said "I have got some black grains"—that is leather—I said "They will be no use to me"—I had no other interview; the next time I saw them they were in custody—this <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to the inspector—it is dated 8th April—this is the receipt.

This is only a small lot; this time last year we were very busy; we were having large quantities of skins from the steamboats, and I have no doubt next week, the beginning or the middle, I shall see you. In fact, even to night we are likely to have some; there are <hi rend="italic">lumpers</hi>; there are four in our gang they sometimes bring them at night," and she asked him if he would do with some tobacco or spirits—he said "I don't use that sort of thing, I don't require them"—she said "You will be sure to see me during next week"—I followed her home to 21, Gedling Street—on Saturday, 30th May, I went with Inspector Charlwood with a search warrant—the female prisoner opened the door—I told her to call her hus<lb/>band, and he came—I told them who I was, and that I had got a search warrant to search their house—I said to her "I am going to take you in custody for having in your possession, on 8th April, forty-six dozen and a half of ermine skins which you sold to Mr. Whichelow of Grange Wharf"—she said "I know nothing about the ermine skins at all, I have not sold any"—I took them to the station and produced these two ermine skins, and the receipt, and said "These two skins are a sample of the skins which were sold to Mr. Whichelow, this is your receipt"—she said "I know no<lb/>thing about the skins, I have not sold any to Mr. Whichelow, I know nothing about them;" Mr. Whichelow gave me the bulk of the skins and they were shown to Mr. Hirschel—the prisoner's house was searched and some pipes were found.</p>
