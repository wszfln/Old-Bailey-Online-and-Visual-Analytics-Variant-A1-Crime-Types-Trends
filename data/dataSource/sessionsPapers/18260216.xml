            . I held an appointment in the Customs, and am superannuated with a pension. I have known the prisoner Rigaud nearly two years - he lived over Westminster-bridge; I forget the name of the place. I first knew the female prisoner about May last, by taking her two letters from Rigaud; she then lived in the Borough - I saw her once there: she and Rigaud afterwards lived together, as man and wife, at Kentish-town. I frequently went there of a morning, and always found them both there - she went by the name of Rigaud. Last summer Rigaud proposed to me to go to Margate with him, as he was going to see a sick sister, at the baths at Boulogne - this was the Thursday before Sunday, the 10th of July. I at first objected, on account of leaving my wife, not being in the habit of ever leaving her. Rigaud said a sea voyage would be the best thing for my health - he prevailed on me to go. The two prisoners and I went down on Sunday, the 10th, and on Monday we went round the island, and to Ramsgate, to see after the packet, which was gone, or they would have started that day for France - we returned to Margate, and on Tuesday, the 12th, went to Dover; we got there about five o'clock in the afternoon, and while we were at tea Rigaud took a letter and a paper from his pocket, which he said was from Mr. Collins, whom I knew - Rigaud told the female prisoner it was a commission, and must be executed before they went to France, and that next morning he was sure of receiving a remittance, which he had written to Mr. Collins for; he immediately quitted his chair, and went out, and when he returned he said he had found two clergymen, and therefore should be sure - but we must make haste, as they were going out; he said I was to see the lady sign the commission, and to sign it also.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you knew the female prisoner by the name of Rigaud? A. Yes, and also as Eliza Foster, in May or the end of April, before they lived at Kentish-town - he said her maiden name was Eliza Foster; I never called her Eliza Foster till we got to Dover, but there he informed me she was entitled to some property, coming from a deceased relation, I think an aunt, and the reason of his wishing to hide the name of Rigaud was that she was of age, and had been kept by Lord Oxford, and, as his wife had left him, they should be very comfortable together.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he first tell you her name was Foster? - A. In April or May, when I first knew her. When we were at Dover I accompanied both the prisoners to a clerymen's house - he was out, and we went to the Rev. Matthew Armstrong's - the female prisoner was sworn - Rigaud and I witnessed her affidavit; we then went back to Payne's Hotel. Next day the prisoners set off for France, and I for London.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this affidavit - whose signature is this,"John Green," as a witness to it? A. It is not mine; the first time I saw this one, was in Mr. Freshfield's, the solicitor's, office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Rigaud at Hayes-place, Lisson-green? A. Yes, about the latter end of August; I was there one morning when he asked me to witness a power of attorney, for selling stock - I did so; this is it (looking at it) - it is signed Eliza Foster; I have attested - the signature I saw the female prisoner sign, and Rigaud witness it; I hesitated to witness it - he said it was merely signing the power of attorney, to avoid her going forward through the pressure of a crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What do you represent yourself to be? A. I was formerly comptroller for the port of Xerumentra - I have ceased to be so six or seven years; since that I have been endeavouring to recover a large property, but have not succeeded. I am nephew of Mrs. Margaret Farmer, and have a suit before the Court of Chancery, upon that claim; that is not the claim in which I said I did not succeed. I have met with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160004"/>&gt;no opposition from the Bank solicitor on that claim, except being sent to the Court of Chancery. I knew

            ; I have lost sight of him five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live at No. 9, Manor-terrace, Chelsea? A. I cannot swear that; I had given all my affairs into Rigaud's hands, as agent, to recover 50,000l. for me; he has mutilated my papers, and taken me in. I represented that Oldham lived at No. 9, Manor-terrace, at a Mrs. Day's - I believe he lived there, but never went to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call at that very house, and desire Mrs. Day if anybody called to inquire for Oldham, to say he lived there, but was out of town? A. No. I went there for Rigaud - I did not at first recollect the place. I visited a Mr. Day there, but you said Mrs. Day - I saw several women there, but whether any of them was Mrs. Day I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You visited them? A. No - I have been there with Rigaud, but never eat or drank in the house. I believe I went there but twice - I do not think I ever went there alone - I might, but it was after Rigaud had taken me there. On my oath I do not recollect going there alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call on Mrs. Day and say something about James Scuddemore Oldham? A. I went with Rigaud - he went into a house just by, and begged I would deliver that message to Mr. Day; Rigaud had no waistcoat, and was ashamed to go himself to the house, and begged of me to call and say if Mr. James Scuddemore Oldham was not in town, to inform any person who inquired after him that that was the case - I delivered that message to some woman. I have often seen Rigaud without a waistcoat - this was in April or May 1825; it was five or six months before we went to Margate, which was on the 10th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you know the prisoner Baker's mother, who lived at No. 3, Brandon-row? A. I never saw her mother. I took two letters to Brandon-row for Rigaud - he stood at the corner of the row at the time; we were walking into the City together, and he requested me to leave them, as he had promised to keep away from the house - I do not know that the name of the place is Brandon-row, but it was close by the King's Bench Prison. I saw a woman there, who immediately called the female prisoner down, on my saying I had a letter for Eliza; I do not know whether that woman was her mother - Rigaud said she worked for a Mrs. Baker, and I should see"Mantua-making done here" written up; I never knew the girl's name was Baker till she was a prisoner - I was told she was Eliza Foster when I went with the letter - I did not know her by any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you knew her as Mrs. Rigaud? A. I never knew her go by any other name than Rigaud; I never thought her his wife, because I knew his wife. - When I delivered the letters to her, Rigaud told me she wanted two months of being of age. I entered into no bond whatever - I signed some papers. I do not know what a bond is - not an Ecclesiastical bond.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not introduce a woman to Rigaud yourself at Dover, as Eliza Foster? A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not represent to Rigaud that Eliza Foster, living at Dover, was entitled to property of her aunt's, in the Bank, and request him to manage the business? A. I never did in my life. On our arrival at Dover a letter was received from Mr. Collins, enclosing the commission to Rigaud; we went to Mr. Armstrong's about six or seven o'clock in the evening, I think, and were there ten or twenty minutes; there was a curtain put down, and candles in the room - I cannot say what time it was. Rigaud received a letter next morning, from Collins, with 25l. - they then set off for Calias and I for town; I did not see them again till about the end of August. I never wrote to Rigaud on this matter. The signature to the affidavit is not my writing. I have never said I did not see Baker sign her name. I gave evidence at Bow-street, and do not know whether my evidence was taken down - something was read over to me. I read the paper which Baker signed at Lisson-grove - it was left in Rigaud's possession.

            ? A. I knew him about two years ago, when I had the misfortune to be in Whitecross-street prison, for about ten days; he was steward of the ward. About April 1825 I went to ask Alfrey to become one of my securities to a bond I was to give upon administering. I saw Rigaud in White cross-street prison after I made this communication to Mr. Freshfield - he gave me some duplicates in Whitecross street prison; I redeemed the property, pawned it again, and lost 6s. 6d. by it. I gave him the duplicates and a sovereign out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How came you to go to Mr. Day's in Manor-terrace? A. I had met Rigaud with Day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call at Brandon-row? A. When I got to the Elephant and Castle Rigaud asked me to deliver a letter to a lady, and said he would give it to me when he got to the corner of the street - I delivered it without looking at the direction; I recollect the female prisoner had her thimble on, and her needle in her hand. This is the instrument that was executed at Mr. Armstrong's (looking at it) - it has my signature. I saw the other parties sign it; I thought it extraordinary that Rigaud read it instead of Mr. Armstrong.</p>

            . I live at Dover. On the 12th of July, 1825, this commission was put into my hands - I administered the oath to the party described as Eliza Foster - the bond was then executed; the commission and bond were returned to the parties, who went away with it - I do not know any of the parties, - I perfectly recognize Rigaud's features, but cannot connect him with this proceeding.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect what time of day this happened? A. No; I only recollect the transaction by having signed the papers.</p>
               <p>The following documents were here read - the commission and oath, the bond, which described Eliza Foster as living<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160005"/>&gt;at Dover, and Rigaud at Fir-tree cottage, Camden-town; also the letters of administration, and power of attorney.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. I am a clerk to my brother, a proctor, of Doctors' Commons. Rigaud gave me instructions to extract these letters of administration - I afterwards received this letter from him, by the two-penny post; I believe it to be his hand-writing - I had seen him write before. I obtained the commission, affidavit, and bond, according to the letter - I received the bond back, inclosed in a letter, and extracted the letters of administration.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Rigaud employed you before? A. I had seen him several times before, as surety in administrations.</p>
               <p>Rigaud's letter to Mr. Watson, with instructions for a commission, in order to obtain letters of administration, in the name of Eliza Foster, of Dover, neice, and only next of kin of Mary Foster, late of Brook-street, Holborn, naming Francis James Rigaud, of Fir-tree cottage, Camden-town, and John Green, of Camden-terrace, as sureties, was here read.</p>

No Mary Foster was ever in my service - I was never at Philadelphia.</p>

The letter signed Mary Collins was dated Bordeaux, the 27th of June, 1825, addressed to Eliza Foster, Dover, informing her of the death of her aunt, Mary Foster, on her passage from Philadelphis, with the writer, stating that she had left a small sum in the Bank, Long Annuities, when she had left England in the writer's service, and advising her to administer, in order to obtain the same.</p>

On the 19th of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners came into the shop; I am certain of them both; Gardner came twice that day. On the 20th, about the same time, they came again; I recollected them immediately - they asked to look at a watch which they had seen the day before; Gardner said he wished to have it - he left 5s. as a deposit, and was to call in a few days for it. I am certain of them both; Gardner gave his name as West, and after they had paid the 5s. they were going out together - they turned back short, and left the door a jar; Gardner then asked to see some watch-chains, which were in a glass-case by the side of the window; he paid me 2s. 6d. for the chain, and went suddenly out of the shop; I directly missed a case from the counter, containing fifteen gold watches, and about seven silver ones; the case had been put on the counter twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before they came in; no other customer or stranger had been in the shop besides them, only a relation of Mr. Grant's. The case of watches was safe on the counter when the prisoners came in, and was within their reach; no one came in while they were there: I missed it a few seconds after Gardner left the door. The watches cost upwards of 400l. I immediately called the boy up, and ran into the street after them, but they were out of sight. The case was brought back to Mr. Grant's, by a ticket-porter the next day - I am sure it is the one which had the watches in it - here it is. I found Gardner in custody about a fortnight ago; I was taken into three different rooms, where there were thirty or forty persons - nobody was pointed out to me. I was told if I saw him to take no notice, but the moment I saw him the impression was so strong I immediately touched him on the shoulder. I saw Jones on the Friday following, at the Mansion House, among others, in the Justice room, and pointed him out to Mr. Cope, the marshal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was not Jones at the bar, under charge? A. I do not exactly know where the bar is; several people stood before him; he stood at a bar, among five or six other persons; I was not told I should see him. I was sent for against a person suspected to be the man; he was brought in after I got there, but I did not see him brought in, norin charge of any officer. Mr. Alexander Gordon, a relation of master's, came in a quarter of an hour before them. I had seen the case while the prisoners were in the shop; there was something singular in their appearance; Jones had a fustian coat. I know him by his face; his dress was very different when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Jones appear to you, at the Mansion House, to be in a more forward situation than the others? A. No, my Lord - three or four stood in the same line; and when I first saw him I did not know it was a place for persons in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your master any partner? A. No, nor any other Christian name. The case has a glass top; the watches were loose in it. I was behind the counter when they went out. The shop door is five or six feet from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the watches flap against the glass? A. They might, but if carefully handled I think a watch would not come against the glass. I suppose I was ten feet from the door - Gardner was very close to me at the counter, and intercepted my seeing Jones passing - He had a fustian frock coat on; I do not think the case would go into their pockets; he might put it under his frock coat; my back was to the door - it was broad day-light. Crown-court is two doors from our shop - it leads to Water-lane, and has two passages leading out of it. The case was not broken at all when it was brought back.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was your back towards them? A. Yes - only while I turned round to take the chain out of the glass-case; my back was then towards both of them; I only showed him one chain, and while I turned my back to get it Jones left the shop; Gardner remained, and paid for it. I had not time to put the cases in the window - there were four cases on the counter.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. John Threader, a hatter, who lives at No. 74 Fleet-street, next door to Mr. Grant. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160007"/>&gt;the 19th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was cleaning the windows outside the shop, and saw two young men standing at Mr. Grant's window; Gardner was one of them. On the 20th I was again cleaning the windows, and saw Gardner with another person, whom I thought was the same I had seen before; they stood about the door; I saw them go into Mr. Grant's shop - I went in to breakfast, and saw no more. I afterwards saw Gardner in custody, at a public-house opposite the Mansion House, and was sure he was the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was between eight and nine o'clock? A. Yes, and the same time on the 20th. I went to breakfast in less than five minutes after they went into the shop; I might be twenty minutes at breakfast, and heard of this loss directly I came down, after nine o'clock. Gardner had a black body coat on, and the other a fustian coat, with pockets on each side; I cannot say whether it was buttoned; there is a court next door but one to Mr. Grant's. I do not think it possible for Gardner to put the case into his pocket.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Grant. On the 19th of October I saw two persons, like the prisoners, come into the shop - I did not see their faces, and cannot positively swear to them; they left the door open, and I shut it by Bannister's order. I did not see them on the 20th, but was called up about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and the case of watches was gone. I had left the shop about half-past eight; it was then on the counter, and contained watches. I saw the prisoners when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw two men, whose faces you did not look at? A. I saw one of their faces, but did not take notice of them; the alarm was given before nine o'clock, I think - there were more cases on the counter, but they are of a different shape to this; I had dusted them, and know how many there were; when the alarm was given I looked and missed this one. The watches laid in the case, with a leather under them, but none on the top - they were not fixed; they would slide down if the case was turned up end-ways; it must be carried flat to keep them safe: they all had glasses.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are all the cases in the shop alike? A. No- they are all moveable; some of the others had watches in them.</p>

            . I have been a ticket-porter at Fleet-market three years, and live at No. 3, Five-foot-lane. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I picked up this case, with a bit of leather and paper by it, in Five-foot-lane, Old Fish-street, stuck in the window bars of Messrs. Yates and Hancock's premises, outside the window, by the area-grating; it must have been put there by somebody outside the house; it is a darkish place. I took it home, and at eleven o'clock that day took it to Guildhall, and was told to keep it till it was advertised. I took it to Mr. Grant's next morning, in consequence of what I saw in the paper; I left it there till to-day, and have now brought it here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is this place from Mr. Grant's? A. It is about three minutes walk - it is by Bread-street-hill.

On the 6th of February, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner pass me, and saw that the gate of the New Post-office had been opened - he walked on, looking back, then crossed, and attempted to take something, but a gentleman passed, and he went away. At a quarter past ten o'clock I saw him go and draw these saws from under the gate; I followed and collared him - he threw them at me.</p>

I missed a purse out of my basket, with a sixpence, eight pence, six half-pence, and a duplicate in it; I followed, and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped. I saw Morris pick up the purse, with the money and duplicate in it, in Union-street. The top of the basket lifts up.</p>

On the 7th of February, about nine o'clock at night, I was in my parlour - two men came in, but I could not see them - I know there were two men; somebody came in and put both his hands suddenly over my eyes and mouth. I know there were two, because I heard the other shut the door while the other held me - neither of them spoke a word; the first continued holding his hand over my eyes and mouth, while the other stepped up, put his hand into my pocket, and took out five half-pence, which was all I had about me; they still held me - I could not call out as he stopped my breath - they were about five minutes in the room - I made a kind of moan, as well as I could, and the lodgers came in - they ran out - one escaped, and the other, who was the prisoner, was taken in the passage. - I could not move the protect my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose your sight is bad? A. Yes, being old. The prisoner had no business whatever in my room - he once lodged in the house.</p>

            . I am an hostler, and lodge in the prosecutrix's house. On this night, about nine o'clock, I was with my wife in my room, which is exactly over the parlour; I heard a groaning noise, like a person in an apoplectic fit - my wife followed me down with a candle; I tried the room door, and asked Mrs. Hill, three or four times, what was the matter, but got no answer. I burst the door open with my feet, and the first man I attacked was the prisoner; there were two of them, but the moment I seized him the other man rushed out, and snatched the candlestick out of my wife's hand: the prisoner and I were down in the passage for five minutes, and the other man was five minutes before he could find the door. I succeeded in detaining the prisoner - he had no right in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you tell whether the other man was older than the prisoner? A. I consider him younger - he left his hat behind, and it would hardly fit a boy sixteen years old.</p>

            . I am shepherd to Mr. Partridge, who lives at the adjoining farm to Mr. Gilson. A man, named Sharp, came to me to look for a sheep - I looked into my flock, but it was not there - I then went away. I did not see the skin found, but he came to me afterwards on a Sunday, to help him to get a down sheep-skin out of a pond; I looked at the head, which was on the skin, the tail and the entrails were wrapped up in it. I have not seen the skin since that Sunday, when Sharp's son came and took it away. I am not sure I should know it now. Sharp is since dead - I did not see the constable.</p>

            . I am constable of Little Stanmore. The prisoner lived by the poor-house; I went to search his house on a Sunday in November, and found nearly a whole sheep in a drawer where he kept his victuals; it was undressed; it appeared not to have been cut up by a butcher, as they would have cut it more handsome. I kept it till it was quite tainted; the skin was afterwards brought to my house by Sharp; Mr. Gilson was not there when it was brought, but he came there on Monday, and saw the same skin and meat that were brought to me; I saw them putting it together to compare it, but I did not take notice of it. I heard the prisoner was at Paddington and went there on a Saturday night, five or six weeks afterwards, to apprehend him; I told him what I took him for - he did not say a word - I know he has worked hard and maintained his family.</p>

             re-examined. I went to the constable's house on the 30th of November, as near as I can recollect; I saw some skin and some mutton there - I assisted in comparing them - they tallied together in my judgment - the joints were not cut off as a butcher would have cut them; the joints of the legs and shoulders fitted with the parts left in the skin, and there was part of the fleece left on the breast of the mutton which was found; I think it was the sheep belonging to that skin - the skin was marked I. A. - the same as the sheep which were left in my field - it is here now - I had not missed the sheep, but the shepherd told me of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many sheep did Mr. Allen send you? A. Forty-two; I saw them all right on Saturday the 26th of November, in the evening; the shepherd told me on the 27th, that one was lost; I saw the skin and meat at the constable's house on Wednesday, the 30th; I counted the sheep on Monday morning, the 28th, and there were but forty-one. Mr. Allen lives about forty-six miles from me - I had none from him this season before this flock. I do not know whether there are any flocks in the neighbourhood marked in the same way - it was a Down sheep - there are other South Down sheep in the neighbourhood, but not marked in the same way to my knowledge, Sharp was Mr. Allen's shepherd - I should think the sheep I saw had not been killed within the time I had heard it was missing - I have no doubt that it was one of the forty-two.</p>

            . I am a shepherd, and have been so many years - I live with Mr. Jones. I compared some mutton, and a skin, at Mr. Tomlins' house - the meat fitted the skin exactly - every joint as firm as possible - I did not notice whether any of the fleece was left on the meat - it was a South Down sheep - there were the two legs, two shoulders, two breasts, and a piece of the loin - nearly the whole sheep - the head was along with the skin - there was a mark but I did not notice it. (Looking at the skin). I am sure this is it - the leg is cut off at the arm instead of the fetlock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a most unfortunate man; I have four small children. About fifteen months ago I lost an affectionate wife; I was very bad, and have the misfortune of a heavy rupture; I was at work on the Saturday and came home in the evening, when my eldest child, not twelve years of age, said "Father, some man has been here with a bag of meat, and he said he should call and see you again to-morrow or the next day;" I said"Pooh! pooh! he will call for it again;" "No, (he said) you are to fill our bellies." I gave them a part of it, and put the rest in the drawer - the constable knows I worked hard.</p>

            . I am head constable of Worship-street-office. On Wednesday, the 25th of January, I received information at the office, which I communicated to the Magistrate, who directed me to go to Mr. Edward Lawson's house, <placeName id="t18260216-8-crimeloc43">Brown's-lane, Spitalfields</placeName>

                        targets="t18260216-8-off41 t18260216-8-crimeloc43"/>, and take away a placard which was nailed against the window shutter - I went with Kennedy and Vann, two other officers; the window shutter was closed - I ordered Vann to take the placard down; we took it to the office - there were forty or fifty people in the street at this time; I was then ordered by Mr. Bennett, the acting Magistrate, to go with sufficient force to execute an assault warrant, which was in possession of Armstong, an officer, who went with us - seven officers, besides myself, went - we were to execute the warrant if we could ascertain whether Mr. Edward Lawson was on the premises; he is a currier; his brother was in the house with him. We proceeded to the front of the house in Brown's-lane - it was shut up - we went to the side door, in a wall in Corbett's-court, leading to the back premises; there is a yard on the other side of the wall - Armstrong tried to obtain admittance at the side door, but no answer was given; at that time I heard a great noise, as if they were placing heavy articles against the door. I went into Mr. Bennison's hay-loft, adjoining the premises, and looked through several holes into Lawson's premises, saw eight or ten persons walking up and down Lawson's second floor loft, which adjoins Mr. Bennison's loft - it is an open loft, where they dry leather; the holes were so small I could not ascertain how many there were; I heard a great noise, as if they were moving tables to the side of the shed, to barricade it - that hindered our view. Attfield called me to look through a hole - I there saw a pole, with something at the end of it, standing against a post in the shed; Armstrong had a dog which went through one of the holes, as far as his head and shoulders - it immediately yelped and drew back - next morning I found it had received a cut in the right shoulder; we then left the loft; I went to the office, to Mr. Bennett, and on returning, met Armstrong, and from what he said, I went with him, Kennedy, Attfield, and several officers, into the hay-loft again. I looked through a hole, and saw several men in the loft; I asked them to kneel down that I might speak to them more conveniently - two of them did so; I told them what I had come about, and charged them, in the King's name, to aid and assist; after that I left the loft, went to the side door, got my officers round, and ordered them to draw their cutlasses, which they did - there were eight of us - but I had no cutlass at that time. I tried to break open the side door with two crow bars, but could not succeed. I fetched a ladder from Mr. Bennison's yard, and placed it against the top of the wall - Armstrong immediately went up the ladder, with his warrant in his left hand, and his constable's staff in his right, and when he got to the top of the ladder I observed a pole, with a sharp instrument at the end of it, jobbing at his head and neck - he standing on the ladder, with his head above the wall; the jobbing was repeated, and he parried it off as well as he could; Hanley then gave Armstrong a pistol, which he fired. I then heard a noise in front of the house, and immediately went to see what was the matter; I saw the first floor window up, and a female standing there - she said to the mob"My brother is shot, why don't you come forward and protect him;" she then put the window down, and withdrew. I went to the office, and as I returned met the officers in Spital-square, with the prisoners, and one of Lawson's men in custody; I took them to the office, and sent for a surgeon to Lawson, who had a slight wound in the thigh, as I afterwards found. Vann, Hanley, Attfield, and I, returned to the premises, and in different parts of the premises found twenty-four of these poles, with sharp instruments at the end of them; also fourteen currier's knifes, with the cross ends broken off. In front of the house were currier's tables heaped up from the floor to the ceiling, and behind them were hogsheads, filled with bricks and stones - it was blockaded every where to prevent access.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had your first communication with the Magistrate any thing to do with the execution of the assault warrant? A. No; my instructions were to fetch away the placard - the Magistrate afterwards ordered me to go and execute the assault warrant. I believe it was granted on the 29th of December - it was the duty of the officer who had it to execute it immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not arranged that you should use this warrant as the ostensible reason of your going there, when your real reason was on account of the placard, and the people being gathered? A. I received my instructions from the Magistrate, and cannot state their reasons. I had no warrant when I went to take the placard down, and did not then know of the house being fastened furthen then the shutters being up; I had not heard that it was barri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160011"/>caded. I had heard that Lawson had turned the taxgatherer and exciseman out. I stood about two yards from the bottom of the ladder when Armstrong went up- the wall is above twelve feet high; the ends of the ladder were a foot or more above the wall. Armstrong's head and shoulders, and part of his breast and arms, were above the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not go up the lndder with a cutlass in his hand? A. I will not, for my attention was divided with the men above and below; I saw his hands scuffling with the pole, but will not swear whether he had a cutlass or not. I did not hear him say "I have killed one man, and now give me another pistol."</p>

On the 29th of December this warrant was given to me to execute against Edward Lawson (read); I attempted to put it in force several times but could not, because the premises were shut up. On the 25th of January Mr. Twyford and Mr. Bennett inquired about it - I said I could not find the man; they directed Garton to take all the officers with him; I went with them; I went into Mr. Bennison's loft, and, after remaining there some time, Adams and Hanley came, and in about twenty minutes Adams pointed out Edward Lawson to me in the loft - several others were there; the warrant was then in my hand; I said "Mr. Lawson, I have a warrant against you for assaulting and beating Mr. William Smith;" there is an open board all along the loft, about nine inches wide - I read it through the hole quite loud, and mentioned my name, with the name of every officer with me, and then said "Mr. Lawson, if you will give me your word, as a gentleman, that you will come to the office with two housekeepers, and put in bail, we will leave, and send the mob away;" he said "I will not;" I said I would give him ten minutes to consider of it, and if he did not I would break open the promises. He said "You may do as you like;" I then went down from the hay-loft, with the other officers, to the side door in Corbett's-court. Two of Lawson's men were on the wall; I told one to come down and I would shew him the warrant; he came down and read it; I assisted him over the wall, to acquaint Lawson; I waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then kicked the door loudly, and knocked twenty or thirty times - a ladder was then brought - it reached about four feet above the wall; I went up with my warrant in my left hand and my staff in the right - I had nothing else. When I got to the top of the wall I perceived Mr. Edward Lawson and three men, in the yard - the prisoner, James Lawson, was one of them; but I did not then know who he was. I said "Mr. Lawson, here is the warrant against you, and surrender;" he had a long pike in his hand - this is the very one (pointing it out); it has a knite at the end of it- he pushed at me, and the first push missed me; he gave a second push, aiming at the hand with the warrant in it, and cut my hand just at the back of my little finger - it went into the palm of my hand - he pushed at my head and body, and pushed at me four or five times afterwards - he did not say a word to me, nor I to him, during this time. The wound did not affect me at all - it bled for two or three hours - he made two or three other thrusts at me - one came very near my head - I warded it off with my staff - Vann was at the bottom of the ladder, and said"Josh, why don't you shoot him?" I said I had no pistol - Hanley came half way up the ladder, and gave me one - it was ready cocked; I saw Lawson making another attempt at me, and I shot him; he ran backward into his house - I thought he was stunned - he staggered - I said"I have shot him, but keep on breaking the wall that we may apprehend him." In less than two minutes he came out of the house, and said "Armstrong, you have shot me;" he then took up the pike which he had left against the wall; I said "Ah, and if you come out of that door I will shoot you again;" his brother was walking about, close to him, with his hands in his pockets - he had never offered to come near at all. The wall was nearly broken down, and Edward Lawson said "Armstrong, come down and I will surrender to you;" I said "Put that pike out of your hand, and I will;" he gave it to his brother, who came to the door and gave it to Vann. I said to the officers "Mr. Lawson has surrendered to me - I will go in;" I jumped off the ladder; he said "I put myself under your protection," and walked to the office with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You shook hands together? A. Yes, and drank together. I received the warrant on the evening it was signed. Mr. Smith never directed me to withdraw it; about a week after it was issued he told me the business was in the hands of the commissioners, and I had no occasion to execute it. I did not see him afterwards till Lawson was in custody; if I had met Lawson in the street I should have taken him, because the Magistrates never allow an officer to discharge a warrant; it was the same warrant as I at first received, for I kept it all the time - when warrants are discharged we file them in the office, but never destroy them.</p>
               <p>Q. James was walking about with his hands in his pocket - was he in agitation? A. He was, and he appeared interfering to prevent any thing; he spoke to the men, and they went away; he spoke to his brother several times - I cannot say what he said, but there is no doubt of his wishing his brother to give in.</p>

            . On the 25th of January I went with Garton and other officers to Mr. Lawson's premises - we at last forced through the door in Corbet's-court, got into the yard, and saw both the prisoners there; we brought away two or three pikes from the yard; I seized James Lawson, took hold of a pike which stood in the yard, and said to him, "You villain, what made you use such a villainous instrument as this?" he said, "I thought," or "I considered I had a right to do it, in defence of my brother"- he made no resistance.</p>

            . I am an officer. I accompanied the others to execute this warrant - I stood at the door in Corbett's-court, with my cutlass; some persons were breaking the door down with crow-bars, and as soon as a hole was broken through at the bottom a spike darted through the hole, and went very near the legs of the person who was breaking the wall down; he broke the knife off the end of it with the crow-bar. On the 30th of January I saw Edward Lawson in the public-house next door to the office - some conversation took place, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160012"/>said he was very sorry we did not fire at the first onset, for if we had, his men would all have been staunch to him - I mentioned to him about the spear coming through the hole in the wall - he said, "That was me - the knife was broken off, and I got another spear."</p>

            . I worked for Mr. Edward Lawson. - On the 25th of January I was there, when the officers came - I think it was between twelve and one o'clock; we were at dinner; the premises were barricaded - I was in the loft with master, and heard the officers speak to him; he was in the loft when the warrant was read - we heard it read through the opening; I afterwards got over the wall to the officers - I read it then, returned, and told master it was for a common assault, and wished him to surrender - he wished till seven o'clock to consider of it. I made my escape through the window into a neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Before you told him he did not know what it was for? A. Yes - it was read to him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAWSON. I have consented to forego my defence, and leave it to my counsel, but I will say I had no malignant intention towards Armstrong, or any of the officers; I knew they did not come to execute the warrant, but, however, I have consented to withdraw my defence.

            . I am a brush-maker, and live at the corner of Corbett's-court - my premises overlook a great part of Lawson's. On the 25th of January I saw the officer come, with some papers in his hand; I stood at my window, which was open, opposite the wall where the ladder was placed; the window is on the ground floor, but a little elevated, as the pavement is above the road; I was above many of the people's heads. When the ladder was brought I saw Armstrong go up, with the papers in his hand; the ladder projected above the wall, and while he was going up I saw a dirty looking pole put up, from behind the wall; the person using it was endeavouring to push the ladder aside from the wall; this was while Armstrong was going up, for he slipped in going up - the pole worked up and down to catch the step of the ladder; when Armstrong got to the top of the ladder I saw him perfectly clear - he had his staff slung on his wrist, and a cutlass in his hand, and in his left hand were some papers - the staff hung on his wrist, by a piece of string, and the moment he got to the top he cut at the pole, and hit it, and, I think, he cut it; he then grasped at the pole with his left hand, and caught it in his hand at the third grasp; he immediately let go, and turned his hand round to shew his brother officers, and I saw the blood - I am certain he got the cut by grasping at the pole; his shoulders were not above the wall; he had to raise himself to chop at the pole; he peeped as it were into the yard; his head was a little above the wall; there was nothing to prevent their poking the pike into his face if they were so disposed; he came half way down the ladder, and got a pistol from another officer.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Armstrong's back was to you? - A. Yes. I am quite positive he had a cutlass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when he came down the ladder for a pistol, in which hand did he take it? A. I am not certain, but he had it in his right hand when he went up; he shifted the cutlass out of his right hand under his arm; when he got to the top of the ladder he had the pistol and cutlass also, both in one hand; I cannot say where the staff was then; it hung to his wrist when he cut at the pole.</p>

            . I am a plumber. I was in the street when the officers came to Mr. Lawson's door - I went up to the first floor window of a neighbour's house, which is opposite, about thirty yards from the house, and could see plainly - I was about two feet higher than the wall; the ladder was placed considerably above the wall; I then saw a pole, with some instrument at the end, pushed against the ladder, trying to push it away; the shoulder part came against the step of the ladder - this was before the officer went up. I then saw Armstrong run up very fast - he slipped in going up, he ran so fast; he had a cutlass in his right hand, a staff and a paper in his left; I saw nothing in his right hand but the cutlass; I was looking at him in an oblique direction; his left arm was nearest to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it easy for you to tell in that direction whether the staff was on his right or left arm? A. I think so; immediately as he got to the top he saw the pole, and made a cut at it; he attempted to cut it again, and with his left hand tried to catch at something, and succeeded in grasping it - he immediately turned round, and said something to the people, and came down partly; a pistol was handed to him, which he afterwards fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was his head above the wall? A. About midway.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the catlass when he took the pistol? A. I think he had both in one hand, but I was agitated at the time, and seeing the pistol I directed my eye down into the yard, to see the consequence. I live in Lamb-street; I have nothing to do with the prisoner, except being a creditor of his.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old, and live with my mother, next door to these premises. I was at our first floor back window, looking into Lawson's yard, and saw a sword or cutlass and a staff in the officer's right hand, and a paper in the left; as he ascended the ladder I saw a staff slinging, I think, to his right wrist; I was about five yards from where Lawson stood; when the ladder was put to the wall Edward Lawson put up a pole, and pushed it, before Armstrong shewed himself on the wall, and when he came up Lawson put up the pole two or three times, as with intent to push at the ladder; Armstrong tried to lay hold of the pole, and at last he laid hold of the knife part of it, and tried to wrest it from Lawson's hand - Lawson held it fast, but did not attempt to pull it away; Armstrong let go, and his hand bled; he descended the ladder, and returned with the pistol; he cocked it when he was on the wall.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the cutlass when he took the pistol in his hand? A. I believe he took it in his right hand, which had the cutlass; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160013"/>were both in his right hand - he had nothing in the left when he fired.</p>
               <p>Q. If he held both in his right hand how could he cock the pistol? A. He fell back, and pulled the cock back cautiously, for fear the pole should come up again.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there any thing to prevent Lawson stabbing him in his head or breast? A. Nothing - he did not attempt it, but lodged the pole on the wall, and pushed it two or three times.</p>

I was on Lawson's back wall, which parts his premises from Butcher's; I heard something said about a ladder, and saw one three or four feet above the wall; I could only see the part which was above the wall; I could see into Lawson's yard - I saw him take up a pole to shove the ladder aside; I then saw Armstrong get up the ladder, and make a chop at the pole with his cutlass; he then put his hand out to try and catch hold of the pole once or twice, and at last caught hold of it - I observed nothing further.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What were you doing on the wall? A. Looking on, the same as others; I was not on Lawson's premises before I got on the wall.

            . I am a butcher, and live in Lamb-street, Spitalfields. I was in Brown's-lane, at the top of Corbett's-court, about thirty feet from the spot, and saw the ladder put against the wall - the spear was put up with a view, as I thought, of putting away the ladder, or to intimidate any person from coming up. I saw Armstrong ascend the ladder, with a cutlass in his hand, and, I believe, a staff; I am positive of the cutlass - I was on his left side. The moment he reached the top of the wall he chopped at the spear, and then made a grasp at it with his left hand, and at last got hold of it; he let go, shook his hand, and I saw a stain of blood; he then received a pistol from below, and fired it over the wall, with his right hand. I saw him cock it first.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What did he do with the cutlass? A. I will not swear what he did with it - he cocked the pistol with the thumb of the same hand as he had it in.</p>

I was present all the time the officers were there, in my first floor room, directly opposite Corbett's-court. I was about twenty yards from the ladder, and was on the second floor part of the time. When the ladder was put against the wall I saw a pike put up, and on Armstrong's ascending it was slightly moved - he then struck at it with a sword or dagger, once or twice, and then grasped it with his left hand; he let go, reached down, and received a pistol from a brother officer, and fired; his head and shoulders were above the wall when he cut at the pike; they could have struck at his head or body; I think I could have run it through his body if I had been there; I was astonished he did not strike it through his head; it appeared to be directed strait to his head - it only appeared to be placed there for defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. Which hand did he take the pistol in? A. The right - I think he still held the cutlass, but really I cannot say; I could not see whether the pistol was cocked.

I was by Lawson's premises when the officers were there; I was in Mr. Gardener's workshop, where I work, and could see where the ladder was placed; I saw a pole, with a knife at the end of it, put up; Armstrong got to the top, and called out for somebody to hold it, for attempts were then making to poke it away; after that he made two or three cuts at it with his cutlass - he then ascended higher, and grasped at the pole, to wrest it away; he turned his hand round, and I perceived it all over blood; he came down, and received a pistol, which he fired.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Had he any thing in his left hand? A. When he first went up the ladder I believe he had the cutlass in his right hand, and the staff in his left, and, I think, the warrant was in his right; he fired the pistol with his right hand. I believe he had given the cutlass and warrant to the person below.</p>

             re-examined. I cocked the pistol myself, and then handed it to Armstrong; he had his staff and warrant in his left hand then - I believe he shifted his staff from his right to his left hand, to take the pistol - he had no cutlass then; one was handed up the ladder to him after he fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Garton order you all to draw your cutlasses? A. Yes, when he had broken in - I believe we all drew them. After he had fired he came down and gave me the pistol; I had no ammunition, and shortly after handed him up my cutlass; I had not seen him with one of his own; he beat at the pike with his staff.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. I received the goods from Bird - there was a piece of drngget and two paper parcels; I gave them to Bolton, our carman; I saw him pack them up into a cotton wrapper, and I put the name of Hodges on them - they had been sold to Messrs. Hodges; I put them in the cart, which was standing at the Snow-hill door, and gave them into the hands of Bolton; I told him to put them on the near side of the cart, over the horse's back; I saw no more of them till I saw them at Guildhall, on the 11th of February - the paper, with the mark of Hodges upon it, was there. I have no doubt whatever that it was the same package; I had not seen the prisoner near the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this? A. In the City; Bolton is a carman, and is generally employed for Boyd and Co. It had ceased to be the property of Messrs. Boyd and Co. - they were in my care; I go with the cart, or some other person does; the goods had been delivered to Bolton to carry to Hodges, and the cart was his property.</p>

I saw the package at Guildhall, on the 11th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160015"/>&gt;of February, and am quite sure there was the same quantity of pieces in it as in the package in my cart; I saw the direction in Pavely's hand-writing, but I could not swear to it; a servant of the house generally goes with my cart, and Pavely was to have gone with me then; I had goods of Messrs. Boyd's to deliver at different places. I did not miss any other package, nor see any person about the cart.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday, the 1st of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-bridge, near to Snow-hill, and saw two persons, one of whom I believe to be the prisoner; the other person had white stockings on, and a thick stick in his hand, which he leaned upon as he walked; I followed them, and observed them looking at different carts on Skinner-street and Snow-hill; they then ran after a curricle, which went up Snow-hill pretty quickly; I went after them, and went up Cock-lane - I returned back, and passed the prisoner, I believe, standing on Snow-hill - I went down to Holborn-bridge, turned back, and saw the prisoner with this package on his shoulder, at the corner of Snow-hill, about thirty yards from No. 6, going towards Holborn-bridge; I looked round for the other man, and saw him coming along, about 10 or 15 yards behind him - he appeared to be the same man, by his dress, whom I had seen with the person who, I suppose to be, the prisoner; I let the prisoner go to the light part of Fleet-market, when I pushed sharply on, and got up to him; the other man then cried out Oh! and the prisoner let the pack fall down on the ground; I had my hand on him at the time, and took him to the Compter; I got a person to take the package first to the Compter, and then to the Mansion House. I did not know who the package belonged to till Thursday or Friday week - it was then claimed by a person from Messrs. Boyd and Co.'s.

He was charged with robbing Mr. White, but nothing was found upon him.</p>

               <p>JUAN ANTONIO COVIAN (through an interpreter). I have lodged six months at Delia Bailey's house - and keep my money in my bed-room closet. About eight days before this robbery the prisoner came to my house to inquire for another Spaniard - I did not know him before. On the 21st January I was out all day - I returned about six o'clock in the evening and took some money from the cupboard, to get my dinner; I then left two sovereigns and four half crowns safe in the closet, which was not locked. I returned from dinner at seven o'clock, and missed it all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the people of the house access to the room? A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of January, after six o'clock, the prisoner called, and asked for Covian - I said he was not at home, and it was uncertain when he would be in - he said if he waited till eleven o'clock he must see him - I then shewed him into Covian's bed-room, staid a few minutes with him, then went into the front room on the same floor - I had not been there more than five minutes when I heard him rattling money; I entered the room and saw some half-crowns in his hand - immediately on my entering the room he said "I cannot wait any longer, and will see Mr. Covian to-morrow morning" - he then went away, and nobody else entered the room till Covian returned, nor had any body, except me, been there since he went out - he missed his money immediately he returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember when Covian went out? A. About six o'clock - I was in his room, or the adjoining one all the time he was out - I am quite certain nobody but the prisoner was in the room. Next morning Covian missed some shirts and handkerchiefs from his linen - I did not observe that the prisoner had any bundle - the room door remained open while he was there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a native of South America, but have lived in very respectable situations in this country for many years - I received this money from former employers - I had received three sovereigns from a Mr. Holland - George Baring, Esq. also, in the same week, gave me some money, and Mrs. Sharp, of Park-lane, did the same. My landlady can swear to my having a considerable sum about me the whole of the week. Some clothes were lost at the time, and the servant knows that I had no bundle when I left the house. Is it not likely that the person who stole the clothes also stole the money. My business with the prosecutor was to gain a situation. My character could be borne testimony to by George Baring, Esq. (I was his butler eight years); also to William Baring, Esq. - also Mr. Johnstone, deceased, of Gloucester-place, and in the establishments of Mrs. Sharp and General Taunton, both of Park-lane.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You prepared it from the warrant? A. Yes; the body of it; but the names and addresses I got from the party themselves - I asked Gardner where she resided.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the names and descriptions from written instructions? A. I cannot exactly charge my memory, but think it was from word of mouth - they could see the warrant.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Who produced the warrant in their presence? A. I brought it into the office - they accompanied me to the surrogate; the oath was administered to the same person who signed the bond - [Samuel Trueman here produced an affidavit of property from the Legacy Duty office] - this affidavit was prepared by me, by direction of Rigaud - they were written directions - I read the affidavit over to the administratrix who signed it in Rigaud's presence - it was done at the same time as the bond was signed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen Rigaud on these sort of transactions before? A. Several times; I have known him four years; he represented himself as employed by parties to obtain administrations, and has done so through me four or five times - he has since applied for administration to the goods of John Richmond.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did he bring an instrument to you for that administration? A. Yes; it was signed Eliza Baker - but letters had been granted - he called and took those papers away - I could not get them back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. I suppose the name is immaterial when letters are applied for? A. If persons take the oath we take it for granted they are the parties.</p>

I have known the female prisoner from her birth, about thirty years, and knew her father and mother - they went by the name of Meek - I saw the prisoner last about July or August - she always went by the name of Meek - I never heard of her having a relation named Ricci, but I had very little knowledge of her relations - I never heard of a person named Gardner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not she absent from your sight some time? A. Yes, for seven or eight years - I think she lived at Brixton when I saw her last.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Were the prisoners charged, before the Magistrate, on this particular case? A.

I knew Rigaud had been residing at Worthing; I went down there on the 16th of November, and seized his papers - I did it on my own authority. Meek was taken into custody there, on a charge of misdemeanor; some papers, partly burnt, were brought to me, and they brought to my knowledge these felonies - there was no charge of felony against them then; Rigaud was in London at that time; he did not send me word that he had surrendered to Whitecross-street. I gave directions for his apprehension, and an officer brought me ward that he was taken by the Sheriff. I saw him at my office four or five times between the 4th and 16th of November, respecting the claim of one Eliza Garner, to property in the Bank, in the name of Baylward.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. What claim was it? A. The claim of a young woman, described as twenty-one years old, by the name of Eliza Garner; this bond was given in evidence before the Magistrate; I gave Rigaud notice of this bill being found before the last Sessions.</p>

               <p>The affidavit of Eliza Gardner - that she was so related to Joseph Ricci, praying that letters of administration might be granted, and swearing the effects to be under 300l. - two powers of attorney, from Eliza Gardner, to Rigaud, for the sale of the stock - another administration bond, describing Eliza Gurner neice and only next of kin of another person, which was also proved to be signed by both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MR. LANCASTER re-examined. The bond was executed in my presence, in the registry, where they are always deposited - I brought it here to day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Meek put in a written Defence, denying that she had ever signed any of the papers, and all knowledge of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Rigaud, in a long address to the Court, went through the same line of Defence as on the former trial (page 139), representing that he had been employed by several persons, as agent, to recover funded property, and that a Mr. Issitt applied to him to procure this property for Eliza Gardner, and upon inquiry he had no reason to doubt the statement; he complained of an illegal warrant being issued against him by the Bank solicitor, whom he had frequently called upon respecting this claim - that the expenses paid for administering, together with his own charges, would amount to the notes traced to him.</p>
               <p>HENRY TAYLOR re-examined. I remember the prisoner bringing back the letters of administration, to have the word spinster inserted.</p>

I left town on the 24th of January, and, I believe, my books were all safe - I returned on Sunday, the 5th of February, and on Monday evening, after a consultation which lasted till ten o'clock, I went to Inner Temple-lane, and saw a great light in my room - I thought they were on fire; I went up, and found both doors were closed; I had told the prisoner always to shut the chambers at dark, and take the key to my house, in the New Kent-road. I knocked at the door, and receiving no answer I went to the gate watchman, returned to the chambers, and met James Sullivan (whose brother had formerly been my clerk), in the passage, with a law bag of books - papers were hanging out of it; I passed him, and went up, but did not succeed in getting into the chambers - we got a smith, who could not pick the lock; we heard a boy inside cry out, "Who is there?" and as we were drawing a bolt the door was opened from within; I found the prisoner there, and Wilson, who is a stranger; nobody could get to the chambers without Sullivan letting them in; I ordered them both to the watch-house, and as there was no constable there I let them go. I returned to my chambers, lighted a candle, and found the leaves of a volume stripped of its cover, on the desk, and next morning I found several book covers on the top of the book-case.

I found four pages of Horace there - I missed the whole volume; I also found a volume of "Wentworth on Pleadings," with notes of my own writing; I missed six volumes out of ten. We found in the shop a large quantity of my book, and a large butter flask full of my books; there were three hampers full of leaves of books; most of them in my own hand-writing; I lost between three and four hundred volumes; they must have cost me 700l., and many of them cannot be replaced; there were manuscripts, which I had been preparing twenty-two years; there were nine volumes just ready for the press. In consequence of further information I sent to Mr. Parker's pork shop, at the corner of Fetter-lane, Fleet-street; I went myself in the evening, and saw a large handkerchief full of my own volumes - also confidential letters, and valuable securities, which had been in a cupboard under the book-case.</p>

Parker did not examine it - he asked where I brought it from - I told him from my brother in Bellyard - I have no brother there; I took some more on the Monday to Torkington's, Chancery-lane - Mr. Moore met me on the stairs with them; some were long books - I rereceived 8d. for them - he said he gave three halfpence a pound; I was taken up next night, and told what had happened.</p>

I have known the prisoner about six weeks - I went to Mr. Moore's chambers on Monday evening, and saw a large fire in the grate, like paper ashes - the prisoner was on a chair at the library, putting up books - Sullivan had taken a very large one from the bottom shelf; he ripped the leaves out, burned the cover, and put the inside into the bag, which was half full when I got there - Sullivan went out and sold it; he brought the money, and threw it on the table; I do not know how much, but we could only find 6d. - the prisoner and I spent it as we went home; Mr. Moore came and knocked at the door; the prisoner said, "It is master, don't speak a word or he will put me into the cage;" I at last said, "Who is there? open the door Thomas;' he opened it, Mr. Moore came in, and we were both taken to the watch-house, and as the constable did not come, Mr. Moore discharged us; the beadle fetched me next morning, and I have been in custody ever since.</p>

On Saturday, the 14th of January, about half-past eight, or twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop and asked the price of a silver shaving-box in the window - it was five guineas; he said it was too expensive - I took out a dressing case with silver boxes, and handed him the soap-box out of it, that came to 3l. 10s.; he said that was too much, and asked the price of a plated one, which we had not got; he said he was recommended by a customer of ours, and wished to see one about six guineas; I shewed him two or three - I got a dressing case which was fitted up at 16l., saying I could put glass boxes instead of silver, which would reduce it to nine guineas - all the fittings up were then safe; I shewed him another, he then said he would have the one at nine guineas, but wished to see the plated articles in it; I said it would take an hour or two to fit it up - he pressed very much to have them in - I went to the back of the shop to get them, and was there some time - when I brought them they would not fit the box; he said, "You can fit them up and send them to me at twelve o'clock;" and while he was giving his address, one of our workmen came in - he immediately left the shop, leaving his address, "Mr. Johnson, 13, Norfolk-street, Strand;" the instant he went out, in consequence of what the workman said to me, I looked and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 11l. 10s.; they were all safe two minutes before he left; he was about a quarter of an hour in the shop; I am positive he is the man - I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. He went out immediately as the young man came in? A. Yes, in a minute or two, as soon as he gave his address - he was writing it when the workman came in - I am confident he is the man - when he was first taken, I saw him by a different light, and said if he had been in the same dress I should know him better, but I had a shade of doubt about him.</p>

I did not; I said, if he was in the same dress I should know him better - but at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160022"/>&gt;time he was in a disguised state - he had a loose handkerchief tied round his neck, it came over his chin, and he was quite florid in the face, which was not the case when he was in the shop, but I understood he was taken in a public-house; I pointed him out instantly from two other men who came into my shop with him - I discovered afterwards that they were officers, but did not then know it; Mr. Herring came in, told them to pull off their hats, and said, "Now, which of these three is the man?" and I pointed him out - I was confident of him - I did not express a doubt - I had a shade of doubt that night on account of his florid appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that several depredations had been committed with goods of this sort? A. Yes; he was remanded, and one shopkeeper I know came forward, and could not identify him; I am confident he is the man - I had seen him at the shop window before he came in.</p>

            . I am a journeyman pocket-book maker. On the 14th of January, nearly at nine o'clock in the morning, I came into Mr. Lambe's shop, and saw the prisoner there for a minute or two - I saw nobody there but Lambe and the prisoner - he was a stranger, but I am positive he is the man; I went in pursuit of him within a minute or two of his leaving the shop, but could not find him; I saw him at Bow-street on the Tuesday morning after, and pointed him out in the office; I have no doubt whatever of him - when I went into the shop he was giving his address - I made an observation to Lambe when he went out - I heard him tell Lambe to send the things home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a perfect stranger to you? A. Yes; the office was full of people - the officer touched me on the shoulder - I turned round and said, "That is the man;" he was among a dozen people - I did not see him come in - I was attending to another case, and the moment I saw him I recognised him - I was wiping my shoes on the mat when he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to No. 13, Norfolk-street? A. Yes; there was no such person as Johnson ever lived there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 14th of January, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was coming along Pall-mall, and met Lambe's servant - I went to the shop, Gonge and Lambe informed me of the robbery, and described the person to me; I met the prisoner the moment I came out of the shop - he answered their description - he was crossing from Northumberland-house to Messrs. Drummond's bank - I said, "Tom, I want to speak to you;" he said, "I am going sliding, master;" I said, "Tell your woman I won't keep you a minute;" (his girl was with him); he turned about two yards from me to speak to her, and off he ran as hard as he could - I was not two hundred yards from Lambe's - a great number of people were passing in the street; I went back to Lambe's and told them to attend at the office; I spoke to two or three officers, and on Monday night, the 16th, I found him in custody, and took him to Lambe's shop - the witness Lambe was in the shop - I told him I had got Rhodes, and to be very particular whether he was the man or not, and if he had any doubt to let him have it; when the prisoner was produced, he certainly expressed a little doubt, but at that time his dress was altered, his hair was combed straight over his forehead, different to what it generally is, and he kept spitting as if he was half and half - he had two handkerchiefs on his neck, different to the way he was dressed on Saturday morning; he was taken to Bow-street next morning, and the two witnesses swore positively to him; I was in the office - Gouge called me, and said,"There is the man;" and said he had no doubt whatever of him; there were about twenty persons in the office, prisoners and strangers, when he pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not at the bar? A. No, he was in custody, but a person coming into the office could not know that; he was on the platform.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him, do you know that he ran away, except that you lost sight of him? A. I am sure he ran, but I could not tell which way - I did not see him run, but he was gone in a moment; when he was in the shop, I told all three to take off their hats - two officers were with him - it was a cold night; it is not uncommon to wear an extra handkerchief.</p>

My wife let the man in with it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 16th of January, about twelve o'clock in the day, I went with a search-warrant to No. 40, Clipstone-street, and searched the second floor front room; Cutler, who was with me, found ten volumes of Shakespeare's works in that room, and among the dirty linen this cloth; I drew the staple of the cellar door, which was locked, and found two hearth rugs, a small carpet, and a cloth, in a sack; I waited till half-past ten o'clock at night, when the prisoner came home, with his wife; I followed him up stairs, and walked in after him - I told him I wanted him, and to put up his hands that I might secure him; his wife begged to know why I took him; I said he knew - he said he did not; I told him it was on suspicion of having robbed Mr. Palmer, and did he know such a person - he said he did not; I told him I meant Mr. Palmer, of Berkeley-square - he again said he did not know him; I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found two clock keys in his coat pocket; I asked him where the clock belonging to them was - he said he knew nothing about it. When I took him to the office next day, I asked where the clock was - he said he did not know; I said he might do as he pleased about telling me, but his wife was in custody, and though I thought her innocent, I feared I should not be able to persuade the Magistrate so, and she might be committed, but if the clock was found in all probability she would be discharged, but if it was not she would not, and he might do as he pleased about telling me; I said, "I don't wish you to tell me," and was about to lock the door to leave him; he said something in answer, and in consequence of what he said I went to Wren's, in Great Titchfield-street, on Tuesday morning, the 17th, and there found the clock, which I produce; I knew nothing of Wren before. I found the small key opens the clock case, and the larger one winds it up- the keys are numbered 430, the same as the clock. He said to me, "Stop, I will tell you where the clock is - it is at Mr. Wren's, a cabinet-maker, in Titchfield-street, where I took it to be repaired." I found a boot in his bed-room, which I took to Mr. Palmer's garden, which the back drawing room looks into, and compared it with a vast number of footsteps; the boot exactly tallied with the marks - some of them had left an exact impression - it fitted them. I found a ladder in a small yard between the garden and stables; there is a coach-house between the garden and mews; there were marks of dirt by the coach-house door, as if a person had been over there; I could get in that way, by getting on the coach-house gates into a small yard, over the top of the stable, on to a shed, and that is the way the footsteps went; there was mortar broken down by the shed wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found a ladder and marks too? A. Yes - he must get over the wall to the ladder. - The boot is a common size, but the heel is flat like a shoe. I searched his lodgings for a clock, but found none.</p>

            . I can swear to these ten volumes of Shakespeare; I have brought the seventh volume. I also know the clock and rug - the keys were kept under the clock.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I believe the clock to be mine - it was bought by a relation, and, I understand, cost twenty guineas; it is certainly worth 5l. Shakespeare's works are worth five or six guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought these things in the way of trade on Thursday, the 12th, at the door of Machin and Debenham's sale rooms, King-street, Covent-garden, of a person appearing to be a porter; he told me he had bought them there, and had frequently seen me buying things there, but I did not recollect him - I gave him a 5l. note, two sovereigns, and five shillings - 5l. for the clock, 1l. for Shakespeare, and 25s. shillings for the rugs and carpet. I put the rugs and carpet into the cellar, which I frequently use for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a butcher, of Newgate-market. The prisoner is my nephew; I lodge at his father's, in Black Horse-square, Aldgate; he sleeps with me; I have lived there about three years. On Saturday, the 4th of February, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - he went to bed with me, and got up about eight o'clock in the morning; he could not have left the bed without my missing him; his mother generally takes the key of our room. I never saw him wear a light coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What business is he? A. He works for his father, who is a tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you go to Newgate-market? A. Two or three times a week. I have no stall; I cut a little meat, and sell it there on commission. I pay any one who lets me cut it on their stall. His father sent him out on Monday, after a man who owed them money.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister - he was at home on the 4th of February, and did not get off the work-board till the clock struck nine; he went to bed between eleven and twelve - he sleeps with my uncle; I saw them both in bed - my mother locked them into the room, and kept the key till between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, when I went to the bed side, and called my brother and uncle up - my brother never wore a great coat of any description. On Monday morning my father sent him to look after a young man, who was in our debt, and we had heard he lived somewhere about Bloomsbury - my father told him to search every public-house about there. My mother is now confined to her bed, in a dying state.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who is the man who owed you money? A. William Hullen - he did live in Ayliff-street. My mother always locks them into their room, and never will trust me with the key - they never get up till they are called.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. On Saturday, the 4th of February, I left work at eight o'clock, leaving my two sons to finish a coat; the prisoner left work at nine - he went to bed at eleven, with his uncle - they were locked in, and my wife had the key; he got up about eight o'clock. I sent him on Monday to look after a man who owed me money, which I was to have by instalments - he was a wine porter, and I heard he had got a situation about Bloomsbury. I told my son to search every winevaults and cellar, and if he saw a wine-cellar to stop till somebody came out; he never wore a great coat. My wife has not been out of bed since she heard of this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it your wife's custom to lock up your son and brother every night? A. Yes. My brother is out of business - he used to carry on business at Newgate-market, and was a carcase butcher in Warwick-lane - he has left off business this three years, and lives with me.</p>

I followed, and caught him in the Pancras-road, with it under his arm; he had ran about two hundred yards; I left him in a shop, and met Wheatley walking down a street, about 50 yards from Mr. Sibel's, towards where Lowerbank had run. I secured him, and took them both to the office, with the coat; there was a snuff-box and handkerchief in the pocket.</p>

The prisoner was nearly two years in our service. On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock at night, as he was leaving work, I stopped him at the gate, and said he must be searched, but nothing was found on him; I accompanied the officer to his premises, leaving him behind; they brought down two yards and a half of linen; he immediately said "This is my master's property"- the officer said "We do not want you to implicate yourself." I could not identify it myself - he was employed the day before in cutting linen of this description, and in a book, in his own hand-writing, he has entered forty-eight garments cut from this duck, which three pieces would make, and by cutting them rather small he might leave two yards and a quarter over - it was of the same quality as the garments cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you two or three different firms? A. No; the names of Favel and Bousfield are over our door, but the first is only there by courtesy.</p>

No; we allow no perquisites - the remnants should be used up in the next quantity cut - we allow nothing to be taken off the premises; I had cautioned him against taking any thing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see them brought to your stall? A. No; I am certain he did not say he had only come for another person - he said, they must be sold as early as possible, for he wanted to pay a bill; he neither said they were his or they were not - I paid very little attention; I should have paid the money to him, for I have known him personally for many years, seeing him three or four times a day in the market, and considered him a very respectable man; I considered him a jobber.</p>

I went after him as he was going out of the area, with the door in his hand, brought him back, and found the teapot in his basket, under the oranges - it is worth 5l. and has master's initials on it - he was given in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am eight years and three months old, (this witness, upon being questioned, appeared perfectly aware of the nature of an oath); I live next door but one to Allford. I was standing at the top of Wood's-buildings, about ten yards from Allford's house, and saw two persons at his house; there was a gas-light at the top of the court, but I could distinguish their features without the lamp at first, as it was not dark when I first saw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160030"/>- I saw them for about half an hour; I am quite sure the prisoners are the persons; there was a hole in the window - they put a hand in, drew the nail out, and put it down the gully hole - the window remained in its place; they lifted it up and got into the house - one of them got inside the house, and the box was shoved through the window - they put it into a cart and drove away with it - there was day light enough to see them when they opened the window; I saw them again about week after, in Devonshire place; I had seen them before the robbery, and am quite sure I cannot be mistaken in them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention that you had seen persons get into the house? A. Allford's wife was at the water cock next day, and we told her of it - I told her I knew them and their names - William Bean, and the other is called Taylor - we called him by that name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know where they lived? A. No; they were taken up a good bit afterwards - it was a fortnight after, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not seven weeks before they were taken? A. Yes; they were taken in Devonshire-place - I did not see them afterward till then - one had a black coat on, and the other a light white one; I could only see Taylor's waistcoat, as Bean's coat was buttoned up - they had their hats on all the time; I was rather further from them than I am now; I did not go home, but played about with some other boys - it was dark when they went away - there is a gas-light at the top of Wood's-buildings; I went round to the front of Allford's house, and saw them - I peeped round the corner; I do not know Harry Lane; Shipley and two or three others were playing with me.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, in North-street - about the length of a short street from Allford's. I heard of this robbery about three hours after it happened - about half-past four o'clock that afternoon, I was going out of my room door to call my children into tea - it was nearly dark - I saw a young man whom they call Harry Lane, with a box - it appeared to be large - I could not see the colour - and by the time I had shut my door I heard somebody going up stairs, and heard a woman say, "What have you got there?" my children made such a noise, I could not distinctly hear - but I heard her say to the man,"Take it down, or I will kick it down stairs;" after that I saw the man go by the window with a box - I think, by the light, it must have been brown or black; I did not give information about it - but when I heard the prisoners were taken, I mentioned it to their friends.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoners before? A. Yes, for a long time; Swile is a tailor by trade, but sells things in the street - he has an ass and hampers. Bean gets his living in the same way.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES LEA. Q. Did you take the prisoners from the description which Sumers gave of their persons or only their names? A. He described their persons as well; he said one was dressed in black, and the other in a light coat; they were so dressed when I took them.</p>

A gentleman picked her up - she held by the rails, and could hardly stand. When they had got the umbrella one of them was standing under a baker's window, whistling; this gentleman was coming by. I pointed him out to him - he had not got the umbrella, but was one of those who illused her, and pulled her down - the gentleman laid hold of him; I am sure he is one of the party; the prisoner is the boy I am quite sure; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge - he was with the boys all the time - it lasted about an hour, I think. I stood some distance from them - he is one who waited at the window for her; there was a light in the window; I am positive he is one of them.

On the 24th of January I went into Devonshire, on account of my father's illness; I returned on Sunday evening, the 5th of February, and on Monday evening, the 6th, about ten o'clock, I was passing my chambers, and on looking up at the window I saw a much greater light than a candle would give- I went up stairs, and knocked loudly at the door several times, but received no answer; I then went to the gate watchman, and on returning up stairs I met a boy, named Sullivan (whose brother had formerly been my clerk) -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160032"/>&gt;he had a common law bag quite full of books and papers- I am sure it was then past ten o'clock. I had Sullivan, Chilmead, and Wilson taken up afterwards, and from their account before the Magistrate, I procured a search-warrant; and on Wednesday or Thursday morning I accompanied Cousins to No.93, Chancery-lane - the name of Torkington and Son is over the door. On entering the shop the first thing that struck my attention was a page of the octavo edition of "Pickering's Statutes," round some butter, which a person was about to take out of the shop- the youngest prisoner was in the shop. The work consists of forty-two volumes; I have lost seventeen of them; they were all safe when I left town, I believe - I can sefely swear that full one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty volumes have been taken while I was from town- [four large hampers of books were here produced] - these are all full of books, parts of books, and papers; here is aprt of "Wentworth on Pleadings" - I lost six volumes of that work; here are several parts of volumes of that work; several of these have my own writing on them- here is "Pickering's Statutes," and</p>
               <p>"Cummins' Digest"- I had seven volumes interleaved - they are all here except a volume and a half; here is a manuscript of my own, and another of a late pupil of mine - they were intended of publication. I believe all the papers in these hampers are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. The property to a stranger, in its present state, is only waste-paper? A. Pecisely so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Among thses papers do you find considerable portions of a volume not disjointed? A. There are in many cases volume after volume still cannected together - most of the books are octavo; here are two volumes ouly stripped of their covers, not at all disjointed. I believe the prisoners bear a most irreproachable character.</p>

            . I am ten years old, and live with my mother, who is a tailoress on Clerkenwell-green. On a Monday night I went ot Mr. Moore's chambers, and saw Chilmead, who was convicted on Saturday night; we put some books into a green bag there - the covers were torn off; Thomas Chilmead and Wilson tore them off; we put seven or eight books into the bag - some were large, and some small; the bag was almost full; we could not conveniently carry more. I met Mr. Moore when I had the second bag full - that was as full as I could carry it; I carried it to Mr. Torkington's, in Chancery-lane; I saw Osgood Torkington in the shop; the father was weighing butter on the other side of the shop - there are two counters; I think he could hear what I said to Osgood; I only said I had brought some more paper - he said, "Let me look at it" - I put the bag on the counter - he took some out, and I put some in the scales, and he put some into the scales too; he put in a large and small weight, and paid me 8d. for it; that was for both bags full.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag you took before and the one you took then? A. Yes - he gave me 8d. for each bag - I amd sure of that- I do not know the weight; he gave me a 6d. and 2d.; I delivered him the same quantity as Mr. Moore met me with. When I took the first bag I saw Osgood Torkington; the father was weighing butter then; I asked Osgood if he would buy that paper; he said, Yes, and asked what I wanted for it - I said 4d. a pound; he said he could not give so much as that, he could only afford three half-pence per pound; we put it in the scales, and he gave me 8d. for that also.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time was the father near enough to hear what was said? A. Yes - I believe he heard. I do not recollect anything more that was said; he asked me where the second bag came from - I said from my brother, in Bellyard; he did not ask my brother's name, nor mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not been spoken to on this subject at Bow-street, and other places? A. Yes; I have been in prison a fortnight to night. I was accused as a thief at Bow-street. My brother was formerly a clerk at Mr. Moore's - he is now a writer, and lives at Westminster. We all three tore the covers off the books - I am sure of that; we burnt most of the covers.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have said? A. Yes. Wilson said he tore none off, but he did. I had sold some before to Mr. Parker, and knew what he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not get 31/2d. a pound for each bag at Torkington's, and return to your companions and say you got but three half-pence? A. No, I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not accused at the office of eating cheescakes and custards oftener than they could get them? A. No; I used to eat custards. I sold the paper for 11/2d., because Chilmead said it was better to get that than nothing, and that he did not know any other place where they would buy it. I did not get 31/2d. a pound for it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, for one of these bags, get half a crown and two shillings? A. No - I got but 16l. for the two bags. My brother has not told me what to say here; he was in the coach which took me to Bow-street, but Mr. Moore and the constable were with us - also Chilmead and Wilson. I work for my mother, at sewing.</p>
               <p>Mr. CARRINGTON. Q. Why did you not take this paper to Fetter-lane? A. They said they did not want any more. I went to Torkington's by Chilmead's direction; I took the second bag about a quarter past ten o'clock - they were just shutting up the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. Q. Does not the whole appear to you to be waste paper? A.

            . I am a printer, and live in Gough-square. I sell a good deal of waste paper - if sold in the ream it is 5d. or 6d. a pound, but in the state this is in 4d. a pound; worse than this is continually sold for 4d. - we sell the author's proofs; 11/2d. is greatly under value - we get 4d. a pound for worse. I should think the bag produced would weigh 8lbs. or 10lbs. if well filled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You sell proofs and works which are spoiled? A. Yes. It is ca<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160033"/>&gt;pable of being used for many purposes, which this is not. I know nothing of the sale of old books; all this would fetch 4d. a pound. I have seen books at the booksellers', with the covers cut off, but for what purpose I cannot say. I should not consider this paper, in the state it is now, fit for anything but waste. I should not feel surprised at seeing it sold for waste.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you expect to see, as waste paper, books, not only without covers, but still adhering together by their backs - should you think it strange? A. I should certainly require to know where they came from; some of these leaves are connected, but not many; here is one that appears new, but the title page is torn off; here are pages from 913 to 1916, progressively. As a printer I should inquire about this, but what a cheesemonger might think I do not know.</p>

            , JUN. I am the eldest prisoner's son; he was a grocer, and retired from business, but took this shop for my brother; he afterwards came to live there, and helped my brother a little; we usually give 31/2d. and sometimes 4d. a pound for waste paper. I know Sullivan; I cannot exactly say what day it was that he came to the shop - it was one evening, about an hour before the shop was shut up, I think, but cannot exactly say- my brother dealt with him; I saw him pay 5s. 3d. for the paper - it was for one bag; I do not know whether any one else was in the shop except my father; after Sullivan was gone I calculated, by the Ready Reckoner, 18lbs. at 31/2d.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. Q. How long was this before the shop was shut? A. It might be about an hour - somewhere about eight or nine o'clock; the paper was in a blue bag. The 5s. 3d. was paid for the contents of one bag - it is a large shop; I did not notice whether any one else was there. I was sweeping by the door as this boy came in; the door-way is about three feet wide - a person might pass me without my knowledge.</p>

            . My husband is a supernumerary porter of Lincoln's Inn. I was at Messrs. Torkingtons' shop, and saw a boy there, who I think was Sullivan; Osgood Torkington and him were weighing paper at the further end of the shop. I was waiting to be served. Old Mr. Torkington was standing at the desk on the opposite side- I saw old Mr. Torkington lay down 4s. 6d. to the boy; when he went to the counter the son had laid down no money. The boy refused the 4s. 6d., saying it was not enough; he went to the scale, and pointed to one weight, and asked Osgood what that weight was; I believe it was between nine and ten o'clock. I heard Osgood call out, after he had weighed the paper, "Eighteen pounds;" that is the reason Mr. Torkington laid the money down, I think- when the boy refused it I heard Osgood say, "Eighteen pounds," pausing a moment, as if he was reckoning, and then say, "five shillings and three-pence;" he went towards the till, and I do not know who gave the remainder of the money; old Torkington laid down half-a-crown and two shillings; I did not see the boy take it up - I saw him leave the shop, and the money was gone then. I should not have taken further notice of it, but my husband saw this affair in the paper, and that brought it to my mind.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Reuben Fletcher, a proctor, of Doctors' Commons. Rigaud applied to me on the 21st of September last, to obtain letters of administration to the effects of S. G. Bailward; he brought written instructions, which I produce; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160034"/>&gt;said he came from Mr. Collins, and wanted a commission to be sent, if possible, that day, for the purpose of administering the oath to a party in the country. When I began to prepare the papers I found I had not sufficient particulars, and wrote some queries on the paper which I have produced, and sent them to Mr. Collins' office, and received them, with the answers, on the following morning. In the course of that day Rigaud called, and desired the commission might be sent to him at the Sussex hotel, Bouverie-street. I sent it on the 22d, with the bond and affidavit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been proctor for Mr. Collins on many occasions? A. Mr. Fletcher has transacted business for him before.</p>

            . I am a proctor. I was absent when these instructions were given. On the 3d of October I received the commission bond and affidavit, swearing the effects under 450l., enclosed in a letter, dated the 2d of October, from the defendant Collins; I had letters of administration extracted in consequence of these documents, and sent them on the 4th or 5th of October, to Mr. Collins, at Captain Rigaud's, post-office, Worthing, enclosed in this letter, (looking at it). On the 27th of October I received instructions from Collins to enter a caveat against any other letters of administration being granted to the effects of Bailward. On the 3d of November I received verbal instructions at my office, from Collins, to take out another commission, to reswear the administratrix under the sum of 18,000l. - and on the 8th of November I delivered that commission to Collins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you before that received instructions from Rigaud to increase the amount? A. None; it is not unusual to enter a caveat. The great increase of the amount from 450l. to 18,000l., naturally excited my suspicions - and I saw the Bank solicitor between the 3d and 8th of November; I was not desired not to caution Collins about it - but considering our communication was confidential, I did not think myself at liberty to inform Collins; I have done business for him on one other occasion; I live opposite to him - he is a solicitor - I considered him respectable; it is not unusual for strangers to apply for administration, but we generally subject them to inquiry; there is no occasion for an attorney to be engaged.</p>

            . I am deputy accountant at the Bank. Here is a petition and two affidavits which were left at the Bank - I cannot say who by. Mr. Collins called frequently to know whether this claim was in a state of being admitted; I told him from time to time that it was not satisfactory, and further evidence would be required; (looking at four letters), I believe he brought these after I told him that; they were annexed to the first papers - I gave them all to the Bank solicitor, and finally referred him to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Can you tell me at what time you saw Collins? A. The latter end of October - nothing more particular passed; I have no recollection of his saying the parties could all be produced if it was required.</p>

Bailward, upon Mr. Bailward becoming of age; I know some money was transferred to him by the Accountant General at the termination of that cause - he is now forty-one or forty-two years old; I have known all his family intimately all my life - he has several brothers and sisters; he had no sister named Garner or Gardner - his sisters are all living except one, who died single; Mr. Bailward is still living, but labours under an infirmity, which prevents his receiving his dividends, or authorising any one to do so - I saw him three weeks ago.</p>

Rigaud took the house ready furnished, on the 19th of August; Issit, Rigaud, and Baker (who was called Mrs. Rigaud) came first, with a servant boy - Meek came on the Thursday after - they lived very expensive at first - Issit and Meek used to sit with the family; Issit was usually called Mr. I - I thought it was Hie till to-day; I have heard the trades-people in the town use the name of Routledge. Mr. Collins, the defendant, came down on the 29th of September, and staid a week or rather more - all the defendants were in the house that week - they lived in one family; Meek (who passed by the name of Gardner) went to Broadwater with Issit - it is nearly two miles off - the Rev. Mr. Wood lived there: I acted as servant at the house all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They walked out together the same as any one else? A. Certainly. The only time I heard the name of Issit was when a Mr. Evans, of Little Hampton, called to see them twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was not Meek always called Miss G.? A. Always G. or Gardner; they frequently spoke to each other by their initials. I believe Issit passed as Mr. Routledge at Worthing. Mr. Collins came on Michaelmas day - he appeared in health.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not many respectable people visit there? A. Only Mr. Evans, a surgeon. Rigaud had a sister at Little Hampton - she was at Worthing once for the benefit of her health, and Miss Evans, the surgeon's daughter, visited there; the elergyman of Little Hampton dined there once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. While Mr. Collins was there was Meek called by any other name than Garner? A. No; it was always pronounced with a d; I have seen that on her directions; my master dined there once or twice, seven or eight weeks after they had been there.</p>

I received from Mr. Hutchinson the petition, two affidavits, and a letter, dated the 31st of October, signed Collins, enclosing one signed Eliza Garner, and an extract from one signed Green. Mr. Collins called on me on the 3d of November, saying he had been referred to me from the Chief Accountant's office, upon the claim of Miss Garner, as administratrix of Bailward; I told him the Bank required further evidence of the beneficial interest of Miss Garner, and for that purpose required a pedigree of Bailward, vouched by certificates. I shewed him a paper, stating the certificates they required; he said he had seen that at the Bank; and that, from the length of time it was impossible to procure these documents, as it must have been a hundred years since the 'marriage of Bailward's father, or nearly so; he then shewed me a letter signed James Green, stating, that the Bank might as well require the marriage certificates of Adam and Eve. I said it was an impertinent letter, and did not receive it; I told Collins he had better give the best evidence he could.

               <p>This letter was proved to be in Rigaud's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. FRESHFIELD. Collins told me he wanted this letter, as it contained an order for money; I said I would take it over to the Bank and he should have it next morning - but he has never applied for it. On the 5th of November Rigaud called, and said he called from Mr. Collins for an answer to his application; I told him I suppesed he wanted that letter, and offered it to him; he said he did not want that; he was going to Brighton, and should see Miss Garner, and was anxious to take her some good news. I then asked if he knew the lady himself; he said he did - that he had lodged with a Mr. and Mrs. Collins three or four years ago, and that Miss Garner, at that time, lived with a Mrs. Brent, Mrs. Collins' sister - that Mrs. Brent frequently brought Miss Garner over to Collins' house, where he saw her, and he always understood she was entitled to some property from her uncle, when she became of age. I told him one difficulty was we had seen no ostensible person except the solicitor, and, if he knew the lady, personally, he had better put what he had to say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160036"/>&gt;in writing, and I would communicate it to the Bank; he proposed to make an affidavit - I said a letter would answer all the purpose, and he said he would write from Brighton. I intimated that probably a bond of indemnity might be required; he said he was her bondsman for the administration; I then said, as the Bank were indemnified I did not think a bond would carry it further. I received a letter from him, by post, from Brighton, on Tuesday morning, the 8th of November, and on the 9th Rigaud and Collins called together - I told Rigaud I had received his letter - he did not deny writing it (read, see note A.) On the 9th I saw Collins and Rigaud, and knowing then that instructions had been given for a commission, in order to increase the amount, I told them we had reason to believe there was other property in the same situation, and if so, it was very uncandid to ask the Bank to transfer this without going to the Court of Chancery, on account of the smallness of the sum, when there was considerable property behind; Rigaud immediately exclaimed that he knew of nothing more. I then turned to Collins, and asked if he knew of more? he said he did not, but he supposed we had good information on the subject. I said it was not surmise on our part, and it would be necessary to have it distinctly stated whether there was more property or not, and until that was done we could proceed no further. On the 11th, Rigaud came alone, and produced a letter to me from Collins, enclosing another signed Eliza Garner - (read, note A.) Rigaud stated, that the poor</p>

               <p>DEAR SIR, - In consequence of the conversation that passed between us at your office on Saturday, on my arrival here I called upon Miss Garner, and I cannot recollect any thing more than what I informed you at our interview. I knew Mrs. Robina Brent, about four years ago; she was in the habit of visiting at the house I then boarded at, in the New Kent-road; Miss Garner was also an occasional visitor, and, in the course of conversation, I was ofter informed that she was intitled to some money in the Bank of England, when she was of age to claim it, and that the same was derived from an uncle who died at sea - his name I did not know until lately, when she applied to me to be her bondsman. From what I have ascertained, and what I believe to be the fact, she is the party entitled to the money left by her uncle; indeed so fully convinced am I of her right to the cash in your hands, that I am willing to enter into the security you required, if that will serve her. I will wait on you in the course of Tuesday, as I purpose being in London on that day. I am, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(signed) F. J. RIGAUD.</p>
               <p>P. S. You will bear in mind that I am only on the half-pay of his Majesty's service.</p>

               <p>SIR:- I have called twice this morning, and waited a considerable time, but have not been fortunate enough to see you. A press of business obliges me to trouble Mr. R. to make the inquiry as to the result of this application. I enclose you a Letter of Miss G.'s, whether it will be of any service or not I do not know. I remain, Sir,</p>

               <p>Nov. 11, 1825.</p>
               <p>MY DEAR, SIR, - I thank you for your Letter received by girl had been racking her brain to find out what other property there could be - he said he supposed there was some 50l. or 100l. more, and it was very hard to keep her out of this property because she could not find that out - he had used nearly the same expressions on the 9th. On Saturday, the 12th, he called again, alone, and said he saw we never should get through this business unless he gave a bond of indemnity, and, to save all further trouble, it might be expressed in the bond, that if there was more property, they should go to Chancery. I asked him to sit down, and write instructions for the bond, which he declined, saying he should remember it very well, and he left. On Monday, the 4th, he brought a letter from Collins, enclosing the draft of a bond of indemnity (read, note C.) I went down to Worthing on the 15th, by the mail, and found Meek living at a house at Great Heene - Eliza Baker, another female, two female servants, and a boy, were also in the house. Meek was taken into custody, and after that some papers were brought to me, half burnt. I insisted on seeing the desk from which they were taken - Baker shewed it me - it is now in court- the initials, F. J. R., are on the brass plate - I found this letter there, which I produce (read, note D.)</p>
               <p>this day's post, though I feel much disappointed; instead of receiving the money, as from our interview on Saturday evening I was led to expect I should, I find there are more queries still to answer, but which I can do in a few words, namely that I am not aware of there being more money in the Bank of England, placed there by my late uncle, than what I have laid claim to, and I trust the gentlemen of that establishment will put me in possession of my just rights - you know my situation is very different to what it was during my uncle's life time. Do pray see the gentlemen, and use all your influence with them, for the little I now have will soon be expended, and after that how am I to return to the Continent. I shall be most anxious till I have your reply to this. Give my kind love to my friend Mrs. B., and believe me yours truly. (Signed) E. GARNER.</p>
               <p>Brighton, Nov. 9, 1825.</p>
               <p>Since I wrote I open the letter to say that I have received a letter from Mrs. B., in which she has given me a particular commission, therefore I shall send a parcel immediately to your solicitor.</p>
               <p>(C.) Re-Bailward.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I send you the bond hastily prepared from the vague instructions I have received through Mr. R. I presume, however, it will answer the purpose; you will make what alteration you think proper. I am going out of my usual mode in signing a bond for my clients - but if this is insisted on, rather than Miss G. should be put to the expense and delay of applying to Chancery for so small a sum, I will do it. I think you should be content with Miss G's. bond. Perhaps you will be able to look at the draught while Mr. R. waits, as every day is of importance after the delay which has taken place.</p>
               <p>12th of November, 1825. JOHN COLLINS.</p>
               <p>(D.) Heene, Friday.</p>
               <p>DEAR R.: - I hasten to answer your letter of yesterday's date and to acknowledge the documents, but I shall not proceed in them until I see you, as under present circumstances the introduction of my name would be imprudent, and, in fact, I have not the means of carrying the expenses,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160037"/>&gt;Prisoner RIGAUD. Q. Pray what charge had you against me when you took my desk? A. A charge of being concerned in taking out false letters of administration. Bishop, the officer, had a warrant against you - there was a warrant by a Sussex Magistrate. I had no search warrant; I took the desk upon my own responsibility: you always represented yourself to me as an half-pay officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know Mr. Collins when he called on you? A. I knew he was an attorney. There was about eight years interest due on</p>
               <p>which will necessarily accrue in the completion; therefore I think it the most advisable to wait your arrival, and I trust we shall see you on Monday afternoon. The recent affairs, which the Papers have themed with, must cause great agitation in a certain quarter, and caution must follow, as a matter of course; the late "Decision" carries fully the appearance you hint at. I am fearful some screw is loose in Oxford-street. You acted very judiciously in the matter, and, of course, you will not repeat your visit there. I am hurt to hear your half-pay is under stoppage, and that you are hard up. I cannot state positively the time of S. G. B's death, or where he was buried, but from what I have been able to glean, St. Martin's, about 1809 or 1810. I was aware that no will or administration had been granted, and I told you so. I am glad to hear Margaret's affairs are proceeding in. Mrs. R. is going to Hampton this afternoon, by invitation, and will return on Monday, and she will take charge of any letter for E. B. You had better call on Watts, and make some excuse, which surely your fertile brain is capable of, for I think him a host with us. When - last was at Brighton I saw a fellow I did not wish, so you can take a trip over with Betsey, and do the needful there, as she is willing to go into it. I like the letter D being out. Mrs. R. desires me to say, with her love, that as your stay will be so short in London she shall not forward the things you wanted, but fully expects to see you at home on Monday. How will you manage at the Sussex unless you are able to raise the wind - if it will not be inconvenient to you send down those clothes of mine, or bring them with you; that tailor surely would not stand tick. Now, in case your friend Collins comes down, would it not be better for him and you to see the affair Betsey has to do, completed at Brighton, as every caution must be observed throughout our multifarious transactions. Have you been able to get the Richmond's completed. I am glad our sable friend is to be soon related to a fair dame of yours, name Collins; our larder is well supplied, and I wish I could say as much for my purse and our wine cellar - they are to let, unfurnished - however, the hare will come very acceptable, and shall wait your arrival to wash it down with a glass of port. I hope your friend Collins will breech you before you leave London, as we shall be queered - for 5s. is all our stock, and black Monday will soon arrive - however, d - n all gloom, Expecting to hear on Sunday, I am yours, faithfully.</p>
               <p>You have neglected to name our friend Mr. Collins was to inquire about, at Whitchall - "the seven years." No letters from our correspondent in reply to those you took to London.</p>
               <p>Call at the post-office in Dorking, and ask for letters for A. B. C., and also call at the post-office at Mickleham, and inquire for Captain Kent.</p>
               <p>To Captain Rigaud, Sussex-hotel, Bouverie-street, Fleet-street, London. this sum. The Bank would not transfer that sum alone, having more. Mr. Fletcher came to me about the 5th of November - I saw Mr. Collins once after that - I did not caution him about it. I think Rigaud proposed that Collins should enter into the bond - I did not press him for the bond - I will not swear that I did not propose Collins signing the bond - it was our business, as solicitors, to draw the bond, but considering it useless myself, I had no wish to have it. On the 3d of November I asked Collins if he knew any thing of the parties; he said they were introduced to him by a friend; he did not name Rigaud since this charge; he has said he only knew them by being introduced by Rigaud; I saw him on the 3d or 4th of November; I did not then know Rigaud; I saw Collins again on the 9th - no such communication took place then. I went to Worthing on the 15th, and obtained a warrant against Collins that day - there were two warrants - I filled up one, and the clerk of the office the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Charging Collins with conspiracy, and gave it to the officer to bring him to the office on that charge? A. Yes: Mr. Hall, the Magistrate, certainly never told me the warrant was given on an understanding that it was not to be executed; if it was said it was in my absence. I know Collins was discharged - I told him at the office I had a charge of felony against the others, and did not wish to enter into the conspiracy - he said he was very unwilling to have his name mixed up with them, and whatever information he could give, without violating his professional duty, he would; he called on me twice afterwards - I told him it must be distinctly understood I could make no promise beyond this, that any thing he said to me should be confidential, and should never be given in evidence against him - he did not ask for that promise - I know he requested an interview with the Governor of the Bank. When this bill was found he wrote to me to know what bail should he put in.</p>

            . I am a clergyman, and live at Broadwater, near Worthing. on the 30th of September last I received a note, and appointed to be at home at ten o'clock next morning; I do not know the date - this bond was then executed by a person calling herself Eliza Garner - there was a man with her; I have attested her signature, and as such, I conceive I administered the oath to her - I do not remember it, but have no doubt of it. The commission directs me to administer the oath; I do not think that I did adminster it; I have certainly attested the oath, but cannot declare that I gave her the oath - and yet it is not likely that I should attest it without I swore her - a solicitor generally comes with these matters. I do think I administered the oath, but cannot be positive; there is a fee of 10s. or 10s. 6d., for administering the oath - I received that fee, which I should not do without swearing the person. On the 12th of November a servant boy brought me a note, signed Eliza Garner - I cannot find that note; I sent a verbal answer by him to Miss Garner, that I should be at home at the time she wished, which was half-past five o'clock - at which time I had the Rev. Mr. Davison in my room, also a clerk of Mr. Freshfield's. Eliza Garner, as she called herself, came; I believe it was Meek, although she is now much altered; I asked her what she came for - she produced a bond and an authority to swear her, and attest what she brought - I looked at it and handed it to Mr. Davison, saying, "My eyes are not very good, I wish you to see what this contains" - he read it over, and said the signatures are put to it, which ought not to be there; she said she knew nothing about it, that she was directed to come for me to attest her signature - I did not remember her, but I said, "I think you were here some time before on business of this nature?' she said she was; I returned her papers, refusing to attest them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your receiving the fee makes you think you swore the party? A. I do not conceive I should receive it without swearing ber, as it is for administering the oath, not for signing my name; it took place in my dining-room, at ten o'clock in the morning. I remember having the fee perfectly well, as I applied it to a found I was raising to improve my chancel; the man paid it to me, I am certain; I do not think I have administered an oath since - it is a very rare thing with me. When she came on the second occasion she had a bonnet and veil on - she kept her veil down all the time.</p>

            . I am a clergyman, and live at Worthing. I was at Mr. Wood's house on Saturday, the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock, when a person, calling herself Miss Garner came - she was alone, but said a person was waiting for her at the gate; Mr. and Mrs. Wood, Miss King, Mr. Jeffrey, and I were in the room; she produced a document from the Prerogative Court; Mr. Wood desired me to read it over - he said, "I think, when you were here before, there was some person with you" - she said there was; I said there were two names signed to the bond, and as those persons were not present Mr. Wood could not attest it; he asked her how that happened - she said she was unacquainted with the matter - the paper had been sent to her from London. I believe the prisoner Meek to be the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160039"/>seen her before? A. No; she wore a large leghorn bonnet - she had a veil; I think it was a black one; her countenance was quite clear to me, I am certain of that. To the best of my belief she drew her veil aside.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. WOOD re-examined. I believe her veil was down all the time. When she came in the fire was stirred, and candles snuffed; I was anxious to discover her countenance, as I had heard something irregular was going on.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVISON. When she entered the room, to the best of my recollection, her veil was down. I sat opposite her - Mr. Wood was at her side; she did not put her veil up, but drew it on one side; her face was partly exposed to me, but not to Mr. Wood; the veil was between him and her. We were desirous of seeing her countenance, and the fire was stirred, and candles placed, so that we should have a full view of her; we had agreed, before she came, to ask if she had been there before; we had a good deal of conversation with Mr. Jeffrey.</p>

Freshfields, and was at Mr. Wood's on the 12th of November; I had been sent down to make inquiry - Meek was announced at Mr. Wood's, by the name of Garner, and I believe Mr. Wood asked her if her name was Garner - I understood her to say "Yes, I was here in September with Captain Rigaud."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who suggested the question? A. I had suggested it previously; I talked the affair over with Mr. Davison, but not with Mr. Wood.

            . I was three months in Rigaud's service, at Heene - Mr. and Mrs. Rigaud, Mr. and Mrs. Issit, and Miss Gardner (Meek) lived in the house. On the Saturday before Meek was apprehended I went to Mr. Wood's with a note; Mrs. Rigaud, or Miss Gardner, gave it to me; I took it to Mr. Wood - he said he should be at home; I gave that answer to Mr. Issit, and between six and seven o'clock in the evening Issit and Miss Gardner went out, towards Mr. Wood's. I was present when Miss Gardner was apprehended, and took a desk produced out of the parlour, by Mrs. Rigaud's (Baker's) direction - she opened it, and gave me some papers, telling me to burn or bury them; I put two on the fire - my fellow-servant took them off.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank, and have the Navy 5 per cent. ledger - there were 200l. 15s. Navy 5 per cents. in the name of Samuel Groome Bailward; there is also Bank stock in his name, transferred by order of the Court of Chancery. to the amount of 2676l. 13s. 4d., since which a bonus of 669l. 3s. 4d. has been added - he also had 242l. 13l. 4d. 5 per cents., and 2684l. 8s. 8d. Consols. The value of all except the Bank stock is transferred to the Commissioners for the reduction of the National Debt.</p>
               <p>RIGAUD'S Defence. Gentlemen of the Jury, I have been four times at the bar, prosecuted by the Bank of England, under prosecutions arising out of the same circumstances - I can only positively deny that ever I wrote a letter in any other name than my own, and every witness that has appeared in the box has witnessed that I never went by any other name; thus giving every clue to find me. - Mr. Freshfield knows that I told him when I suggested a bond, (which he urged me to sign), that it was ridiculous for him to desire me, who was but a half-pay officer, to sign a bond for 500l., and he said, "You will find out that Lord Palmerston will stop your half-pay if you don't." I know nothing about the transaction. I trust, if I do not call witnesses to charactor, you will consider that I have been months in prison, and I have not 1s.; I have exhausted every 1d. I have in the world; if I have not called persons it is for want-of means, and that is the only reason. I have stood here four times - and this I hope will be the very last.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker. These boots are not my making; I have made about twenty pairs of boots for Mr. Waite; I once cleaned the bottom of a pair of boots for him, which had been on his own feet - he brought them to me, and said, "They are tool little for me - what can I do?" I said, "All you can do is to have them cleaned." Which I did, and had 1s. for doing it - they were dirtied as these are.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is this ago? A. It is more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160041"/>&gt;six months ago. I have not worked for him since; these are not the boots I cleaned for him.</p>

On the 14th of January, about half-past eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160042"/>o'clock in the evening, I was in his shop, and saw a man put his hand inside the door, and take a pair of bellows - I believe it was the prisoner; I alarmed my master, who ran and brought the prisoner back with them.</p>
               <p>MOSES SIMMONS. I heard the alarm, and pursued a man whom I saw running with a pair of bellows into Redlion-street, and then into Dorset-street - he turned back, and was taken by a man - I came up to him, and he hit me three or four times on my head, and said he would not go with me as I was not an officer - I threw him on the ground, and took him; I then got a light, went back to the place, and found the bellows there - I believe the prisoner is the man whom I saw with them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Paternoster-row - a butcher laid hold on me first, and said, "You have stolen a pair of bellows;" I said, "I have not," and he threw me on the ground, and hit me very much - the witness then came up, and I said, "Are you an officer? if you are I will go with you;" in falling I happened to touch him in the face, but not with an intent to hurt him.</p>

            . I live at No. 30, High-street, Whitechapel - I am a cutler. The prisoner brought some articles to our house on Friday, the 22d of January - he asked if I wanted to buy any scissors - I asked where he got them - he said they were the remains of a venture he had taken out to the Brazils; that he had sold the table-knives and pen-knives, but the scissors were too good for the market - I said they had not the appearance of having been to the Brazils, and asked where he bought them; he said in the vicinity of Smithfield; I found they were scissors of a superior quality, and asked what he gave for them - he said 14s. a dozen, but could not tell the man's name, or in what part of Smithfield he bought them; he said he bought them all at a price; I saw there was at least 10s. a dozen difference in them - the average value was, I think, 25s. a dozen; I kept him in conversation till I opened the whole of the papers, and then I found one dozen which had the name of Gibbs on them: I asked if he bought this dozen with the rest; he said, Yes; I asked him his name, he said, "Harris, 39, High-street, Poplar;" I then said, "I shall have nothing to do with the twenty-two dozen of scissors, but I shall detain this dozen, as I know the person whose name is on them, and I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160043"/>&gt;doubt they are stolen;" he said, "Surely I am not to lose the dozen of scissors." I said, "Certainly not - if you call on me to-morrow evening, if I find you have told me a true story, you shall have them again, or I will purchase them." I then communicated with Mr. Thornhill, who is the successor of Mr. Gibbs, and he went on board the ship the next day.</p>

High-street, to see if the prisoner lived there - I found it was a house nearly fallen down - but I found a person named Cripps, whom the prisoner said he lived with, but she said she knew nothing of him - she knew a person named Harris, which was the name the prisoner gave, but he died at sea.

            , a turner - we lives at No. 1, Osborn-place, Brick-lane. The prisoner came to our house, I think, on the 24th of January he brought a bag full of what he called cutlery - he said he had been to a shop in Smithfield, and given 31l. for them - he sat down, and separated the property that evening - it was pen-knives and scissors; he put them into different parcels, in the same papers as he brought them in - and took some of them away every evening till the following Friday, when the officer came, and took the remaider in the bag.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 28th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and asked the price of a bonnet - I said 14s.; she then asked if a young woman had been there - I said, No; she said she would be there in few minutes - she stopped to see her - and while I turned round to speak to my sister, the prisoner got out with the bonnet - we pursued her, and my sister took her down the next turning, with the bonnet in her hand.</p>

Watkins and Fry; I saw the prisoner at the corner house, standing on the rafters, and cutting off the lead from the back dormer window; I went to where he was - and asked him what he was doing - he said Nothing. I said, "Come down; I saw you cutting the lead;" he then attempted to run away, and got on the third house, where he hid himself for about five minutes; I got on the roof; he jumped out of the window, and was taken about one hundred yards from the place. I have seen the lead compared with that on the roof, and it corresponds exactly; he was quite a stranger, and had no right there</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it day-light? A. Yes; enough for me to discern who he was; I had not been in the house from which the lead was taken for a week or more; he was two or three seconds cutting the lead, but I had seen him about the premises before - his face was towards me, and his hat was on; there was no knife, or any thing by which he could cut lead, found upon him; he was three stories up from the ground - I picked up the lead, but there was no knife with it.</p>

            . I am servant at the Duke of York, public-house; our back window looks over these premises - I was coming through the square - James White told me there was some one cutting the lead; I got into one of the houses, and saw the prisoner - he ran out and got away; I saw three men coming up, and called to them Stop thief! he knocked down one man, and then another - by that time I got up to him; he was taken into our house, and put into the parlour; when I first saw him he was cutting lead; he dropped it through the joists with one hand, and the knife with the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the man who found the lead, see the the knife? A. Yes; I did not see the lead found; I was with the prisoner while they went round, and picked it up; I spoke about the knife at the office,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160046"/>&gt;and it was produced - it was found the day after by a little boy.</p>

            . I live in North-street, Globe-lane, Mile-end, and am a stone-mason. I have seen the prisoner two or three times at his own house - I knew the deceased by seeing him on the building where I work - I never spoke to him - I went to the Masons' Arms on the 17th of December, about a quarter past nine o'clock - I went into the parlour - I went out in about twenty minutes or half an hour, and saw the prisoner rush from the bar into the tap-room - I opened this door and looking in saw two men scuffling - one was a labourer - I cannot say whethere they were fighting or not - I did not see the deceased then; I then saw the prisoner take the deceased by the collar and by the back, carry him to the door, and send him off the steps into the street - he had not time to resist nor did he offer - it was done in a moment, and the door clapped to - some persons came in and said there was a man dead at the door - I then went out and spoke to him, but he could not speak; I then lifted him up, but he could not stand; the watchman then came up; I went and got a candle, and saw two streams of blood running from him- one of which was as wide as my hand; I had heard the prisoner say, a few minutes before, to one of the labourers, I will give you sixpence to take him home. The prisoner then called a servant to get a pail of water - he and the servant washed the blood from the door, while I and some others took the deceased to the surgeon's, and I held him while the surgeon examined the wound; the prisoner came there about ten minutes afterwards, and brought a handkerchief, to tie up his head - I suppose some person had been to tell him of it; I staid there while the doctor dressed the wound, and then some persons went away with the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Was the door shut as soon as the man was put out? A. Yes. Upon notice being given that he was injured, Mr. Norton said he would give sixpence to a man to take him home. It was not by Mr. Norton's desire that I took him to the doctor's - he did not desire to be taken home - he could not speak - I do not know whether Mr. Norton paid the man who took him home - there were several women there, and I know Mrs. Pitman was one - he was certainly very much in liquor - he had been drinking from ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the man appear alive when you went to him in the street? A. Yes, but he could not speak; when the wound was probed he groaned - that was all the noise the made.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Mile-end. I was at the public-house on the 17th of December, and saw the deceased and another drinking together, between seven and eight o'clock, but there was a bit of an objection between him and the prisoner about paying the reckoning; the deceased paid him 1s. and then 6d., and afterwards Norton and a man named Green took hold of the deceased and pushed him out of doors, but that was not when he met with his accident. I was coming home between ten and eleven o'clock, when I saw the watchman, who had got the deceased up, and he was sitting on the step of a door - my master was there, and told me to lend a hand to take him to the doctor, I took him there on my back; Mr. Norton came in shortly, and asked if there was any thing the matter; the doctor, said it was a very serious matter - my master asked if there was much the matter; the doctor said the man's blood-vessel was broken; Mr. Norton said, "If you will take him home I will satisfy you;" I said I would if he could get another sober man, which he did - we took him, but we could not make him speak, and could not find his home; two watchmen came, and we took him first to Ratcliff watch-house, and then to the hospital. Two or three of the doctors came, and said he was very bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The deceased was quite tipsy? A. Yes, when he was first put out, and when I came up the second time he was in the street.</p>

            . I am the deceased's brother. I was at the Mason's Arms that night; my brother was drunk when he came into the house; he and another man had gin and beer till the reckoning amounted to 20d. each - there was a dispute between him and the prisoner about the reckoning; there was a difference of 6d., and I told the prisoner I would pay the 6d. if he would say nothing about it; a man, named Green, then came, and pretended to be an officer. I then went away, and left my brother there. On the Sunday evening following one of the carpenter's came and told me my brother was taken dead to the hospital - I then went to the hospital, but they would not let me in; I went to the prisoner's house, and said I heard my brother was dead, and it was a very sad thing; he seemed very well satisfied about it, as if he had a bullock to kill in Smithfield. I went to the office to get a warrant, but could not. I went afterwards to the hospital, and saw my brother dead; an inquest was held on the Friday, but the Coroner would not examine me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you know John Maynard? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you not tell him to ask the prisoner to give you some money? A. Nothing of the kind came out of my lips. I never proposed that if money was given I would not prefer my indictment, nor propose not to appear when the bill was found. I preferred the indictment as soon as I heard of the Session coming on. I went to a solicitor down Whitechapel - I did not take my brother away from the house, because I had other business to mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q. What am I to understand from your going for a warrant directly? A. Directly I heard of my brother being dead I went to Lambeth-street.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Collet-place, Commercial-road. On the night of the 17th of December, John Murphy was brought to my house by three or four men; he appeared to have been intoxicated. I found a confused wound on the upper and back parts of the head, which was flowing with blood; his clothes were very bloody. I conceive that the confused lacerated wound had taken place from the severity of the fall or a blow - he could not speak, but when I probed the wound he made some noise - I was convinced the skull was not fractured; I said no doubt serious mischief to the brain must ensue from the wound; he was taken from my house to go to his home, but the persons could not find it. Mr. Norton came in when he had been in the shop about ten minutes - his house is not more than two hundred yards from mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Are you a surgeon? A. I have not a diploma, but I have served a regular apprenticeship - I have walked the hospitals and practised as such for seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on good terms with Mr. Norton? A. I do not know that I ever saw him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing there had been a recent fall, were there any symptoms which made it likely that death would ensue? A. No. I said he would never be able to get his bread again; there was no indentation or injury on the skull that I detected; the wound was laid open to the skull, and it was quite visible.</p>

            . I am surgeon of the London Hospital. John Murphy was brought there on the 18th of December - I attended him, but did not examine the head, as it was already dressed. I heard the account of it from the pupil, and I thought the man would certainly recover. I examined his head after death, because his death was to me rather unexpected - he died of apoplexy, which, I presume, took place a few hours before his death - I should think it was occasioned by intoxication and the blow; I should not think the blow alone was sufficient to have occasioned it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it apoplexy alone, or the effects of the blow? A. The united effects of both.</p>

            . I was in the tap-room of the Black Lion on the 7th of February, and saw the prisoner - he went away about half-past eleven o'clock at night; he had no basket with him then - next morning he came again about half-past ten o'clock - I saw him; he had no basket then - he went out about twelve o'clock, and brought the basket with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home through Bloomsbury-square - I met a man with this basket, who was quite intoxicated - he asked me to carry it for him, and he would give me 1s. or 1s. 6d., and said he thought he could help me to work the next day, if I would meet him somewhere; I asked him if he knew the Black Lion; he said he did, and I went there, expecting to meet him, but he did not come. I must acknowledge I pawned the saw and plane, thinking I should take the money which he had promised me, and get them out.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 16th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pawned a pair of woman's shoes, in the name of Mary Regan, for 1s. 6d. - she came again in about three quarters of an hour, with another pair - this excited my suspicion, and I stopped her- I asked where she got them - she said they were her sister's, who lived at No. 10, Oxford-buildings - I told her to go and send her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went for my sister - she was gone out, and I did not return till the officer came for me.</p>

I said it was - she said she took the shoes, but was in a state of intoxication at the time; I took her to Mr. Patisson's shop, and sent for Mr. Palmer; he could not say whether he had missed any shoes, but he swore to their being his.</p>

On the 15th of January I went to the canal, about one o'clock - I saw the prisoner, who was a porter in our employ, in Mr. Snell's warehouse - he saw me, and stooped down behind some crates of earthenware; I went up to him, and asked what he wanted there - he said he was to watch - I told him he could not, and as he was going away, I saw something out of his coat-pocket, and asked what it was - he said, "A bottle;" I said I would see what sort of a bottle it was - he went to go on, and I took hold of his coat - he threw his arms back, and left his coat in my hands; he then ran towards the gate - I ran after him, turned the key, and called the watch, and then went through the house to get an officer;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160050"/>as I was coming out, I heard a noise as if the gates were opening; I saw them opened - the prisoner ran out, and went down Macclesfield-street - I pursued him, and took him into the King's Arms, as I could not get an officer; I returned in about an hour and a half to get the jacket - it appeared in the same state as when I left it - it was taken by the officer in my presence - and several brass-cocks were found in it; we found on the prisoner three brasscocks - one was in his breeches, near his knees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner appear tipsy? A. Yes - and said at the watch-house, that Harrison had taken these things, and had given him some to take back - and he told me if I would promise he should be forgiven, he would tell me of a long string of robberies. Harrison ran away afterwards, but I believe he has now made his appearance - he is not here, nor is the watchman.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Mr. Snell. On the 17th of January I saw the prisoner taken by Mr. Hunt - he threw back his arms, and left his coat in Mr. Hunt's hands - when Mr. Hunt went through the house, he told me to keep the prisoner, but he opened the great gates, and got out - I saw him hold up his fist to Mr. Hunt, and appear as if he was going to knock him down; he had been in Mr. Snell's employ, and so had Harrison - but I had not seen him that day.</p>

I happened to be going up the City-road, and Harrison (who had been in the warehouse) - one of the porters, and a boatman, were drinking gin; they called me in to have some porter, which I did - I then went to a public-house - the watchman stood at the gate, and asked me what they had better do - I said, if the cocks were re-placed, it would be better - and they asked me if I would take them - I being in liquor, took them, and that moment I was taken by Mr. Hunt; I had no notion of stealing them.</p>

            . My daughter Mary is seven years of age - I live in Compton-street. I sent my daughter to Mr. Brooke's, in Grafton-street, for whom I work, to take a pair of shoes - this was three weeks ago last Tuesday, about ten minutes before four o'clock in the afternoon - she had a dark blue pelisse on, and a pinafore - she returned in about an hour, without basket, shoes, pelisse, or pinafore - I went with her next morning to the clothes shops, to see if I could get any intelligence of the things; as we were coming home, she pulled me by the shawl, and said, "There is the young woman who took my things;" I took hold of the prisoner by the shawl, and said, "You stripped my child last night" - she said, "Let me go into your house" - and then she said if I would go up stairs, she would tell me - she then said she had pawned the shoes at Lambeth, and pulled the ticket out of her pocket; I cannot read, and I got my next door neighbour, Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160051"/>&gt;Sutton, to read it - I heard her read the direction, which was in Paradise-row, Lambeth, but I forget the name - I gave the direction to the officer, but the ticket was lost; I saw the shoes at Mary-le-bone office, and know they were those I had given my daughter to carry - these are the shoes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner; she said she was very sorry, and gave me the key of the room which she had taken in Parker-street. We found the bed and bolster, the fire irons, and other things, which, she said, were Mr. M'Crobie's, and she had pawned the quilt for 1s. 6d., but she hoped I would take it out and she would pay me - these two chairs were found there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young person who was with me took the things out; I paid Mr. M'Corbie 7s. a week the first time I was with him, and then I was away for a fortnight, and returned with the young woman, who took away the things - I took only my own things away - I had paid 5s. of the week's rent myself, and this young woman would not pay the 2s.; but she said if I would go on with the things, she would give up the key and follow me; I saw her again on the Friday evening or Saturday morning, and she told me what she had done; I then took the key, and took my things to the room where hers were; another person persuaded me to return them, which I should have done on the Monday, but I was taken on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character, one of whom said she would take her into her service immedidiately.</p>

Limberts', and look into the shop for about five minutes - when they went away their hands were in their pockets; I saw Moody cross the street to the side where I was, with something in his hand - I asked what it was; he said he did not know, but a man gave it to him to carry; I brought him across the road, and pushed him and Harris (who was still standing at the window) into the shop; I took this piece of brass from Moody's right hand; the people were passing at the time, which prevented my seeing who took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CARRINGTON. Q. Did not Moody say it was given to him by another man? A. Yes. He made no resistance - he carried it openly. I do not think he is known to the Police.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LIMBERT. I am in partnership with my father, whose name is John. This is a piece of brass which we screw on for the shutters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not fixed to the house? A. Yes - there is a screw goes to the window in one part, which holds it fast; this part of it could be got away without being unscrewed or wrenched - it is of no use - it is an ornament.</p>

I asked where he got them, and he said they belonged to a young man, named Johnson, who had gone to Castle-street, to dinner. I asked him to go with me to the cook-shop, which he did - I called Paine out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say a person gave him the tools? A. He said a person had gone out of the window, and he had taken up the tools.</p>

I produce the tools and the basket, which I got at the cook-shop in Castle-street; they were laying on the floor, and when I came in Paine said, "That is the man" - I took him, and as we went to the office he said he saw a man go into the house, that he followed him, and took the tools, and was going to take them to some man in the cook-shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I saw a man loitering about - I watched him into three or four houses, and saw him get into this window; I followed him, and as I was going down the kitchen stairs he was in the passage, and threw the basket of tools down. I took them up, and the witness came and said, "What do you do with them?" I said a man had taken them up, and had left them there, and he desired me to take them to the cook-shop. I had not touched them before he told me.</p>

            . On the evening of the 2d of February, about nine o'clock, I was going down Uxbridge, and saw Cox, whom I knew, with something under his arm, in the shape of a coal-skuttle, and another parcel; I went down the town a little further, and told a young man what I had seen; I then heard of the robbery. I believe Weedon to be the person who was with Cox, but I cannot swear to him.</p>

I bought a coal-skuttle and a fish-kettle, some worsted, and thread, which I put into my cart; I missed them about nine o'clock, and went to look for them - I came back again, and made some inquiries; I then went to Mr. Farrow, the constable - just as I got to Uxbridge I had seen Cox looking over the tail-board of my cart - I mentioned this to the constable, but did not see Cox any more that night. I went with the constable to Cox's house, but did not find any thing.</p>

            . I am the constable. On this night I searched Cox's house, and found nothing - he denied all knowledge of it, but from the trepidation in which he was, I thought he had had it. I went down to a young woman in Chequer-yard, with whom he cohabits - she said he had been in company with Weedon; I then went to Weedon's and accused him of having taken the property; he said he had not; I said he had, and Cox said so - Weedon said,"What a d-d liar he must be, for he had taken it himself" - that he (Weedon) had drawn the cart from Mr. Johnson's to another house, which was in the dark, and there Cox took the property out; Cox said afterwards that Weedon drew the cart on to the place in the dark, and then Weedon took out the property. I then told Weedon to go with me to where it was, and he took me to a hay-rick in a field, where I found it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the evening of the 24th of January, about twenty minutes before five o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and said Mr. Jarman wished to know what time he could see me on the morrow; I said,"Any time;" he said, "That is no time;" I said, "Well then, between eight and nine o'clock;" I said, "You mean Mr. Jarman, down Mile-end-road" - he said, "Yes;" I said,"Is it about the German church;" he said he did not know; he then asked me for a glass of water - I went up stairs, he came to the foot of the stairs, and asked if he was to come up - I said, "Yes;" I went to a cupboard to get a glass, but it was not clean - I put some water into it, to wash it - went to get a cloth to wipe it - I then heard a jingling of spoons in the cupboard, from where I had taken the glass - I rushed forward, and said "What is that?" he said, "Nothing at all;" I said, "This will not do for me, you shall not go" - he had his hands behind him - I looked round, and saw part of this spoon in his hand, I seized it, and said, "What! did you come to rob me?" he said, "Oh no, I only meant to show you, how easily you might be robbed;" I said, "That won't do for me, you shall prove whether you know Mr. Jarman or not;" he then said, "I don't know Mr. Jarman - don't you teach German?" I said, "Yes, I did;" he did not know what to say, and I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you first came into the room, and asked what I was about, did I not take the spoon in this direction, and say how cautious you ought to be of exposing your property, when there is a stranger in the room? A. No; he did not say that till I had taken it from him; there were about five more table-spoons, a silver pint pot, half a dozen tea spoons, and a milk-pot; these spoons lay on the top of one another; you could not have taken more without making more noise.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was this? A. In Brewer's-yard, West-street - I think it was a damp, and kind of winterish evening - I was perfectly sober; I went to the Rose-inn, afterwards, to give directions to my drover, but I drank nothing there - the prisoner came up in front of me in a very indecent manner - she was not there above a minute or two; I did not see her again for a fortnight afterwards; I did not offer to make this up if I got 10l.; she offered it to me, but I ejected it.</p>

About half-past one o'clock last Monday I went out for a short time, and when I returned I met my wife, who said somebody had been in the shop - I looked round, and missed a roll of canvass from the window; I was only out four or five minutes. I left the shop directly, and ran down Praed-street, into Market-street, where I met the prisoners, coming in a direction from my house; Williams had the canvass on his shoulder, and they were walking side by side. When I got within forty yards of them Williams put down the roll, and sat upon it; Jones proceeded towards me; I laid hold of him, and then Williams ran away. I gave Jones in charge, and pursued Williams, crying out Stop thief! he soon ran up a court where there was no thoroughfare, - I took him back to Jones, and from there to my shop, where I left them in charge until I fetched a constable. - When I got back the man who held Williams was gone. The value of the canvass is 2l. 5s. 6d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I rent half the house of the landlord, who does not live in it. - The room which was broken open is on the first floor - in which I heard a noise about half-past eight o'clock on the night of the 18th of January, - it was something like a chair falling in the room under me, as I was in the second floor. I took the light in my hand, and went down; I found the prisoner standing at the door of the first floor room, which was broken open; it was the door of the room where the noise came from; I asked what he wanted - he seemed flurried, and said, "Does Mr. Thompson live here?" seeing the door open I immediately collared him, and said, "I'll Thompson you." He then struck me a violent blow on the left eye, which was black for a fortnight; I struck him again, and we had a hard fight together on the stairs, from the landing to the bottom - when we got to the bottom some one opened the outer door - I did not see the man who opened it, for he escaped. I kept hold of the prisoner, got into the street, and called out Murder! when several people came to my assistance, and took him to the watch-house. I then went back with the officers to examine the premises, having left the street door on the latch. The prisoner must have entered through the front door. About half an hour before I heard the noise I went down to see if the children were asleep, and I put out the light and went up in the second floor again to work, leaving the two children fast asleep. I knew the street door was on the latch. I found the bed clothes and pillow had been removed from the bed, but I missed nothing from the place; the bed clothes were drawn aside, and part lay on the floor, and part remained on the bed. The counterpane and all together had been partly pulled off; the children were in another bed in the same room; I cannot exactly swear whether the pillow was on the floor or not. The prisoner had no right to be in my house.</p>

I went to inspect the premises, when I found the lock of the room had been forced from its place, and part of the bed clothes were withdrawn from the bed; there was a hat found on the premises, and when I went the next morning I asked the prisoner whether it was his - he said, "Yes, that's mine" - he had no hat on when taken.</p>

On the night of the 5th of February I was in my father's yard and heard something like the smash of a window, which I mentioned to my mother. My father went out, for half an hour, in the evening - my mother then said the place had been stripped - upon which I went to fetch my father - as I was going along I saw the prisoner and another man - this was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and only a few minutes' walk from my father's house - the prisoner walked before me and the other man over the way - as soon as the prisoner saw me he went on the other side of the road with a dark bundle; the man on the other side had a white bundle; I believe the prisoner noticed that I saw him cross over to his companion. I got before them and they looked at me very hard; I kept my eye upon them; when I got a little further towards the Whitmore's Head public-house, I saw my father and a boy coming, and I said "Father, here they are?" I saw the dark bundle pitched over the wall, where it was afterwards found - he ran away - my father laid hold of the prisoner, and gave him to a gentleman, and then ran after the other towards the Robin Hood, public-house. When my father returned back, he was about to let the prisoner go - he said he was a hard-working lad; my father looked at his shoes, which were not like a tradesman. My father said "Where do you work?" but he could not tell; he then gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. It was night when you were walking in the street, and saw the prisoner? A. Yes; the reason why I could see them behind me was because I kept turning my eye round all the time - I walked sideways - at this time there was no person nigh. The prisoner's shoes and breeches were all over mortar - he said the roads were muddy, and he had fell down, but I did not see him fall - I ran with my father after the other man, whom I saw about five minutes before I met my father.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUST, SEN. This house is my dwelling-house. I went out to spend the evening, and owing to information I ran back towards home, and met my boy, who cried out"Here they are;" it was after seven o'clock when I went away from home - the property was taken from the ground floor; before I went I took a coat and waistcoat off the bed, and the property was perfectly safe then, - the windows of the room were fast, and the bed-clothes all safe; I did not find any broken glass about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who did you leave at home? A. My wife and six children - the eldest is eighteen years of age.</p>

The next morning I found a pane of glass had been taken out - the bed stood near the window - a person could not get the clothes off the bed without putting his arm in.</p>

The prisoner is a neighbour, and visited at our house - we had two watches, which hung in the parlour behind the shop - I went out on the 24th of January, and saw my own watch a few minutes before, but I did not notice my husband's; my watch hung over the mantel-piece, and my husband's finger ring and a key, hung over it; I came home rather late, a customer asked what o'clock it was, and I was going to see when the prisoner ran out of the room, rushed by a customer, and got away. My servant told me he had taken the watch; I went and found my own was also gone - my husbands' has been found since, for the prisoner has been good enough to say where it was. I do not know the value of mine - my husband values his at 4l. - mine cost 3l., and he values it at 2l. - he had his watch in 1807.</p>
               <p>Cross-examind by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Had you a seaman lodging in your house? A. Yes; the prisoner used to come and see us. I do not remember that he wanted ever to borrow money of me - I once heard my husband say he wanted to borrow 5s. of him - I did not see him there that day before my return. I never said to him "I cannot lend you any money but you may take the watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect, madam, and then say whether you persist in saying you never gave him such leave?. A. Oh, dear, no! I never did. I did not miss my husband's watch till he came home - only my own - when I missed my own it was about seven o'clock in the evening, as near as I can recollect. My husband keeps a general chandler's shop. I do not know what parish our house is in.</p>

            . I am eleven years old, and live with Mr. Philpot. The prisoner often came to my master's house. I remember the day the watch was miss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160061"/>&gt;ed, about seven o'clock in the evening - the prisoner had been there about half an hour before; while he was there he stood up by the fire-place all the time; there were two watches hanging over his head, by the mantel-piece: I saw him take the watch. He told me once to go out of the room to teize a little girl. When I was in the shop I could see through a window into the room; there was a key and a silver spoon on the mantel-shelf; I saw him take my mistress' watch down with his right hand. I then went into the parlour - he had his hand in his pocket- he then took up his hat, and rushed out of the room, ran by the customers in the shop, and nearly knocked them down; I saw my mistress' watch at tea time, about five or six o'clock - when I looked afterwards I found both the watches gone. I told little Harriet, and she told my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this young man at your master's once on the day before? A. Yes; my mistress was not at home, but my master was, and the little child; the prisoner had been there half an hour before this happened - he talked once about a young girl who was going to a mad-house; he said he would take her down to Gravesend. My master and mistress, and this young man, have been very intimate.</p>

               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Have you not been in the habit of going to the play with the prisoner? A. No; on one occasion my husband had a couple of orders to go to Sadler's-well - he intented to go himself with Hinkin. I never went with him more than once, and that was with my husband's permission.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are the woman who kept me from sea, and said I should not want money. Witness. Good God! is there no law? Upon my solemn oath there is no truth in these insinuations. Before this I always thought him a good lad. I did give my daughter 2s. to give the prisoner, which she took to him in Newgate, because he said he was in want.</p>

               <p>MRS. PHILPOT re-examined.

My aunt lives in the house when my uncle and his family are there; I have not been there for several days - for two or three days; there may be gentlemen and ladies lodge there for any thing I know.

            . I am an officer. I saw the two prisoners on Saturday evening, the 21st of January, between five and six o'clock, in the City-road - Jacobs came down Featherstone-street, and beckoned to Kelly, who was on the same side as I was, with this trunk on his shoulder - he pointed to a turning; I passed Jacobs, and got pretty close to them; I had something in my hand, and while I was putting it into my hat they crossed to the other side of the City-road - I heard Jacobs talking, but I cannot tell what he said. I then crossed, and seized Kelly with the trunk; I asked what he had got there - he said what was that to me - it was his property. I told him I was an officer - he pulled out a stick and struck me on the head - we fought for about ten minutes - Jacobs got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. Have you any reason to think that Jacobs saw you? A. I do not know; I saw him speaking to the other prisoner, and directly I seized Kelly I saw him walk off at a quick rate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there light enough for you to see his features? A. Yes; he passed a gas light, and I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160062"/>&gt;plainly - it was about twenty minutes before six o'clock; I am sure Jacobs knew me.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 29th of January, about half-past five o'clock, while I was watching in the shrubbery - he looked at this timber, then shouldered it, and went away; I followed him about two or three hundred yards, when he set it down against a tree, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Was not he in the service of Mr. COX? A. Yes - he has been our carter about twelve years; this was about the time he should go to water his horses; the timber laid in a private road near the saw-pit - the wood is not here; it weighed 169lbs. Mr. Cox does not allow his workmen timber to burn.</p>

            . I am in the employ of John Tilbury, Son, and Clark. On the 13th of February I put a gig out to wash, which had this cushion in it; and as we were going to put the horses in one of the cushions was gone - my fellow servant and I had a few words about it. Mr. Clark said there must he some thieves about; I went afterwards and looked about, and saw the prisoner coming up the mews - I asked him if he had seen a cushion - he said"No Harry, do you think I should do such a thing?" I said 'Let me look into your bag for satisfaction;" he untied the bag, and said "You see it is not here;" I said"Let me feel in the bag;" I did so, and there I found it all cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went down and had the sweepings of the shop, which I do every Monday - I saw this cushion torn to pieces in the corner, and took it up.</p>

            . I am a carpenter at Drury-lane Theatre, and live in Hampstead-road. On the morning of the 6th of February I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Foulkes' shop, about five minutes before nine o'clock, with a piece of carpet on his shoulder - he ran up Drury-lane - I followed, and stopped him; I asked him where he was going with it - he said, to No. 13, Lower Grosvenor-street, and that a shopman of the name of Smith gave him 6d. to carry it there; I said, "I know Mr. Foulkes very well, and if you will come back with me I will see about it" - he said, "You don't think I stole it?" I said, No, I had no right to think so. I went back, and asked the shopman if that was their carpet - they said Yes, that they had heard the door go, but had not seen the prisoner.</p>

            . I was waiter at the public-house. I saw the prosecutor come in about an hour and a half before he lost his watch - he was net very drunk then; he had two friends with him, and he drank with them. I saw him and Donovan sparring; I took him by the arm to lead him out of the room; Donovan took him round the body to help him out, and the dumb man pushed him behind - we came to a dark passage which leads into the tap-room, and three or four rushed upon us, and knocked the prosecutor and me down - we were on the ground about half a minute; I arose, and asked Durtnall where his watch was, which I had seen as we came up the room, about a minute before. I did not charge anybody with taking the watch then, but on the Friday, (two days afterwards), I heard Donovan say the watch was pawned - this was in the tap-room.</p>

I have a watch, pawned by Jennings, on Saturday evening, the 11th of February; I asked him what he wanted - he held up his two hands twice, meaning 20s.; I answered, by signs, 14s. - I then wrote on a ticket,"Whose is it?" he pointed to his breast, meaning that it was his own. I then wrote, "What is your name?" he produced a ticket from one of his pockets, and pointed to the name on the ticket, "James Jennings," and gave his direction.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I went with the prosecutor on Monday last to the West India Dock - I saw Jennings in the hold. I wrote on a piece of paper, "Do you know this man?" he shook his head, and intimated by signs that he did not. I then showed him an old duplicate, and made signs to know if he had got any like that in his pocket - he showed me that I might feel; I searched him, and found this one for a watch, pawned for 14s., at Nicholas and Latter's - I then took him into custody, and afterwards went to the Green Man public-house, and found Donovan; I asked him if he knew the prosecutor - he said he might, and he thought he did; as we were going along I said, "I am certain you do, for you was at the Commercial tap on Wednesday last, with Dummy, and there the prosecutor lost his watch" - he said he knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>DONOVAN'S Defence. I was in the tap-room half an hour or three quarters of an hour afterwards - I saw the prosecutor pull out some silver, and give to the landlord - he afterwards said he had lost his things; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160068"/>&gt;this man sitting on the coal box; I went to work, and had not seen him till the officer came and took me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MAYGER. On the 20th of January, about five minutes past ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to me while I was looking in at a shop - she accosted me in a familiar way, and asked if I would go with her to a corner - I did so, and staid there a short time - I then missed my purse and five sovereigns; I looked about, and found her in about twenty minutes in Pimlico; she denied having seen me at all; in coming by a dead wall, near Grosvenor-place, she took her right hand from her pocket, and dropped something - I said to the watchman,"She has dropped something;" he found two sovereigns and a half; she begged very hard for mercy - and I said, if she would return me my money, I would satisfy her and the watchman; she said she could not, as she had thrown it away; she then desired the watchman to let her go, and she would give him what silver she had in her pocket; I then heard some money chink in her left-hand, and said she had got my sovereign; she said she had not - and I said she should go to the watch-house; and there she said she had thrown away the money, thinking it might be marked.</p>

I live with my father, at Cannonbury; I had occasion to come to town on Wednesday evening, the 11th of January, and came in a hackney coach, which came up to our door about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening; I cannot tell who drove the coach, nor the number - I brought some property to town in a small brown hair trunk, which was not locked - there was a little black case in it, which contained a pair of pearl ear-rings, a pearl brooch, and two necklaces of mine, and a pair of pearl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160070"/>&gt;ear-rings, belonging to my sister, Anne Sophia Pullen; I had put the property into the trunk, which I packed up, and delivered to a female servant attending us, to put into the coach - I did not see her put it in, nor did I see it in the coach; I got to my father's house, in Fore-street, City, about seven o'clock, but did not miss the trunk till the following morning; I saw the property again on the Tuesday after I came to town - I made some inquiries about the trunk, and it was brought to me by my servant about nine days after - but when I opened it, the little black case was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The box was not locked - and you have no recollection of the coach or the coachman? A. No, not at all.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pullen; his town house is in Fore-street. I remember Miss Pullen coming home on Wednesday, the 11th of January, and some inquiries being made about the trunk the next morning, it was not to be found; Hughes, the coachman, came to our house on Friday, the 20th of January, before eight o'clock. I had before that seen an advertisement about these ear-rings; I opened the door to the prisoner; he said he had brought the trunk which had been left nine days in his coach; I said, "I will call my master;" he said, "I cannot stay, but I will call again to see that the articles are all right;" - he went away, leaving the trunk, and never called again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not Mr. Pullen other servants? A. One more, but I always open the door - and I can say, the person who brought the trunk, did not call again; he called on the Friday - the advertisement was in the paper on the Tuesday before; we had the number of the coach from the man servant - I had seen the trunk about three o'clock, when it was packed up to come to town, by Miss Pullen; I did not see it put into the coach.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Reeves, pawnbroker, of Snow-hill. On the 13th of January, the prisoner Watson, came to our shop, and brought two pair of earrings, a brooch, and two necklaces; the ear-rings and brooch were pearl - and I asked if he wanted to sell them; he said, he did not particularly want to sell them, but what would I give for them; I offered him 5s., to ascertain if he knew what they were; he said, "You shall have them for 7s." I then questioned him as to where he got them - he said he had picked them up the night before in Blackfriars Road - I told him I should stop the ear-rings, as they were real pearl, and advertise them, and if there was a reward offered for them, he should have it - he said it was perfectly right - that he had picked them up the night before; I asked his direction, and he said his name was Thomas Watts, or Watson, No. 40, Thames-street, and said he would call again in two or three days; this was on Friday - they were advertised the following Tuesday, in the Times newspaper of the 17th of January; on the following Saturday, he came and asked if I had heard any thing about the ear-rings - I asked him to come inside the counter, which he did, and I told him if he would wait a minute, I would speak to him; I went to the further end of the shop, when he lifted up the flap of the counter, and ran out - I ran after him into Seacoal-lane, about two hundred yards - he ran as hard as he could - our apprentice, who was on first, caught him - I then came up, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WATSON. I did not exactly run, I was walking very fast. Witness. He ran, and I pursued him for two hundred yards - our apprentice can prove he ran.</p>

            , Esq. I am the father of Mary Pullen; my town house is in Fore-street, in the City. In consequence of hearing of this loss, and seeing the advertisement in the Times newspaper, I accompanied my daughter to Mr. Reeves, and she identified the box and property; an inquiry was set on foot for the coachman; on the day before the trunk was delivered at my house, I sent two or three different people to inquire, and heard that the trunk was delivered at my house - the coachman said before the Magistrate, that he drove the coach and received the money.</p>

            . I am a Marshalsman. When Watson was brought to Guildhall, on the 24th of January, he was remanded; Mr. Pullen gave me the number of the coach to find where the master lived, and to get the man if I could. The prisoner, Hughes, was out with the coach No. 154, but I took him about half past one or two o'clock on Tuesday morning; I went and searched his lodgings; he stated, without being asked, that he was the coachman - that he had brought the Miss Pullens from Highbury, and had had the trunk, which he had taken home himself to Fore-street. He said he had kept it, I thought he said five days, but I understood afterwards, it was nine days; that he had kept it in his lodgings, in a court just by Worship-street Office, but he knew nothing about the jewels - the next day he came before the Magistrate, and was committed.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HUGHES' Defence. The servant said wrong about my keeping the trunk nine days in my coach; I took the box out that night, when I found it under the seat, close by the nose bags, in some straw; I gave it to my landlady to take care of till I took it home; she took it to my bed-room -Thomas White lodged and slept in the same bed; he asked me whether I had looked into this box; I said no, I did not mean to look into it, I should take it home; but I was very busy; I used to go out soon in the morning, and was out late at night, and my master was ill; but one morning I had my horses shod, and took it home, and delivered it to that young woman - I told her I had found the box in my coach, and had taken care of it, as I had not an opportunity of bringing it - she said, "I do not like to take it in, you had better wait;" I said, I could not wait, but I would call again - I had not an opportunity for two or three days, and then Mr. Harrison took me.</p>
               <p>WATSON'S Defence. I was at Mr. Dixon's Repository, in Barbican, and met a young man named Thomas White; he said he was working in the Curtain Road; he told me he had found a little trinket case between Rowland Hill's Chapel, and Blackfriar's Road - I questioned him if he got them honestly, and he declared that he had; he asked me to go with him to ascertain the worth of them - I took it for granted he had got them honestly, as I had known him for eighteen months; he wished me to go to a Jew's, and I said that is a wrong place; we were going by Mr. Reeves', and I went in there; I told him they were picked up in Blackfriars Road, and wished to ascertain the value; he said they were only mock, and he would give me 6s. for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160071"/>&gt;them; I said I would have 7s.; and then I said, would he give me 6s. - he then went into the parlour, came out, and said he had been mistaken, they were pearl; I said, I would call again, and then I was taken ill, and was blooded; but I called again on the Saturday, and asked if he had found an owner - he said he had, but he did not know whether he was the right owner; he then went to the back of the shop, and I certainly was rather flurried, and did make an attempt to go away, but not because I was guilty.</p>

               <p>COURT to MISS PULLEN. Q. What was the value of the jewelery that you and your sister lost? A. I do not know; the other part of the property is of very little value indeed.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How many servants have you? A. Two female servants; the young man who knew the number of the coach, lives in London.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of February, I saw the prisoner near a pawnbroker's shop in Broad-court, Long-acre - he took something out of his pocket which appeared like silver spoons - he then went to several other pawnbrokers' shops, which were not open, and kept repeatedly looking at the things in his pocket. After I had watched him some time, he got to Mr. Townshend's, in Russell-street - I saw him go in, and, after a little time I followed, and questioned him as to whose property those two spoons were which he was offering to sell- he said his name was King, and they were his own property - he had had them some time; he offered a prayer-book to pawn, which he said was his own, and his name was in it - I searched it, but could find no name - he afterwards said the spoons belonged to his mother, who lived near Hyde-park-corner. I took him into the back room, and found on him two glass salt-cellars, a pair of spectacles, and two silver spoons in his watch-fob, and a pepper glass; I asked him how he came by them - he said he was a poor unfortunate fellow; I again asked where he got them; he said "You know;" I said I did not know; he then said they came from Mrs. Keen's, No. 5, Goldsmith's-street, Gough-square. After he had had a hearing I found the prosecutrix out - I likewise found a phosphorus bottle and some matches on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. How is your shop situated? A. It has a door in the passage - the lodgers have no occasion to go through the shop into the house.</p>

About five o'clock on the afternoon of the 2d of February, Mr. James Hilditch was serving two gentlemen when the prisoner came in, and I spoke to him; he asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs, and I asked him to walk further in, which he did, and stood by the gentleman who was by the fire; I took some handkerchiefs, and asked him distinctly to walk further into the light, but he did not; I then went opposite to him, in that part of the shop which is rather dark - he said those handkerchiefs were plain, and would not do; I went to get some others - he said they would not do - he wanted a small pattern; and then he asked for some other patterns, but we had not got them. He was going away - I went to open the door for him and saw a piece of silk under his cloak; I got the key, locked the door, and called Mr. Hilditch. I lifted up his cloak and there was the roll of silk placed perpendicularly; James Hilditch took it from him - he was dressed very much like a gentleman, with a travelling cloak and fur collar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. How many persons were in the shop? A. I, James Hilditch, the prisoner, and two gentlemen; the two gentlemen were in the shop at the time I made the charge - a number of rolls of silk were on the counter, but none were on the floor - the roll found under the prisoner's cloak was one of those which had been unrolled and shewn to the two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had your attention been drawn to this roll after the prisoner came into the shop? A. No, it had not.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was serving in the shop - I showed the two gentlemen a roll of black sarsnet, but they did not buy it, nor move it at all; I had unrolled about three yards of this silk, twisted it up, and laid it on the counter, in the back shop, under the lamp. The prisoner came into the shop, and this piece of silk was found under his arm - he had not purchased it. I had seen him near the gentlemen - they had not left the shop when this occurred - they went out afterwards - there were thirty yards of this sarsuet - I saw it under the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not bring the gentlemen forward? A. They said it was a very unpleasant thing to be in the shop, so I would not detain them - they said they would call again the next day, but they have not- I do not know whether the gentlemen saw him take it or not.</p>

I had no idea of a theft till I saw him pass them into the apron of a man who was with him; I put my head in at the door and said "The man has taken your shoes;" "Which man?" said Mr. Thompson; "That man in the brown coat," said I. I did not pursue him but Mr. Thompson did. I believe it to have been the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course when you were looking into the shop, you could not be looking at the man in the brown coat? A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JOHN THOMPSON. I keep a shoemaker's shop in Gracechurch-street. Mr. Thorpe put his head into my shop, and said "There goes the man who has taken your shoes" - I ran after him and pushed him into a neighbour's house - he had nothing upon him.</p>

Tabor and Johnson's, in Savage-gardens, Crutched-friars, for the Hollands, I did not see him again till about half-past eleven o'clock the next day, when I met him at the docks - he said, "Master, this is a bad job - I suppose you have heard of it?" I said I had, and asked him how it happened - he said he had his tail rope cut on London-bridge, and somebody had taken the cask of Hollands out. I asked him to go with me to Mr. Johnson to explain it - he went. I went in while he waited, and told Mr. Johnson what I had heard.

I got a warrant next day (Sunday morning), and searched the premises of Stevens, at the corner of Buckley-street, Whitechapel - Fortune, Foster, and Dalton were with me - we found the cask in the cellar - it was taken to Lambeth-street; I do not know that it contained Hollands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the docks on Friday? A. Yes. Laws' cart left the docks about half-past three o'clock, and was to call at Messrs. Tabor and Johnson's afterwards. The wine was permitted there, and should, in the regular course of things, have been delivered there.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Johnson and Tabor, of Savage-gardens. On Friday, the 3d of February, the prisoner Laws came to their warehouse about half-past three o'clock, with two pipes of wine - he left one there, and was to take the other to Symond's wharf,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160074"/>in the Borough; he took with him a cask containing twenty-seven gallons and three pints of spirits; there was a permit nailed under a small tin on the head of the cask, so that it could not rub off. He went from our warehouse about half-past four or twenty minutes before five o'clock, and if he had gone at a fair pace he might have got to the Borough at half-past five o'clock. I saw the same cask afterwards at Lambeth-street office, on the 6th - the permit was not on it - it had Hollands in it, but I cannot say that it was the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dusk? A. No - I do not think it would be dusk before he got over the water; he might have got to Symond's wharf in about an hour, but there are stoppages sometimes; he might have gone down Thames-street, but I should not have gone that way, because there are frequent stoppages there, and so there are in Tooley-street, and on London-bridge.</p>

            . I am a Police officer of Lambeth-street. I received a warrant to search Stevens' house - I went there about twelve o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 5th of February, with two officers - I knocked at the door, and as we are frequently in the habit of going to see that they are shut up, the door was opened; I walked in, and looked into the tap-room, where I saw three persons; I asked what they did there, and they said they were lodgers. I called Stevens aside, and asked if he had not a cask of Hollands, of such a size as I described, in his house; he said he had one brought there the night before that, but it turned out to be Friday night, and the person had asked his leave to deposit it there till Monday morning, as it was too late to take it to the in it was to go to - he said he knew the two men who had brought it, and he gave their names to my brother officers. I told him I must see it, as I understood it had been stolen - he said,"I will show it to you immediately;" he then got some keys from the bar, took a candle, and went into the cellar, and shewed it to me and Mr. Stones, one of the proprietors, who identified the cask, which I took into my custody. Mr. Stevens was very desirous of seeing the Magistrate that morning; he let him go, as some gentleman passed his word for his appearance the next day. His house is directly in a contray way to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Who granted the warrant? A. Mr. Wyat. He came next day according to his promise. I believe he has kept that house for two years or more. I do not think I asked him the men's names; I examined the cask - there was no tin or permit on it; there was a chalk mark on one of the beads - I do not know whether it was a letter or a figure; Foster went into the cellar with me, but I do not think either or them heard the account which Stevens gave me, because I called him aside.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. As there were customers in the house you did not, out of delicacy, ask him before them? A. No. I do not know what conversation passed between him and Foster; it was a person named Plant who passed his word for his appearance. I told him I had a search-warrant before I saw the cask.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The permit, you say, was gone, and the tin also, if ever there was one? A. Yes - I saw on the head of the cask marks of nails, and there is the corner of a piece of paper under one of the nails; there are marks of nails that would have suited the permit, and the direction; Laws and another man (who was discharged) came to the house while I was in the cellar, and were secured by my brother officers - they were locked up, and examined on the Monday; there were three or four persons in the house. I do not know whether a publican takes off the permit from a cask, and puts it on his file.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house on the Sunday, and went into the cellar with Stevens; I asked how he came by that cask - he said it was brought by two men who lived in the neighbourhood; I asked him their names, and he said Dalton and Laws; I told him I knew the two men perfectly well; Dalton, I believe, is a carman, and has got a cart of his own. I know his brother, but I do not know whose service he is in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he mention what Laws it was? A. When I came out of the cellar Laws and Dalton were standing together - I took the handcuffs out of my pocket, and put them on them; they asked what it was for - I told them I would tell them at the office. I then looked round, and said, "These are the two men you mean," and he said Yes. I took them to the office - they asked what they were brought there for; I told them about some Hollands, and Laws said his tail rope had been cut on London-bridge, and he had lost it; Dalton said, "I know nothing about it" - to which Laws made no answer; Stevens was not there then - he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who spoke first to Stevens? A. Fortune did - I did not hear what he said. I followed them down to the cellar. There were four or five persons in the tap-room. I suppose Laws came in while we were in the cellar - he was not there when we went down. - Stevens told us in the cellar that Laws and Dalton brought it - he did not refer to a man up stairs, and say he brought it. The Magistrate allowed him to go, and appear on the Monday. Stevens charged Dalton as one of the men, but he was discharged on the Thursday.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How much out of the way would it be to go to his house, when the party was to go over London-bridge, to Symonds' wharf? A. Quite a contrary way. - Fortune and Foster were in the cellar, and I stopped up stairs in the parlour. The prisoner Laws and three more knocked at the door, and I unbolted it; they asked if they could have a pot of beer; I told them Yes, and desired them to go into the tap-room, which they did - I had every reason to believe that two of the men were persons suspected of stealing the spirits. Foster came up in a few minutes, and took Dalton and Laws into custody.</p>

I ascertained upon inquiry that a cask had been left at Mr. Stevens', and went there immediately, when Mr. Dalton opened the door.</p>
               <p>STEVENS' Defence. When the officers came I gave them every information in my power; I told them two men certainly had left it there on the Friday afternoon; if I had had any idea it was stolen, I had time to have made away with it; I took it as smuggled goods, not having any permit. I have kept the house ten months.</p>

            , they live in Savage-gardens. The prisoner, Snellgrove, brought the waggon, with five puncheons of rum, to their door on the 13th of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening - Frost brought an empty cart at the same time - I knocked the bung out, and guaged four of the puncheons; I guaged three of them the next morning, at Symonds' wharf, between nine and eleven o'clock - there was then a deficiency of fourteen gallons in the three.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you guage them more than once? A. Yes; three of them I guaged again at Symonds' wharf - and there was a deficiency in them of fourteen gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the casks? A. Yes - and they had been plugged with large plugs, close to the tin, which had not been in them when they were at our house; I saw Snellgrove drive the waggon from our house, and gave him the papers, to deliver them at Symonds and Beals' wharf.</p>

I am foreman at Symonds' wharf On the 13th of January, some puncheons of rum were brought there by Stones' waggon - one of them appeared to be partly empty, and I desired Frost, who brought them, to put the bung up - I told him I should not sign his note till his master came to examine them; I saw on the wharf when they were guaged - there was a deficiency.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who drove the waggon? A. I do not know; I will swear Frost was the man I spoke to - I think it was about twenty minutes after nine o'clock; there was a gas-light close by the wharf, and I could see him sufficiently to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. FISH. Q. Who gave you the note? A. The watchman; the prisoner said, "As I received them, so have you."</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 13th of January, I was in Cable-street, Whitechapel; I observed a cart stop which took my attention, as the property was covered over in a singular way; it stopped a few doors from Back-church-lane, opposite the door of one Lewis - I saw Dalton go to the cart tail, and take this large stone bottle out - as he went towards the door, I heard Lewis say, "I will have nothing to do with it;" Lewis would have known my if he had seen me - I secured Dalton and the bottle, and put them into Lewis' door - there was a person in the cart when I first perceived it, but as I went toward the door again, a man got out of it in a hurry, and escaped - I went into the cart, and found two more bottles, covered with horse-cloths - I went to Mr. Stones', next morning, and apprehended the two prisoners; I cannot swear to their being in the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Did not Dalton tell you, he was merely unloading it as a porter? A. It was words to that effect - that being on the spot, he was employed to unload the cart; I did not see him in the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Did not Snellgrove come with you without hesitation? A. He would have come, but Mr. Stones brought him; I saw it was Mr. Stones' cart, and knowing him, I took it there; the place is in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STONES re-examined. Q. You have told us Frost and Snellgrove were your servants, and this cart and waggon both took out rum? A. Yes; the cart took out another puncheon of rum belonging to another merchant; these horse cloths belonged to Snellgrove's horses.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Then the cart was out with another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160076"/>&gt;puncheon of other rum? A. Yes; it was going to Beals' wharf - the cart and horse were mine, but these cloths are never used by other horses.</p>

I have two partners - the prisoner was in our employ, On the 16th of February, I had him apprehended - and searched his house; I was present when this sugar was found, and I have here some sugar which corresponds with it - it was refined last Tuesday week; I have no doubt whatever that it is ours; this lump was taken on Wednesday; he asked me some time ago, if I would allow him sugar - I said, "Certainly not;" I thought his salary very ample, but I would sell him a little, provided it was broken up, and entered in a book, and paid for; on the 17th of January we sold him seven pounds broken up into small pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. About six years; I have sold him rather better than seven pounds of sugar, but not without mentioning it to my partners, and its being entered in the book; these lumps are all numbered on the bottom, - the days they are made, or cut out, as we call it.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Bucknll. On the 24th of January I was removing from Queen-street, Edgware-road, to King-street, Park-street; I took a hackney coach, No. 781, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I took the number at the time - a person named Jobbins brought it - he appeared to be the driver - the prisoner was not then present; I saw Jobbins take my things out of the parlour and put them into the coach, and among the rest was a box, which contained one pair of scissors, four yards of lace, and twenty sovereigns - there were a great many other things of value; Jobbins then got on the box and drove away - he stopped at the corner of Park-street, and took some person up, but I did not see who it was; when we got to King-street, I saw two men on the box; the prisoner was one of them - he took my things to the door, but I think Jobbins was in the coach, and gave them to him; the prisoner demanded the fee of me, and drove off from the door - I afterwards missed the box which contained the property - On the Thursday following, I offered a reward of 5l. to a waterman, and he gave me some information; I have seen the scissors since, which I can swear to.</p>

            . I live in New-Court, Lower-marsh, Lambeth. I am a general dealer. Crane came to my house on Tuesday evening, the 24th of January, between nine and ten o'clock, with another person; they called me out of my back parlour, and offered a box for sale, similar to this, but I cannot say it was this; I said I would not buy it; I have known the prisoner for ten yeras, but I would never buy any thing from such kind of people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. There was another man with him? A. Yes; but it was the prisoner who made the offer to me; I cannot tell whether the box was deal or mahogany; they caried it under their arms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You state in your deposition before the Magistrate, that the prisoner wanted to sell the box now produced? A. I did not say so; I could not say this was the box; I stated that the prisoner opened the box, but I did not buy it.</p>

            . I am a hatter and salesman. I was at Cohen's shop, and remember the prisoner and another man coming there, and offering a box for sale; I was sworn before the Magistrate, and asked if I recollected this box - I said, "I was in the shop, when this, or one similar to it, was offered for sale;" I have no doubt on my mind but it was this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it opened before you? A. Yes; the prisoner opened it a little way for Mr. Cohen to see - he said, "I will not buy it, take it out."</p>

            . I am a publican, and live at the Marsh-gate. The prisoner brought this box to me on the Tuesday evening in question, between nine and eleven o'clock - he said, "Will you take care of this for me, and the old lady will give it me in the morning - it is for sale, and I will take two guineas for it." I asked him where he got it - he said it was a find, and he got it eight miles off; he left it with me, and about two hours afterwards I turned every thing out, to see if I could find who was the owner; he called for it the next day, I believe, but I was not up; I can only account for taking it, from being in the habit of taking things for customers.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 26th of January, at the Horse Grenadier, public-house, in Oxford-street; he then had this box in his possession; he said it was all right, the box was one he had found, and the lady did not suspect him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he know you was an officer? A. I told him so; I took him into the kitchen, where he said, in the presence of the prosecutrix, that he had not seen the box till the following morning, and it was as he had found it; there was a key in it, which would not open it, and I wrenched it open.(Box and scissors identified.)</p>
               <p>B. COHEN. I cannot swear this was the box - it is similar to it; the prisoner has been in the habit of visiting me - he has bought clothes of me, and lived opposite to me, but I never bought any thing of him.</p>

I was the coachman, and gave the lady these things; Jobbins got on the other side the horses; the lady asked my number; she had the numbers of several other coaches taken before mine; I went to the Horse Grenadier - I stood there at the time, and the lady said it was not me.</p>

I then went to her and said "What have you got in your apron?" she made some answer but I did not hear what, but I felt there were some crockery ware; I took them into the parlour, and took them out - she gave no account how she came by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLOOMFIELD. The tea-pot and milk-pot were not in my lap. Witness. Yes, I took them out of your lap.</p>

Did not you receive the money for the tobacco which I took of the man, and gave to you. Witness. No - I have no recollection of taking a farthing - it was earlier than the shop was usually opened - the prisoner got up sooner than usual that morning.</p>

               <p>DAVID's Defence. Davies had a cap and collar made by a woman in the kitchen - she asked for the money, and Davies said "If you will give me a pair of salts I will go and pawn them;" she kept one shilling, and I gave the woman the other shilling. I gave these things to the young woman to hold while I went down stairs - she saw my mistress, and did not want her to see her.</p>

On the 30th of January, about half-past two o'clock, Lane gave me information, and I missed a ham, which I had hung up about eight o'clock - I went into the street, and saw Head with it, under his arm; I pursued him, and when he saw me he ran, and turned into a lane, where I saw the two prisoners together - Head had the ham, and the other had a bag or apron, which he was endeavouring to put it into; a witness was coming up the lane, and I called to him to stop them: they threw down the ham, and ran away. I lost sight of Head, but I knew him before, and know he was the person who had the ham. I took M'Graw, but he had no bag.</p>

On the evening of the 14th of February, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pair of shoes - he tried on a pair, and said they were too large; I shewed him another, and they were too small - he put on a third pair, and said they would do - he put his hand into his pocket, as if he was going to pay, and then said, "I think I will have the first pair" - as I turned round to get them he snatched the third pair off the board, and ran away; I ran after him into Broad-street - a patrol stopped him in a few minutes. He was quite a stranger, but I am certain of his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say the foreman had paid for lit? A. No - he said "The foreman, - the foreman." I knew he was the foreman of Mr. Buxton, a baker, in Chapel-street, Islington; he did say the foreman would make it all right, and then offered to pay for it. I have heard that he is servant to Mr. Allerdine, another baker; he went back, and wished to have the foreman brought back, and when he found it was not paid for he offered to pay for it.</p>

            . I am one of the conductors of the Bow-street patrol. On the 14th of February I was on duty in Playhouse-yard, with Keys; I saw the prisoner there with a bag of nails - I asked him what he had in the bag; he said nails, which he had brought from his waggon in Whitecross-street, and was going to take them to his own home, in Green Harbour-court, Golden-lane - that he had been out delivering nails, and he had delivered twenty-nine bags, but had forgotten to deliver the 30th, and intended to deliver it in the morning. I asked if he had any papers to show what he had delivered - he said he had the papers, but they only showed the delivery of twenty-nine bags, and the prisoner said they had thirty of them - I sent Keys to go with him to Mr. Slater's wharf, but he was not at home - I went the next morning, and saw Mr. Slater; I then went to the prisoner, and told him I had seen Mr. Slater; and he said it often happened that he took a bag home to deliver the next day.</p>

On Saturday, the 21st of January, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I missed the savoys out of my garden - they were safe about dusk the evening before - and were worth about 30s.; I saw some marks of a wooden-leg, and I suspected the prisoner - I took an officer, and searched his house; we found five of the savoys - I then went to the turnpike, and asked the man there about them; the prisoner was brought to the office, and there I charged him with taking them; he said he had bought them from a cart, but did not say where.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house and found the five savoys - I went into the garden, and saw the mark of a wooden-leg; I met the prisoner on the Monday - he said he was coming to give himself up, about these savoys, but he was not guilty; I told him about the print of the wooden leg - and he said, more men had wooden-leg besides him; when I found these savoys at his house, he said he had bought sixpenny-worth of a man in the road, and had sold five of them to the turnpike-gate man; the wooden-leg mark in the garden was of the left leg, and so is the prisoner's; he said he had been to see for in work on the night they were taken.</p>

            . I am the wife of James Jordon. I had seen this property safe about eight o'clock at night, when the prisoner went to bed; the trousers were in the drawer, in his room; he left before day-light on a Monday morning, in September; I met him in the street some time ago - I said, "Do you recollect me?" he said, "No;" I said, "Not lodging with me in Welton-street - and you robbed me?" he said, No; a man came up and said he had robbed him; he said he knew nothing of it - he was not the man - but I am sure he is - he came three or four times to me before he took the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If I recollect right, you said I slept with another person? Witness. Yes - there was another person in the bed on the same night - he sleeps there now - but he is not here.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. On the 22d of January I had some information, and the next morning, about half-past three o'clock, I heard a waggon go by my house, which is in the way from Mr. Dale's to London; I called up another person, and went with him to the Horse and Groom, at Edmonton - the horses stopped to drink, and Scott, who was with the waggon, went and opened a stable-door, and when the horses had done drinking, he moved to the stable door, and took out one truss, which he put into the stable, and then went on with only one truss in the waggon - I followed it some distance, then returned; we got to Edmonton about four o'clock - I waited till the landlord of the Horse and Groom got up, and then I asked him who kept the keys of the stable - he said, "Whitman." I then waited till he got up, and asked him whose the hay was that was in the stable; he said it was his own - that he knew it was there, and had been there ever since Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Where were you? A. On the opposite side of the way - it was light enough for me to see it, but there is a gas light there; there was some other person in the stable; before Whitman got up, I was away some time - and cannot say whether any other person brought the hay during that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you brought any hay that was found in the loft of the stable, to compare with this? A. No; there was other hay in a bin - I have only brought some from the truss.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to THOMAS DALE. Q. Is not this a common quality of hay? A. No; it grew in a flooded meadow - I suppose there may be five thousand such meadows in the county.</p>

I afterwards went to his lodgings in Drury-lane with an officer; the woman he lived with was there. I found various tools which I had not missed, including the articles stated in the indictment; they hung in his room by the side of his work bench; we took him up in about half an hour afterwards. I accused him of it, and he said if I would forgive him he would tell me all he had done. I said I should not make any promises - he did not then tell me any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me these braces out to make? A. I gave him a quantity to make about twelve months ago, and about six months ago he brought in all he had as he said - he used to send the boy with them, and I accused the boy with being two dozen of braces short, and the prisoner said he had given them to my boy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you allow him to have work at home? A. Yes, but I knew these 17 pairs of braces were not taken in the course of that employ, because he had taken them all in - about one dozen pair of them were unfinished, and these five pair were some he had no hand in making.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These five pair had been put in promiscuously with work I had to take to my mother. Witness. No, he could not, his business was to tie these up. I packed them up, and he must have taken them from a basket in my warehouse. He had nothing to do with them at all, nor with these 300 brace bits - we give the bits and braces together - it is impossible we could have given them to him. He has had nothing to do with them during the last six months - he has been a porter in the house.</p>

I went back, and saw the prisoner and his companion come out of the stable. I said "What do you want there," and tried to stop the prisoner, who got by my companion, but he afterwards pursued and took him in Bow-street - I am quite positive of his person; I went on to the stable, and missed my jacket and overalls, which I wore there at four o'clock.</p>

On the 22d of December I was removing, and hired a hackney coach, No. 602 - the prisoner was the driver; I had some parcels and looking-glasses in the coach; I gave him my work-box and needle-case to put in; he said the coach was quite full, that the glasses would be broken, and he would put it into the boot; when he put me down at my own house, he took every thing out of the coach, and four dish-covers which were in the boot, but he did not give me the work-box; I did not miss it till the next day; I have never seen it since; I made inquiries about the coach, and employed a man to find it - I applied at Essex-street about one month afterwards - the master of the coach attended, and the prisoner attended as the driver; he said he never saw the box; but I told the gentlemen I would be on my oath I gave it into his hand, and they fined the master 2l., for not registering the name of his man - they gave me the 2l.; and I did not hear of the prisoner being in custody till the Sunday before last.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of February - I found nothing on him - I asked him where he lodged; he said with his mother, in Newcastle-street, Shoreditch - I went there with the prisoner, and in a box in his bed-room, I found a number of small articles belonging to a work-box.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took this lady to Black Lion-lane, and stopped at the Yorkshire Stingo, and had some refreshment; we then waited above an hour for the van; I came back, and had some more household goods, and assisted in loading the van again; then the lady pulled up at a public-house, and had some rum and some porter - I stopped at Bagnigge-wells, and had some more to drink; after she had settled with me, I returned, and a gentleman hired me to come to Holborn; my master came, and said, "What have you taken?" - I gave him fourteen shillings; and then, as I was taking the nosebags out, the box came out - my master said, "What is that! a prize?" - I said, "I do not know - but whatever it is, it shall go to Essex-street;" - he said, "See what value it is, if it is of value, you may" - I then went and had some ale with him, and got rather tipsy; and as I was going home, I fell down, and broke the box into two pieces - I went with a man and had some more drink; I fell asleep, and when I awoke, the box was gone; I was called up to Essex-street, and attended with my master, who said, he knew nothing of it, though he had seen me with it; - they then asked the lady the value of the box - she said two pounds, though it is stated here to be worth only one pound - they asked my master what he gave me as wages; he said, none - they then put the penalty on him, and gave the lady the two pounds - my master owed me a grudge - and he said to me, in a day or two "Bring me the box;" and I said, I could not, on my honour, but I would pay him ten shillings a week; and on the Saturday fortnight he abused me - one word brought up another, and next night he sent for an officer, and I was taken into custody - it is done for spite and malice.</p>
               <p>COURT to W. M'DOWALL. Q. Is it true that you saw the box that night? A. No - not till the Monday after we had been to Essex-street; when I saw a box and a gold bracelet, which the lady said she had bought in France - but I did not know it was the same box till afterwards, when we were quarrelling, and I discharged him. I applied for a warrant at Bow-street, as he threatened to give me a leaden pill, and all those kind of bravadoes.</p>
               <p>COURT to ELIZABETH NORRIS. Q. Was there a gold bracelet in your box? A. Yes - which I had bought in France.</p>

Bank note, a sovereign, half a sovereign, and 1s., in my watch-pocket. I awoke about half-past five o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was then gone - and also my watch and money.</p>

I weighed it, and it weighed 3qrs. 5lbs.; I paid them 2l. 15s. for it, and said "What are you going to do next?" they said they had to go for some more to Clerkenwell. I filled up that tub in Kingsgate-street, and made it up to 5cwt. 18lbs. - it was then put into the cart by the prisoners, myself and other servants, to go to my melting house in Liquorpond-street;

            , my other servant, and the prisoners, went with it. I had seen a quantity in the warehouse in Liquorpond-street, that morning, in the pan- there was 2cwt. 2lbs. - the 5cwt. 18lbs. was to be added to it, and the weight of the cask deducted from it. Restall afterwards made some communication to me. I went with two men to Liquorpond-street, and weighed the fat very exactly - I found a deficiency of 2cwt, and 1qr. nearly. I did not see the prisoner again that day, though they said they should return with some more from Clerkenwell; they returned about noon the next day, and brought the same tub which they had taken, which then contained 4cwt. 1qr. and 16lbs. of fat; I weighed it, and said "You know I have been very uneasy, and uncomfortable about the losses I have had - what did you do with that tub of fat you took last night?" they said they had emptied it into the melting pan, which would have taken about twenty minutes. I told them I certainly must find out what they had done with the fat that was in the tub; they said they could bring people to prove where they had got the fat they had brought that morning; and Lodge said"No one saw it taken away;" I said they had. They then clenched their fists at the boy, and went away swearing; I gave information at the office, and they were taken in about six hours. I have never received any clue to know where they bought it - the value of the 2cwt. of greese would be 36s.; they get a profit by buying this grease and selling it to me. Lodge has been with me nearly five years, and Baylis three or four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you collect your grease from different people? A. Yes; the last time I weighed the grease in Liquorpond-street, on the 16th, it weighed 4cwt. 1qr.; I had been there on the morning of the 15th, and there was some grease in the pan which I did not weigh - Reed, the officer, saw it weighed on the 16th. Restall and Freshingfield are employed in Liquorpond-street; when Restall is not there, Freshingfield locks the place, and brings me the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were they to do with the cask? A. They were to empty it clean out, and then weight it in the presence of George Restall; they were then to take it away empty, and get some more fat in it; if any part of it had been taken away I might have bought it again - it would have undergone no change whatever; I saw the grease on the 15th; it appeared to me to be 2cwt. and upwards.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RESTALL. I am servant to Thomas Knowles. I have been so for three or four years. I was at his shop in Orange-street when the prisoners brought the grease on the 15th - it was taken out of the scale and filled up with the stuff on the board, to 5cwt. 18lbs. - it was then put into the cart, and I drove it to Liquorpond-street - the two prisoners walked; I had seen 2cwt. 2lbs. put into the pan the day before, which came from Mr. Bullock's, and on the morning of the 15th, it appeared to be the same quantity; when I got to the warehouse I turned the cart round, and they got the cask by the side of the copper, and Baylis got the fork to empty it; I took hold of the fork, and Lodge gave me half a crown to go and get a feed of corn. I went, and was gone about five minutes, or not quite so much; I had not to go one hundred yards - on my return I saw the cask in the cart, upon its beam ends; I went into the melting-house and locked into the copper, and thought all was not right - I said nothing to the prisoners; they went into the street, where Albion said to Baylis, "We may as well have something to eat;" Baylis said "I was to have gone home to dinner - my wife has got a meat pudding, but she must not mind its being cold;" they then went up the steps of a public-house - I locked up the doors - they said to me "Come in;" I said I did not want any thing to drink, but I went into the house and spoke to my father - they offered me some beer but I would not have it. I was in the house about eight minutes, and then came out; I left them going along the passage. I went home to master and told him what I had seen - he came to the warehouse and weighed the fat, and took the weights - there was 4cwt. 26lb. in the pan, which was less by 217lbs. than I expected. I had kept the keys from the time I locked the door till my master got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you weigh the grease on the 14th? A. Yes, and gave my master the account of it. Mr. Bullock was there when it was weighed; Freshingfield went to the warehouse as well as myself; I did not weigh the grease on the 15th. The pan is a large surface, and it would be difficult, without trying, to know what quantity was in it. The stuff put in on the 14th was kitchen stuff - about the same sort as that put in on the 15th- I did not look into the cask when the prisoners were gone into the public house - it laid on its side in the cart, with its mouth towards the tail.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you weighed it on the 14th? A Yes; and I saw it on the 15th - if there had been 2 cwt. gone, I should have missed it; I looked into the pan, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160088"/>&gt;it appeared all right; after I left the melting house, I gave the keys to my master.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I was present when the prisoner brought this cask to be weighed, in Kingsgate-street; I saw it loaded, and was in the shop when Restall came and gave information - we all three went and weighed the grease in the melting-pan - there was 2cwt. short of what there should have been; there was only 4cwt. 26lbs.; I had been there on the night of the 14th, when it was weighed - and we put upwards of 2cwt. into the pan, and 4cwt. and upwards was sent on the morning of the 15th; I saw the quantity on the morning of the 15th, before the cask was sent from the house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAYLIS' Defence. There was an opportunity for Restall to look into the cart, and it was his own offer to go and fetch the corn - he went and got some cat's-meat; a great part of the grease was emptied before he went away - when he returned he said nothing to us - we went and had some refreshment - he went home to his master's, as I suppose, after he had been with his father.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RESTALL. They asked me to get some dog's-meat - and I said, "I might as well get some for the cat;" I was not absent more than five minutes - I went for the meat while they were measuring the corn.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a tail-board to the cart? A. Yes; it was as high as the sides - I could not look over it without raising myself up.</p>
