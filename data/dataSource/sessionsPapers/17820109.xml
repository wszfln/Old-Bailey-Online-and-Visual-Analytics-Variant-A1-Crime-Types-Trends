               <p>What do you know of the prisoner's taking? - I don't know who took them; I lost two pair of silk stockings, with my private mark upon them. I saw them about a quarter of an hour before she was brought back; I was up stairs in my dining room; it was about four o'clock in the evening, coming into the shop, the stockings were gone, two pair, what we call span silk, with private marks upon them, one mine, one my son's, and a paper of cotton caps, which were gone likewise; men's night-caps, all of which were found in the prisoner's possession; I saw them taken out of her apron, in my parlour; my son seized her, and found these things in her possession; she said somebody gave them to her; first she said, she picked them up, at the magistrate's she said somebody gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>It might be ten minutes before I missed them, I saw her; the constable has had the custody of the the things.</p>
               <p>T. Wolley (the constable.) I was sent for to Williamson's, when I came I found these things in the prisoner's apron, I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williamson, sen. These stockings there have my private mark on them; I made it myself; this pair is my stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williamson, jun. They are my marks; the paper of night-caps I tied up not two minutes before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williamson. sen. The writing on the paper of caps is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 26, near Gray's-inn-gate, three doors from it; above it on the same side.</p>
               <p>Williamson, jun. On the 13th of November I tied up this paper of caps, and went into the yard; not long after the maid called me; there were three women in the shop, I saw them go out; I did not see the prisoner in the shop, I saw her receive them together with other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you saw her receive them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where? - Just at Staples-inn-gate I stopt her, and asked her what she had got?</p>
               <p>Gray's-inn-gate is above the bars? - Yes; and my father's is three doors from that.</p>
               <p>I apprehend it to be several hundred yards from this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a hundred yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. She must be acquitted of this charge.</p>

               <p>What was in your purse? - A crown piece; the purse was silk.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for charging the prisoner? - I had not the least memory of either of the men; not the least recollection; they went away directly after.</p>

Mr. Filewood, and the lady, Mrs. Lewis; the man came to my side, and demanded our money, Mrs. Lewis instantly gave her purse; he demanded mine, I was not quite so ready, he desired I would make haste; it was loose silver; I did not see Mrs. Filewood's purse and watch given; I thought I had some recollection of the man, after the watch was stopped; I thought I had some knowledge of his face; I saw him afterwards when the watch was stopped; the prisoner was taken up; I went to the office to see him; I then thought it was the man that came on my side; there were two men; I saw but one.</p>

               <p>How did price escape? - It was dark, the stables run under ground; Price and the prisoner both run together.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him standing still before he run? - I saw him opposite the shop.</p>
               <p>Was that before Price spoke to him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Price had not spoke to him before they set out running? - No; I have known this man sometime, I never heard any harm before of him; I went round my counter, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the way; the counter runs up to the window.</p>

               <p>Which are the men? - Those at the bar; the little one took her buckles, that is Hall, I am certain of it; I am very certain to them all three.</p>

               <p>Are you shop-man to Mr. Didier? - Yes sir; I do not know the prisoner. On Tuesday, the 13th of November last, I missed fifty-two yards of black mode and silk, about two in the afternoon; I am not positive, whether I saw it for two or three days before, I knew it had been in the shop the day before, Mr. Didier saw it then; on Tuesday the 13th of November two women came into the shop, strangers to me, it was before I missed the mode; as soon as they were gone out of the shop I missed it, in about five minutes after; neither of those women were the prisoner; I did not hear any thing more of the silk till the Friday, then a person informed Mr. Didier about it; I know nothing of the silk being found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Didier called again.</p>
               <p>Where did you find your piece of mode? - I came home on Tuesday between two and three, I had the mode in my hand the day before; when I came home I was informed a piece of mode had been stolen; on Friday morning I found it in the constable's hands, in consequence of an advertisement, I could not have sworn to it, but for my shop mark in my hand writing; I never saw the prisoner till after the robbery at the Justice's, I only know from Wolley, the constable, how he came by it; at the Justice's she said she found it, or picked it up, or something, she said two women put it into her lap as she was going along, she acknowledged its being found upon her.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of November these women came into my father's shop, I was backwards, but was immediately called, and just as I came in, they went out on some frivolous pretence, I followed them, and going towards Gray's Inn-lane, they crossed over, and the prisoner was watching them, it is narrow there; I saw her open her apron and the woman popped the things into her lap; I stopped her, and asked her what she had in her apron, she said old cloaths; I desired to see them, and the first thing I saw was some silk stockings and chintzes of my father's, with some other things of a neighbour's.</p>
               <p>Court. Though it is very clear this woman did not come honestly by these goods,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090015"/> the offence is different from the charge of the indictment; it appears from Davidson's evidence, that this woman was in the shop of Didier, therefore her offence is certainly that of receiving the goods, knowing them to be stolen; if she had been so indicted, you would have had no doubt of convicting her, but there is now no evidence to convict her on this indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. Was he drunk then, or out of his senses; did you see. Mrs. Napper take up the cloak afterwards? - No; it was brought into the tap-room by Mrs. Napper, I did not see her take it up, but I am positive it was the same cloak, I saw her hang it up, I saw it on the nail.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Napper. Where did you pick up your cloak? - Out at the back door under the bench, I have the cloak here now; he begged my pardon, and begged me to be merciful, he said he never was brought up to work, he deserved to be hanged years ago, he is a noted thief.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, I was a customer at the house for beer, I came in and said to the old gentlewoman, I want a pot of beer and change for a shilling, and the gentlewoman said you have dropt something, I said I had dropt nothing; then I went into the taproom, and the gentlewoman said that is what he has dropt; I said do what you will with me, and they took me up, and sent for the constable, he said I must go with him to the Compter; then I went before the Lord Mayor, he asked her if it was her cloak, she said she valued it at half a guinea; he asked her if she could prove I dropt it, she said no; the Lord Mayor said I commit this man to the Compter, they called the landlord, he said he knew nothing of it. I know no more of it than the child unborn; I have four witnesses below, I cannot read English, their names are on this paper, Myles, Daniel, Cole, and Hendricks.</p>
               <p>Who put the names down on that paper? - I cannot tell who he was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090016"/>SAMPSON HENDRICKS sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A corn doctor; I have known the prisoner a great many years, he is my nephew, it is my duty to appear for him, I never knew him to be before the face of a magistrate in his life, he always bore an exceeding good character; I know nothing of the other witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. This story is certainly a very odd one, that this man should deliberately take the bonnet off the hook, lay it down, and take the cloak, and carry it off before their faces, is something very extraordinary, and the account he gave of himself, that he got his living by thieving, and deserved to be hanged twenty times, is more extraordinary; the prisoner has given no answer to that, only one witness has appeared for him, his uncle, and knows nothing against him; you will form your own judgment of the case, and if you have any reason to doubt of the evidence you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury. how do you get your living?</p>
               <p>By selling lemons, and sometimes cloaths; get 10 s. or 8 s. a week.</p>

               <p>I am a weaver, a manufacturer; on the 20th of December I was going through Bishopsgate-street, and by the Black Bull, I stopped for a cart to come out of the inn; about one in the afternoon, or a little after, just behind the dark part of the gateway, I saw a man who is the prisoner, with a basket of raisins in his hand, and was walking very fast, he was coming out of the gateway, after the cart, and was going out by Mr. Macmurdo's, he turned directly to go towards Threadneedle-street, in consequence of that I called to the carman, and he went up to the man, and took the basket, and asked him what he was doing with it; I saw him do it; I asked the car-man why he did not take the man as well as the basket, but he kept to his cart; I followed the man, who took to his heels; I did not lose sight of him till the turning;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090017"/> I overtook him again, and looked at him in the face, and went into the Poulry Compter to get a constable to take him, I called a constable to go up Cheapside, I met him, I said that is the man, and the constable took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Was it so placed that it was likely to fall out of the cart? - I cannot say; I should think it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am porter at the four swans, Bishopsgate-street, I was in that Inn yard at half past one, I went with an order of Hinde's and Butterfield's, I saw nothing in Bishopsgate-street; as I was coming back, the turnkey of the Poultry, said, I must go with him, I told him my name and my business; this gentleman said, he saw a carman take a basket off my back, I was very contented, I neither saw the basket nor the cart.</p>
               <p>Court to Davies. Are you sure you can now swear to the prisoner's person, you had but little time to observe him? - I remarked a little mark on his cheek, I am clear is the same man.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did you see him again, how long was it? - It might be an hour very likely.</p>
               <p>To Coates. How long was it from the time you lost sight of the man, when you went to the Compter, till you took up the prisoner in Cheapside? - I believe five or six minutes; we took him up a little beyond the Old Jury, but a little from the Compter, the man threatened me, says I, my friend I think I am very clear, because I passed you, he said he had been at Hinde's and Butterfield's, as he tells you now, I went to them knowing them, they said he had been there, in that he has given you a true account; I am very glad you asked that question because it made me recollect.</p>
               <p>To Coates. You met him again returning that was between Hind and Butterfield's and the old Jury? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure and positive as to his person? - I am very clear in it that it is the same person; I immediately followed him, I did not lose sight of him, but just at the turning of Threadneedle-street; I overtook him without running, because I thought it would only alarm him, then I looked at him, I verily believe him to be the same man, I looked at his face, his coat and his stockings, he had very brown stockings on.</p>
               <p>You learned that he was a porter at the four swans? - Yes, sir; I went there.</p>
               <p>To Coates. Was the prisoner's hair tied behind or not? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, on Monday the 10th about half past eight, we had been to Smithfield, I saw a coach stop at a certain house, near a public-house, the sign of the Sun; I saw the tallest, Osborne, jump out of the coach, I was twenty yards from it, I said there was something suspicious in his loitering about; he whispered to the other prisoner who was in the coach, they did not both come out, Osborne went right down the street; I looked in at the coach door, and saw the bundle there, Osborne made off, I am not positive he saw me or not; I continued there some time, I said I had a right to come in, and what have you got here; Peach said, what did I want there, I ordered the coachman to drive to Justice Blackborrow's, with Peach in it, he was examined, and committed for a farther examination; there are the things I found in the coach with them, afterwards Osborne was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Osborne. Ask him if this man was in the coach with me when he took me? -</p>
               <p>Court. He says he saw Osborne go out of the coach, and only you and the bundle in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear Osborne went out of the coach? - I am positive sure of it.</p>
               <p>The constable produced the things, and said they had been in his custody ever since.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor deposed, they were his property, I know the bed curtain by the tuck in particular, and the pattern, the glass I can swear to, the scutcheon is on the drawer.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing else you know to be yours? No; they found no more.</p>
               <p>This was the next day you saw them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who called you? - It was one of the two gentlemen at the bar, and took me to the bottom of Newtoner's-street, and desired me turn down on the left hand side to Parker's-lane, I did so, there the two prisoners brought a bundle and a glass.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the same persons? Yes; they ordered me to drive into Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, and from thence to White chapel, and back again to Turnmill-street, and when they stopped me in Turnmill-street, Mr. Blackborrow's men came to me at the coach door; I never saw them before that day, I carried them to Justice Blackborrow's.</p>

               <p>She says she saw me roll it out of the road; says she saw that young man take it out of the road, and put it down there in the ditch, and as soon as that man came up to her, I went up and asked her if she wanted any thing, as I thought she might have heard something of it; she said no; I stood there, it was twenty yards from the box she says, and it was not seven yards; she told him at first she saw me roll it out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090024"/> of the path-way, then said I put it in the ditch. I have no witnesses; I did not see the box at all till I came close by Stamford Hill; the box lay in the road, I rolled it on the path-way; this woman coming along I asked if she wanted any thing, she said no, nothing of me; I thought she might have heard something of it.</p>

               <p>What did she say besides? - She said she had a child of six weeks old, and begged for mercy for the infant's sake; it was the first offence; the child was not with her.</p>

               <p>Might not a card of lace of that bulk stick to the lace of her cloak? - It was not near the desk; I saw her at the end of the counter; she had no occasion to pass by the desk to go to the back room.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You first met with another man talking with a woman? - Yes; I spoke to her, and he said, that woman is my wife; this was on the 27th of December; I said, I did not mean any harm to her, you are welcome to a glass of any thing; I did not know that any house was open at that time; it was about three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>You say you ordered the coachman to drive, where? - To the Golden Cross, at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>When you called it first, why did not you refuse to let the men go and tell the coachman they were not of your company? - I was much flurried, I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I was not drunk, I was sober enough to know what I was about.</p>
               <p>If sober, you would hardly have gone with them? - I only suspected one of them, I could not tell whether the other was his friend or no, I was at a stand, and did not know what to do, I never was in such a situation.</p>
               <p>Is it possible a sober man could act in such a manner, if you suspected one, then you was three to one, you might have objected? - I certainly knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>How came you to let the coach go on to Piccadilly? - I don't know, when I quitted the coach, I took my money out to pay the coachman, I had one shilling and sixpence in silver, the prisoner snatched out of my hand a guinea and a half, and a shilling.</p>
               <p>He did not demand your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor produce a weapon? - No; my handkerchief was taken out of my pocket in the coach, nor my tobacco-box, I did not miss that, the other was forced out of my hand and nothing said, I held the prisoner fast till the watchman came up.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am patrole watchman in the winter, my partner and I go two and two together; about the 2d of December we heard a noise the corner of the Hay-market, near the Lemon Tree; when we came up, he said they have robbed me, says he, take hold of that man, I ran after him, could not catch him, they took him to the watch-house, and found this tobacco-box and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090027"/> handkerchief, and a guinea, on him, the prosecutor seemed to be between both, not quite in liquor, nor quite sober, I was present when they were taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor deposed to the box, which was taken privately from him, and the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at a house and called for a pint of purl, and this other man was drinking there, as soon as I drank my purl, I went out of the house to go home, I overtook this gentleman at the bottom of Ludgate-hill, he was reeling about, much in liquor, I advised him to go home, he would not, I joaked with him, I said I suppose you are like me, says he, what do you mean, says I, are you locked in the street, no, says he, but I don't chuse to go home to disturb my family and servants; another man came up, and he said, I don't want you, the gentleman was much in liquor, he did not know what to do, we got a coach, and got into it, he pulled the tobacco-box out, and it dropped down, he was very much in liquor, and with the movement of the coach he fell asleep, instead of putting his handkerchief in his pocket, he put it down on the seat of the coach; I called to the coachman, and said there was something dropped down in the coach; I stooped and picked up the handkerchief and box, he put them in my pocket, he was very much in liquor, he could hardly get out of the coach; when he got out, he pulled out a shilling, and a half guinea, and some half-pence, I said, I had some silver and would pay it for him. I thought the gentleman would forget, I had laid out the eighteen-pence for him, and I took the half guinea out of his hand, says he directly you have robbed me, says I, I have got none but your half guinea as security, if you give me the eighteen-pence, you shall have it directly, no, says he, you have robbed me. I gave him the half-guinea again, he said, I had robbed him of three or four guineas; I had but one guinea about me, with some silver, I paid the coachman. The next morning they asked me how I came by the tobacco box, and the handkerchief; I told them the same I do now to you. They would not hear me, I have no witnesses here, they are gone, I asked the coachman, I said have you seen me rob the gentleman? No, says he, the gentleman is drunk and mad.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Why did not you bring the coachman, Mr. Roberts? - I did not speak to the coachman.</p>
               <p>Why did you not take the number? - I did not take that; as soon as I took my money out, he seized my money.</p>
               <p>Court. The charge in the indictment, is a highway robbery. In order to constitute that, it is necessary either the property should be actually taken from the person who is robbed, by force or violence; with the use of weapons, or with force and violence, or that it should be delivered by the person, in consequnce of the fear of some immediate personal attempt to his life or person. With respect to the handkerchief and tobacco box, found by the watchman, there is no pretence for supporting the indictment, for they were certainly taken, if not found, as the prisoner says, in the coach, but taken from the prosecutor at all, they were taken privately without his perceiving it; that is an offence of a different nature, and there is not the least pretence for saying he was robbed (in a legal sense) of his tobacco box and handkerchief. It does not seem to me that there is evidence enough to constitute a highway robbery; there was no demand of money; no threat used by the prisoner; no weapon produced to put the prosecutor in fear; the prosecutor did not deliver the money, nor was it taken from him by such force and violence as would endanger his life and person, but upon drawing his money out of his pocket himself, and holding out his hand for the purpose of paying the coachman; the prisoner snatched it out of his hand; though that is clearly a theft and felony, it is not in point of law, a highway robbery; and therefore I don't think upon his own evidence, the prosecutor has proved sufficient to warrant the indictment. It was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090028"/> in a way that might make it felony, but it is not a highway robbery, and therefore he ought to be acquitted of the charge of the highway robbery upon this indictment.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of these men before the time of the robbery? - No; I had a very great opportunity of seeing Coleman.</p>
               <p>Have you told us the expressions you made use of? - Yes; I never saw the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to say Coleman give me the ring? - I meant from hearing his name since; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Your expression was, Coleman give me the ring, you was mistaken in the expression? - I was.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - I believe the sun had not been out, it was rather a dull cloudy day; it was near four.</p>
               <p>Was it dusk, or full day light? - It rather began to decline; I kept them there as long as I could, before I parted with the money, thinking I might see somebody; I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>They were quite strange to you? - They were, or I should have spoke of it at the office; Coleman had a laced hat on, I am certain of his person, the other I do not know, it was about his size, I cannot positively swear to the face; I was very little alarmed at the time.</p>
               <p>Did either present any weapon? - The tall one had a pistol; I observed he held it up with his hand under the right flap of his coat; the short one did not, the other did, I took it to be such by the brightness of the barrel; he held it out to me.</p>
               <p>Did not the sight of the pistol alarm you? - It had some little effect upon me.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it before you saw either of the prisoners? - It was better than a fortnight; it was the Monday before Christmas day they were taken, near three weeks.</p>
               <p>Could you in three minutes seeing him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090029"/> and never saw him for three weeks after, know him so as to swear to him? - Yes; I can speak positively to Coleman.</p>
               <p>When did you first see them? - They were not taken up on my account; I first saw them at Bow-street, I believe it was the Wednesday after Christmas day, I had a note from the office to attend; they were both there, I saw them in the public office with several more, they were all intermixed, I pointed out the short one myself, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>You lost a watch and mourning ring? - Yes; the ring was found at a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street, the next morning after it was taken from me, by a person going about with hand-bills; one of the officers came and told me; I went to Wardour-street, and saw the ring at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>What is the pawnbroker's name? - Payne.</p>
               <p>What sort of ring? - A white enamel'd ring; it was given me by Mr. Haldiman, in St. Mary Axe, it was his daughter's, a child of eight years of age, her name and age were engraved on the ring, I attended to teach music there; the ring was too small for me, I was not measured for it; I had notice of it, and did not put it on, but put it in my pocket, the ring I found at the pawnbroker's was the same; I was present at the office when the prisoners were examined; the tall man was asked how he came by it, the ring was pawned in the name of

            , he pawned it.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything respecting the charge? He said he had bought it of a soldier.</p>
               <p>Did Coleman say any thing? - Not that I heard; the tall one held a pistol out, I put my hand round to put it from me.</p>
               <p>The robbery was between Kentish-Town and Pancras, in the common footway, both in soldiers cloaths, no other person near us at the time of passing; I followed them across the other road.</p>
               <p>What induces you to think it was him, except the general knowledge of Coleman, was there any thing remarkable in his face? He had a remarkable face; westood face to face some time; at first I was not much frighttened, a little I was, but more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you no intimation from any person in the office that he was the man? - No.</p>
               <p>You can swear at three weeks distance that was the man? - I am quite positive as to Coleman; I am not sure of the other.</p>

            ; he was dressed very genteely in a white coat spotted with green, and a green shag waistcoat, and his hair powdered very much.</p>

               <p>He was not in regimentals then? - No; I had seen him once before, he brought a watch about a fortnight before, and came in a few days and sold it to a hair-dresser; I knew him when he came again with the ring, he was not with me above five minutes when he pawned the ring.</p>
               <p>Was the shop light or dark? - Three candles in it; we are forced to keep a good light, to see the things.</p>
               <p>The people that come there stand in a bad light? - We put the light in front; we can see them distinctly, nobody else; when he came, we asked him where he lived, he said in the same street.</p>
               <p>Did you ask no farther questions? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Do you make a practice of receiving things, and only ask their names? - He appeared to be a gentleman; we enquired where he lived; if strangers come, we are satisfied with asking their names, and where they live; there was a hand-bill the next morning, we went down to Bow-street to let them know we had the ring.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty Curtis pawned the ring? - I can; it might be a week after that I saw him at the public office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090030"/>Was it not three weeks? - I cannot be sure; it was some time after, I had been at the office four or times about it.</p>
               <p>Was any body with Curtis when he came and pawned the ring? - No.</p>
               <p>To Duncombe. How long had you this ring before you lost it? - The day before; for the family was out of town, they went to Brighthelmstone or Margate.</p>
               <p>Court. The ring is dated August? - It is.</p>
               <p>Do you know the ring, look at it? - This is the ring; I don't suppose a gentleman of Mr. Haldiman's sort would pawn such a ring; I know it to be mine, by the name, and the ring not fitting.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Are there not ten thousand rings that will not fit you like that? - I cannot be positive, but there may be more rings like it.</p>
               <p>You would not be so certain, if you found it, or seen it on the finger of a gentleman, or any other situation than you saw it after you lost it? - Not if I saw it on any gentleman's finger; I should suppose the same gentleman had sent him one; it was about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Is it not in general dark at that time of year at that hour? - It was not dark; I saw Coleman's face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>To the pawnbroker's apprentice. There are boxes in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are the candles removable? - Yes; we always put the candle so as to see them; we did I remember then, because I saw him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>There was no shade on his face? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw him perfectly well? - I did.</p>

             came to my shop, offered me a watch, and wanted a guinea and a half on it; I brought him one guinea, he refused it, and went out, came in again, and took the guinea; soon after, at a quarter before nine, an officer came to tell me to stop the watch, I told him I had taken it, I had seen this man about four times in my shop before; I went to the place where I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090032"/> he lodged, there I learned he was a soldier, but gone from there; he was dressed the same I ever saw him in, a light coloured coat, with small spots; in the street one day, I saw him have a green one; I don't know what it was that day he had on, I am certain of his person. (He produces the watch). This is the watch pawned by Curtis. The prosecutor looks at the watch and deposes it was his property. I will swear to the watch, it has my own name to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination of the Pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Sometimes things are pawned in their own names, sometimes not, he pawned this in the name of Curtis; I knew him, and he was conscious for aught I know, no doubt he knew that, he said to me, if I had came clandestinely by the watch, you may be certain I would not have pawned it in my own name, where I was known.</p>
               <p>Court to Jolly. What trade are you of? - A watch gilder.</p>
               <p>Are you a watchmaker? - If any body bespeaks a watch, I make it up; the watch has my name to it, as the maker's.</p>
               <p>Is there any other mark but your own name; - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you put your name to several other watches? - I don't know that I have; I have made several others twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>What does 1202 mean? - Sometimes they put one number, sometimes another; ++ 1012, I think is the number to the best of my knowledge of the watch, I wore myself.</p>
               <p>Did you know that before you lost it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would you know the watch you lost from any other with your name to it? - Yes; if you would let me look at it, by the top case, and name, and number, the top case is almost wore off the thread of it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular about the spring that you open the watch by? - The button is very much wore, and I knew that before I lost it. Upon my oath I knew that before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know it before you lost your watch? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prothero. This old gentleman said one of the men had robbed him; I found nothing but the cloaths; at the office there were three or four serjeants, the prosecutor was desired to look round, and see if he knew any one; he looked for a considerable time, and said, if it is any man here, it is (Curtis); he was desired to touch the man that he knew, and he did touch him; he did not say Curtis, for he did not know his name; he then saw the cloaths on my arm, he snatched hold of the coat, and said, this is the coat the man had on that robbed me; he was desired to pull off his regimentals, and put that coat and waistcoat on; when he had done that, the old gentleman went up to him, and took him by the coat, and said, this is the man, I am positive.</p>
               <p>He expressed a doubt before the cloathes were put on? - He said, if it is any amongst the persons in the room it was him; he went and laid hold of him by the coat, and said, this is the man, I am certain, as soon as he put the coat on.</p>

               <p>I was sent for on the 24th of December, about a watch that was taken on the highway by two men; I found it at a watchmaker's in Pettyfrance, at Mr. Wilcox's, he helped us to the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prothero. I found nothing on Coleman.</p>
               <p>- Wilcox. I am a serjeant in the guards; on the 24th of December, the pawnbroker and Mr. Halliburton came to me on the parade in St. James's Park, and told me a watch had been pawned by Curtis, and I made enquiry, and we took him on guard; he told me Coleman was with him when he pawned the watch, I sent one of the officers to fetch him, which he did; Curtis told me he had found the watch behind some ruins, the bottom of Tothill-street, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and Coleman was with him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He says he was robbed at a quarter past one, and he was detained eight minutes by me, which made it near twenty-five minutes; after we came from inspection, a little after ten, I stopped at the Three Tuns<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090033"/> and had some beer, then I went home to my lodgings, and pulled off my coat, and put my necessaries by; we had had an inspection; I and the rest of my comrades drank six or seven pots of beer; I left the house about ten minutes before one, I was going over to the Borough along with this man, but we did not go, as I met a friend at the bottom of Tothill-street, and went and had a pint of beer with him, that detained me till about five or six minutes past one; I then went to Westminster Bridge, we were to come home and dine with the landlady, she asked us to dinner, we said, if we go to the Borough, we shall be late to dinner; we returned about six or seven minutes before two, and had dinner and a little beer; at the bottom of Tothill-street, there were some ruins and buildings there, I went on one side to ease myself, and saw the watch lying upon the ground, I said I had found a watch, I came back to her house, and did not go to to the Borough, but staid there the remainder of the day; the next day, as I had no money, I went to pawn the watch; the pawnbroker knew me very well, I told him I wanted a guinea and a half upon the watch, he said he would lend but one guinea; as I was late for guard, I came back and desired to have a guinea upon it.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember the time he came home that day? - I had a ham and fillet of veal, and more friends to dine with me; I said, what made you stay so late; I particularly remember the hour of dining, we generally dine about half past one; when they came in, I remember I said it wanted but five minutes of two, and you were to be at home at half past one.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they were taken up? - On the Monday morning, a gentleman came to search my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Prothero deposed, she told him they came home within five minutes of two, or under, and that they both came home in a coach.</p>
               <p>What distance is this place from Pancrass, where the robbery was committed, to Tothill fields? - About two miles, or two miles and an half, it cannot exceed that.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Hemmet. Did they come home in a coach that day? - They said they did; I did not see it.</p>
               <p>(As neither Prothero nor Hemmet could remember what sort of a day it was, the Court asked the question of Mr. Arnold, who said it was a very fair day, but the sun was not out.)</p>
               <p>- Parsons, a hair-dresser, deposed, he had known Curtis several years, that Curtis had worked for him as a journeyman, and was very honest.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parsons deposed, she had known him for eighteen y ears, had known him from a child, that he was very honest, and had never heard any imputation upon his character; that he always behaved well.</p>

               <p>The court were of opinion, Mr. Beauchamp was a competent witness, as he could be no more interested, than a person prosesecuting a thief for stealing his goods (whether there was a felony committed or not, must depend upon the evidence, ab initio) he is entitled by law to the property stolen, the moment the prisoner is convicted; therefore more strongly interested in the conviction than Mr. Beauchamp, in the present case; to incapacitate a person from being a witness, he must be immediately interested in the subject matter in dispute; supposing it to be a forgery, the person whose name is forged as an indorser, cannot be examined as a witness, to prove it is not his hand writing; if it was his hand writing, he would be charged with the payment of the money; therefore he is particularly interested, which is not the case, here it is a vague interest, and not the subject matter in consideration of the court.</p>

I looked all through it, I took it on the credit of the Bath bank, the acceptance; and the prisoner's appearance; I looked to the name of the acceptor, and gave credit to that, I knew nothing of Hevey before, no other conversation passed, he might be a swindler, or a substantial man; I trusted to the appearance of the note, and I relied upon the credit of the Bath bank; the order was signified by the indorsement; the first credit was to the bill itself; I was examined at Guildhall five or six times; I remember I said, the prisoner told me his name was M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Did you accompany that with any other observation? - I said, that he told me his name was M'Carty, on two or three examinations.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I did not take him up, I was at the Mansion house when the prisoner was brought there before Mr. Alderman Pugh; I searched him, and found he had a handful of gold, which I gave him again, by order of the Alderman, I found a pocket-book and a great number of notes in it, bank notes in appearance, they have been opened by different magistrates, and sealed up again; he went by the name of Hevey, never by any other name. (Then he produced a number of notes, sealed up.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they of the same kind with the rest?</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. The same bank; here are a great number, and for different sums.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they all indorsed? - Here are many B. M'Carty, and there are some blank ones; and here is a blank for a bill of exchange from Dublin, and their sums are different.</p>
               <p>Court. There is one payable to Hevey himself, I see.</p>

             was called, but objected to being an evidence upon the trial, as he was committed prisoner upon the same affair, and desired to know if he was indicted, that if he was, he would not be a witness.</p>
               <p>The Court informed him, he would not be obliged to answer any question that might tend to prove him guilty of any crime, that he was not bound to give evidence that might criminate himself, that if he was to accuse himself in Court, he might be indicted for it, and it was open for him.</p>
               <p>The Council for the Prisoner told him, he would not ask him any questions that could possibly criminate him.</p>
               <p>He then submitted to be examined.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner at the bar? - I do, very well.</p>
               <p>You had a house in St. Helen's? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a person as M'Carty? I do.</p>
               <p>Court. All this may be very material evidence to prove him guilty of a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. It does; it may go farther, it may make him an accessary before the fact.</p>
               <p>The Court said, it is necessary to tell you, if there is a bill preferred against you for a conspiracy, what you have now said already may certainly go to make against you upon that charge.</p>

               <p>Do you know M'Carty's hand-writing? I cannot possibly say; I have seen his hand writing I believe upon the back of the bills, I can say the hand-writing was equal upon every bill that I have passed through my hands, which I have accepted and paid; I have not seen him write an indorsement, therefore I cannot possibly say whether I know the hand-writing or not.</p>

               <p>Court. You are going to disprove his hand writing by a similitude of hands, which you cannot do, it is not a proper proof.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinson called. Deposed he had seen M'Carty write once, to a bond of indemnito to the parish, in the year 1774. The bond shewn the witness, signed at that time, was objected to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashhurst stated, there were two questions proper for the consideration of the jury; the first, was, whether they believed it to be the indorsement of any person of the name of

             M'Carty; if it was not, there could be no doubt it was a forgery. If there was no such person in existence, or that it was not really his hand writing; but supposing they should be of opinion, there was such a man existing as

             M'Carty, and that it was his hand writing; there still might be another question, proper for their consideration, (and that was upon a point, which he believed had never been precisely determined by any judicial determination). Whether, if a person produces the real signature of a person existing, purporting to be the indorsement of such person, and says, I am that

             M'Carty, or that man (whoever he is) that indorsed the note, that in fact is not the man; it shall, or not, amount in point of law to a forgery; and said, if the jury found their verdict upon the latter ground, he would take care the matter should undergo a discussion, before the twelve judges, who would settle the point of law. The law in general was thus, If a person tended any instrument to another, with intent to procure money or goods, and indorsed it himself by another person's name, in the presence of the person to whom it is tendered, that would certainly be in point of law, a forgery; that he believed had already been determined; but that was not the case here, the prisoner did not sign the name

               <p>Jury to Mr. Beauchamp. Whether at the time the prisoner offered the bill, the servant was in the shop? And whether the prisoner offered to indorse the bill?</p>
               <p>Court. Was the servant in the shop at the time the bill was offered to you? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Beauchamp. Yes; but he was employed at the farther end of the shop, upon other business.</p>
               <p>Did or did not the prisoner, at the time, offer to indorse it? - No, sir; he said he had indorsed it, and that was his name.</p>
               <p>He did not say he would indorse it, but he had indorsed it? - He had indorsed it, he said.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came he to go out of your shop, before the boy returned? - He was gone a long while, I had the watch; he was in and out of the shop, and waited; I had the watch and money too, till the boy came back.</p>

               <p>I have been employed for the Mint thirteen years; there was information given to me by Mr. Campbell, on Saturday the 15th, I appointed to come on Monday, at five o'clock; I went, and was put into a warehouse, which came to the back of the house where these people lived, and about half past five they came up to tea; just before they came, I heard a thump, the warehouse was as near as I am to you; after they had drank tea, they went down again; after they had been down about five minutes, the thump went as it had done before, it was the fly for the cutting-out press, it goes with a force, so as to force out a thick piece of copper, therefore it makes a noise; I appointed to come again on Wednesday with some officers, to see what they were; I went then, and knocked at the door, a servant opened it, on the door-plate was the name of Smith; I asked if Mr. Smith was at home, the girl said no; I immediately pushed the girl on one side, and went to the cellar, I went to go into it, but they had put out the candle, and I kept every body down till I got a light. In the first cellar I saw Corn and Morgan, in the cellar where the big press was, where they had been coining halfpence, and Mr. Clark I likewise found there, it was the stamping press; Corn and Morgan were standing by the press, it is a narrow cellar, that the fly had only just room to go round, they were in a working dress, their coats off, and shirt sleeves tucked up; I put them in custody; I went into the furthermost cellar, where I brought out Acton, he was in a working dress, the same as the rest, his wig and all his cloaths were in the kitchen; he was near the cutting-out press, where somebody had been at work, I am sure of that, for the chair was warm, where somebody had been sitting at the press; I did not observe whether he was warm or not, only found him in a working situation, I put him in custody; I put all the prisoners in one cellar, and then went and fetched Mr. Campbell; in the first cellar I saw a cutting-out press, and a large press, and a quantity of half-pence; in the further cellar, another press,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090043"/> blank coppers; cecil, and one halfpenny in the die, which was cut out, and given to Mr. Campbell; the dies were fixed in the press, Mr. Campbell saw the prisoners there. I kept every thing very quiet, and the people down in the cellar; knowing the master of the house was not at home, I set a person at the door to stop whoever came, I heard a bell ring, I applied to the door, and the master,

             the Second, and the impression is faint, I found the reverse die to it in the house, in the parlour drawer, I think Mr. Campbell took it out himself; they were all committed that night, and the wife, being found in the cellar; when before the magistrate, Clark owned all the things, that his wife might be discharged.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask him any particulars, when he came into the door? - He was asked who he was, and he said he came to ask for Mr. Johnson; I never ask a man to say one single word, for fear he might say any thing that might injure himself, I let it alone till he comes before the magistrate; Mr. Prothero has had the custody of all the things, I have some halfpence that have been finished, I found them there. (Produces the finished halfpence.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did the things you found there contain a compleat apparatus for coining halfpence? - As exact as can be.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You said you first went into a warehouse, how was that situated, was it near any place? - There is a small yard at Mr. Clarke's house; the kitchen is above stairs, it was about half past five, it is not a very light place, but there was a light in the room; but you will have that from Mr. Campbell. I saw Clarke write in a book, and put the book in this place again.</p>
               <p>I understand you then, that you saw these four people in the kitchen; and they left the kitchen for some time, and you suppose that they went down stairs, and came up stairs again? - I said, they came up stairs to drink tea, and went down stairs again.</p>
               <p>You went a little further than that at first, now you only mean to say, that you do not know where they went; you said you went below stairs? - I said, I believed I did.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to say, the noise could come from no other quarter but that? - I would not swear from whence the noise came; we were not very silent when we went into the house; the girl made a noise when I pushed her on one side, which I wish I could have prevented; I should have gone down, and they would not have heard me; there is just room in the place for the fly to turn; I did-not see them at work, they stood close to the press.</p>
               <p>Could they stand otherwise, on account of the smallness of the cellar? - I do not think they could; we looked for other tools but could not find any thing else, we passed directly to the other cellar, I did not see them then as I did afterwards; after they came up into the kitchen, there hung up all their coats, and Acton's wig hung up on the mantle-piece; their coats and their great-coats; the front cellar I look upon to be a very large one, where the other cutting out press was; it was a long cellar, and they stood at the further corner of it.</p>
               <p>You did not see Acton do any thing? - I only found him in the room.</p>
               <p>So as to the people in the first cellar, and the people in the second cellar, you did not find them doing any thing; you only found them standing there, and doing nothing? - That is all, sir; then Abraham Clarke came in, and said, all these things were his.</p>
               <p>It has been said, you have been employed thirteen years by the mint; I wish the jury to understand, who you are; are you not one of the officers at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect some share of the reward? - As much as you do with your brief, sir, for the conviction; this is an imputation thrown on me, which I do not deserve, I will appeal to the Court, and Recorder, who knows me; I am perhaps worth as much money as you are.</p>
               <p>Court. Whatever the operation of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090044"/> question may be, is for the judgment of the jury; the question is certainly a proper one; whether there is a reward, and do you expect a part of it; your being entitled to it, is no sort of imputation upon your conduct; it is a proper question; the jury have a right to know the circumstance in which a witness stands.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that halfpenny you took out of the die, warm? - The rest were then warm; I do not know for that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you say, that you took the halfpenny from the die yourself; and yet you say now, you do not know, whether it was warm? - I let that halfpenny stay in the die, till I went and fetched Mr. Campbell; here is a quantity of other dies that were found there, a dozen, or more.</p>
               <p>PROTHERO sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with Mr. Clark at this place, on the 19th of December; I was going down stairs after Clark, he said, here they are; I retreated for a candle into the kitchen, seeing no light there, and in my hurry, I ran my candle too far into the fire; Corn, and Morgan, with Mrs. Clark, were standing behind the press; Corn immediately asked me how I did; I told him I was very well, and laughed at him; we tied them together directly, Morgan and Corn; the witness Clark, went into the further cellar, and brought Acton o ut; he had on a very dirty shirt, and no wig nor hat on; Corn had his waistcoat on, but Morgan had not; I am sure both had their coats off, their shirt-sleeves were tucked up, and both very dirty and greasy; Morgan, and Acton, had no waistcoats on I am sure; Corn, I think had, to the best of my recollection; the snuff of the candle was burning by the press, it was knocked down, I told the prisoners of it; then I tied Acton, the other prisoner, by himself; and they were all four kept there, till Mr. Campbell was fetched, and nothing touched further, till he came; there was a vast quantity of blanks, cecil copper at first, this is the proper sheet of copper (produces a sheet of copper in two pieces, with the blanks cut out of the middle) only the blanks are taken out of the middle of it, what remains of the copper, is called the cecil; the cecil is laid on the side of the press, and that half sheet was in the press; here are a great quantity of halfpence, finished, that were found there, by the great press; after they strike the impression, they drop; they are all finished, all to colouring, they have a way of colouring them afterwards; I did not touch any of the halfpence for some time afterwards; Clark brought Acton out of the other cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether if people cut copper to make buttons, or any thing else, they do not cut it in the same way? - I should imagine so, I am no judge of it, I never saw any buttons made.</p>
               <p>Is not the same instrument made use of, either for buttons or for halfpence? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The same question to Clarke? - There is not the least doubt of it, though not of the same stuff, it is a mixt metal; they would out out with the same press, but not with the same tools.</p>
               <p>To Prothero. You are an officer of justice belonging to Bow-street? - Yes, Sir, I am; I am not ashamed of it.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of December, Mr. Roe, a neighbour of mine, suspected that coiners lived at No. 24, in Little St. Thomas Apostle's, and not chusing to trust our own constables, as it was a house of credit in the front, I applied to Bow-street; I saw Mr. Clarke, and mentioned the circumstance of the noise, and the condition the men were often seen in, to him, and he said he had little doubt but they were coiners; on the Monday he met me at Roe's, I took him into Roe's warehouse, to see the men, and opened the shutter a very little, of one of the windows, which looked directly into their kitchen; there were tea-things, and bread and butter; we heard the thumping very fast, and after waiting about half an hour, there came three men into the kitchen, two of them had their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090045"/> coats off, and might have their waistcoats off; one of them (Morgan) had his coat on, they all looked very warm, I have very little doubt that these are all the men; I would not chuse to swear positively to them, I believe these to be the men, and Morgan the man that had his coat on, Corn, Morgan and Acton, after tea they went down stairs, and the thumping began; we had no light in the warehouse, because they should not observe us, as there never were any candles at night there, and they had candles and the light of the fire, that we could distinguish them, I was very near them, it was a very small yard, and the warehouse window looked down into the kitchen; then we went into Mr. Roe's cellar, thinking we might hear the knockings more distinct there, we heard it much in the same manner, in a line from us, I have no doubt where the noise came from, for there is no man in Mr. Robinson's warehouse, and the other side a widow lives, I have very little doubt but the noise came from there. Mr. Roe and I did not chuse to appear as the informers at that time, it was said they were people come out of the country; Mr. Clark appointed to meet us on Wednesday, at twelve o'clock; he came with his men, before he went in he said, if they are coiners, I will send a man with a red face; he came himself in a few minutes, and beckoned; I went into the cellar, there the three men were tied together, with their coats off, and all very dirty, they all appeared as if at very hard work; I looked into the small cellar, there was a cutting-out press, Clark turned the fly round, and took a halfpenny out; he wished me to put a mark on it, and to swear to it; I bid him put a mark on it, and I would keep it; he put a mark on it, what it is I do not know, here is the halfpenny; (produces a halfpenny) round the die there appeared to be a great quantity of halfpence, that appeared as if just put into the press, and fresh cut off; they lay round it in the inner cellar, where the cutting-out press was, it was a very small place, something of a wine vault at the end of it, there was a table, with a hole through it, and a cutting-out press on it, and a box with blanks; in the front cellar there was another cutting-out press, there was no halfpence in that, but there was a table standing by it with halfpence, told out in sixpenny-worths; they appeared to be coloured like halfpence, they were all told out, but not tied up; the men began pulling the presses to pieces, Clark told them to make little noise; we went up stairs to see if we could find any thing; in one of the drawers I found some of the dies, that was all; we went to the closet in the kitchen where we had seen the prisoner Clark go, we found nothing there; somebody ringing at the door, the prisoner Clark came in, and the door was shut, and Mr. Clark went up to him, and told him to walk into the kitchen, that he might search him; he came in very readily; Mr. Clark pulled a die out of his pocket, he asked him how he came by it, he said he picked it up that morning in the street, Mr. Clark said it is unfortunate that the paper should be so dry and clean, it was a very rainy morning; he was very anxious to know where his wife was, he was very anxious for her safety; he said every thing belonging to the house was his, one of them wished to change his shirt, their shirts were very dirty and black; they put on their cloaths, and went to Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you feel any of the halfpence that you saw round the die? - No; not till I had been there a great while; there was all the appearance as if the men had been at work, I have not a doubt in my own mind but they were all fresh done.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not see them till they were in the hands of the officers? - No, Sir; not till they were all tied together.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw these men before Monday night? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of all their persons before? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You said you still had some doubt? - I would not chuse to swear positively that they are the men; I have not a doubt in my own breast that they were the men.</p>

               <p>I wish to ask Clark and Prothero whether they did not take some carpenters tools out of my house?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Prothero. No; I am sure there was none in the house, but an old rusty saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. I am an unfortunate man; the things were all my own; these three men are innocent, which I hope they will be able to prove; this man (Acton) keeps a sale shop, an infirm man, not capable nor likely to work; this carpenter I had to work, I was apprehensive that I should be over-heard, the over night I called to Morgan to desire him to come and help me to take down my tools, he took me for a button maker. Acton has two children at nurse at Islington. Corn has made me many things, this man has done me many jobs; they came with no other intention, my lord, but to take down the tools; and with respect to the witness, Mr. Clark, observing that the halfpenny was hot, it is impossible, were I to call on the solicitor of the mint, he knows it is impossible for a halfpenny to retain heat a minute, or a moment; and after the candle was out, there was some time before that candle could be lighted again; as for the halfpenny between the die, it is what I generally leave, nobody ever worked at it but myself and my wife; a touch will cool it.</p>
               <p>Court to Fletcher. Will a halfpenny retain heat for some time? - I know the pressure is so great, that the heat remains some time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. But observe the difference between the halfpence here, and the half-pence at the mint.</p>
               <p>Fletcher. Oh, I know there is a great difference in the weight, as 70 is to 48.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clark. I have no witnesses, I thought it needless; I have been an unfortunate man, and a large family, and have had great losses in business.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner MORGAN.</p>

            . I live in Holborn with my father, a hatter and hosier; on the 13th of November, some women came into the shop, the prisoner was not one; I followed those women, the prisoner at the bar was following them; I heard no conversation between them; just at Staples Inn Gate, they joined, I saw the women put some articles into the prisoner's lap.</p>
               <p>What do mean by articles? - Sundry things; the prisoner was pushing down towards Castle-yard, I stopped her, and asked her what she had got in her apron; she told me, old cloaths; I pushed her cloak aside; the first thing that occured to me, was the silk stockings, and other things she stole from my father's; I brought her back to my father's, the other women made their escape, they were well dressed, she said she had picked them up, it happened to be a rainy, dirty day, and they were not the least soiled; this alamode was in her lap, as was the other property that was found, and delivered to the owners.</p>
               <p>Did you see this alamode put in by the women? - I did not see the alamode in particular, but I saw them put in some articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This was by Staples Inn Gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw the other women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why not secure them? - I had no assistance; I was not quite two yards from them, when they were put into her lap; whether she spoke I could not tell; at the justice's, she said, first she picked them up; and at another examination, not the first, she said, they were given her by those women.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came from Oxford to Watford, and from Watford to Edgware; I was much tired, it was ten minutes after eleven, I asked a man where I could lay down a little while; the man shewed me this gentleman's house, and said I might lay in the stable; I went there with an intention to lay down, I have no witnesses here.</p>

               <p>Court. In strictness of law, if a person breaks and enters a house, with intent to steal, and is prevented from carrying that intention into execution, and nothing is actually stolen, yet, if the jury are clearly satisfied of that intention, such person is guilty of a capital offence. It is necessary there should be an actual breaking, as well as entering of the house; the lifting up the latch of a door, and entering with intention to steal, is sufficient in law to constitute a burglary; if the prisoner got in by an open window, it was not, in point of law, breaking the house, or a burglary. Here is no evidence of the prisoner's breaking the house, and though there was an entry, you ought to acquit him.</p>

               <p>Did you observe him particularly? - I could not discern his face, he was a tallish fellow, with an apron on, in an instant the other door opened, and a man jumped in on my wife's side, and demanded her money, and began to rifle her pockets, he started back and said, damn you, madam, what have you got here, he thought it was a pistol I suppose, she said, only my fan, he opened it and shut it, and gave it her again; I could not distinguish his features, he was in the coach, two without side I could discern; he searched me, and I had my gold in my hand; one said, damn him do him, he held the symeter to my throat, and I let the money fall about the coach, I saw the man that stood without side, put his hand into the coach, and pick up some of the guineas, I swore to him taking my hat, I said, for God's sake don't use us ill, one of them, that was Harford, said damn you, don't use any more bad names, and threatened to blow his brains out that did.</p>

               <p>You mentioned the man's name on a former trial? - I mentioned Harford; the man said it is Mr. Allen and Mrs. Allen of Kingsland, I know them well, I believe he held my wife's hand, and squeezed it, and said Madam don't be frightened, you shall not be hurt, and said so to me; he said what have you lost, I said sixteen guineas; he said tell me ingeniously what you have lost; I said sixteen guineas, and he said to his companion if you don't find sixteen guineas I will do you before night, for I can take the gentleman's word; then they took and searched the front of the coach; those in the coach bid me and my wife get up, and go on the other side, and they searched that side, then we set with our backs to the horses when they went away; one took the hat which fell off, and they told the money; one said, damn you there lays a guinea; I put my foot upon it, as it was in the coach, they came back and pickt it up, it was light enough to see it; one of them bid the other give me the hat, and Hartford brought it back; then one asked for my wife's cardinal; I said no, they should have no cardinal; I asked them to pay the coachman, as they had got all my money; Fowler, that I remember, had a silk handkerchief on his face, let it down, the prisoner Fowler, I did not know his name at that time; he gave somewhat to the coachman; he let his handkerchief drop; I saw his face distinctly after it was as high as his mouth; I took particular notice of my wife looking at them all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face so fully you could swear to him? - Yes; he came round to my side by the horse's head; he took the hanger he had, I remarked it, he stood wantonly and jobbed the hanger into the pannel of the coach; it was black ivory or ebony handle, I remarked it was like an old sword with a black handle; he drove it in the pannel of the coach before it drove away; my wife said Lord what a lovely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090056"/> youth that is, he just resembles our boy we just buried; I said so he does, I saw him very plain, I saw him on the right side; they were ten minutes there; the robbery was done between two and three; our milkman coming he told us he met them, he gave us a sketch where to go; as they came out of the door of a public house, the corner of Grub-street, about ten the same morning, I said that is one of the men; it was the same youth that was like our boy; just then I said there is another; then I said I believe there is two more; the second was Hartford that brought me the hat again; we would not swear to them; I always said I could not discern his face, but a tall fellow stood over me, which I believe to be the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Were you sure, did you swear positively to Fowler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he apprehended then? - Yes; and the hanger was found in his possession; he was in a light coloured coat, one over the other, but he robbed me in a great coat.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, do you know him? - No; I don't know the man, but by the question I asked at Bow-street; I asked which side of the coach they searched first, he told me the front; he acknowledged that he robbed me, and in the same coat he had on. I thought if he could tell me that question right he must be in the coach; he said they searched the front of the coach first; he wavered in some points first, said he did not turn back for the money, but at last he acknowledged some of them did. I never saw his face, I cannot swear to that, I remember his shape and make, every thing but his face; he had an apron on.</p>
               <p>Was the man on your side? - He came in on my side.</p>
               <p>How many did you see in the coach? - There were two in the coach, this on my side, and Harper on my wife's side; by appearance he stood over me in the apron; I always said he was a tall thin fellow; I could not see his face; he blinded the light of the moon.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ALLEN sworn.</p>
               <p>When the coach stopped I saw the hangers; I said there were thieves; my husband started up and said, good God, is there? they demanded my husband's money; he gave them some silver; they said he had got more money; he took it out and held it in his hand; they swore they would do for him; they took hold of his wrist, and he let the money go; they began to scramble for it; another came and jumped in on my side, and put something to my breast like a pistol; I don't think it was a real pistol, but something in imitation of it; they demanded my money; I said I had no money; they found my fan; he started back and said what is this, I said nothing but my fan; they took and opened it, and delivered it back; I had nothing in my pocket but keys and halfpence, they took out the halfpence, and gave me them again; they pulled me off the seat, and searched behind me; they found nothing; they searched my husband at the same time, and the man said, don't be frightened, you shall not be hurt; Mr. Allen said, gentlemen, I hope you will pay the coachman as you have got my money; the man who stood on my side pulled the handkerchief off his face, and said, here, coachman, here is a shilling for you, that was Fowler, he dropt the handkerchief from his mouth and part of his face, and gave the coachman a shilling, and he told the coachman if he spoke a word upon the road he would blow his brains out; I kept looking in his face all the time; he

               <p>How long was it his face was uncovered? - It might be the space of a moment or two.</p>
               <p>Had you a full view of his face? - I had a full view of his face.</p>
               <p>Could you see his features distinctly? - Very.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing to induce you to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090057"/> take more particular notice of him? - Because his features were very much like my child that was buried about two months before that.</p>

               <p>When did you see Fowler the next time? - The next morning when he was taken by the runners; I knew him the moment I saw him come into the office.</p>
               <p>Was he in company with any others? - There were four more.</p>
               <p>Did you pick out Fowler from the rest? - The moment he came into Mr. Wilmot's office, I said this is the man that has the features of my son.</p>
               <p>The resemblance struck you immediately? - Very much, Sir.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, do you recollect any thing of him? - No; I do not particularly.</p>
               <p>You did not take notice of any of the other men but Fowler? - Not particularly I do not; he was close upon my husband.</p>

               <p>You say that Harford was one? - Yes; and he shook hands with me; he lived coachman at Clapton, and knew me well; when he brought my hat again, I saw him for a minute; he behaved very politely; I believe it was through him we were not hurt; he squeezed my wife by the hand, and said, madam, I know you well, you shall not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Did you ask for a guinea? - I only desired them to be kind enough to pay the coachman; I said, gentlemen, I hope you will pay the coachman as you have got all my money; as to the guinea, I asked for no such a thing.</p>

             before the jury brought in their verdict, spoke to the court, and said he was the man that caused Lucas to make the confession, and surrender himself, as he said, he had acknowledged to him, that he (Lucas) Clark and Milburn, and one Underwood were the persons, and those two men, Fowler and Harford were innocent men, and said Clark confessed to him he was the man that Mrs. Allen took to be her son.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Bond was asked if he knew the countenance of Clark.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond said he did not know that it was the same Clark, but there was a Clark in custody some months ago that was shot in the hand with a blunderbuss by a gentleman, whom he attacked near Ball's Pond turnpike; he was wounded in the hand, and has lost the use of one of his fingers.</p>
               <p>Wood said all four of the men had new coats on the day after that robbery, he would declare upon his oath, but they were very poor before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond. I took the confession myself from the mouth of the prisoner, from what he told me at the time; he mentioned that Clark was wounded; I have not a doubt that the Clark he means in that confession is the same Clark who was wounded in the hand, from his telling me he was lame in the hand when I took the confession. Clark and Milburn both are well known at our office.</p>

As I was going down Long lane, to see the execution, I said to Lucas, what do you think of the matter, he seemed to be in a flow of tears, and the brother of Fowler came and hung round him, and said you know my brother is innocent. This, I declare to God, is the matter of fact that brought on the confession; the brother said pray save his life, if possible; he said, I don't care two-pence, I will declare what I know of the matter; I went to the sheriff and asked his opinion, he told me to go to a magistrate; I went to Bow-street, and there they took his confession.</p>

               <p>Court. At six o'clock in the evening, at such a season of the year, it must be after dark, and that is necessary, in point of law, to constitute a burglary. The window was found open, and the blind torn, that was in point of law a breaking; though the things are not carried out of a house, a burglary may be committed, if a person breaks into the house in the night, and commits a felony, or breaks in with intent to commit a felony. If a person is indicted only for a larceny, if the things were proved to have been in a room above stairs, and he takes them from the room they are in, and brings them down stairs, that is a taking that would constitute a larceny; therefore in point of law, their being so removed by the person breaking into the house, would be committing a burglary in the house.</p>

               <p>Did you see him at the time he presented the pistol? - I did, Sir; it was a moonlight night, the moon was rather cloudy, but it was light enough; he was so near, I felt the chop of a cutlass over my shoulder, at the time the pistol cracked; he lodged seven slugs in my back, they were within a yard of me when they fired; I ran then to the turnpike house; I had seen them twice before; here is the coat they shot through, the muzzle of the pistol split the coat here all to pieces. (The coat shewn in Court.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My life is taken away for want of my friends coming to speak for me; I cannot send for my witnesses, because I am confined, I can get nobody to fetch them; I have been in the cells, and I have not a friend to send for them; my landlord knows I was at home in Cow Cross, I spent the afternoon there, and was with my friends till eleven o'clock at night. It is very hard my life must be taken away, because I cannot send for my friends.</p>
               <p>To Ellingham. Did you know the prisoner immediately, as soon as you saw him after he was taken up? - Yes; as soon as I saw him go into the coach at New Prison, when I first saw him after the fact.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December, towards the evening, I was engaged with a customer; the prisoner came into my shop, I had reason to suspect her, and I took notice of her; there were two parcels of handkerchiefs on the bottom of my counter, she wanted some callico wrapper; when I had done my business I was engaged in, I shewed her some, the very first piece I shewed her did, she wanted a quarter of a yard, that was 3 d. she paid me, I then missed one parcel of handkerchiefs, which I have now in my possession; I followed her out of the shop immediately, I overtook her about a yard from my shop, just without the door, I stopped her, I charged her immediately with having my property, she said she had got nothing; I brought her back into the shop, and I felt under her arm; I took these handkerchiefs from under her arm, under her cloak, (produces the handkerchiefs) they are the same I took from her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any shop-mark? - No doubt of it, but these were not marked, being just come in, I am sure these are one of the parcels, she fell on her knees and cried for mercy.</p>

               <p>I suppose he asked you to drink a glass of wine? - I do not recollect he did.</p>
               <p>But you walked peaceably together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>He did not mistake you for another person? - I believe not; he did not behave any thing amiss.</p>
               <p>No rudeness at all? - Only going to salute me.</p>
               <p>That was not very rude you know; and so then, without any other conversation, or any thing particular, all at once he seized this watch from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he know you had a watch there? I found his hand at my side.</p>
               <p>What, tickling of you? - I cried out as soon as he snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Did not you make a stop, and let him go on? - It was just about the time I bid him go about his business.</p>
               <p>There was no rudeness, nor no struggling, nor no kissing before? - No, Sir; only he wanted to salute me.</p>
               <p>These men that stopped him, were they following on or meeting yot? - I do not know; they both live in the Borough, I did not know them then.</p>
               <p>You knew them immediately, did not you? - I did not know them before.</p>
               <p>Was the watch fastened by a new string? - Not very new; an old string,</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was broke? - Not till it was snatched from my side.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a new string or an old one, it is a very material point in this case?</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very old one, and very much worn.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090066"/>Court. You felt the prisoner's hand at your pocket before the time that he snatched the watch? - Just before.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you as if he was endeavouring to take any thing from your pocket, or as if it was a piece of indecent familiarity? - I thought he was going to put his hand in my pocket, to take something.</p>
               <p>What reason had you from his former behaviour or appearance, to suppose that he meant to take something out of your pocket? I thought his hand being in my pocket, he meant to take something out.</p>
               <p>Court. He put his hand round you to kiss you at the same time? - Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>On Sunday evening, about eight, I was coming along Cannon-street, at the corner of Abchurch-lane, I was going on from London stone side, I was going to London bridge, this Mrs. Battell and the prisoner at the bar were standing at the corner, when I came up they were pretty close together.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure of their standing still, were they in conversation, or what? - I had not time to observe; before I got across the street, I saw the prisoner running up the lane, I saw Mrs. Battell feeling at her side, and she cried stop thief, he has stole my watch; I ran directly after him up the lane, and before I came within two yards of him, he threw the watch away with his left hand, I saw him do it, I am sure of it, it was a moon-light night; I immediately secured him, I took hold of his left collar, and another gentleman came up, and secured him at the right collar; I picked-up the watch, it was on the left hand side of the street, I desired the other gentleman to take care of it and of him; about ten minutes the prosecutrix came up, there was a croud round, so that I did not perceive her before; the body of the watch was one way, and the case flew on the flag stones; the prisoner begged not to be used ill, we took him to the Compter; he said he did not take the watch, it might stick to him, he could not help it; I saw him actually throw the watch away; I never saw the prosecutrix before.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I live in the Borough, I am shopman to a haberdasher; I knew her the next day to be the same person that lost the watch, did not know her before; (produces the watch) the watch was not broke.</p>
               <p>Court. The watch has had more falls than one.</p>
               <p>This young woman did not come up for ten minutes, it is not ten minutes walk, is it? - Just as people can walk.</p>
               <p>You may be a very pert servant, but you are a very bad witness, be a little decent; I do you mean to say she was ten minutes before she came up? - She had her pattens on, I do not know the other witness, I perceived no struggling between them, they were talking.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher at Dockhead, I never saw the prosecutrix nor the last witness before; I was coming along Cannon-street, opposite Abchurch-lane, I saw the prisoner come round her, breast to breast, I thought he wanted to salute her; when I first observed them, they were on the turn, near the corner, I was on the other side, he was some length of time about what I thought he was doing; I saw his body agitated greatly, and move several times, that made me take particular notice of him; I made a full stop, and looked at them, I thought they seemed to be rather familiar, I observed a twisting of their bodies; I suppose they might remain so a minute, I did not hear a word said by either of them; he quitted her, and ran up Abchurch-lane, I observed her then put her hand to her right side, and she said stop thief, I have lost my watch; I ran after him, and caught him more than half way up; just as I was going to lay hold of him I saw the watch falling, it seemed as if it came from his left side, and to be thrown rather than to fall, I did not take any particular motion of his hand, I was too nigh for that; I did not see Roberts pick up the watch, I held the prisoner the while, I think he said he did not rob her; Mrs. Battell came up just as the watch was picked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178201090067"/>Jury. How came it, as the prisoner is a pretty stout man, that you ran faster than him, did any thing impede him in his running? - I do not know, I ran faster than him, and I can run faster than you, he had a great coat on, perhaps that might impede him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Suppose this watch stuck to any part of him, he moved his arms you know when he run, a man does not run with his arms in his pocket, therefore it might have gone off in an a slant direction; you do not mean to say that you saw him throw it? - No, sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Whether it was brushed off by his cloaths, or stuck to his arm, it would have followed that direction? - It might so.</p>
               <p>It must you know? -</p>
               <p>Court. You said that from what you saw, when you first saw them together; the idea that you formed at that time, was, that they were familiar together? - I thought so, then, but as soon as he left her, I gave up my former suspicion immediately, then I thought what it was.</p>
               <p>Jury. The bruises on the inside and outside cases answer?</p>
               <p>Court. Nearly; one does, and another does not; that would be very likely to happen when the case fell off.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Battle called, proves the watch, is positive it is her's; it has been in her father's family almost a hundred years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am innocent of the affair, I leave it entirely to my counsel.</p>

The money has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>( Allen looks at a guinea in the purse, it was handed to the Court.) It fell in the ashes of the stove, and there is in the back of the head some of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. You have acknowledged at the last sessions, that you was the same Robert Hill, who was convicted of stealing goods in a dwelling house, and received sentence of death; what have you to say now, why execution should not be awarded against you, upon that sentence.</p>
               <p>Robert Hill then stated to the court, the defence made for him by council, last sessions, when he was called up to shew cause, &amp;c. (See page 19 and 20, of Numb. I. Part I. of the former Sessions Paper) and added, because he had refused to go on board the African ship, the captain ordered him out of the cabbin, and another person, and said, we wanted to scuttle the ship, and I don't know what they mean by that; they had a shim sham court marshal, we were tied up, and I received 175 lashes, after the order came down to remove me from his ship; then we were put on shore at the White house at Portsmouth, and we were sixteen weeks there, without so much as a bit of bread or drop of water to subsist on, we could not get water without paying a penny for it, necessity made us get away, and we did it without force, we got over the wall.</p>
               <p>Court. A great part of what you have stated is true, I know an order was sent from the secretary of state, which I obtained, for removing you from that ship which you had illegally been put on board of, the condition of your pardon being to go to the East Indies; with respect to the escape from prison, what you have urged in vindication of that, rather goes as a matter to obtain compassion from your sovereign, than any justification in the court; the court orders that you remain a respite during his Majesty's pleasure.</p>
