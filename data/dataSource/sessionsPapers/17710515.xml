Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150003"/> Brownsword and I went up stairs together; there was a green cloth, like a wrapper, upon the ground, and a double breasted coat, two waistcoats, a petticoat, and a red cloth cloak, they were all put together upon the ground in Mrs. Brownsword's chamber.</p>
               <p>- Brownsword. I was alarmed by the cracking of the cieling over head, and I thought I heard feet in my room; I had been in the room and double locked the door about an hour before, and had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the green cloth and those things you found on the floor, lie there when you was in the room before?</p>
               <p>Brownsword. No; the green cloth was at the bottom of a drawer in the chest of drawers; when I had got up about three stairs I saw West coming down, he had lodged with me formerly; I asked him how he dare come into my room; he said, Bl - t your eyes, I don't care for your room. I endeavoured to secure him; I scuffled some time with him; he threw me down, and got from me; I turned about and saw the prisoner and Mr. Fisher down; he got up and left the handkerchief in Mr. Fisher's hands; I caught him in my arms; the rings were taken out of a little drawer in a chest of drawers. Fisher was in the passage, and the prisoner out of it. Fisher was drawing him up the step. I held him, and cried out, Murder! Mrs. Lester came down and helped us to secure him; he was never out of my hands; he had one shoe and stocking on; and a piece was tore off his cape; he struck me and beat me down to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lock broke?</p>
               <p>Brownsword. No; it was unlocked or picked; we searched him, and found this key, two pieces of wire, and some pieces of candle. ( producing them.)</p>

            . I live in Parliament-Court, Artillery-Lane, Bishopsgate-street; on the twenty-fourth of April, about twelve o'clock in the evening, as I was coming home, between Webb's Square and a bun house, called Union Row House, in Shoreditch, I saw a man and woman standing at the end of Webb Square as I passed by it; I went on a little further; I thought I heard somebody behind me; I turned back and saw five people; I turned my head again, and walked on; a man came up to my right side, and put his other hand over my eyes, he told me if I made a noise he would blow my brains out; he lifted his hand a little off my eyes, and I saw a man at my left side with a pistol, I believe; I felt something under my car which I believed to be a pistol; he then closed his hand fast to my eyes again; so that I could not see; then somebody came behind me and pinioned my arms; and then another came and rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep the pistol at your head all the time?</p>
               <p>Garrat. I could not tell, as they nded my eyes; they took to the value of six guineas in cash, my watch and ring, and they took my pocket book from me which had in it a note of 5 l. and another of 50 l. I begged for it again; I bade them go under a lamp and they would see there was nothing in it of value; they gave it to me again; one of them came up to me and brought my cane back;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150004"/> while he gave it me he held his head back that I might not see him; they tell me that he has cut his hair off since, if so, it is Suttle: but he used me very well for a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all men you saw behind you, when you turned your head?</p>
               <p>Garrat. There was but one tall as I observed then; the person that first came up with the pistol seemed to have dark hair, but his hand was upon my eyes immediately. I I never got any of the things again; the evidence says my things were sold to one Lyons a Jew, who is gone off.</p>

            . When I came to Mr. Shaw's I found Mrs. Shaw behind the compter, the prisoner was treating with her about some goods. I am a surgeon, I went to let Mrs. Shaw bleed. I sat down a little while in the parlour, by and by I got up and went into the shop. I found she had not bought any thing, but was be speaking a cloak; in looking by the side of her red cloak, I saw something with lace upon it. Mr. Shaw came in, after speaking to him, he went round the compter to his wife. I gave him a hint of what I saw; he went to his wife again, she was going. I went round another compter, and took hold of it, and said, what is this? She said a rag, or a piece of her gown. I gave it a pull, and it came out. I said, is this a rag; she seemed immediately struck with a conviction of her crime, and then Mr. Shaw went for a constable. Whilst he was gone, Mrs. Shaw was exceedingly faint and hurried, and went into the parlour. The prisoner went into the room to her, and begged her to let her go before her husband came, and offered to go down upon her knees: after that I heard the prisoner say, here was another cloak; (that was after we would not let her go) she produced the other cloak. I was in the shop I did not see it, but I heard her. (The cloak produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Viator. Tuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon; he has two rooms, his bed is on the back room, I went into the back room, he locked the door of the fore room and put the key in his pocket; then he came into the back room and threw me by force on the bed, and he lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Viator. Nothing at all, he put his hand upon my mouth and stopped my crying. I could not speak, he offered me a gown, a silk cloak, and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Viator. As he lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he lay with you?</p>
               <p>Viator. He came into my body of a sudden, and hurt me very sadly, and I was wet; he lay with me a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at home?</p>
               <p>Viator. Nobody, but my mistress and Lucy Jones, and the other apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell it to them?</p>
               <p>Viator. I told the maid first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told your mistress of it?</p>
               <p>Viator. She did first on the same night. My mistress said dont you tell your father, for if you do, he will ruin me and kill you. She repeated it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found yourself disordered?</p>
               <p>Viator. Yes; I have the foul disease.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever know a man before?</p>
               <p>Viator. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you why you did not tell your father before this?</p>
               <p>Viator. Because my mistress made me so frightened. I complained to the maid and my mistress the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day light then?</p>
               <p>Wright. It was not broad day, it was light. I met two, Cleghorn and another, between the Fleece and Mr. Currie's house; they were going through George-yard, which leads into Bow-lane; they went into Bow-lane, and there parted; one went down Bow-lane, the other into Bow-church-yard. Cleghorn went into Bow-church-yard; I pursued him into Cheapside; he had a bundle flung across his shoulder, which made me suspect he had it. I took him when he had got about forty yards in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the bundle then?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; I asked him how he came by the bundle; he said very honestly. I said from where; he said Ironmonger-lane: I said I am not certain, but I believe you came out of a house in Queen-street. I took him to the watch-house; coming through George-yard, he broke away from me; I pursued him thro' Cheapside, and Honey-lane-market, and into Milk-street, and took him in Mumford court. I said I had a brother watchman joined me in Cheapside. When I took him the first time, he threw the bundle down in George-yard, when he broke away from me. I gave him in charge of a constable. I searched his right side coat pocket, and took out two large spoons and a candlestick, and two clasp knives.</p>

            . I watch'd in Bow-church-yard; as the prisoner came by me my brother watchman desired me to follow him; we overtook him and brought him back; he had a bundle in a check apron; when we brought him back to George-yard he threw the bundle down and ran from us both; my brother watchman left me with the bundle and pursued him; I left it in charge of one Heath, a watchman, whilst I joined him in the pursuit; when we brought the prisoner back, the bundle was at the watch-house.</p>

I know him, and knew the other prisoner was sometimes with him. I went and found Aldrich in Cow Cross. I took him to the gentleman's house; I searched him, and in his pocket was this silver spoon, and three keys, and he had a hat belonging to one of the gentlemen, which he had on his head.

               <p>Mr. Currie. There was a defect in the curves in the windows; there are two planks come out and make part of the footway. I never knew till after the robbery that these planks were not fastened. I thought they had gone into a grove or something, so that they could not have been slid on the outside; but when I came to examine them the day after I was robbed, I found it was possible to slide them out of their places so as to get down.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was there not a fastening they call an iron dog?</p>
               <p>Mr. Currie. No; it appeared to be quite solid, but it was not.</p>
               <p>- Heath. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember coming up to assist when Cleghorn was taken?</p>
               <p>Heath. Yes; I took the bundle to the watch-house, and gave it to Mr. Foster. (The bundle produced, containing two great coats, thirteen pair of shoes, one shirt, one neckcloth, two silk handkerchiefs, one white apron, three coarse aprons, a jack towel, three check aprons, and a red and white handkerchief.)</p>
               <p>(The above goods were deposed to by the different owners, as mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>- Davis. There is all the plate that has been produced, but the spoons in this bundle that has now been opened. There was a toothpick in his pocket.</p>

I dress'd myself, and went down stairs, When we came out in the court we met with a girl that he knew; he and she walked arm in arm, he turned down Lawrence lane; I bid her good morning. Afterwards he cross'd the way, and went down Queen street; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150013"/> bid me stand at the corner. In a few minutes he brought a handkerchief full of some silver things; he bid me put them in my pocket. I asked him how he came by them; he said, What, d - n me, do you want me to be taken up. He put some in my coat and some in my waistcoat pockets; then he gave me a bundle that lay at a passage door. I followed him. He bid me go Cheapside way, and said he would meet me at St. Paul's. I went up Cheapside, and was taken by a watchman; then I thought the things were stolen, so I threw them down, and ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any marks of violence in the shop?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. No, none at all. I missed some long lawns, some Scotch lawns, and printed handkerchiefs. The next day I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150014"/> kitchen, I saw the outside window shutter had been forced, the bolt was broke off, the sash could then be lifted up; the kitchen was bolted on the outside: there was a window that had a glass casement that was broke, so that I supposed somebody got through that hole into a back place, where I keep coals; then they got into the house, and unbolted the kitchen door, which was bolted on the outside. I know nothing of the prisoners. I went to Sir

               <p>Q. Was there room enough to admit a man through it?</p>

             and myself, and Bailiss, were drinking at the Shepherd and Goat, at Fleet Ditch, between twelve and one o'clock; we went from there to the Coach and Horses, outside Temple Bar, there we sat and drank four or five half pints of rum; we went from there about half after two, towards Leicester Fields; then we went down a street, at the bottom of it Ibbert bid me stop, opposite the watchman's box, accordingly I sat down just opposite the watchman's box, and went to sleep; Ibbert ran to me, and asked me what I was about; I asked him where Bailiss was; Bailiss, said he, why you are in a trance; mind what you are about, says he, and if the watchman comes, whistle: he went away, and I sat down and went to sleep again: in about half an hour the watchman came up, I seeing him ran home directly, and went to bed; I waked about eight in the morning, and found the goods upon a chest, I had left the door open. I put them into the chest, and locked it. I spoke to Murphy, and told him I should be obliged to him to find any body to buy the goods; he asked me, if they were stolen; I did not tell him whether they were or not; I said he need not be afraid, nothing should hurt him; he said he knew one or two which could buy them of me. I appointed to meet him at the Swan in Salisbury Court; accordingly he brought a Jew and another man there, and went up with Bailiss to look at the things, Bailiss came along with the Jew; they went to my lodgings, at a court in Fleet-street, the Hole in the Wall Court; I was drinking at the Swan door at the same time. Mr. Phillips and some other constables came in. Ibbert said, we had better go off; I am afraid there is something the matter.</p>

No; I met him at the Shepherd and Goat next day; he was at the Swan with me several times; Ibbert staid at the Swan with me, he came in about half an hour after I was there; he and I went off, when he said he was afraid something was the matter; we went opposite the court where my lodgings were; we staid there, and saw the constable go up and bring down Bailiss and Murphy; we followed the constable to Sir John Fielding's as we were coming back again we met the constables; they took Ibberts, and I made off; next morning Phillips took hold of me, and carried me before Sir

               <p>Jameson. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk both times?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150015"/>Jameson. I was fully committed, not an evidence then; I was made an evidence afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you say this to account for not telling the same story now that you did then?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I do not know what I said then.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had Bailiss and Ibbert to see the linen; what had they to do with them?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To see if they could get somebody to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they to do with them; how came the linens in your room?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I do not know, I was asleep; I am apt to think Bailiss and Ibbert brought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your reasons for thinking so?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Because we were all out together.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>Jameson. With an intent to break open a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement what was to be done with the goods if you got any thing; where were they to be brought?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Murphey was not with you at this time?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They were brought to your lodging then?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time the next morning did you see Murphey?</p>
               <p>Jameson. About ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either Ibbert or Bailiss before you saw him?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes; about half an hour after nine I saw Ibbert.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Ibbert's business?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To see and get the goods off; he asked me if I could tell who would buy them; I said I would speak to Murphey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time you had been concerned?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No, once before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who was to buy the goods?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Murphey?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Next day, at a slop-shop in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask Ibbert how they got at them?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I asked what they had got: they said a quantity of linen; I told him I did not untie them, but put them in the chest just as they were brought; he asked me to get somebody to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where or how he got them?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I had not time then; Ibbert fell a swearing at me for running away and leaving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the money they were to be sold for?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Ibbert and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you two to divide all the money?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody else to have any share in it?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not Bailiss?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; he said Bailiss had nothing to do with the robbery; and if it lay in his power he would not allow him a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Bailiss.</p>
               <p>Jameson. About twelve o'clock at the Swan.</p>
               <p>Q. Not see him; you mean till he, Murphy, and the Jew came there.</p>
               <p>Jameson. I saw him at the Swan before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and Bailiss then?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Nothing about the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him you had seen Murphey?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; he had a person with him; he gave me the wink to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you all met at the Swan you say the Jew and Murphy went to see the linen?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bailiss to go?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I desired him to see me done justice to. They were taken up and carried to Sir

I went directly to Mr. Wood, and told him I had met these fellows with three large bundles upon their head. It was at Breams-buildings, Chancery-lane, that I met them. I told Wood of it, and told him I believed it was Bailiss. I bid him go to his house; he said he did know where he lived. I met Ibbert again in the afternoon. I said, Charles, how do you do? have you sold the goods? he said, Will you buy them? I said, How much will it come to? do you think twenty pounds? he said he did not know, he would speak to the rest of the company. I mentioned Jameson and Murphy.</p>

I asked them to shew me the way: Murphy and Bailiss went with me, I bid a porter watch to see what house I went into, and then send to Phillips, Wood, and the rest, to take them.

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the Swan on Sunday, they were sitting at different tables, Bailiss and Ibberts?</p>
               <p>Aaron. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they join company at supper?</p>
               <p>Aaron. They supped separate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Bailiss come to you to talk about these goods?</p>
               <p>Aaron. Never at all about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other speak about the goods?</p>
               <p>Aaron. Charles did. I asked if there was any plate; he mentioned several things, two table spoons, six tea-spoons, a pair of tea-tongs, a silver waiter, a silver salt, a silver milk-pot, and a pair of salts. I asked what was become of them; he said he did not know whether they were sold or no. I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you lose such plate?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes; the very plate he has mentioned:</p>

He came in about a quarter of an hour, and said he had found out the place; it was at the Hole in the Wall Court. I went up into the house as softly as I could; I went up into the room, and knocked at the door. As soon as I came in, I saw

He bid me shew them the money but not let them have any of it. I went with the Jew to the Sam in Salisbury court; there he brought for Bailiss and Murphy; I staid in the street for them; we walked up Fleet street, till we came to the Hole in the Wall; there we lost them; presently Murphy beckoned us into a court; we went up stairs; there Murphy unlocked a large box, and turned out three bundles of linen, the box was behind the door on the right hand, there was flowered cotton handkerchiefs, &amp;c. they took two bundles from under the bed; there were two large pieces of linen; the Jew said he did not know what they were, but they would lump them; I cast them up, they came to thirty-one guineas; Bailiss said he thought they would come to a great deal more. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out some money, and then a bank note, and put it in my pocket again; I said I could go and get more money, if one or two hundred pounds, I could get it. I said we would not do business there, but would go and have some punch; we were going, then these people came up and took them.</p>

            . I saw Bailiss in the morning at the picture shop in Fleet-street. I did not offer to meddle with him, we spoke to each other. I was much surprized to see him in the room, as I never heard any thing amiss of him; he and Murphy both stood up against the side of the chimney. I asked what cloth they had there. Upon the bed I found this pistol (producing it) in a handkerchief, and a gold laced hat with it. I was informed the lodgings belonged to Murphy and Ibberts.</p>
               <p>Bailiss's Defence.</p>
               <p>Upon Monday the twenty second of April I think, I went to Westminster-hall, in order to attend a trial for my master Mr. How, to oppose the discharge of one Web a prisoner in Newgate, who was about to receive the benefit of the insolvent act; my lord Mayor was brought up that day in order to be admitted to bail, which occasioned me to stay there till about four in the afternoon, after that I came away with the plantiff in the action to Salisbury Court. I said to him I wish you would call upon Mr. How, and tell him I was obliged to stay so long. I went to the Swan to dinner, there I met Murphy, whom I knew when in his clerkship; he asked me to go to his lodgings to see the delivery of some goods, which he said were run goods. I went up into the room, the Jew was standing there, he said where are these goods, Murphy said here they are. I thought it proper to bring a friend with me to see the delivery<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150018"/> of them; they began to talk about the price, they asked me my opinion, I said these goods are worth a great deal more if they are honestly come by. I had not been there long before up came the constables. Mr. Wood said to me how came you here. I told him the story. I never was there before. I have had the best of education. I have been bred up to the law. I have been in London about five years. I have always been in place, and kept the best of company, and avoided bad, as far as lay in my power. I have several gentlemen in court to prove it. I hope the court will consider it where my life is at stake. I am as innocent of the fact as any person can be.</p>

I made this report to Mr. Carter; he ordered me to detain the prisoner; at night he returned. I kept him later than usual; he went away about nine. I sent Price for him; he hesitated to return, but did come. I asked him what he had in his pockets; he said, nothing: I bid him empty them. He took out several indifferent things, and turned out one pocket that had nothing in it: I bid him turn out the other; he kept his hand in it five minutes; I believe at last he took out these brushes (producing them.) I asked him how he came by them in his pocket; he said he did not know. Then I asked him if he had nothing else; then he pulled out some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150020"/> polishings (producing them ) these rags have the polishings in them: we burn the rags, and the silver is tried and valued: the apprentices take it up every Saturday night, and lock it up; it fetches about fifteen shillings a pound.

            . * My master often cautioned me to watch the prisoner. The clerk made a hole in the wainscot; when all the men were gone, but the prisoner, I saw him come to the window and look out; then he went up to the polishing box. I could not perceive what he did; he fumbled there; then he went to the place where he generally sits, and put his hand into his pocket; then he came back again and went up to the other box, which I saw his hand in. I thought I saw it through his fingers as he went along; then he went to the same place were he used to sit, and put his hand in his pocket.</p>

            . I live in King street, Bloomsbury. I am a washer; we melt polishings and cleanse silver out of the dust, for gold and silversmiths. I have bought of the prisoner aprons and fronts of coats and waistcoats, which is their perquisites. I was once between a master and his man, and valued his apron and waistcoat, which the master paid him for.</p>
               <p>Q. What price do you give?</p>
               <p>Tabois. It is all an uncertainty, according as we thought it might be filled with silver, three, four or five shillings. I never bought any polishing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What may that be worth that is produced?</p>
               <p>Tabois. Nobody can tell till it is melted.</p>

            . I received two bank notes, the numbers were of one 144, the other 217; I did not look much at them; they were 20 l. each. I wanted to get some gold to send into America. On the 30th of April, I took them out of my chest, and went to Mr. Drummond's to change them; they refused to change them. I offered to change them at the Crown in Bow-street. When I came near the Admiralty coffee-house, I met two soldiers; they said, Mr. Moreton, how do you do? said I, Do you know me? they said, Yes. They asked me to give them a pint; they took me down a long alley to a publick house. I stood against the table, and they stood by me; I put my hand in my pocket, and said, I have been robbed since I met you; they said, No sure Mr. Moreton, you can't be robbed, they said they would not take them away; they felt my pockets, then they bid me examine and search. I put my hands in my pocket again, and said, sure enough here are my bank notes; I put my hand in my pocket and felt them. I said, I am so glad I have got my notes again, I will give you half a gallon of beer for joy; a young man in the house wrapped them up in paper; and I put them in my right hand pocket. I paid for the beer, and we went up into the street; as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150023"/> as I had got into the street, Kenney kept pretty close to me, at my right hand; there were five or six girls at the door; this all happened in half an hour; when I got into the passage I felt something kit against my thigh; I catched Kenney's hand in my pocket; I said you have got my notes again; I felt for the notes, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you caught his hand in your pocket, whereabouts was Hawkins?</p>
               <p>Moreton. Not far off; a little at my left hand; there were several girls at his right hand. I charged them with it; they denied it; I was a good deal confused; I leaned against the wall, and they went away. I went down again to the same house, and said, They have robbed me of my notes again. They sent out after them, and caught them again. I received the notes from Mr. Lassater; they were brought back again in a few minutes; they offered to be searched; when they got to the top of the entry I walked behind; one of the girls knocked my hat off, and another struck me in the face; then they ran away, and I saw no more of them till they were taken; they acknowledged before the justice that they had changed the notes. I think Hawkins said, he got them of his father; Kenney said he found them in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was confused; was it with your loss or with liquor?</p>
               <p>Moreton. With my loss; it was all the money I had.</p>

I took it out of his hand and went to Mr. Cox, the brewer, to ask him if it was a good one; I told Kenney if he came in the morning I would change it; he came in the morning; I went up to Mr. Cox's and told him it came from a soldier. (The note produced.)</p>

            . I saw Mr. Moreton and the prisoners at Derry's; they came in and called for some beer; Mrs. Derry said, Let no beer be drawn for them: I said, There is a creditable man with them. Then they called for a pot, and had it. Moreton put his hand in his pocket to pay for some beer; then he said, I am robbed of forty pounds; I said, It is impossible to be robbed in this house. I asked him if he knew the prisoners; he said he knew a little of them. He said he had two twe nty pound notes. He searched his pockets and pulled out some paper. He did not pull them out then. I said, You had better look further. One of the prisoners said, Look in that pocket, perhaps you have not searched far enough; upon that he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out the two twenty pound notes. I looked at them, and said, I think you wrap them up in a careless manner. I took down a paper, and put the notes in it; he put them in his right hand waistcoat pocket. Then they had another pot of beer. They staid about twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>- Bond. I took them at Richmond. Hawkins was very quiet; Kenney very obstinate. I found eleven guineas and a half, and a six and nine-pence on one; and upon the other I found six guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them how they came by that money they had?</p>
               <p>Bond. They were very much in liquor. Hawkins said he had the money of his father. I gave them back a guinea each, by order of the magistrate.</p>

Before she came in, the prisoner at the bar rushed in; he moved his hat, and a black crape fell from under it over his face; he took a sword and pistol in his hand, and said, This is the suit of lace; you bitch, your money; I said, My money! he said, Give me your purse, or else you are a dead woman. I put my hand in my pocket for my purse: he held the pistol near my face: he said, D - n your blood, don't trifle; I am a gentleman in disress; I want two hundred pounds. I told him I had no more money in the house: then he bid me pull off my coat, and turn my pockets out; and he put in his hands to rifle them: he found no more money.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Chancellor. I am her journeywoman. On the eighth of April, at about eight o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Chancellor and her little grand-daughter were sitting together in the parlour: there was a single knock at the door: I went: the prisoner was at the door. I opened it: the prisoner asked if Mrs. Chancellor was at home; I said, I did not know but I would go and see: he said he had got a suit of lace to shew Mrs. Chancellor, just come from abroad. I told him to stop a bit at the door, before I could get into the parlour to deliver the message, he got past me into the room: he went as far as the table where Mrs. Chancellor was sitting; then he lifted up his hat, and a black silk, or crape fell down over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not any silk or crape over his face when you let him in, or when he came into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No; he presented a pistol and sword to Mrs. Chancellor, and said, This is the suit of lace, you bitch; 'tis your money I want: he said he was a gentleman in distress, and wanted two hundred pounds, and would have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress give him any money?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Yes; she gave him her purse: he d - d the purse, and said, That will not do for me; I am a gentleman in distress, and want two hundred pounds: the child cried; he held a pistol to her, and called her little squeaking bitch, and said if she did not hold her tongue he would blow her brains out. he ordered Mrs. Chancellor to go up stairs directly, and then he took up the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Your conversation at the door was very short, I believe.</p>
               <p>Hampton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other conversation than what you mentioned?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No.</p>
               <p>Q. By what light did you see him?</p>
               <p>Hampton. The lamp which is over the door: as soon as he got to the table, he let down the black over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. About half a minute?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Longer than half a minute, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Your expression was, he rushed?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He came that minute into the parlour, and pushed the door to.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no-opportunity of seeing his face I suppose, but what you saw at the door?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Yes; in the parlour; I just got into the parlour first; I saw his face before he got up to the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe any part of his dress?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He had a lightish brown great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. A plain, or laced hat?</p>
               <p>Hampton. Not laced that I know of; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of his being the person?</p>

I pursued him; he ran down Gravel-lane, as hard as he could, and several people after him; a man came out of the Black Moor's Head, when the prisoner was spent with running, and he was taken. I was present; he had this knife in his hand (produced a clasp knife) we carried him to the Poultry Compter, and there searched him we found this pocket pistol loaded with two slugs, and this watch we found in his breeches pocket ( producing them.)

I went to bed myself; I always go to bed at ten o'clock. When he found I went to bed, Macdonald went up himself, and brought his friend down to breakfast with my wife; they ordered a neck of mutton to be made into broth for dinner. I got up some time before dinner, and dined; the farmer complained again of his head, and begged to go to bed again till his head was better; he asked, whether it was one or two pair of stairs; my wife said to the girl, Go up, and shew the gentleman where he lay last night; she went up and put the bed to rights; she came down, and left him there; Macdonald was up and down very often with him; in that time they picked my door and my bureau, and took the money away; that was the fifteenth; I did not miss it till the day following; there was about 200 l. I can't swear to the exact sum; the bureau was in my bed chamber; I found the door and bureau locked as I left it; so it must have been picked and locked again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your money the day they came there?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I saw it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any body lodged in your house at the time?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, only my wife, a servant and child. I went to Sir

               <p>Court to the Prisoner. You was tried last assize there I believe?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Hughes. When I came to him I said, Have you any money? he said, No, I have not a farthing. I said, What have you spent my two hundred pounds? he said, There was not quite two hundred of it. He said, Go over to the jailor, and I will satisfy you in every thing in writing; I went over; in the interim there were some friends came to him, and advised him to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell with certainty how long it was after the supposed robbery that you found yourself to be robbed?</p>
               <p>Hughes. The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some company dined with you on the 16th?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No; I miss'd it in the forenoon before dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did you see this money?</p>
               <p>Hughes. The 14th, I suppose; I opened my bureau every day; I saw it every day.</p>

               <p>Hughes. Because I did not see it: I go up to that bureau sometimes eight or ten times a day for change.</p>

               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hughes. For a twenty-seven shilling piece.</p>

            . I live in Brownlow-street, in the same house with the prisoner; I lodged with Adley; the person lodged with Mackmannon; the house was between two people; but there was only one stair case in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suspect the prisoner at the bar of doing any thing improper?</p>
               <p>Berry. From something I had heard pass between him and his wife, I suspected they coined money; I told my suspicion to my landlord: they seemed jealous, and used to slop the key hole of the door; so I made a hole in the partition in order to watch them. On Friday, the twelfth of April, I got up at six o'clock; I heard the prisoner and his wife at work before I got up; when she went down stairs I made a hole in the wall; I saw the prisoner with his cloaths open to his shirt, and a night cap on, walking about the room; I saw the new coin on a mould that lay open; the mould was near the middle of the room; soon after he took the coin up and turned it round; there were several pieces of coin joined together; I saw holes through it; he went with it towards the fire, and then he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. What coin was it?</p>
               <p>Berry. Silver coin.</p>
               <p>Q. What size?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150030"/>Berry. A shilling every one of them; there were a number of them fast together. (the mould produced for coining seven shillings and eight sixpences.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a mould of this sort?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged at this place?</p>
               <p>Berry. From the beginning of this quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in?</p>
               <p>Berry. I have a child, and I take in a little washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes, and have been these three years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue to look through this hole?</p>
               <p>Berry. About a quarter of an hour; he did not take the money out of the mould directly; but walked about some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which room is towards the street, yours or his?</p>
               <p>Berry. Mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How high from the floor is the hole you made?</p>
               <p>Berry. About two yards; I stood upon a chair to see through it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you stand, upright or stooping?</p>
               <p>Berry. As upright as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call that two yards from the floor?</p>
               <p>Berry. I did not measure the place; it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the hole?</p>
               <p>Berry. Just big enough to put my finger in.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were very jealous, and used to stop the key hole of the door; what time did you make the hole?</p>
               <p>Berry. About two o'clock; when she went down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they work in a different room from where they lived?</p>
               <p>Berry. They have a room on the first floor, and a bed room on the second floor; it was the bed room I saw him in.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at home on Friday night?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And had a candle?</p>
               <p>Berry. I did not look into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Berry. I usually go to bed at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Berry. No.</p>
               <p>Council. The reason of my asking the question is, they would see the light.</p>
               <p>Berry. I stopped the hole when I made it.</p>
               <p>Q. How thick is this wall?</p>
               <p>Berry. It is only lath and plaister.</p>
               <p>Q. A double lath and plaister?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, a single one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is not a double lath and plaister?</p>
               <p>Berry. The place that I made the hole through was single.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you make the whole with?</p>
               <p>Berry. A narrow pointed knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell how many inches the knife went in when you made the hole?</p>
               <p>Berry. Not any inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Penknife?</p>
               <p>Berry. No; a case knife pointed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can give us no notion of the thickness of the wall?</p>
               <p>Berry. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this coin you saw, all of the same size?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes; as near as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be shillings or six-pences for what you know?</p>
               <p>Berry. I am sure they were shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention this hole to any body?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes; to my landlord,

               <p>Berry. They went down stairs to breakfast directly after he had carried the coin to the fire; when she came up again, I went to tell Adley; he did not come up again, she came up about eight o'clock. I looked through the hole again, and saw her a going to make a pair of moulds.</p>

             came down to me when I was at breakfast. I went up with her; I stood up in a chair in her room, and put up my head close to the wall and peeped through a smallish hole.</p>
               <p>Q. How large?</p>
               <p>Adley. About the size of a small finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this hole command the room so that you could see any thing in it?</p>
               <p>Adley. I could see only right forward, facing the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that mould, did you ever see it before?</p>
               <p>Adley. What I saw was partly about the size of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else about the room?</p>
               <p>Adley. Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you came into the room by request of Berry; had she had any talk with you before about the coining?</p>
               <p>Adley. Not particular before that day; we had suspicion; the prisoner's wife said she made rich cordials, and in pouring it out she scalded her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your room?</p>
               <p>Adley. My bed chamber is over theirs.</p>

               <p>Q. What o'clock was it when you went up stairs with Berry?</p>
               <p>Adley. About nine o'clock.</p>

            . On Monday the 15th of April, I received a letter from Mr. Chamberlavne, the woman waited whilst I read it; Sir John made out a warrant against Vaughan and his wife; I got an officer. I went with him directly along with the woman; when we came to the corner of Brownlow street, Mrs. Berry said, that they were blowing when she came out, she told us she would go up stairs first; and if they were blowing she would come down and let us know; she came down and said they were blowing. I went up stairs, and I listened in the passage. I heard a blowing; Mrs. Berry had told me that they kept the door locked. I went all of a sudden to the other side of the passage, and bursted the door open. The prisoner's wife was blowing the fire; she turned round from the fire and made a prodigious outcry. I put her into the hands of the constable and went forward to the fire; there was this crucible in the fire red hot ( producing it) with metal in it; the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see when you went in?</p>
               <p>Bond. I saw that mould lying on the floor, between the bed and the fire place, the screws were edge-ways, the mould lay ready for the metal to be poured into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you?</p>
               <p>Bond. Yes; Halliburton and my brother. I called in Berry before I left the room.</p>

               <p>Berry. I saw a mould like that.</p>

            . I took the prisoner at a public house. I went with Mr. Bond; we found that mould in the room by the bed side; the counterfeit money (producing it) was found in a basket and in a little box by the bed side. The prisoner is a porter and plies at Gray's Inn Gate. I took him in Holborn, at the corner of Gray's Inn Gate. I told him I wanted to go to his house; he said, what can you want at my house? I asked him where he lived; he told me some place, I forgot where; but it was not the place where he lived. Clark said, I have got an information that you are a smuggler, and we want to search your house for smuggled goods; then said he, if that is the case, I will go along with you, and shew you every part of the house; he took us to the one pair of stairs room; he did not know at that time that his wife was taken. I searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150032"/> his pocket and found three six-pences, that appeared to be bad; and there was a sort of receipt in his pocket, for making money. I asked him if he had any other apartments in the house belonging to him; he said no, that was his only apartment. I said that was not true, and desired him to go and shew us the other place; we had the key; he then went up stairs, his wife and the things were taken away before he came to the house. One of us opened the door; we searched again but f ound nothing more.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Halliburton to apprehend the prisoner; we found him at the Elephant and Castle in Holborn; he said he lived a mile from that place: I told him at last, we had an information of smuggled goods; then he took us very readily to his apartments in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you his own apartments?</p>
               <p>Clark. I went up into his one pair of stairs room, and there searched him. I found this receipt upon him, in his pocket-book, in his left-hand pocket (producing it) It is read, giving directions how to cast money. We found these three sixpences in his pocket. I was not in the room when he was first searched.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, when he talked about smuggled goods, he went very willingly?</p>

               <p>Q. But you know a search is a search; when you search'd for smuggled goods, you would find what was there - Can you tell us whether that mould has been used since the impressions were made?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it has not; that blackness is occasioned by being smoaked, which hides the impression till the metal is run in, and then it brings the black upon the coin. They smoke it in order to preserve the impression.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a moneyer in the mint?</p>

               <p>I will relate all I know about the matter: some time between Christmas and Candlemas last, I met one Bachanan in Red Lyon-square. I had not seen him some time before. He had these moulds with him; he said, I am going into the city; I wish you would let me leave this till I come back. I readily consented that he should; he left them; and I never saw him from that time to this. I know nothing of the matter no more than the child unborn. I always worked hard to maintain my family.

I had given him warning. I went there on Saturday night; on Sunday my master gave me a caution that I must not let in any body without acquainting my mistress or my young master; I told him I would not; they said my young master had been very extravagant, and run into debt at a great many places; and that the bailiffs were after him. On the Monday they sent me out with two bad shillings; they gave me more money with them to help put them off; they said they took them, and must put them off; I was to buy some bread for their dogs, they kept some pointers, and some lard for pancakes, which makes me remember that it was Shrove-Tuesday; I passed the two bad shillings, and brought my mistress the change; on Tuesday they sent me out with another; I thought it something odd having another the next day, though I did not think any thing of their making them. I fetched the prisoner in a ladle one night and some mould; two or three days after this I went to warm my young master's bed; I went down stairs, and went into the parlour for some beer; and I saw a little pair of moulds lying on the table, about four inches square, with two quarter guineas upon them; and there was the ladle I fetched him in, and a little box of quarter guineas on the table; I went up, and staid a considerable while upon the stairs to watch; when he came in again, as he was then gone to the vault; at last, going down stairs, I hit against the wainscot; he ran out with a hanger, and said to me, it is well you was not ran through, D - n you, what do you do there? When I went up to my mistress, she asked me what had happened; I told her: she said, Did you go into the parlour? I told her no.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hanger in his hand?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; it generally hangs in the day time in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him yourself in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, the mould was all marked; I saw him put the mould together, and pour the metal in; then he broke the mould in two; I saw this while I was sitting upon the stairs, waiting to go down with the chamber-pot; the parlour door was wide open; and the hanger lay across the table; after I went, the prisoner came up and opened my chamber door to see whether I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him coin a quarter of a guinea?</p>
               <p>Clark. I saw him pour the metal into a a mould, which I suppose was the same as I had seen; and there was some quarter guineas in a little box upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you had been in the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mould made of?</p>
               <p>Clark. Round it, I believe, was iron, it was black in the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend it was made of?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell; I did not take them off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for you to see, as he poured the metal, what colour it was of?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a mould before?</p>
               <p>Clark. Not till I saw young Mr. Byerman's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go of your own accord to the justices?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes: they would not grant a warrant for the bad shillings. I was served with a copy of a writ to make my words good: then I told the whole story.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after this warrant?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Two months.</p>
               <p>Isabella Walker. I went to live with Mr. Byerman a month all but a day before Christmas. I came away on boxing day; the day after Christmas day. Mr. Byerman used me very ill; he sat up to write one night, he sent me to fetch a thing in out of the yard with a handle, such as plumbers use, about half a yard long. He called me up in the morning; when I came down stairs, there was a great fire made up with wood; he said he made it with wood, because I did not fetch the coals, and said he should not have called me so soon if he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150034"/> had any coals: the writing lay upon the table: when I swept under the dresser, I found a little piece of money, it was larger than a five-and-three-pence, but not so large as a half guinea. I supposed it to be a medal. I carried it to my mistress, and my young master; my young master said it is nothing but an old medal that has been thrown about.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it if you saw it again?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; it had a head on one side, and nothing on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is no evidence at all given on this occasion that can render it necessary for the prisoner to go into any defence; the prosecutors have undertaken to prove that he coined a counterfeit quarter guinea; neither of the witnesses are able to prove such a thing upon him.</p>

            . The prisoner on Ash Wednesday, ordered me to fetch a mould and a ladle, between three and four o'clock at noon; the ladle was in the back kitchen. I took the ladle to him in the parlour; there was a cart load of dirt, which I was to sist over the garden; while I was in the garden fisting the cinders, I stood near the parlour window; when I fetched the ladle he bid me turn the carpet half way up, which I did. I saw him take the mould out of a bag that lay upon the carpet. I stood pretty close to the window. I saw him with the ladle take some mould out of a watering pot, that I brought him; and I took him some water at the same time, to sprinkle the earth with. Whilst I was fisting the cinders I saw him put some of the earth into the mould, then he squeezed them together; then he laid some pieces of something along the mould; then he joined the two moulds together, the metal was on the fire; the prisoner called me, whilst I was fisting the first sieve, and asked me if I had taken any metal from off the music. I asked him what it was; he said a piece of tutenage; he called up to his mamma; she told him it was under the green cloth by the window; he put it in the ladle, and I saw it melted; then he put the moulds inside a stand and screwed the stand together; then I saw him pour the metal in the mould; then he unscrewed the stand and took the moulds out, he opened them and took out some pieces and broke them in half; then he throwed the coin upon the hearth; soon afterwards he took them up and put them upon a chair; just at that time the bell rung, he came to me and said he had looked through the door and it was one of his creditors, so he went up stairs; before he went up, he put the moulds into a bag, and he put the earth and ladle on one side; he took the bag up stairs with him. I went and answered the door; after the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150035"/> was gone, he came down stairs again; while the man was there the house door was open, I saw these shillings, he had covered them with a spotted red and white handkerchief. I counted them, there were fifty-three shillings, which I did suppose were for shillings, they lay upon the chair; they had a sort of a yellow cast, the size of a shilling, with a king William's head upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was upon the other side?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not take that particular notice. I do not believe there was any thing upon the other side; then he brought down a bag and fixed a thing on the top of a little table, and it turned round like the flie of a jack; he opened the thing and fixed it on the table and turned the thing round; he put the shillings in and took them out. I saw him take them off the chair from under the handkerchief. When he came in again at night, I asked him what he was making with that metal; he said some dumps for a dancing master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any bad money of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; I have had the same as these shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they the same colour as them you saw when they were given you to pass?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; they were not; they whitened them with the stuff they had mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar whiten them?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; he rubbed them with his thumb and singer with something red; I don't know what it was. I have seen him beat it in the mortar, but never saw him mix it; when he had coined them he separated them that were in long rows, and put them upon the marble harth, then he put them in a chair and covered them with his pocket handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Clark. About a week; this was before I gave warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he made no secret of this matter?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; it was made no secret, nobody came into our house?</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived there about a week?</p>
               <p>Clark. Not so long I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. A large room.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room is the fire place in?</p>
               <p>Clark. On one side.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you stand to the parlour window?</p>
               <p>Clark. I stood as close as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. The sash up or down?</p>
               <p>Clark. Down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you stood was the fire?</p>
               <p>Clark. About so far; (describing about four yards.)</p>
               <p>Q. What, was the dirt put into the moulds?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you speak of tutenage. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Clark. Of a kind of yellow cast.</p>
               <p>Q. And your master made no secret of it?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it is a pity but they did make a secret; they bring goods or any thing in, and make no secret of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He left them upon a chair?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they altogether or separate when you saw them upon the chair?</p>
               <p>Clark. They were broke; they were all separate.</p>
               <p>Q. What number did you see?</p>
               <p>Clark. Fifty-three.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in some confusion when this man knock'd at the door, and the young man went up stairs; your business was to talk to this man at the door?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you to go into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Clark. While the man was talking, and making a noise at the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. You was talking to the man till he was gone?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; I shut the door before he went, and left him making a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door was shut, your master was safe enough from the man?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your master stay up stairs after the door was shut?</p>
               <p>Clark. Some time after; I saw the money while the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot say the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150036"/>Q. Which door was shut when the man went away?</p>
               <p>Clark. The street door; we do not let them into the garden when they come.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You look'd at these shillings?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes; I thought them the same make as the shillings they had given me to pass: it made me very cautious not to take them to put off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master when he came in at night?</p>
               <p>Clark. Only I asked him what he was making; he said, dumps. I said I would never take any more to pass, for they were the same as he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after this?</p>
               <p>Clark. About three weeks; I would not carry a shilling to pass, and they turned me out. My old master beat me. This young man was guarded out by my master with a drawn sword. He turned me out at half an hour after twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to after that?</p>
               <p>Clark. To one Mrs. Boucher's, an acquaintance of theirs. I live with one Mr. Clift now; I have lived there two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Clift and your master have had some law-suits together I believe?</p>
               <p>Clark. That is nothing to me, If I had not been with Mr. Clift they would not have served me with a copy of a writ, because I said a relation of my master's had taken bad money to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Clift had some dispute with Mr. Byerman, I believe?</p>
               <p>Clark. I believe they had; I knew Mr. Clift before I went to Mr. Byerman's. Mr. Clift gave me warning upon that affair. I have three masters here that I lived with. It was the lawyer I carried the copy of the writ to, who insisted upon my going to the sollicitor of the Tower.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of money ( shewing her a piece of foreign coin.) Do you think that was one of the fifty-three?</p>
               <p>Clark. I am sure it is not; they offered me 200 l. to go abroad; if they can hurt me they will. I know that is not one of the shillings.</p>
               <p>Isabella Walker. I lived with Mr. Byerman, the first day that ever I caught him doing any thing, he asked me to beat some quick silver and brick dust together. He put the quick silver into the mortar, and I beat it up with the brick dust; it mixed together; he took his buckles out of his shoes and cleaned them; he would not let me stay in the room, but bid me go up to make his bed; when I came down with the pot I saw him at the sink, rubbing something upon a shilling, between his finger and thumb, he said he took these bad shillings upon a journey, and as he had taken them he should get them off; there was some money laid down upon the dresser, and I think one of, the bad shillings lay upon the drawers. I went with one of these shillings to buy some rabbits, the prisoner and his mother were there upon St. Thomas's day; it was I think Friday, and bought a rabbit, the gentleman never disputed them, and I wondered why I should; after that time I thought they were not bad; but upon Christmas day in the morning the because cupboard door was left open, there was a large saucer quite full of this bad money; they had heads upon one side, and nothing at all upon the other. I thought directly they were some of the same shillings I had seen in the window; at Christmas day at night my master and mistress used me very ill, my young master was there at the same time, and told me not to take any notice of what I had heard or seen, for it was not his fault, and desired I would not say any thing about him. I came away in the morning; I locked the door and put the key under it; and went away and never came again for my wages; that time and Christmas day was the only time I ever saw them, that was the only time I ever saw him rub them. I borrowed three shillings once of the father, and a five and three-pence. I changed the quarter of a guinea, and put the money into my pocket. I looked at it; it was all good, I put it among the other money. I offered a shilling afterwards, the woman said that it was a bad shilling. I went back and told the woman she had given it to me. I went home to my master and told him of it; he said the woman at the chandler's shop had given it me; and he bid me go and break her windows.</p>

               <p>Q. You had some quarrels with your master while you was there?</p>
               <p>Walker. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master was cleaning his buckles with this stuff, you said he sent you out of the room?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150037"/>Q. You say a little before you went away. the prisoner said he hoped you would say nothing about him?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was in debt, and had his creditors come after him?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes; a vast many.</p>

He asked me to lend him a crown; I said you are always wanting to borrow money; your father does not know it; I would not lend him any; he went further, where he went I can't tell, and he came back in the evening.

               <p>Hamilton. I had salt fish for dinner; we have it always twice a week in Lent; therefore I remember it, that was the first day in Lent.</p>

               <p>Q. Is tutenage softer or harder than silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I rather think it softer; if there is an air furnace it would melt of itself?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it would not melt without a furnace, or being blown under?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Would tutenage put into a hot coal fire melt?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I should think not; I should think it would not melt without the fire being blown under.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of this metal being melted in an iron ladle?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; nor any mechanic whatever, I am sure.</p>

               <p>Court. Tutenage is a mixed metal, I think?</p>

               <p>Q. Was that before dinner, or after?</p>
               <p>Burn. After; I was in the house before dinner: I went to dine with my mother, at the next door; they asked me to stay dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who?</p>
               <p>Burn. Mrs. Byerman herself.</p>
               <p>Q. You said they?</p>
               <p>Burn. It was Mrs. Byerman. I went in, between twelve and one, and she asked me to dine. I went home and dined, and came in again about two. My child died the tenth of February. I had been a week before at my mother's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him come home?</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with me at a shilling a week; he lodged four nights, when he went away I missed the sheets. He had not the room to himself, but had a bedfellow to lie with him; the bedfellow went out that morning, and the sheets were safe after he was gone. The prisoner was getting up, when I saw the sheets safe; I bid him lock the door, and bring the key down; he threw the key to me, instead of giving it me: as he went away, I went up suspecting something not right; I opened the door, and missed the sheets. The prisoner was taken a month after; before the justice, he told where he had pawned the sheets; they appeared to be pawned by him the twenty-eighth of March, at Mr. Peer's, in Chapel-street, Soho. I cannot swear positively to them. I believe they are mine; I think I can speak to the work.</p>

            . I know the saddle and saddle-cloth; they are the property of my master, Mr. Park. On Friday night I had a saddle-cloth, and used it upon a mare of my master's, and locked it up; about seven o'clock I missed them. On Saturday and on Monday I saw them at the justices; there I knew them very well. The prisoner when charged with stealing them, said, as he was going along the road early in the morning he found them.</p>

               <p>Diggins. I do not know; I have not seen him these eight years till last Wednesday was a week; and then I saw him in Grays-inn lane, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>

               <p>Q. What time?</p>

               <p>Diggins. A two curled wig: I had not seen him almost eight years before: He saw me home to my own house that evening: he was with me from three till eight o'clock. I went to a public house with him in Grays-inn lane; I do not know the sign. We went into the Red-Lion in Moorfields before I went home; we staid there about an hour.</p>

               <p>Diggins. I believe, about six or seven o'clock; he went home with me that night. I was to meet him next day at Bethnal-green, at one o'clock; I did not go there till two; we staid there half an hour: from there we came down to Mrs. Reynold's house in Baldwin's-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is she?</p>
               <p>Diggins. A woman that has washed for me some time: I went there to dine; as I did not choose to dine in a public house. We staid there from four till ten at night; then he saw me home. At about seven o'clock we drank tea: she fetched some salmon for dinner. I parted with him at eleven. I never saw him from that time till I saw him in Tothill-fields bridewell, when he sent me a letter; that was on Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this man a relation of yours?</p>
               <p>Diggins. Not at all.</p>

               <p>Q. What was their business at your house?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Their business was this; she said she knew him from a boy, and did not chuse to go into a public house with him: she asked me to let her friend have some dinner: they had pickled salmon first, and afterwards a dish of tea, and were talking about their little tricks when they were children.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not chuse to go to a public house with him?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; I went for the salmon; it was about four when they came in; they had the salmon about five; they talked till about six or seven, and then had a dish of tea: they departed from that room about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit to hear them talk all the time?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her if she can remember sewing a button upon my coat about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. A button dropped off, and we sewed it upon that coat.</p>
               <p>Q. So you know nothing of this Mrs. Diggins?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; I know she is a married woman.</p>

            . On the eighteenth of April Mrs. Diggins brought Chesterford up to me to drink tea; and from that time to ten o'clock at night he was in my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. What acquaintance have you with Mrs. Diggins?</p>
               <p>Lucas. She is an intimate acquaintance of mine, she lodges with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you remember it was that day more particularly than any other day?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I think it was upon Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was upon Wednesday?</p>
               <p>Lucas. You know best.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have the curiosity to know it was that day that Mr. Diggins brought this man to you?</p>
               <p>Lucas. They eat a bit of victuals and drank tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say it was the eighteenth?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I can affirm it. I have it down in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the book?</p>
               <p>Lucas. (Fumbles in her pocket a long time.) It was a bit of paper I wrote it down on.</p>
               <p>Q. I want that paper?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I can swear it was the eighteenth of April. I am a woman of character, and my oath will go as far as this. I will say the young man was with me that day.</p>
               <p>Court. A great deal depends upon this paper. I want to see it?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I have lost it. It was the eighteenth upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear any more about it?</p>
               <p>Lucas: Mrs. Diggins brought this young fellow up to drink tea.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the question; I ask you when you first heard of his being in trouble?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Two or three days afterwards, Mrs. Diggins told me of it; he had the same cloaths and wig, and every thing on as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Diggins's business?</p>
               <p>Lucas. She has friends as well as me; she makes flowers, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What for the milliners?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She has a husband I suppose?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Yes; he is gone to sea.</p>

Yes; on Friday the first; I went out about eleven o'clock upon some business, upon my return about a quarter after I went and sat at the bar; I observed the prisoner setting about eight or ten yards from me; he seemed to look directly at me the whole time; he then came forwards and asked me if I had any brokers used my house. I told him I had several; he said he wished I would recommend him to one; he said he had some East India stock to sell; I called Stephen and desired him to call my nephew,

            , which he did. I bid him go either to Jonathan's or Garraway's, and tell Mr. Portis that a gentleman at my house had some India stock to sell. I don't recollect that I was in the way when Mr. Portis came. I saw no more of the transaction till next day; when about one o'clock Mr. Portis came in a hurry, and asked where the gentleman was that I recommended him the day before to sell some India stock for. I then called to the waiters. I do not know the answer they gave him, but Mr. Portis went out immediately towards the East India House; in about half an hour after that the prisoner and Mr. Portis came to my house together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they stay any time?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. I can't take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. About the middle of February: the prisoner and Mr. Portis came into the coffee house, they were going down the coffee room; Mr. Portis turned short and asked me if I had any idea of that person; I told him I believed he was the person I had sent for him to sell some India stock for. Mr. Portis desired to speak with my nephew Hanbury; I had him called down.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what hour he came in?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. About a quarter after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think so?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. I had been out of town that morning; the coach comes in about ten o'clock, and I had been but a very little time in town, then I went out for about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of the person that day after Mr. Portis came?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the same person came in at one next day?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason for saying one o'clock?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. I am generally about that time in the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason to think it was about one?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. When I saw him the waiter told me the stock could not be transfered on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only reason; that might suit one hour as well as the other?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. I am generally in the bar from twelve to three. I think it was about half after one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed when you saw him as he is now?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. No; he had a brown coat; he was in boots, and his hair was undressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear in the same dress afterwards?</p>
               <p>Bicknell. Yes; the same the day following.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt in your own mind now, whether he is the same person you saw in your coffee house?</p>

            . I live with Mr. Bicknell; I am his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him first?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. On the first of October. I was called down stairs by my uncle; he said I must fetch a broker for that gentleman; my uncle desired me to fetch Mr. Portis. I went to Garraway's and Jonathan's to search for him; I brought him with me; my uncle was not at home when I came back; Mr. Powell was sitting then under the dial. Mr. Portis sat with him some few minutes and conversed with him; then Mr. Portis went out and came in again, and informed Mr. Powell that it was no transfer day at the India House and he could not sell the stock; Mr. Portis appointed to meet him next morning to sell it; the next morning between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner came in; Mr. Portis not coming at the time appointed, I went for him; he came with me as before. Mr. Portis went to the India house, as I suppose, by himself; he came in again and Mr. Powell went out with him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150048"/> this was about twelve or one o'clock. Some time after that, Mr. Portis came in again in a hurry, and asked me if I had seen that gentleman, and said he could not find him. Mr. Portis then went out, and some time afterwards the prisoner came in; I told him Mr. Portis had been, and asked for him; he said he had seen him: he then sat down in a box. Some little time after, Mr. Portis came in, and paid him some money; I stood just by at the time; what sum I cannot say. Mr. Portis stayed but a few minutes with him: then I went out: the prisoner stayed a quarter of an hour after that, and then went away; I did not see him from that time till the day he was taken. When Mr. Portis brought him in, I was up stairs; I was called down: Mr. Portis called me to the table where he sat, and asked me if I knew that gentleman; I said I did; I recollected him immediately; I called a constable, and we went to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed when he came first to your house?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I think, in darkish coloured cloaths, and boots and spurs; when Mr. Portis brought him in he was dressed, his hair was powdered: he was dressed the second day the same as he was the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I am certain he is.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Upon a Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never seen him before?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that Monday that you first saw him?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I believe between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. And did the servant give you directions to fetch Mr. Portis?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. No; my uncle gave me directions.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, as soon as you made your appearance in the coffee-house you was sent immediately, and saw him no more then?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I was in the coffee-house the rest of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. For about five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from the time of your return before Mr. Portis went out again?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Not long; I heard Mr. Portis say it was no transfer day.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not attend to the prisoner particularly?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. When Mr. Portis came in the first time he came up to me at the bar, and asked me if I knew him; I looked stedfastly at him and then said I did not; he asked if my uncle did; I said I believed he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. It was the practice at your house, I suppose, to fetch Mr. Portis.</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I have fetched him before to other people.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Portis asked you then if you knew them, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. No; I never fetched him to a stranger before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your uncle in the room when he came next day?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there company in the room next day?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all the time the supposed prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house was very much crouded, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. There were a good many people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended as a waiter?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. I believe that person gave evidence before that he thought I breakfasted at the coffee-house that morning?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes, he did the first day he came.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I breakfast before or after the broker came?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. At breakfast before the broker was ordered to be fetched. I came down before the breakfast was over; the things were before him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he staid a quarter of an hour after the money was paid in the coffee-room?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not seem in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Hanbury. Not the least in a hurry.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who was at the expence of that writ?</p>
               <p>Portis. I do not know; I understand the India company meant to defray the expence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know for what purpose the action was brought against you?</p>
               <p>Portis. In order to try whether I, as a broker, and a subscribing witness to the transaction, was liable to make good the stock transferred.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it has been intimated to you that if this man is convicted that action is not to go on?</p>
               <p>Portis. I have heard nothing about that; but I understand that the action is not to go on; I have not, indeed, had it from the India company, or the attorney. I heard somebody saying, in a cursory way, that they supposed there would be no more of it; but I heard nothing of it in a regular way.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150050"/>Q. Then the action is stopt I suppose?</p>
               <p>Portis. I cannot tell; I gave it into the hands of my attorney; I have heard no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you served with the writ?</p>
               <p>Portis. Last term I believe?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean last Easter term?</p>

               <p>Portis. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with any agents of the East India company?</p>
               <p>Portis. Not respecting the action.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you some intimations that this action is intended to be dropt?</p>
               <p>Portis. Not from the company.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, I suppose, from somebody?</p>
               <p>Portis. I met Mr. Rous, the director, one day, and he said, that as I had took the man, he supposed I should have no more trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. Sware him in chief.</p>
               <p>(He is sworn to give evidence.)</p>

I went to the bar, he pointed to the box, and said, That is the gentleman wants you. I went up to him, and asked him what his commands were; he said he wanted to sell 400 l, India stock; I turned round to Hanbury, and asked him, Who recommended the gentleman to me? he told me his uncle; his uncle, I observed, was not in the bar; I asked him where he was; he said, he was gone out; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him his name; he told me his name was, Taylor

               <p>Q. Are you sure you said that directly to him?</p>
               <p>Portis. I don't recollect my going out of the coffee house: I might have gone out, but I do not recollect it. The next day, Tuesday 2d of October, Hanbury came to me as before, and told me the same person was at their house waiting for me. I then came to Bicknel's coffee-house, and it was then a little after twelve o'clock. When I came to him in the box, I desired his name, and where he lived, that I might put his name upon a slip of paper, to give in the ticket for the transfer, to have it ready, when I had sold the stock; he told me then again that his name was Taylor

            ; recollecting himself, he put his hand in his pocket, and produced a receipt for 400 l. which he said was the original receipt for the stock: that transfer was signed in May, in the name of

             or LOger, to the best of my knowledge: then we went up to the India house together. When we came to the transfer office in the India house, I desired him to sit down, pointing to a vacant chair near the fire place. I desired him to sit for a minute, I would go in where the crowd were; where they were upon business, and would sell the stock. I met with Mr. Cotton, who wanted to buy 400 l. India stock; I sold it to him at 199 l half. He then gave me the name of his principal,

             and Sykes were, to the clerk o f the transfer, and delivered it in. Mr. Cotton applied once or twice before one o'clock, to know if the transfer was ready; this was about half an hour after twelve o'clock, as his principal was waiting to accept the stock, and pay for it. I went up to the books, and asked the clerks if such a transfer was ready; they said, no, but it should be forwarded. Mr. Cotton was impatient to have it done: I went up, and got it done about one o'clock. When it was ready I went to the place where I left the prisoner; he was gone. I went up to Mr. Cotton, and said, I supposed he would return immediately. We staid a few minutes; Mr. Cotton was impatient, and said if he did not come in soon he must buy the stock in upon me (referring to a particular custom.) I said to Mr. Cotton I never saw the person before; I requested him to stay. I went to the coffee house to look for him; I did not find him there, but found him in the street in Cornhill, going towards the India house. I told him of the delay he had occasioned; he said he did not think the transfer would have been so soon ready. I went on before him; he came in after me. When we came up to the books, I desired him to give me the old receipt; he pulled out a number of papers, and seemed to be in a little confusion, at last he pick'd it out from among the papers; I then filled up a receipt, which I saw the prisoner sign in the name of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150051"/> T. Barrow. ( the receipt produced.) The body of the receipt is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you or the prisoner do upon the receipt being signed?</p>
               <p>Portis. It was given to the clerk of the transfer to compare with the original acceptance in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it resemble it?</p>
               <p>Portis. Yes, very much. The clerk returned it to me, and mentioned that the hand writing was the same. The prisoner came up, and signed the transfer in the books. After the receipt was witnessed, Mr. Donaldson gave it me; I gave it Mr. Cotton, and said I would go to his office for it. I desired the prisoner to go to Bicknel's, and wait; and I would bring him the money as soon as I got it. I went to Jonathan's coffee house, having some little business to transact; then I went to Cotton's: I received a draught upon their bankers for 700 l. I also received one note of 50 l. one of 40 l. and 8 l. in money. I went with the notes and money in my hand to Bicknel's coffee-house; this was more than half an hour after one. I then paid the prisoner the money, deducting for the transfer 12 s. and 10 s. for my commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the dress of the prisoner the first day you saw him?</p>
               <p>Portis. He was in a mixed colour, a sort of drab colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Dark or light?</p>
               <p>Portis. Rather a dark; he had his boots and buckskin breeches on; no powder in his hair; and the fore flap of his hat down.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed the next day?</p>
               <p>Portis. The same dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you saw him again?</p>
               <p>Portis. The first time was on Monday the 18th of February; I was crossing the lower end of Lombard street, near the Mansion house; and met him dressed in morning, much as he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the fraud been discovered before this time?</p>
               <p>Portis. Yes; in February, I think. The moment I saw him I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any efforts to find the man out?</p>
               <p>Portis. Yes; I had been down to Gloucester, and also almost as far as the Devizes, to see some persons that were suspected. I went up close to him, and look'd at him five or six times, from the end of Lombard street almost to the end of Nicholas lane. He kept his face toward the wall; he never once turned his face toward me from the moment I first saw him: just at the end of Nicholas lane I put my arm through his as he was walking, and just stopt him: I said, Sir, I beg your pardon, I have something to say to you, he turned round and looked at me, and said, Sir, I don't know you, you have the advantage of me; I said, It is very strange, it I don't know you. I told him I had some particular business with him which I wanted to communicate; he wanted to know my business, he was in a hurry he said; I requested him to go with me to a coffee-house; after some time desiring me to inform him of the business there, he said he would go with me to a coffee-house; I said we would cross over to Bicknel's coffee-house; upon that he seemed to shrink a little, and said, Why Bicknel's? there are other coffee-houses nearer than Bicknel's. I said, I knew none nearer, and I was going there, and requested him to go with me; I kept walking with him in that manner till I got him under the gate-way of George-yard; then he said my business was so strange he did not understand it; and did not know why he should go with me; he said, Sir, What would you think for a person to accost you so strangely that you never saw? I said, I should suppose he had some business with me; and I would not be against going to a coffee-house with any man; we went on to Bicknel's coffee-house door; then he went in before me; he went and sat down opposite the bar in a box; I went up in some little time, and asked Mr. Bicknel if he knew that gentleman that was come in with me; he looked at him, and answered immediately, and said, Yes, Sir, it is the person who committed the forgery. I then asked him where Dick was; meaning

Hanbury came up to the box, I said, Do you know this gentleman in the box? he said, Yes, perfectly well; the prisoner then asked what my business was; I said, I brought him there as the person that committed the forgery on the 2d of October; the prisoner proposed to send for somebody that knew him; he said he kept cash at Mr. Staples's; and that if I would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150052"/> there, he dare say they would give me such an account of him as would remove my suspicions.

               <p>Q. Before Mr. Shakespear, did not you hesitate and seem uncertain?</p>
               <p>Portis. Not to my knowledge; I never had any doubt of the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this receipt here is the figures com. and casting up, 798, 10.</p>
               <p>Portis. It is not my figures nor writing.</p>

               <p>Q. In fact there are some nearer?</p>
               <p>Portis. I believe there are.</p>
               <p>Q. When he observed it was a strange manner in which you addressed him, did not you say it was an odd circumstance, and that he was very much like the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Portis. I said it was odd, appearances were very often deceitful; that I said to get him along with me to the coffee-house.</p>

            . I was a clerk in the India House at the time; if I had never seen the prisoner from that time till now I should not have had the least doubt but he is the person that committed the forgery; the difference is so great in his dress that I cannot swear positive. I have been upon the account of the company at divers informations concerning different persons, but if I had met him upon any of them I should have apprehended him as believing him to be the person, but I will not swear to him. I did not see the transfer signed.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you set out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Williams. I cannot tell; he was at Islington at the Angel about half after nine; we staid there a little while, my master told me to take care to be at the burying of the man on Tuesday. I sat off from Islington before ten o'clock, I left Mr. Powell at Islington; he said he would take care of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Monday, how was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Williams. In a sort of a blossom coloured coat, waistcoat, and breeches, like a blotting paper colour.</p>

               <p>Williams. Yes; at about five o'clock in the evening, at Potters Bar; he was dressed the same as he was the day before.</p>

               <p>Williams. Because I never drove him in the carriage before or since.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was a blossom colour?</p>
               <p>Williams. As far as ever I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any boots on?</p>
               <p>Williams. I can't tell so far.</p>

               <p>Parrey. Yes; the Monday after; he said he had some time to spare whilst somebody went to fetch his horse, or mare, from somewhere out of town for him to go to Uxbridge after the coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation.</p>
               <p>Parrey. Most of it about the accident of the man; he was afraid he said he should loose his horses, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about the coroner?</p>
               <p>Parrey. I understood him he was to go to the coroner at Uxbridge that evening. Mr. Powell said if he could find the coroner, and give him something, it would save his horses; and said he would ride to Uxbridge himself at night. Mr. Powell had not dined; I asked if I should get something; he said no, a Welch-rabbit, or any thing would do; he had one, and stayed with me three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going on horse-back to Uxbridge?</p>
               <p>Parrey. Yes; he waited with me till his horse was fetched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ready dressed? had he boots on?</p>
               <p>Parrey. I do not know; I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether he came back from Uxbridge next morning?</p>
               <p>Parrey. No; I did not see him for months afterwards.</p>

In the morning, about four o'clock, two of my fellow servants called me up; I went to the door to speak to them; when I came back I saw my breeches pulled from under my head; my little girl was in my bed; I charged the prisoner with it; there was my wife's cloathes under her bed's head, on a little table; I had not seen them before for three months; I seldom went to the box; I found the box locked; I had the key, and my cloathes were in it; the stays were under the foot of the bed where I lay. I went into the yard, there was the bag, and six guineas and three shillings. I asked her if she knew any thing of that; she said she did not; she wanted the keys of my drawer; I opened the drawers and box, where my wife's rings were; they were not in it. I took hold of her hand, and she had the gold rings, and had put two brass ones in the box. She had pawned all my wife's apparel. ( the rings produced.) I found no money upon her.</p>

He went into the Shepherd and Goat, Fleet ditch, the man called for six-pennyworth of rum and water; they talked of selling bullocks; he had got a bag of counters for money; he said that was the man that ran away with the buckles. I could not find them when I searched him; we went to Alderman Nash; the gentleman who helped him never came, then a woman came in; I could not take her as she gave him the buckles while I was not there (the counter money produced) they were in this man's pocket; he said he would swear that was the man that had them; he said they held him instead of letting him run after him.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Webster. I pitched my basket at the corner of Stationers Court; I took a three-penny loaf out and went into Warwick-court; when I came back my basket was gone. I ran down Stationers-court, down Ludgate-hill, and into the Old Bailey. I saw the prisoner with my basket; I did not know him before; it had ten quartern loaves, and three-penny ones in it. I laid hold of his coat and desired he would pitch the basket, he did and struck me on the breast, and I fell backwards. I laid hold of the basket and saved the fall; he ran away and I run after him, and cried, stop thief, a gentleman stopped him, he said he was running for a wager; the people told me there was a constable, to whom I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>I took the basket by way of mistake. I thought it was another persons, a young man's in Watling-street, one Mr. Hill. I have not been in work above three weeks since January last. I am a baker by trade. I intended: have gone into the country if I could not have got work.</p>

               <p>- Litton. I met the prisoner on the 13th of this month, in Thames-street, he appeared to be more bulky than common. I was just by Gally Key Gate-way. I stopt him and examined him; and under his coat I found this tobacco; (producing it ) I found some more in his breeches. I took him to the next house and gave him in charge of an officer; there was six pounds of it; he seemed to be come up from the other gateway; he was busy there all day long; there was many hogsheads there. I had a suspicion, as he seemed to walk as if he was frightened.</p>
               <p>- Preston. This gentleman gave him in charge to me. I found some of this tobacco back part of his breeches.</p>

            , my servant. I missed a silver milk pot, and two large spoons; I went into my shop, and missed my till, with about thirty or forty shillings worth of half-pence; I believe I locked the till about five minutes before eleven. I saw the milk pot and the spoons over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any thing again?</p>
               <p>Renvoize. A gardner found the till in the morning; I have seen nothing else since; when I came down, the shutter of the window next the door was taken off the hinges; the watchmen brought it to me. It was fast boltted when I went to bed; the sash was thrown up; I fastened it myself over night; I found this chissel (producing a large ripping chissel) and in the kitchen, upon the table, I found a box and burner. Pollard told me Jackson bought this chissel in Wapping, and that this box belongs to Suttle.</p>

            . I was coming home this evening, 24th of last month; I saw three men come out of the prosecutor's house, they crossed the way, and came up to me in a minute; it was about half an hour after twelve. the first held a cutlass over me, the second held a pistol to my forehead; he knock'd me down with it, and then shot me in the arm. Jackson was the man that held the cutlass over me, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not loose sight of them after coming out of the prosecutor's house to you?</p>
               <p>Greenon No; I suppose it was not a minute's time. Jackson asked me what business I had there; another man, Suttle, shot me through the arm. It was a moon light night, very light. I think I know something of Calligan, but I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jackson. Whether he swore before the justice that I was the man that shot him?</p>
               <p>Greenon. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Suttle. Whether you ever saw me before?</p>
               <p>Greenon. No, never.</p>

            . The four prisoners and I went out together one night, about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been committed as an evidence?</p>
               <p>Pollard. I cannot tell rightly. I had known them about a twelvemonth. Jackson and Suttle and I went out a thieving; we met Callagan and Earles in the way; we asked them to go to the alehouse with us; I had known them before; we went a little way. We asked Earles and Callagan to go a thieving with us; they said they would not: they went away, and I never saw them till the next morning. We went up to a baker's, somewhere about Brick Lane in Bethnal Green near Shoreditch; Suttle and I broke open the house with two chissels; we broke open two window shutters of one window; we lifted up the window, and Suttle and I got in; the shutter hung half off; it was not pulled quite off.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Jackson?</p>
               <p>Pollard. He was outside. This was about two o'clock, or half after; it was a lightish night. We got a silver milk pot, six silver spoons, and a till full of money. I took the till, Suttle took the spoons; there were 29 s.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150062"/> in halfpence: we forced the till open with a chissel (this is one of them, taking up the chissel.)</p>
               <p>Q. Whose was it?</p>
               <p>Pollard. It belonged to us all three: we bought it in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do afterwards?</p>
               <p>Pollard. I got out, and Suttle followed me. Jackson was on the other side of the way; we crossed over to him; we saw a young gentleman looking at us, we crossed the way to him.

             knocked him down with a pistol, and then let it fly at him. Jackson stood over him with a drawn cutlass; this is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. to Greenon. You said you saw three people come out of this house?</p>
               <p>Greenon. Yes; it was three doors from my house: I saw two or three come from the house; they were very close; it is hardly twenty yards from my house: I was coming to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pollard. Do you know any thing of that box?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the short one?</p>

               <p>Osmund.

               <p>Q. You speak then with certainty as to Jackson and Suttle?</p>

Two of them came opposite to me, one stood at the right hand of me; I discovered a pistol laying by his right side, it was something bright that I took for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150066"/> a pistol; it was a star-light night, the 23d of April in the morning at two o'clock, I believe the moon was then down.

               <p>- Carpenter. I was one that was set to watch the lead on April 23, as Mr. Altham had lost some lead the night before: the prisoner came up to the pails where we were watching, and made a great noise by thumping and crying halloo; at last he came over the pails, which are about 7 foot high, and went towards a summer-house of Mr. Altham's; then he went with a bundle towards the pails; then he went back again, making the same noise as he did before; he came the third time with a bag, when he had got within a yard or two of the pond, we seized him; he had a bag under his arm, and a stone; after we had taken him, we examined a bundle which he had hung upon the pails, and it contained 50 lb. of lead; we took it next day to Mr. Altham's coach-house, and it matched the place where the lead was taken from: we concluded that the person that stole the lead the night before, had concealed it in the pond as there seemed to be a signal where they might find it again.</p>

               <p>Arthur Hewit. Between twelve and one in the morning, I had the prisoner given in charge to me. I took him into Mrs. Cornely's hall; I had hold of his collar. The prisoner dropped this watch; I saw it in his hand, he took it out of his left hand breeches pocket. When I charged him with it, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was not another young fellow charged with it as well as me?</p>
               <p>Hewit. Yes, there was, and he was near, but the prisoner dropped the watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. My servant came up to me on the twenty-ninth of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, and asked me if my wife might lend a shilling upon this flute; I sent down word she might. When I came down I examined the flute; I suspected it was stolen; I told my wife so; I enquired what sort of a man brought it: afterwards in the advertisement I saw the flute described, a light-coloured flute, mounted with ivory. As I was standing behind the compter my wife jogged me, and said, This is the man a coming that pawned the flute. He told my wife he lived upon Salt

               <p>Q. How did you get in?</p>
               <p>Jameson. We forced the kitchen windows open.</p>
               <p>Q. What with?</p>
               <p>Jameson. A chissel.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose chissel was it?</p>
               <p>Jameson. My own.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you got in?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I struck a light and broke the street door open; then I got up to one of the lamps, and took a light out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take?</p>
               <p>Jameson. (Repeats several things mentioned in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Jameson. Two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To the chapel, and Murphy was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Murphy never in the house?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he stand outside the house for?</p>
               <p>Jameson. To watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him.</p>
               <p>Jameson. About nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the things away?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I carried them all away myself?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you had done.</p>
               <p>Jameson. Yes, he said he thought I never intended to come out of the house; he thought I had been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long he waited for you?</p>
               <p>Jameson. He said he waited half an hour for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge these goods?</p>
               <p>Jameson. At my lodgings at the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking a gold pencil?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor a pocket book?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they afterwards to the Hole in the Wall.</p>
               <p>Jameson. Murphy and I lodged together in the Old Bailey then, and we lodged together in St. Dunstan's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Murphy any of the goods?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave him some of them to take care of for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no share in the plunder?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave him half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this trunk was yours that had these choice things at the Hole in the Wall?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; it belonged to Murphy; I gave them to Murphy to take care of, and he locked them up in his trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never a trunk of your own?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave them to him at the time Mr. Stevenson's things came into the room.</p>

            . The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 7th of April last. He brought his loom next day into my shop to work with me; he work'd six days in making ribbons; he said he was tired of weaving. On 15th of April I went out, and he and his brother came and fetched his loom away. I let him in on the 16th between ten and eleven at night. After I went to bed I recollected that I had left my watch by the loom; I went to fetch it: I found the prisoner snoring lying upon my bed; the next morning I found the prisoner's bed smooth, and the sheets never turn'd down; so it was plain he had never been in bed. When I went to work I found the work cut out of the loom, and a pair of scissars. The prisoner was gone, and the street door, which had been bolted over night after the prisoner came in, was left upon a spring lock, and the bolts drawn; the prisoner had gone out, and shut the door after him; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, but found nothing there. In one Lewis's house we found thirty-three yards of silk,</p>

The reason of my carrying the box to Leader's house was my brother hired me to do it and the reason why I told the gentleman where the silk was found was that Eggleston had said in my hearing that he had pledged silk in these different places. I therefore directed them to these houses, but did not steal or was concerned in stealing it.</p>
