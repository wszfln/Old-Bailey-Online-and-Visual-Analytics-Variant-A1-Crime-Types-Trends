                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband, and is a carman. On the 29th of January I lived at No. 1, Bett-street, Ratcliffe-highway, in the parish of St. George in the East. I have not lived with my husband since the 28th of July, we have been separated from that time—I have been living there, I do not know where he has been living—I keep a green grocer's shop—I saw my husband on the night of the 29th of January, about half-past seven o'clock—I did not see him till he spoke in the shop—I had been serving a customer, who I think went out at the door as he came in—I was behind the counter, having been serving a customer, I was putting the money in the till, and in a moment Rogers spoke—I did not see him till he spoke—he was then stretch<lb/>ing his hand towards my face—when I looked at him he was hold<lb/>ing his arm across the counter, towards my face, and something went off like a pistol—I did not observe anything in his hand—when he stretched his hand out I put up my hand and threw myself back, and then something went off like a pistol, and a flash of the came into my face—he made use of a bitter oath, and said. "You bl----d b----h I will blow your brains out. I have long threatened to do for you; I don't mind going to the gallows if I can get my ends of you. "He then turned and went out of the door into the street—I tried to get round the counter to shut the door—he had gone out, but the came in again and met at the end of the counter, he then put his hand round my waist, and began to beat me about the head in a dreadful manner—there appeared to be something heavy in his hand, and as he struck me it appeared to cut me, he then called me a bl----d b----h three or four times over, and said, "I don't mind going to the gallows if I get my ends of you"—he then went into a little room ad<lb/>joining the shop by the side of the counter, he began to throw and knock the</p>

               <p>expect the would be good enough to give the customers—I left them, and went into Mr. Hanbury's employ, where I had worked before—I was a <hi rend="italic">trounce</hi> once—before the clerk told me, if I had a mind to come, I might, as a regular <hi rend="italic">trounce</hi>—I went to him, and had nine tons that day, and they gave me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was going out with four hogsheads of stout to the Catherine-wheel, in Bishopsgate-street, right opposite Spitalfield's church—when I came there, I happened to tread on a piece of cabbage-leaf, which flung me down, and the wheel was within a very little of going over me—I had to catch hold of a lamp-post, and I caught the toe of my shoe against the curb—I wrenched my knee, and went down—it was eleven o'clock at night, and I could not go at one o'clock, which I ought to have done, for my knee was swelled, and was so bad—I sent to let the clerk know about it—in the room of going to the clerk, she went into the yard, and Mr. Hanbury gave her an order for me to go into the hospital, and I was there eleven weeks before I could get my knee well—she swore she would not work—if I did not turn out to work, she would not keep me, after all the money I had been earning for her—I never strove to go into a brewer's house any more—well, I went and worked for Mr. Bryant, in Prince's-square, and worked for him six years—I did the very same with Mr. Bryant that I did at the others, cleaning shoes, knives and forks, for him and the servants—I had orders to do so, and I did do it—my master would give me a character from that day to this, and a good character, till there was three or four rascally fellows—one's name was <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> Mitchell, the second James Withers, the third James Hall, and the fourth <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Mitchell—this <hi rend="italic">will</hi> went and told my wife that I had a very great concern with the servant-girl—which God Almighty knows I never knew or heard of, no more than a child just come from its mother's womb—he went and told her—he borrowed a coat of me on the Sunday, and said he would bring it home in the afternoon, which he did at the time I was gone to chapel in Wellclose-square, (to parson Smith's)—when I came home, she asked me where I had been—I said, to chapel—"Chapel! no," she says, "you have been out with that d—nasty stinking w—, and if I meet her, by G—I will murder her"—those were her very words—if not, may God strike me dead—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "You have not been to chapel; you have been with that stinking W—"—I said, "What stinking w—do you mean now?"—I said, "If you had gone to chapel with me, you would have seen if I had been with a w—or not"—I said, "Take and dress yourself, and go out and be comfortable with me on Sunday like another woman; let us be comfortable with one another"—but in the room, of that, she stops at home—well, this villanous fellows told her that I knew as much about the girl as I knew about her—well, soon after it came to master's ears, and he said, "Rogers, have you been making a b—W—Y house of my house?"—"A b—w—y house?"—"No," says I, "I never made a b—house of your house"—he said, "Have you not been along with the servant-girl?"—"What?" said I—he said, "But every time I am out I understand you are always in my house, and you have made a b—w—y house of my house in the middle of the day"—"In the middle of the day!" I said, "Who has told you that?"—he said, "I have heard it"—" What day was it on?" said I—he said, "the day you cleaned the windows" I had been ordered to clean the windows outside, and the cook said to me, "You must come and clean them inside, for I must get the fenders and fire-irons, cleaned"—and I did, and the nursery-maid came down with the children to dressed to take them out: as soon as she came down—she</p>

               <p>had no shawl or handkerchief on (this Mitchell was coming past with Miller and Hall) she sat the little dear baby down on the sofa, and said, "Rogers, mind the baby that it does not fall off the sofa, while I put my handkerchief and shawl on, for I am just going out"—of course, I did so, and these fellows went and rose the report that I had the girl down on the sofa in the middle of the day, and told my master so, as soon as he heard that, he discharged both me and the girl from the premises—she always said if she met the girl she would murder her—I knew no more about the girl than the Lord in heaven; and after I was dis<lb/>charged I made up my mind, being so hurt, that I would go to Graves<lb/>and along with the girl—I did, and we spend the day comfortably together—end yet I knew nothing at all about the girl—I knew I had got a wife and why should I go with the girl—it was a hard thing to get turned out of my place, and I went out of aggravation, and came home, but never knew any thing about the girl—it was her doing to kick up a row that caused me to be turned out of all my places—so then, of course, we had a few words—well, one Sunday night I had been out and came home—she was standing against the door—I had been to see a work<lb/>mate or two of mine—it was about ten o'clock at night, I suppose—that was the first time I was given in charge—as soon as I went in doors—she was standing in the door, and a policeman with her, talking—she standing on one side, and the policeman on the other—she began with me, and wanted to know if I had been out along with my damsels again—I said, "No, I have been to see a mate or two of mine"—she said, "You are a liar"—I said, "I am not," and I said, "You are always saying it, I will give you a knock in the face," and I up with my fist, and gave her a push in the face—I only pushed her—the policeman was standing there—I did not strike her violently—she called out "Murder" immediately—the policeman came and took me—I was taken to the Magistrate, and he heard the case, and said, "Now my man what have you a mind to allow this woman a week, and separate?"—I thought we were to divide our things with each other—I was lawfully married—why should a man not have half as well as a woman?—what does a man marry a woman for?—he marries her to maintain her, and I always did, and always would, unto the utmost of my power—I always strove to keep a good house and home over my head, and got into a good club, and every thing—when I was taken, the Magistrate heard my case—I went back after my things—I brought a box, and took all my things out, and tied them up in an apron—I took them to the Magpie and Stump all <hi rend="italic">higgledy piggledy</hi>—all flung out into the street, as if they were a parcel of old rags—I went to look to see if I had got them all right and found I had not—I went and bought a box, and came back again—I was rather in liquor I will acknowledge—after I got the box I wanted one shirt, three pairs of stockings, a pin which I wore in my shirt, and some numbers of the "Pilgrim's Progress"—I went back for them, and she sent for the policeman, who knocked me down—with his staff he knocked me down on the ground, just as a dog, and dragged me of to the station-house—there I was again hauled up before the Magistrate, and he sentenced me three months to the house of cor<lb/>rection, and there I was three months—one fortnight I was picking oakum, and ten weeks at work in the open shed, and when I came out of the pri<lb/>son the governor gave me a character, said I was a worthy good man when I told him about it, and what it was for—well, I came, out and</p>

               <p>and got some work, as soon as I got out—and was at work about a fort<lb/>night; I happened to go down Belt-street again—I went to the Euston Arms to get some supper, and who should come in but my lady—" Rogers said she—I said, "Well, what do you want?"—"Are you a mind to make up my allowance? she said, "What you made an agreement for, my half-crown a week?"—No," says I, "where you are, I will be, if you like to come with me I will maintain you; or, if you like for me to come with you, but not a farthing will I give you till then"—she said, "You, won't wont you? by G—I will make you up all the time you were in prison"—Will you says I—on the Monday week following my shoes had got dry, being laid up so long—I got into work and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and the soles came down right away from the shoes—I went to the saving's bank (I am not ashamed to say it) to draw 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and bought a bran new smock-frock, the waistcoat that I have on, and a new pair of high shoes, ready and fit to go to work—I went to Mr. Bryant, and stated the case to him—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, have you been home yet?"—I said, "No"—he said "Why don't you strive to go home and make up matters, and live with your wife comfortably?"—I said, "That is what I should like to do"—he said, "Well try what can do"—I was a little in liquor—I went home; and when I got near the door, she came and slammed it against me, and said, "You rascal, you shall not come here"—I went from the place again, and they came and dragged me off again like a dog, and took me before a Magistrate; and they took me to Clerkenwell—there was two months more of it—there was a poor devil—see how a poor fellow has been used—a man had better be dead than alive, ten thousand times—I went in, as soon as I went in the Governor gave me work to do—I did not starve—I had meat, and half a pint of beer, thank God; and when I came out the Governor gave me a character, and said, "You are a worthy man;" he persuaded me to go home, and said, "Now, try once more, and see if you can't make up matters"—so I did, and just the same occurred again—I made no more to do, but went to the officer at Lambeth-street to see the Magistrate—the officer said, "What do you come here now for, Rogers?"—I said, "For my case"—he said, "You were lawfully married to the woman, why not go to your house? I would tear it all to atoms but what I would go in—I would lug the house down over their ears, and knock the policeman's heads off, if they came near me"—I went to the house—there it was, "You shall not come in"—I went back again—I was ordered to taken an officer with me to see I went in without making any disturbance or any piece of work—I went and got the policeman 155, who was on duty, but whether he is here I do not know—I went in and sat a few minutes, when she made no more to do, but ran and seized me in a moment; but the policeman would not take me in charge—he said, "He is in his own house, stop there"—she made no more to do, but caught hold of me, and tore my shirt—caught me with her talons and scratch<lb/>ed me down the face—what flesh and blood could put up with it?—no man living on the face of God's earth could put up with it—I would sooner take a dagger and stab myself then put up with it—I have been scandalously and brutally used—I would sooner be sent out of the country—I am strong and able, and can go to work—I do not care what work it is—I do not want to be in England again—my character is gone for ever, and what use is it for me to stop here—when I went again to the Magistrate—(there stands one, oh, you false swearing <hi rend="italic">varmint</hi>, you undertaker ((<hi rend="italic">pointing to a witness</hi>) the devil will have you some of these days—you have had a good many bodies, let</p>

About ten minutes be<lb/>fore seven o'clock, on the evening of the 15th of January, I locked my room, door, and went up to my landlord, and almost immediately heard my door open, and I came down with a light in my hand—my room is below—I heard the door move and went down with the light—I had locked it—I put the key into the lock but it would not open it—my landlord came down and tried it—his name is Thomas Ulyate—he pushed the door but could not move it, and at last put his shoulder to it, and found the door give a little—John Hughes came, and they thrust the door open; there was somebody in the room—we got a light but it was put out several times—I could clearly distinguish two persons in the room—they were secured and kept in the room till the policeman came, which was very soon—I grasped hold of one of them before the policeman came,—that was Baldwin, he tried to make his escape—they were both secured—when the police<lb/>man came, and I could get into the room, I found they had taken a silk</p>

               <p>purse out of the drawer, in the room, with 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. belonging to my son, and a prayer-book—there were two crown pieces, three half-crowns, one shilling, and a sixpence,—and there was a silver penny in a puzzle-box which was taken out of the drawer and put on a work bench—I saw both the prisoners searched in my room—I believe 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Baldwin, half-a-crown and a penny was found on More ton—a prayer-book laid on one end of the table, and a pocket-book on the other, I had left the pocket-book and pryer-book in the same drawers as the money was taken, from, the policeman found the purse under the grate with the money taken out—I am quite sure I left the room, door locked.</p>

On the 15th of January, I went to No. 6, Chapel-place, in the parish of St. Ann, Westminster—I arrived there about five minutes to seven o'clock—I went into the room, and found the two prisoners standing together—the witness, Hughes, was hold<lb/>ing Baldwin by the handkerchief, to prevent his going out—I tied the two prisoners together with my handkerchief, and began to search them—Bald<lb/>win put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and took out some money—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drover, and live at No. 5, Broad-yard, Turnmill-street. On the 5th of September last, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I was at Friern-Barnet—I was coming out of the park, between Whetstone and Barnet—it is a field adjoining the road, called the park—I had a lot of beasts there—before I was pulled down I saw a whole lot of people standing against the gate—I knew none of them but the pri<lb/>soner—I have known him by sight for twelve months before—I had just crossed into the middle of the high road, and was thrown down five or six yards from the gate—I had passed the man, and the prisoner followed me, took me round the neck, and threw me down right in the middle of the road—by threw me in the road, and held me by the neck while the others undid my things—he came from behind—I am certain he is the man, from seeing him before—he blinded my face—I saw him as he caught hold of me, and I saw him as I lay on my back—thirteen or fourteen of them came round me—the prisoner knelt on my neek, and held his hands over my eyes, while the others ransacks me, he choked me so, that I could not breathe scarcely—mythings were all pulled down, and my breeches turned right over</p>

               <p>my heels—it was after they had done the mischief to me that they unbuttoned my breeches and stripped them down all over my feet—that would prevent my running—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1/4., 1 knife, a pair of scissors, and a tobacco-box, about me—I lost every thing; my from my breeches pocket, and the other things from my jacket pocket—I had no smock-frock on—I felt them fumbling in my pocket, and every thing was taken—no<lb/>thing was left in the road; they even took stick which I was minding my cows with—my neck was as black as it could be for a fortnight after<lb/>wards, with their kneeling on it—I never heard them speak at all—I got nothing back—I did not see the prisoner again till last Thursday, when I saw him in the New Prison, Clerkenwell—he was not shown to me—he was among a number of other prisoners, and I picked him out—the prisoners were all put in a line, thirteen of fourteen, and I picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol on the northern road. I know the park and the gate the witness speaks of—the parishes join there—I am not certain whether it is in one parish or the other just there—it is in the high road—the prosecutor gave me information on the morning this happened, and complained of robbed—he particularly described one man, and another as short chubby man, besides—in consequence of which, I gave him information of the prisoner being in custody—last Wednesday I went with him to the New prison, and told the Deputy-Governor my business, and a line was formed in the yard—the prisoner was near about the centre of the others standing with the other prisoners—as soon as the prosecutors saw him, he said, "That is him, the tall man in the smock-frock"—he picked him out directly—the prisoner did not hear what he said that I know of—he might be twenty yards from him—it was a little after one o'clock in the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Water-street, Bridewell. In De<lb/>cember last, the prisoner was treating with me for a house—he referred me to his friend, George White, of Essex-street, a barrister—the fixtures were to be included in the rent—there was a treaty about some furniture which came to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he first referred me to Mr. White as to his character, and proposed to take this furniture at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and to pay me by an acceptance of Mr. White's to that amount—I objected to make any application to Mr. White—the prisoner was to do so—I called on Mr. White on the 28th in consequence of the prisoner's direction for the acceptance—It was to be drawn by the prisoner—he refused to give it, and stated he had informed Mr. Cook he would not—I wrote to the prisoner on that day, and he came to me the day following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not have an interview first with Mrs. White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she came into the room before I left—Mrs. White said, "You will certainly not accept a bill, not recommend that man"—but I should say that Mr. White had declined the acceptance before Mrs. White came into the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell me, that Mr. White was indisposed when you first called, that there was no fire in the first-floor office, and Mrs. White came and asked you up stairs, and she would introduce you to Mr. White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not one item of what you have stated is true, she did not do so, nor did I tell you so—the servant introduced me up stairs—this is my hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)" 2, Water-street, Bridewell Precinct, December 22nd, 1835. Sir, Mr. Leblanc, who is the superior landlord of the house, No. 2, Tudor-street, has this day made inquiries of Mr. White, and is sa<lb/>tisfied with his statement as to your respectability, and I have therefore directed the notice "To let" to be taken down, Mr. Leblanc is going out of town on Thursday, in the middle of the day, it is therefore desirable, with a view to immediate possession, that the agreement with his as to rent, fixtures, &amp;c., is completed at the latest on Thursday morning.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. A</hi>. Do you remember calling at her lodging at one o'clock the following morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The morning I called at her lodging I think was the latter end of October—I found you, and her, and her child in bed together between one and two o'clock in the morning—I think it was some where out of the York-road—I have never seen it since—you had the appearance of a man coming out of bed—you had your coat and trousers on—I said, "Here is a sovereign for Mrs. Cook"—I went up stairs and saw the lady and her child in bed together, from which you had come shortly before, no doubt—I do not think there was any thing the matter with the woman—I did not give her any medicine—under any pretence—you did not tell me there was a disease in the <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect asking me if I would be kind enough to procure a more convenient lodging nearer to you, and if I would let you know where it was you would feel obliged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said any thing of the kind, I believe you brought the woman to the neighbourhood of my chambers for the pur<lb/>pose of extortion—I did not meet you night after night in the street—I went to meet you one night at the corner of Earl-street, I did not find you there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I met him every other night, and he handed me from 2 to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the purpose of carrying this poor woman through her abor<lb/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It is utterly false—I did not visit her with you in the charac<lb/>ter of a physician—I do not remember your calling in a Mr. Hart, a surgeon accoucheur—you once sent me a prescription which I could not read, not understanding medicine—I burnt it—I remember on the 1st of last March giving her 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to convey her home to her mother in your presence—I said I would pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the child, not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I did not advise you to try and get an appointment under Col. Evans, you said you were going to Spain, and I wrote to him—you did not call and say you would go if I would furnish you with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the medical bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember accepting a bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which not being honoured I was arrested on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe you were arrested—I told the attorney you were not worth arresting—you told me the writ was issued—I remember writing a letter to Mrs. Woodhouse—I promised when the bill was cashed to remit the difference—the document I indorsed was for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believe it became due on Saturday—I believe it was presented—a man of the name of Wettenholm came to me to accept for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you, and to take your counter acceptance—of course I refused. I would not have accepted the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I returned from the country (I was at Maidstone)—I found the party in question was pregnant—I asked her by whom—she said, "Mr. White, of King's-Bench-walk, Temple"—I requested her to make him acquainted with her situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you happen to know when she was delivered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On February the 7th, 1834—I was told so by the prisoner; and before the end of that month I made a contract to pay them 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in that case they should keep the child—I said, "Rather than have the thing made public, or go before the parish officers, I will pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—and before I left for the Spring circuit of 1834, I paid the prisoner the balance of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he pro<lb/>mised I should never hear any thing more of him or the child—In March, 1835, I paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the representation of the woman and the prisoner, that she was to return to her friends at Aylesbury—and that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to enable her to do it.</p>

About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 13th of January, I saw Ebdon come in and look round the warehouse, and into the counting-house; seeing nobody, he went to where the figs were, and took one drum off a pile—he then turned and took another drum off another pile—the other prisoner was standing inside the door, against the scales—I arose from my hiding-place—Ebdon saw me and dropped the figs—I got between them and the door, and stopped them from going out—they were given into custody—they were both strangers.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carman, and live on Dowgate-hill. On the 12th of January, I went to an alamode-beef shop in Butcherhall-lane—I had a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Greenwood and Co. On Glyn's—I went to the shop about one o'clock, and came away about half-past one—I did not miss the cheque till about an hour afterwards—I instantly went to.</p>

                  </hi>, I am clerk to Mr. Allsup, who lives is St. Paul's-churchyard. I know Walters, by his being in our employ from Saturday at twelve o'clock till Tuesday at dinner-time—on Tuesday, the 12th of January, I went to the alamode-beef house in Butcherhall-lane, with Mr. Allsup, junior, and Walters—it might be about ten minutes after one o'clock—I picked up a soft piece of paper from the ground, which I afterwards discovered to be a cheque, and passed it to some gentlemen on the right of me sitting in the room—they asked to look at it, and examined it—there were several gentlemen in the room—one advised me one thing and another the other—at last they said it would be better for me to leave my address with the parties in the house, and keep it in my possession—I left my card at the bar, and brought the cheque away—after leaving the eating-house, I went back again to St. Paul's-church yard—I became un<lb/>comfortable at having the cheque, and Mr. Allsup persuaded me to send or take it back—Walters said, "If you will give it to me I will take it back, I will not be five minutes"—I gave it to him to take back to the alamode beef-house, and leave it there, and bring me my card back—I did not au<lb/>thorize him to take it to the bankers and receive the money, I had not the least idea of that—I understand he returned in about a quarter of an hour, but I saw no more of him myself till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Walters. Q.</hi> Did any body in the eating-house make a remark about advertising at in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection—I believe Allsup told me to cross my card—the gentleman on my right advised me to leave my card—my name was printed on the card, and I wrote my address in pencil—I believe I found the cheque before the dinner was brought in—we were in the house half an hour or more—it was said by some gentle<lb/>man, that it was as well as know who was the drawer of the cheque, and we went out there was no name on the cheque to whom it was payable—it</p>

               <p>had a number—we all went in the direction of the bankers—I went in my<lb/>self and learned the address of the drawer—I did not give notice to the clerks that I had found a cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not show the cheque to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I considered it to be more honourable to return it to the parties who drew it—I did not consider it right to show it to the clerks—I merely inquired the residence of the drawer, and got it, but I did not know whether it was on this side of the water or the other, and we all returned to St. Paul's-churchyard—I gave it to you to take back to the eating-house—I did not go to the drawer, I gave it into your custody, trusting to your honesty, as you seemed so anxious about my having it, and knowing your father was a most respect<lb/>able man in out employ till he died; and you were taken into the concern out of respect to your father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not take the cheque back yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You seemed so anxious to take it—I had no doubt Mr. Allsup would trust you with money—Mr. Allsup depended on you as well as I did—the coat you have on now I be<lb/>lieve was lent to you when you went to dinner, to appear respectable to go with as—the cheque was given to you before we went into Mr. Allsup's house, and you ran off in the direction of Newgate-street—Mr. Allsup and myself went into the premises—I made no remark about your hat—I did not give you my hat, because yours had a bard on it, or authorize you to take it off my desk—I know nothing about a disguise.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> did you not propose that subterfuge to me, to avoid further sus<lb/>picion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not if a man wants to go out he can always go with my permission—I did not give you a green handkerchief—you asked me what you were to get the plaster in, and I said, "There is a basin, take it"—I did not tell you to leave the coat with Mrs. Brown, in Carter-lane—I did not go with you to a public-house, in Carter-lane.</p>

"In a square"—he said, "Are you sure you found it?"—he said yes, he found it in a leather bag, with the guard twisted round it—he asked him what he wanted for it—he said he did not know, he would take any thing for it and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—Cockburn ex<lb/>amined it—he opened the case of it—there was some name at the back of the case—I asked him what name it was—he said it was nothing—the boy took the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went out of the shop—I asked Cockburn if the watch was a gold one—he said no, It was only a Bartholomew-fair one—I went out of the shop then—I said to Cockburn. "The boy was all of a tremble when he came up to "—he made no remark at that—Cockburn was present when the boy said he would take it to his mother—the boy said he would rather give the watch to the owner, if he knew who it was, than have the money—he said, the money was no good to him—I said to Cockburn, "Your wife will wonder where you got the watch from"—he said he would not say any thing to his wife—it would do for his little girl to play with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of young and Luxmore, pawnbroker's St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner came to our shop on the 21st of December, at near six o'clock in the evening and brought a gold watch to pledge—he spoke in French, and asked 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I lent him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I consider it worth that—I heard afterwards that the prosecutors had been robbed, and sent to them that evening—the last witness came to me and saw the watch—the prisoner was apprehended next day.</p>

"Have you got any more money about you?"—he said, "Yes," and took out eight shillings, and put them on the table—Mr. Symes called in White, and told him to take the money out of the cuff of his coat—he said, "Pray forgive me"—there were five half crowns and eleven shillings found in one cuff of his coat, and he took eight shillings out of one of his pockets—he said that was his own—he did not claim the rest.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 229. Kent-street, Borough, and am a shoe<lb/>maker. On Saturday, the 16th of January, I was in Newgate-market, and met the prisoner Collins about two o'clock—I I have known him for the last six or seven years—but I had not seen him before for eight or nine months—he said, "I wanted to see you, I was coming over this afternoon, or on Monday morning to see you"—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I have got some goods to sell that I think will suit you"—he is a sadler, and buys up old harness. and takes it into the country and sells it—he lived in the Borough-road four or five years ago—I asked him what goods they were—he said, "Some calf butts, and there is some what they call kip butts, and some what they call kip gray—are you a buyer?"—I said, "It depends upon the figure"—he said, "You can have them at your own price. or at any rate 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb. less than the cost prices—at what time will you be home?"—I said I should be home about four o'clock—he said, "I will be over about four o'clock at your house"—I left him there—I went was a man with me who has the care of a shop of mine—I went home and waited till four o'clock—he did not come—I went out about half-past four o'clock, and met him coming—we walked home together, and when we got home he pulled one calf butt out of his pocket, tied up in a handkerchief as a sample—I said, "You told me you had got some kip butts and kip grays"—he said, "The kip butts are sold, here is the sample kip butts and kip grays"—but it was not kip grays—I asked him what he wanted for the calf butts, and how many there were—he said, six dozen and they were worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb,—I said, "They are not worth that to me—I can't give more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—he said. "We can't take that for them"—he was going to take it away—I said, "You may as well leave that with me—I will cut it up, and If it turns out better than I think it will, if you come over on Monday morning, I may be able to give you a little more"—he said, "I can't leave it with you"—I said, "Well, but we will weight it, and I will pay you it at the rate of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb., the price you ask, and I will cut it up before you come over on Monday morning"—I sent my son out to get it weighted—it weighed 1 lb. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he he then went away, and took with him the cordovan shank. which he called kip gray—on Monday he came over again about twelve o'clock—he then pulled out of the kip butts, which he told me on Saturday were sold"——I looked at it, and saw the mark was nearly taken out, but I could see where it had been—I said, "You told me on Saturday these were sold"—he said, "I thought they were"—I then asked what he wanted for them—he said. "We think they are worth as much as the calf butts"—I said, they were not—I would give from 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to or 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—he said, "will you give any more for the calf butts!"—I said I could not give more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "What will you give for the kip grays?—will you give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb?"—I said, "Yes, I will give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, for that"—this was about 12 o'clock—he was to come again on Monday evening at eight o'clock—I was at home till eight o'clock. but he did not come I went over to the public house, and left word</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010057"/>
               <p>that I was over the way at the Artichoke—he came about half-past eight o'clock—I heard him ask the landlady for me—I went out, and asked him to come into the parlour—he said, "I have got a female with me. I can't"—I said, "Ask her in"—he came in with the female, and sat in the parlour—he said, "Well, you are to have the kip butts at your own price, (whish was from 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) and you are to have thirteen of the calf butts at your price. (which was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per lb.) and you are to have the kip gray at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he said, there might be from 30 to 40lbs. weight of it—I said, "Well, but Collins, you told me there were six dozen of the calf butts, and now you tell me there are thirteen—I suppose you have picked out the worst of them"—he said, "No, that is not it, when you have got these, and we find it is all right you will have the remainder"—we sat there talking, and he said, "If you and your son were to buy 60 or 70lbs. of goods, if they came in this way (<hi rend="italic">crossing his fingers</hi>) you could cut them up in one night"—I said, "Yes, I dare say we could"—he asked what time I should be home the next day—this was on Monday evening—the goods were not brought at this time—I forgot to mention that when he bought the kip butt as a sample, I wished him to leave that in the same manner as he had the calf butt, and said we would weigh it, and I would pay him for it—he said so, he would not leave that, unless I would cut it up in his presence, while he waited, which I declined to do—on the Monday evening, I asked him when he would bring the goods over—he said, when would it suit me, I said, "To-morrow, at twelve o'clock"—and about half-past twelve o'clock he came with a truck, and another man drawing it—previous to that I had been over to Mr. Newen, who sent two officers with me, and we put them in the Artichoke parlour till the prisoner and the man came with the goods—the truck was loaded up apparently with old traces, and old chaise aprons—I had a customer in my shop, who had come from the coun<lb/>try—the prisoner said to me. "Who is that man?"—I said, "A cus<lb/>tomer of mine, it is all right, bring them in," and he said directly, "You see I have brought this old harness"—(I had bought old traces of him before, but not at that time)—I told him to bring it in, and he took it through the shop—the goods were done up in old harness, and con<lb/>cealed—they were in three different parcels covered up in old leather—he took them through the shop into the room where I keep my leather—as soon as the leather was in, I shut the door, and said to Collins, who was in the shop, "Come over the way and I will pay you," and we went to the Artichoke—I had not undone the parcels not seen the inside of them—as soon as they came over the way, I gave both the men in charge of the officers—I was present afterwards when the officers unpacked the parcels—this is a part of what was in the parcels—it has my mark on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went with another officer to the Artichoke public-house—we waited there about half an hour—the prisoner came with another person, and page said, "These are the men, I give them into custody"—I searched Collins, and asked him where he lived—he said, "In the City"—I said the City was a large place, whereabouts there!—he said again, "The City"—I said, "If you do not choose to tell me I shall not ask you any more"—he then said he lived in Gunpowder. alley, Shoe-lane, No. 10. or 9—I then said it was my duty to ask him how he came in possession of this leather—he said a man had met him on the Thursday previous, as he was coming out his house, about the middle of the day, and asked him if he dealt in harness and leather—he replied, "Yes"—I asked him if he knew the man, and where he lived—he said he did not know any thing about him—he had never seen him be<lb/>fore to his knowledge—I asked the description of the man—he said "A tall thin man"—that he had got some leather to dispose of, and he called on the Friday, and brought him a skin, and on the Saturday he brought the whole of the leather in a sort of chaise cart in two black bags—I said. "Would a man leave that quantity of leather with you without your knowing any thing at all about him?—he said, "He did leave it"—I took the men and the leather in a hackney-coach to Guildhall, and then went and searched the prisoner's house, in Gunpowder-alley, and in the upper room I found two calf butts in this handkerchief, two black bags, and a great deal of old harness leather, which we did not meddle with—the other prisoner was discharged—I found this chisel which corresponded with the marks on the desk which was broken open in the prosecutor's ware house; but it was in a place where the prisoner works with these tools, and he being indicted for receiving I did not mention this—this is a common piece of iron, and the other seems a sort of screw-driver—these were not by themselves, but tucked in a piece of leather by the side of the window, where there were awls and things of his trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live in Salmon-lane, Lime house, I was at the King's Arms on the 8th of January, from seven to eight o'clock—I saw the prosecutor in the parlour intoxicated—the prisoner was there when I went into the parlour—the prosecutor had been exhi<lb/>biting his back, and said something about flogging—I sat down, and had a glass of half-and-half—the landlord found that the prosecutor was in that state that he did not like him to he in the parlour—he was called on to pay his reckoning. and had no money—the landlord threatened that be would not let the prisoner quit the house till he was searched—he at<lb/>tempted to leave, and refused to be searched—I stopped him as I was at the bar two policeman then arrived—he had struck me on the side of the head with his fist—I cannot say whether it was clenched or not—then a party coming by called in to have half a pint of porter, and seeing me ill-used, forced the prisoner into the tap-room—he went into a corner, and seated himself in the further box, where he took out of his pocket, some pieces of paper, one of which was 65 note—I saw the word "five" written on the note, but I could not see the number he then tried to destroy a paper. and was stopped by Mr. Robey at the tire-place.</p>

I went to the beer-shop on the 15th January—the two prisoners went to purchase a board to repair the tap-room, and it was put up by Wright—I afterwards went up stairs with Wright, and he said there was a box full of clothes there, and asked me how we were to get rid of them—I told him I did not know—I would have nothing to do with them—he did nothing to the box in my presence—I did not see it lifted up—I do not know whether it was open or shut—he said if I would go into the next court he would throw them to me—I said I would have nothing to do with it—I went down and sat there till I was turned out—I thought I should get knocked about if I spoke of it—I was turned out with the rest afterwards, for making a disturbance with a man of the name of Roberts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Welchman. I was on board <hi rend="italic">The President</hi> from New York to England—I knew the prisoner, and the carpenter—I was present on the Saturday evening in question—about supper time—the first I ob<lb/>served was the carpenter asked the prisoner, how much money he had spent that day—he said 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the carpenter held 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his hand, and was going to bet him he did not spend it, for he had not 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to spend—Antonio said he had, and called the carpenter something out of his name—I forget what it was—the carpenter then got up and struck him—that was the first blow between them—they fought for a little white—it was a fair fight—the carpenter had the best of it. he asked Antonio if he had had enough, and he said, "Yes"—I heard Antonio <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "You villain, you are biting my finger"—the fight was over then, and the carpenter had gone aside—Antonio was just by the scuttle—he then said, "You have bit my finger," Or some thing, which I did not exactly notice—the carpenter asked him two or three times whether he had had enough, and he said, "Yes"—they were both on their feet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said when he said he had had enough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The carpenter dropped him and went to his supper—they left off—the carpenter went</p>

               <p>and sat on his chest, getting his supper—Antonio was standing between the bits on the scuttle—they were about five feet from one another—An<lb/>tonio was cursing and swearing by the scuttle—he was in a great passion at that time, and said he would fight him next morning, or else kill him that night—I cannot say who began the second fight, for I did not notice—I saw them giving blows to one another—I was standing on the chest to get out of the way—they both appeared to be in a passion when the second fight began—Antonio was lying on his back on the chest, and the carpenter had his hand on him, but did not strike him—the carpenter got up and left Antonio, and went and leaned his head on his bed-place, on his arm—Antonio got up and sat a little while on the chest, just the same as if he was considering, and then he got up and stabbed the carpenter—he was considering a very little while, no time I might say—it might be a minute, but I cannot say—the light was very dull, but I saw the knife shining in his hand, and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "The vil<lb/>lain has got a knife in his hand"—and before I spoke the word the car<lb/>penter was down—I said, "You have stabbed the man"—he said, "No, I have not stabbed him"—I and another man lifted the carpenter up, and overhauled his right breast—the prisoner delivered his knife to Taylor, who put it in his breast, and ran for assistance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>.) In defending myself from this serious charge, I have no contend against overwhelming diffculties. But, before adverting to those difficulties, I would earnestly implore you to banish from your minds all prejudice arising from the character too generally en<lb/>tertained of the dispositions of my countrymen, and not allow that feeling at all to bias your decision. An Englishman can produce his kindred and friends to prove that his actions have ever been controlled by a kind and humane heart; but I stand before you a friendless outcast, far from all friends and kindred, a stranger in a foreign land, and one who, but for the humanity of the most worthy Sheriffs, would have been here without the means of defence. But I feel confident that, after hearing the few remarks which I have to offer, on the cruel treatment I have received from the de<lb/>ceased, you my Lords and Gentlemen, will award me justice. I com<lb/>menced my career in the Portugese navy; and having faithfully served my country, obtained my discharge. I then entered the merchant ser<lb/>vice; and having sailed since then, on board the shipping of almost every country, I about two years since engaged myself in an American ship, called the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi>. of the line of packets, sailing between Liverpool and New York. I remained in this ship for two voyages; and having conducted myself to the satisfaction of my officers, I sailed in another American packet, called the <hi rend="italic">St. Andrew</hi>, on the same station. With her I remained also for two voyages, and then unhappily engaged myself to the packet-shop, <hi rend="italic">The president</hi>. Thus you will see that I have conducted myself to the satisfaction of my superiors. On Saturday, the 16th, we knocked off work about six o'clock, and went into the forcastle to get our supper. In about half an hour, the deceased and I began to joke as to which had spent the money. We continued our joking some time, until the deceased became angry, and some hard words passed between us. He told me that I was a liar; and on my answering him, that I was no liar, he struck me. I returned the blow, and he fell on his chest. I then said I had fought enough, and I did not wish to fight again; but, on ris<lb/>ing, he turned his sleeves up, and began to strike me. I returned the blow; he caught my hand, forced my fingers into his mouth, and bit them violently, whilst he heat me with the other hand. I called to him to let go of my fingers, but he still held them fast for some time. I called to him again, and he then released them; but, at the same instant, suddenly seized me by the throat, and <hi rend="italic">pinned</hi> me against the side of the forecastle. He grasped me with such force, that I was almost strangled, and called to him several times, but in vain, to release his hold. I urged him again and again to loose his hold, but he still held fast; and having my ship-knife by my side, (a knife worn by all seamen on board of American ships.) I drew it from the sheath, and was so overcome with rage and pain, that I cannot remember what followed. Gentlemen of the Jury, since then I have never ceased deeply to lament my conduct, and have not had one moment's comfort; for I was on friendly terms with the deceased, and entertained towards him no feelings of malice or revenge. Indeed, we had always been the best of friends; and none of the crew can regret his death so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010103"/>
               <p>deeply as I do. But, Gentlemen, do not, I beseech you, forget, that at this time I was suffering the most brutal treatment from him. I was pinned against the wall, and throttled almost to suffocation; my fingers were nearly bitten off; my check was dragged till the flesh almost gave way; blows were inflicted when I could not defend myself; and yet seven or eight of this American crew, (four of whom are witnesses against me,) calmly witnessed the scene, and refused me their assistance. And here I may be allowed to remark, that, in addition to my other misfortunes, I am unable to express myself intelligibly in the English language, and there<lb/>fore liable to be misconstrued or misunderstood. Gentleman, let each of you imagine himself in the midst of foreigners, treated thus brutally, and no one offering the least assistance—aching with pain—sinking almost with suffocation—and yet deserted in this dastardly manner by all his ship<lb/>mates; and would there be no palliation, if, in this moment of passion and suffering, you inflicted a fatal wound? I solemnly assure you, that the witnesses against me have misrepresented the facts, and that my statement is true; and yet I can produce before you no evidence to support it; for though there were other persons present, besides those examined, they have all left England, and returned to America.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of St. James's Infirmary. I was called on to examine the person of the deceased, on Monday, the 18th of January, in Angel-court, King-street, St. James's, by desire of Sir Na<lb/>thaniel Conant, to ascertain whether he was in danger—I found him free from any symptom of injury of the brain at that time—his functions were all performed—he was free from head-ache—he slept well the previous night, and took nourishment—I understood he had received a blow on the head on the Saturday night previous—I examined the wound—it was of a very triffling nature, and nearly healed—it was on the back part of the head, on the left side—the skull was not depressed, that I could discover—it was a small wound—the man was about sixty years of age, neither spare nor robust—he was sober when I saw him—I reported to the Ma<lb/>gistrate, that there was no reason to apprehend any danger from the injury he had received—I was called to see him again on the Thursday following, being informed he was still ill in bed—I went to see him in his own house, and saw he was affected with symptoms which I referred to an injury of the brain—there was a dryness of the tongue—his mind was quite ra<lb/>tional, but he was in a low condition, his pulse depressed, and he had not much nervous energy—I consider those symptoms were connected with a blow he had had on his head, and then thought them of a dangerous na<lb/>ture—I recommended them to apply for admission into St. James's Infir<lb/>mary, but application was not made—I considered his case of so much danger, that I recommended the overseer to send him to the Infirmary, but he was taken to St. George's Hospital—I never saw him after the Thursday—he was not in a state of <hi rend="italic">coma</hi> when I last saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought there on Thursday afternoon, the 21st of January—he was in a very low, depressed state, and gave me an account of having received a fall on the Saturday previous—I ordered him to bed directly, and he shortly recovered from the state he was in—he was perfectly sen<lb/>sible—he complained of no pain in his head—there was no external wound, but an appearance where a wound had been there was no appearance of fracture of the skull—I saw him about two hours after and ordered him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010105"/>
               <p>some medicine—he said he was much better—I saw him again about twelve o'clock at night—he was rather worse, wandering and delirious—I ordered him medicine—he had a very quiet night, and awoke better in the morning—about eleven o'clock he was suddenly seized with symptoms of pressure on the brain, and died in about an hour and half—he was examined next day—I found a large quantity of extravasated and coagulated blood on the surface of the brain, and in the brain—on removing the membranes I found a small fracture at the base of the skull—that was quite sufficient to cause his death—the fracture might have been caused by the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the appearances you found after death, in your judgement, suf<lb/>ficient for you to ascribe his death to what produced the fractured skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my opinion—it is possible he might have died from other causes, but there was quite sufficient in my mind to account for his death—the pressure on the brain occasions the injury—but in this case the frac<lb/>ture did not press on the brain, but the coagulated and extravasated blood did, and that occasioned the pressure—the extravasated blood was not in the seat of the fracture—I cannot exactly ascribe the extravasated blood and the pressure, to the skull being fractured—the concussion from the fall might rupture the vessel, and the skull have nothing to do with it—I ascribe his death most probably to the fall, but the fracture alone was not sufficient to cause death unless there had been the rupture of the vessel, and that was too far removed from the fracture to have caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you right, you ascribe his death in the pressure of coagulated blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—independent of that fall, the fracture was at a distance—I could not ascribe the pressure of the blood to the fracture.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hearing he was in liquor very much that night, suppose he had made, under the influence of liquor, any violent exertion himself, might it not have produced the coagulation of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so; and he might have had a fit of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any difference in the appearance of extravasation, when death is caused by apoplexy, or from intoxication? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he would be more likely to have apoplexy if in liquor—it is impossible to decide whether the rupture was brought on by his drinking improperly, or by the fall—a fall sufficient to cause fracture, might have been sufficient to cause a rupture of the vessels—I cannot undertake to say, but the inclination of my opinion is, the fall was very probably the cause of the extravasation; but still, apoplexy might arise without that—if he had been visited with apoplexy, symptoms of sickness would of course ac<lb/>company it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister of the Inner Temple. I was a passenger in the "Emperor" on the night of the 30th of January and heard an alteration between two persons at the Angel—I believe it to have been between the two drives of the "Emperor" and the "Dart"—the "Dart" started frist, but I think had not got bayond the horses heads of the "Emperor", when the "Emperor" also started, slowly at first, but as soon as the horses got into a trot, in my judgement, we went at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—all I observed with respect to the "Dart "was it proceeded a few yards, we then passed it, and there appeared to me no effort on the part of the driver of the "Dart" to race,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010126"/>
               <p>and I did not notice it afterwards—after proceeding four or five hundred yards (I cannot say whether it was opposite Penton-street or not,) there was simultaneously a breaking in of the glass of the fore window, and at the same time a passing over something the road—that was going down the hill—according to my judgment, we were then going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—in consequence of an observation made by a gentleman in the omnibus I looked out at the window of the door and thirty or forty yards behind the omnibus I saw something lying in the road—I could not discover whether it was a man or what—it was a beau<lb/>tiful moonlight night—I immediately desire the <hi rend="italic">cad</hi> in attendance to stop, and I believe all the passengers called to him to stop—the pace of the ominous was not slackened—we proceeded thirty or forty yards before it did stop and then it made a regular stop—I thing two passengers got out before myself, and went in a direction of the object lying in the road—I told the coachman to stop, and told him he had either driven over some<lb/>body or killed somebody—I cannot say what were my exact words—I insisted on his stopping at the same time called out for the police—a policeman came up at the instant and went towards the horses' heads, and desired the coachman to stop—I think the conductor told the coachman to go on, which he did immediately and galloped so fast down the hill, that sight and hearing—I was calling after it, "Stop him, stop him," and the policeman was running after it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker and live in Stan<lb/>more-street, St. Pancras-road. I was in the New-road near the Angel, on night of the 30th of January, and saw the "Emperor" and "Dart" going towards King's-Cross, at a very rapid rate, abreast—that was before they got to Penton-street—I had occasion to stop a short time, and lost sight of them, till I got to the Belvidere—I then saw them both driving down the hill at a very rapid rate, near the middle of the road, about theree or four yards from each other, as near as I could say—they were abreast of each other, but about two or three yards apart—I saw a horse standing in the middle of the road—I had seen nothing happen before that—that was as near the Belvidere Tavern railing as possible, nearly opposite the gas-lamp—the omnibuses wree about one-third down the hill at that time, going at a very rapid rate, indeed, a great deal faster than usual—but I am no judge of horses—I cannot say whether they were galloping or trotting—they appeared to me the racing, by what I could see—I saw a person lying in the middle of the road on his face—I directly ran and assisted in picking him up—the horse was about three or four yards from the gentleman—he was carried to a doctor's immedi<lb/>dely I assited aftwards in taking him to St. Bartholomew's hospital in a coach.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never saw him till he was at the office—none of the drawers were locked where the counterpanes were—I was not alone in the house that day—a woman named Atkinson was with me—she slept in the house on the 23rd of No<lb/>vember—she used to hold a situation in the Bazaar—nobody else was in the house to my knowledge—on the 23rd a young man named Goodwin called, but he only staid a few minutes—there was no man in the house on the 23rd or 24th—on man slept there—on my nobody but myself and Mrs. Atkinson slept in the house that night—there was no man in the house on the 24th—I never said there was.</p>

I bought it a few days ago"—he proposed to give a bill at four months of his own acceptance, for a carriage, which I declined—I saw him again on the 20th—I wanted another name on the bill—he then said he would not purchase, as he expected to receive his money is a short time, and he would have something for a month—he at first stated he would have a headed chaise, but I had not one to lend him—he then said he would have a cabriolet—I said I had one of them, and he selected one, which he hired at five guineas a month—our months consist of twenty-eight days—he came the next day, about twelve o'clock, I think, the 21st, and took away the cabriolet—he had a little boy with him in livery, who acted as his servant—some one had brought a horse which was there before the prisoner came—the boy had come before the prisoner to know where the cabriolet was, and they were trying the horse in it round the square—the prisoner then took the cabriolet away—I had not received any thing of him on account, neither money nor bill—it was on the faith of his being the proprietor of the handsome house and furniture which I had seen, that I allowed him to take the cabriolet on hire—I had not in any respect sold it to him—the purchase went off—he had stated that he wanted the cabriolet for the purpose of waiting on the gentlemen who were going on an excursion—I do not think I saw him again till the 28th of December, when he called again at Mr. Felton's, and said he had lent the cabriolet to the steward, but he did not say where the steward was gone—he had produced this paper to me, or one like it—I have no doubt it was this (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Excursion up the Mediterranean—A party of</p>

               <p>ladies and gentleman are about to proceed upon an excursion of pleasure up the Mediterranean, and parts adjacent; touching first at Gibraltar, and from thence, as may be agreed upon by a majority of the party. The vessel intended for the excursion is a fine frigate-built ship, with accom<lb/>modation for thirty passengers: fitted up with every comfort that can be obtained; as warm and cold baths, a piano, harp, a band of music, a ear<lb/>riage for inland parties, and a small yacht for shooting and fishing excur<lb/>sions—the tables will be covered in every respect and style, not to be ex<lb/>celled by a first-rate hotel or club-house, as neither trouble nor expense will be spared in the selection of articles of the finest qualities—the charge for passengers (80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each per month)will include all expenses on board, and allow them to indulge in every luxury—ladies and gentlemen desirous of visiting that delightful part of the globe, with advantages never before offered, will learn further particulars by application to Captain Tadman, 4, Westbourne-place, Eaton-square.</p>

Attenboroughs—my brother is here, who keeps that shop—he saw the prisoner that day, at Camberwell, at a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock—the prisoner was not in Shoreditch that day—my brother had a female servant at that time—his wife used to attend the shop—I was there because I was out of a situation, from February—I had been with my brother about four months—the 6th of May was my birth-day—I became of age that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Carey, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and am an appraiser, I was walking with a female in Southampton-row, Blooms<lb/>bury on the 26th of January—she had been drinking with me in the course of the evening, and fell down—I do not know how she came to fall—the liquor might take effect upon her in a short time—she received a severe injury—I got her up—the prisoner stepped up, and offered her kind assistance to take this woman towards my place, and after getting her home, and getting a bottle of vinegar, and bathing her face, and all that, she requested me to allow her to sit there till the morning, after I had given her a cup of tea, which was all that I had to give her—I did not wish either of them there—it was about half-past twelve o'clock when the accident occurred—I allowed the woman, and the prisoner to sit there—in the morning, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the back part of the prisoner, going out of the parlour door with the black coat and trowsers which I had worn the day before, the prisoner went with her—I did not see her carrying them away, but I saw her go—I got up the moment I saw the door shut, but could not find my trowsers, I went into the back room to get a pair—the sick person staid there till the next evening—I missed a mustard-pot cover, a handkerchief, and the other things stated—this hand<lb/>cover is mine.</p>

The prisoner came and offered these steps for sale, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., last Tuesday-week, the 26th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I said they would not fetch 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have known him in the neighbourhood about two years—he lives within twenty yards of my own house—Mrs. Edwards came over—I offered them to her for sale, and she claimed them—I told her who I bought them of—the prisoner is a brush-maker.</p>

I was going with my wife to the theatre on the Monday-week, previous to my selling them, and my wife and another girl kicked against the steps—I took them up—I could see nobody belonging to them, and took them home—I kept them till Tuesday-week, when having no money, and my wife being ill, I sold them to Mrs. Wilmot, who has been my landlady for twelve months—does it stand fessible I should sell them to her if I had stolen them?</p>

On the afternoon of the 27th of January, the prisoner Murray came to the shop, and offered to pawn a pair of new worsted stockings—I asked him who he pawned them for—he said, for his mother—on looking towards the window, I observed two or three boys waiting for him outside—I cannot say whether Hallisery was one of them—I said I must detain him—he said if I did I must pay him for his loss of time—when the officer came I gave him in charge, with the stock<lb/>ings.</p>

               <p>he threw it down, but I did not take any particular notice—I cannot say what became of the flannel—I never went to interfere or look after it—I saw nobody pick it up—It was dry on the pavement, as far as I can re<lb/>collect—I did not think of a robbery, or I might have stopped the boy—I know nothing of the prisoner—the next morning I called in at the Star and Garter public-house, close to Mr. Blake's, and heard of the robbery; and said, "Oh, that is something as I had seen last night"—the person who was talking of it said, a man was taken up for it—I said, "How can that be, if it is the same as I mean? I saw a boy bring a roll of flannel out, it could not be a man who stole it"—we almost got to high words about it, and left the house—accordingly on Thursday night the prisoner's friends, who I know nothing of, came to me, and said they un<lb/>derstood I had seen something of It, and would I come forward and state what I had seen—I said, "Certainly, If you think my evidence is of any use I will come up, without a penny or anything else—what I will do shall be voluntary, without interest, or friendship, or any thing"—I did not stay to look on when I saw this—I saw nothing to alarm the boy, to make him drop it—whether anybody pushed it out of his hands I do not know—whether the boy picked it up or not I do not know—it was as much as thirty yards off, no doubt.</p>

About two or three o'clock, on the 28th of Janu<lb/>ary, a neighbour opposite came and told me something, in consequence of which I missed a cheese—I had seen it safe hall an hour before—the prisoner was pointed out to me by somebody—I went and brought him back—when the prisoner was in the shop, he said, "I do not want to have any bother about it, I know where the cheese is; I will return it, and make you a handsome present"—I said I could not it, and gave him into custody.</p>

I opened the door and looked into the street—Beasley was standing outside on the pavement to the best of my belief—I turned towards the back-door, and saw the other prisoner in the back-yard—he came up towards me—I collared him, and asked what he did there—he said he was only in the privy—he had no right in my yard at that time of night—I kept him in custody, and called my son, who was in bed, in the one pair back-room—he came, and called an officer—I saw Beasley in custody about a quarter of an hour afterwards—both their hands had the marks of bricks and mortar and the black of the copper on them—I found the copper in the washhouse had been taken out of its place—I had seen it fixed at nine o'clock at night—I cannot swear to Beasley, but to the best of my belief it was him—it was a good distance for me to see.</p>
               <p>Beasley. He never looked at my hands—he says he saw me outside the door, and it is false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-case maker, and live in King-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner was my journeyman, and worked in my shop—on Thursday, the 4th of February, I gave directions to the prisoner to put some plates into some cases, two of which contained these brushes—I went out immediately after on business—when I came home, I sent for the cases to my counting-house—when brought to me I found no brushes in any I called Leech, and said, "Where are they?"—he opened a drawer, and gave me one set I said, "There were others in the other case"—he</p>

               <p>said, "There was not"—I sent him in the warehouse to see if the other cases were right—he came back and said they were—I sent for a policeman, and found four brushes, which are my property, in his great-coat pocket.</p>

On the early part of Thursday the brushes were taken out of the case by somebody—I immediately looked into the drawers adjoining to where the prisoner works, and found these four brushes, with four others, placed at the back of the drawer—no one else sits there—it was between three and four o'clock—about five o'clock, when he went to tea, I went to see if the brushes were in the name place, and found that four of them were removed into a drawer, to be put into the case, were put into a third drawer, under some carpet—the prisoner went out after that, about seven o'clock—I then went to the drawer, and found one set of brushes was gone—I communicated it to my employer—other persons had an opportunity of going to the drawers besides the prisoner, but we were never in the habit of putting brushes into them—he never went out of the shop, to go out of the house, without his great coat on—they must have been put in between five and seven o'clock—at the time I suppose the brushes were put there, I looked under his board, and found these three pieces of leather, and having a red-ink pen in my hand. I marked them—these three pieces were found on the prisoner, when he was taken to the station-house.</p>

I said to the prisoner, "Good God! Ma' am, what is the matter up-stairs? I cannot enter my room for the smoke"—her husband was sitting by the fire in the same room as her—she said, the room at times, with contrary winds, was apt to smoke; but I had been there eleven months, and never saw it—I went to Cartwright, to the public-house, and gave him his shilling—I came back a little before eight o'clock, and went up-stairs to bed—when I opened the door, there were flames of fire from the bedstead—the husband was at home then, and the prisoner also—I came running down stairs, and said to Mr. and Mrs. Fisk, "The place is on fire"—there were several people there being served—it is a chandler-shop—Mr. Fisk went up-stairs, and got pails of water—I went up stairs, and instead of going into the room which I told him was on flames, he burst open the other room door, and that was in flames also—I heard the prisoner say nothing, nor saw her do any thing—I got some water myself, and assisted in putting the fire out—I</p>

On Sunday night, the 10th of January, I fastened the house up, at about half-past eight o'clock—I locked the door—there is no back door—the window was fastened with a catch, and a nail put into the frame to keep—it together—I went to bed about half-past eight o'clock—there was nobody in the house, but my husband and myself—we both went to bed at the same time—say husband came down first in the morning, but he is not here—he is very ill—he went down about half-past six o'clock, and called me down—I came down directly after him, and found the street door partly open—the lock was not forced—on examining I found the window had been broken—the middle pane of the upper frame had been put in, and three pieces in the bottom pane were broken out to admit an arm to unfasten the window—it was perfectly safe when I went to bed—the window was shut down again, and the door open—before I went to bed I had put my son Jeremiah's shirt, which I had washed for him, on the back of a chair, towards the fire to air it—he does not sleep in the house—it was gone, and the provisions which I had laid in for the week were gone—there were two ounces, of tea, one pound of sugar, very nearly one pound of butter the best part of a half-quartern loaf, and about one pound and a half or two pounds of pork—they were taken from the cupboard, which was not locked I am sure they were they when I went to bed—I do not know where the prisoner lodged—he was sometimes at home, and sometimes not—a</p>

               <p>in, with pipes, without your observing them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nobody went in at the same time with Mr. Miles and myself—I found no female with a mug in her hand, as if served with beer—no female went out—I staid at the bar a minute and a half or two minutes, and after that went into the parlor—I had a view of the tap-room—there were no people there—the door makes a very great noise when it opens—it is in a dilapidated state, and tied at top and bottom—there is a stone flooring, and the bolt shoots makes a noise—I might not have heard that door open, if the parlour door had been shut, but I had the parlourd-oor in my hand, waiting for Mr. Cullingford to come down stairs, and in the situation in which I was placed I think the front door could not have opened without my seeing it—Mr. Cullingford came down stairs shortly, and we had some talk about the waistcoat—while we were talking, the pot-boy came to the room door, and told him it was near the time to open the house—I think he said it wanted about two minutes and a half to the time—Mr. Cullingford said. "Go up and look what o'clock it is, "and he went—Mr. Cullingford said, "We will not open the door, we had better be a minutes or two after than before the time"—there is a window on the staircase, which looks out on Trinity church clock—it would not he necessary to open the front door to see that—I and my friend stopped in the parlour a few seconds, and then came out of the parlour—the door was opened—it was then minutes past one o'clock.</p>

I produce a pair of hod-nail boots, which I found at the prisoner's house, No. 19, Surrey-road—the prisoner was in bed, and the shoes were by the bed-side—I told him I wanted him for receiving a pair of boots of Mr. Matthews, knowing them to he stolen—he said he had bought them if Freeman, and given 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—Freeman was present at the time, and he contradicted him, and said he had not given him any money, but he was to give it him on boxing-day—I took the prisoner to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You cannot expect that these boys will tell the truth, when their master came into the prisoner and gave them halfpence not to tell the truth.</p>
