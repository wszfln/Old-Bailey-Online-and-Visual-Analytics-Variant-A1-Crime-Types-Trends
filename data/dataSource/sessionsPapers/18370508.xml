I have known the prisoner for years—he lives near the Three Pigeons at Stratford, in a house of his own—nobody lodges or lives with him—he is carpenter—I went to his house, on a Monday in April—I do not recollect the day of the month—I think it was the beginning of April—I think it was between seven and tight o'clock in the morning when I went—I went to clean his house—he came for me—I was there all day—he asked me to lay there—I told him I did not mind stopping of a day for him, and doing for him, and answering the gate, but I did not like to stop all night—me asked me to stop all night—he said I should not go back again—this passed between six and seven o'clock in the evening, when I wanted to to home—1 had dined with him between twelve and one o'clock—he had been out in the afternoon—he was tipsy when he came home, but not very tipsy—he insisted on my staying, and I staid all night, and slept, with him—he got up about six o'clock on Tuesday morning, and went to his work—his work was out of doors—he came in about eight o'clock to breakfast—he did not say any thing till dinner time—I told him then that I wanted to go home to see how my father was—he said I should not go home—he Liked about taking medicine is the afternoon—he did not do any thing to be that day—I staid Monday night and Tuesday night with him—on the Tuesday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he said he was going own the yard—he went down stairs, and came back directly after—I said him, "You have not been down the yard"—he said, "No, it was too cold"—he said nothing more to me, but he cut my throat—I did not see my thing in his hand—this was between twelve and one o'clock in the right, between Tuesday and Wednesday—I was in bed—there was no light the room—I had not been asleep—he cut my throat across the front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Stratford. I was called on Wednesday, about one o'clock in the morning, by a horse-patrol—I found the prosecutrix in one corner of the room leaning against the wall—the blood was trickling from her throat down her fingers—I went towards her, and the watchman appeared to think she had done it herself—I saw, from the nature of the cut, that she did not do it herself—the prisoner was laying on the bed with his throat cut—his was the worst cut of the two—his windpipe was considerably divided, nearly half of it—he was not able to speak, but fearing he might die, I questioned him—I had the prosecutrix removed to her mother's residence, and attended her there—she is not in any danger now—I attended her nineteen days—I also attended the prisoner till he was capable of being removed to Ilford prison, which was also nineteen days—I did not see any symptoms of insanity in his conduct—I observed that he was not drunk on that night, and made the remark to the constable—I did not sew up his wound—it was sewn subsequently, in consequence of his tearing it, but at that time I only approximated it by means of pillows—he separated it on the Sunday, and it was then sewn up, and I had a strait-waistcoat put on him, to pre<lb/>vent his doing further mischief—I did not do that under the impression of his being insane—he had been from the Wednesday to the Sunday before he pulled the wound open—when he was able to articulate I did not observe any symptoms of madness in his conversation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. On Easter Monday, the 27th of March, I was going through Clapham New Park, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and a man came running to me with a heavy step—he met me—he seized me by the left arm, and seized my bag, but did not take it—I resisted—I had the bag on my left arm, it was a reticule bag—he put his other arm round me and held me tight, and said, "I want your money"—(I had said nothing more to him than, "What do you mean"?)—I said, "I have no money"—he said, "No money"? most emphatically—he came round behind me and clasped me with both arms—he felt round me for my pockets, and felt my watch, in a little pocket, fastened to my stays, under my dress—he put his hand under my dress, and found the pocket-hole—he tore the watch off by main force, upon which I uttered a shrill shriek—he tore the pocket and all off my stays—it was stitched on—it was a plain gold watch, which I have worn for many years—when I tried to shriek, he said, "Ah, do that again, and I will do for you"—and he brought an instrument round to my throat, and held it there for the space of a moment—I saw him afterwards suspend the watch for a moment in his hand—I saw the left side of his face for that instant—I did not minutely observe it, but his dress and person were remarkable—I had not seen his face before that time, for I was carrying a parasol before me, which prevented my seeing it at first—he had examined my glass before I felt him pull it out of my girdle—he returned, cut the string off my neck with the instrument he held to my throat, I suppose, and took off the glass—he came and took my bag after all, then touched my left shoulder, and said, "Now you may go on, don't make a noise"—he stopped for a moment to look forward, as if to see if any body was coming, and I saw the other side of his face completely—he had his hat on—he was in a dark coat, fastened in front, and drab-coloured trowsers—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner Young</hi>)—I have since seen the watch at Turner's the pawnbroker's—I had no opportunity of observing his front-face—I am positive he is the man who robbed me—I was calm, because I did not understand it at first—I have felt very much more since it happened, and have been very unwell—I felt some alarm and fright, and I felt much distressed about the man—I did not feel uncertain about his being the man—I had never seen him before—he was brought to me on the Saturday following by a policeman—I was then certain of him, but I felt such dreadful terror at identify<lb/>ing a man, and he perhaps being hanged through it—I was in a dread<lb/>ful nervous state, and fetched out of my bed to see him—I felt dreadfully nervous, and 1 therefore declined saying he was the man—I said I was afraid 1 could not say he was the man—I did not decidedly say he was not the man—it was not a taller man than him—that is the man who robbed me (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—he was brought again at my request, for I was extremely angry with myself at saying I could not say he was the man, when I found it would not be a hanging matter, and I went to the station-house in Scotland-yard, when he was taken a second time—I saw him before the Magistrate, and identified him the first time—that was</p>

               <p>last Wednesday fortnight, the 26th of April; but on the Saturday after the robbery I said I was afraid 1 could not identify him—I went to the Hall again last Wednesday, and knew him then perfectly—he is certainly the man—I did not see his front-face till he was brought to me—he is the man, I am positive of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>.

When I was taken up by the policeman, she said it was between one and two o'clock, and I told her I did not go out till between two and three—to-day she says it was between two and three o'clock—I was fetched out of the hospital, and brought to the lady, and she said I was not the man; that it was a young man about twenty years of age, rather taller than me, and no whiskers. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I said I dared not identify him—I guessed his age to be about twenty—I said nothing about his height—as to his whiskers, the hat might conceal them—I described his person at the request of the police, and said he was a middle size, rather short than tall—I did not see his whiskers—he was rather pallid, and I said I supposed he had not any whiskers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. She said I was not the man, and her sister gave me a shilling. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not say it decidedly, it is impossible—I did not say he was not the man—I did not give him a shilling, or desire any body to give him one—it was unknown to me—I did not see any shilling given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Young</hi>. The lady went to bed when she said I was not the person, and the policeman said, "I cannot detain him, then," and she said, "Oh, no, don't detain him." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not—the policeman had sent me word that ha could not detain him, before I came down stairs—I said nothing about his detention—I did not tell the policeman he need not detain him—I was informed he could not be detained unless I identified him.</p>

I apprehended Young on Saturday, the 1st of April, in Easter week—I told him I wanted him to accompany me to Brixton—he said, "No," and afterwards he said, "Yes"—I took him to Brixton station-house, and took him up to the prosecutrix's house on the same day—she was ill in bed—it was about half-past twelve o'clock—she came down, and saw the prisoner, and said he answered the description—he said he was innocent—she told him no, it could not be, for He was the man who had robbed her on Easter Monday—she asked him to turn side-face—he did so, and then she asked him to turn the other side-face—he did so—then she asked him to turn round with his back to her—he did so—then she said he was the man; but from the hesitation and fright, she said she should not like positively to swear to him, as she was so ill, and asked me if I could detain him—I said no, I had orders from the Super<lb/>intendent that unless she could identify the man, not to detain him—he again said he was innocent—the lady said she hoped he was, but she doubted it, for he answered the description in every point; and she said if there was any</p>

On the 18th of April two persons came to me—as near as I can speak, it was about half-past eight o'clock at night—it was dark then—I had a candle alight—they asked me if I had any nineteen-inch seating—I know one of the men perfectly well to be the prisoner Brand, and the other prisoner I know, though I will not take my oath to his features, but I will to his stature—I had not known Brandon before—they said, "Let us see what you have got"—I unlocked the room door, and shewed them a piece of seventeen inch, and twenty-four inch—I had no nineteen inch, and told them so—I kept my horsehair locked in a book-case in the room—I unlocked the book-case, and took it out before them—they both looked at it—Theodore said he had got a set of chairs to do, but they came to so much money, he would not have them done—they did not buy any thing of me—it was finally arranged that he was to call for the twenty-four inch in the morning, to have that instead of the nineteen-inch—I had an opportunity of seeing the persona of both the men—I stood alongside of Theodore, and had no opportunity of seeing his features; but the other was a good deal in the passage, and I thought be might be inclined to go up stairs, and I had a better opportunity of seeing him than the other—I swear to the height of Theodore, being every way the same—I will take my oath Brandon is the same man—after thy they went away—I lighted them down the court, and bolted my street-door, and went in and tried all the fastenings—the window, the book-case, and the escrutoire in this room Were all secure—the window-shutters were bolted inside—I cannot say whether the window-sash was fastened, but the shutters were bolted—I am certain the sash-window was down—I have a mode of sticking a piece, of wood in to fasten it, but whether that was in or not I do not know—I went up two Pairs of stairs after locking the room door, to go to my work—it then Wanted exactly a quarter to nine by my clock, and I think it was as nearly right as possible, it might be five minutes too slow—I was alarmed in about five minutes by a ring at the bell, and came down—I went to the street-door, unbolted it, and found several neighbours there, who gave the alarm of robbery—I did not see any body running away—in consequence of what I heard, unlocked my lower room door, and found my book-case forced open, the shutters were forced open, and the bottom sash thrown up—I found a piece of the twenty-four inch cloth standing up inside the room, underneath the ledge of the window that was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was one of the pieces I had been showing to the two men, and which I had locked up in the book-case—two chisels Bare picked up, and a bag, which did not belong to me, but I had seen it before—a man named Abbott, who works forme, used to bring that hag, and take his work home in it—he had lost it, and I was obliged to lend him one—it was not in the room at the time I was there before—I looked into the book-case, and missed a piece of twenty-six inch, about twenty-five or twenty-six yards long—there was a remnant with it, standing up by the side of it—It was lot rolled up with it—the remnant was also gone—the twenty-six inch piece was brought to me that night by Sarah Jennings, my daughter, in about a quarter of an hour—I have never seen the remnant since—the twenty-four inch and the twenty-six inch pieces were worth, as near as I can</p>

Brandon lodged in our house—I remember the 18th of April perfectly well—I went out about a quarter after seven o'clock that evening—Brandon was out then—my daughter, who is about eleven years old, went out with me—I returned at half-past eight o'clock myself, but I sent my little girl home about ten minutes before me—Brandon was at home when I got home, and my husband also—we went up stairs, about a quarter of an hour after I came home, into Brandon's room, and saw some shelves there—I remained there about five minutes—my husband went down first, and I went down within a minute or two of him—I left Brandon in the room, with his nightcap on—he is a married man—his wife lives with him, and they have got a little girl—he appeared to be about going to bed—the little girl went down to get the supper beer after that—I did not go out of the house after half-past eight o'clock—I was in our sitting room after leaving Brandon's room—I went to bed about a quarter past ten o'clock—our room is immediately below Brandon's—he could not pass without my seeing him—he did not leave his room that night—he was dressed in the same clothes as he is now, except his nightcap.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old; I am the daughter of William Chivers and his wife. The prisoner Brandon lives in our house—I used to work at the braid work—I have two sisters who have got places now—on Tuesday, the 18th of April, I remember going out with my mother, about a quarter after seven o'clock, I think, to buy a bonnet-shape—I went home first to take the bonnet-shape home, and then I went back again to my mother—I met her at the corner of Swan-yard, where we live, and we went together, to get her bonnet back again, which she had taken before, and she said she would not have it done—we went into Curtain-road, and then went home together—it was half-past by the Swan and Horse clock when we got home—when we got home I heard Mr. Brandon call out to my father and mother—he was up stairs—they went up—I am sure it was Brandon's voice I heard call to them, and I heard him cough—they re<lb/>mained up stairs about five minutes—my father came down first—my mo<lb/>ther stayed up about a minute longer, and then she came down after him—my father did not go out after that, while I was up, but I went to bed soon after my mother came down from Brandon—I should think it was about a quarter to nine o'clock when I went to bed—I slept in the next room to Brandon—the head of my bed was next to his room—I did not see him when I went up to bed.</p>

On the evening of the 29th of March, I saw the prisoner in Drury-lane, standing by a cookshop—I said, "You seem very cold"—she said, "I am cold and hungry too"—I said, "Well, step with me, I have got an old gown I will give you to wear"—she went to my house—I looked out an old gown and shift, and while she was putting those things on, I went to the cupboard, and cut her a slice of bread—I told her to sit by the fire, and warm herself; and while she was eating the bread, I said, "You can go and get yourself something to drink,"—I gave her a shilling to</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Liverpool Terrace, and am a builder. I married the prisoner in October, 1827, in Bishopsgate Church, as a widow—this signature is the prisoner's—John Harding and my mother were present at the marriage—I can prove my mother's signature—I cannot speak to Harding's—I have no doubt that this signature of Ann Suannah Ayres is the prisoner's writing—we lived together for two years—she quitted me in my absence, and sold every thing, and left—I have never lived with her since—I directed her to be taken into custody on the 6th of April.</p>

Q.</hi> She sold all your furniture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was some<lb/>things left—she had no property whatever when I married her—I was a publican at the time—I think I continued so for twelve months after we were married—the house belonged to my uncle; and he, seeing my wife's conduct, wished me to leave—she was constantly drunk, and staying out at night—not all night—I treated her kindly—I knew a woman of the name of Bontain—I paid her husband some money, because he accused me of going to see his wife, previous to my marriage—he required 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me as a compensation, and, being poor and ill at that time, I gave it him—I never recollect a Dr. Newington attending my wife—I think I may swear it positively—I do not recollect that he ever attended her—a girl lived with us of the name of Guyer—I do not remember her taking a shirt up into my room, and then making a complaint—I mean to swear that—when I gave up this house I began my own business, as a plasterer—I worked as a journeyman—I never threatened the prisoner that I would bring my mistress, or her mistress to live in the house—I have known Mrs. Bowers since we have been searching for witnesses to prove this marriage—I did not hear her examined—I first knew her within this fortnight—</p>

               <p>it was on the 10th or 13th of April that the prisoner was examined, and it was since her examination at Hatton-garden, that I first saw Mrs. Bowers—it was about a fortnight ago, I should think—it was a week, at all events—I saw her at Hatton-garden first—I spoke to her on this business—that was the first time I ever saw her—I saw her about a week after, in the Hackney-road, at Mr. Webb's—I was in the house—I talked with her then for about a quarter of an hour over this business—I text saw her on Monday last—on these two occasions I spoke to her on this business—she might come to town on Saturday last, but she was in town before—I should think we were about twenty minutes in Hatton-garden—she let me know she was going into the country—I think it was to Reading, in Berkshire.</p>

About twelve o'clock at night, on the 18th of March, I was on duty in Lamb's-gardens, Bethnal-green—the prisoner Lee is a housekeeper there—I do not know what he is—a woman of the town was making a noise in front of his house, and he gave charge of her—she was taken to the station-house by two other police-men—she complained of ill usage from him—he had refused to admit her, and she broke his window—she said to him, "If you serve me out, I will serve you out; go and bring that stolen horse out of your stable, at the back of your house"—I had refused before that to take her, unless he went to give charge of her—he then said he would go and press the charge at the station-house—when they proceeded a little way, I left them with two others, and turned back—I knocked at the door of Lee's house, and Enever opened the door—I said, "Oh, Enever, I am surprised to see you here; I did not expect to see you here"—he said, "Why?"—I said the officers were after him a few days before, I heard, in a case of felony, and I said, "What is this about the horse?"—he made no answer to that—I said, "Let us see him?"—he took the light off the table, and opened a door at the back of the room which led into a stable—I there saw a bay mare—I asked him who it belonged to—"Oh," he said, "It is Lee's mare, which his brother lent him to work with"—I examined the mare particu<lb/>larly, so that I might look over the list of stolen horses in the "Hue and Cry," and then went to the station-house—I overtook the woman before they got there, but Lee was gone—after the woman was charged, I went back again to Lee's house, and knocked at the door—nobody opened it—I remained there about twenty minutes—I then went round to the back of the house, where the stable is—looked through a little window in the stable, and the mare was gone—I have seen her since, but she was in dif<lb/>ferent condition to what she was then—when I saw her in the stable, she looked as if she had not been groomed for some time, but I am certain it is the same one I have seen since.</p>

The prisoner was in my service in March, 1835—he absconded on the 11th—in consequence of information from Cobb, I went over to his lodging in Upper Ground-street, and found, among other things of mine, this goblet and glass—I never sold or gave them to the prisoner—I had two dozen of these glasses made on purpose for a tavern—it is an unusual size—I supplied one dozen, and kept the other in stock, and on examination I found I had only eleven remaining—I am quite sure I had twelve before—I compared this with the eleven—I have not a doubt of it—I had such an ale glass as this in my stock.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 26th of April, it was left with me, and at half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me for the loan of the keys, as he had forgotten to take out a parcel to take to one of the gentlemen—I went up stairs and brought him down the keys—he asked me to lend him a light, as he did not know justly where it was—I gave him a light—he returned in the course of five minutes, and brought me the keys and the candle—he bid me good night, and left his umbrella in my passage—I called after him, and said, "Sir, you have left your umbrella," and perceived a brown paper parcel under his arm—I cannot tell what it contained—it was about the size of a quartern loaf or a quartern brick—I did not take particular notice—it was more the shape of a brick than a loaf—he said he would leave his umbrella and call for it again—I saw no more of him till he was at the Mansion-house, on Friday last.</p>

                  </hi>.

This is a plaster of Paris mould for casting counterfeit sixpences—it has been used for that purpose, and has a counterfeit sixpence now in it, made of Britannia metal—a mould of this size would retain heat five or six minutes after it has been used, and if the coin remained in the mould, it would of course retain the heat considerably longer—the two sixpences produced by Dunkett are both counterfeit, and have been cast in the mould—neither of the three are complete—there is a roughness on the edge which should be removed with a file—the files produced would answer that purpose—they have white metal in them—here are two ladles and two broken spoons of a similar metal to the coin, and an iron spoon which appears to have been used to melt white metal—it has some now adhering to it—here is some plaster of Paris in powder, which is the material of which the moulds are made.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of John Smith, a surgeon, of Goswell-street. The prisoner Ellen was in my employment for nearly two years—I had very great confidence in her—she left about February, as she told me she was going to be married to a farmer in Yorkshire—I had missed an innumerable quantity of things for a year and a half—I spoke to her about the house-maid, and asked her if she thought she was honest—she said, "I don't think the does the thing that is right;" and I parted with her, when she had lived with me about nine weeks—she did not go to Yorkshire—the other prisoner who is her mother lived in Featherstone-street, not far from our house—I heard that the mother had removed, and in consequence of some suspicions, I went to a house in Somers Town, with a policeman—the prisoner, Ellen was there, and the mother came in while we were there—we searched, and I found a pillow-case, this apron, two pocket-handkerchiefs, nine towels, and other things—I have no doubt they are mine—Elizabeth said, before they were found, that they had nothing but what was their own, and I was welcome to search—when the things were found, she told me the sheet and the dimity were hers—I have not the least doubt that they are mine—they are almost all my own work—she said they were not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Weston-street, Pentonville, I never spoke to the prosecutor till last Sunday morning—when I asked him about the transaction of William Smith, whether he thought he was the person who cut it off—he said no, he did not think he was, because he was not the only person that cat beside him, and he should have been the last person, that he suspected had had it, or even the ticket, if he had not said, If you will give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will return it"—he said he had got his fellow-servant to go out to see if he could see William Smith, to tell him him to keep out of the way, as his master intended to have him taken up—he said he had the key cut off, by whom he could pretty well guess, but he did not think it was William Smith.</p>

On Sunday night, the 30th of April, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I left my cab on the stand, with the mare in the shafts, in Whitechapel—I went to get something to drink at a public-house opposite, and was absent about ten minutes—on my return the mare and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> were gone—I went on Monday to Flying Horse-yard, Lambeth-street, which is a very little way from Whitechapel, and found the cab there—I went the same morning, with the policeman, to the Green-yard, Colchester-street, and found the mare there, about 300 yards from the stand—the policeman found the bridle—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> is marked M.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Westminster. On the 24th of April I went to No. 34, St. Ann-street, Westminster, a little after twelve o'clock—Hall, Duke, and Ashton were with me—the street<lb/>door being open, I proceeded up stairs to the first floor, followed by Ash<lb/>ton and Hall—I found the room door fastened, and I tried to open it, but could not—Ashton broke the pannel of the door; and, with the assistance of Hall, we broke the door open—I found the bedstead placed against the door, and I saw Oliver shoving against the bedstead—I saw Birch run from a table to the fire-place, and with his left hand he put something into a pipkin on the fire, there being a brisk fire at the time; he had in his right hand this hammer, which he put into the pot, and it has now some white metal on it—at that instant I secured Birch, and put him into one corner of the room—after the other officers had secured the other pri<lb/>soners, I and Ashton began searching the premises—I took off the fire a pipkin nearly full of metal, in a fluid state—that was the pipkin that I saw Birch put something into a cupboard by the side of the fire—I found part of a mould, the impression being scraped off—I took a knife off the table which I have left at home—the prisoners were taken to the office in a coach—Ashton was inside the coach with me—Birch began a conversation with me, he said "Mr. Powell knows us very well, but he never had us</p>

               <p>for smashing," meaning passing counterfeit coin—I said, "You are en<lb/>gaged in a very bad business"—his answer to that was "Yes, it is no use our denying it to you, it is our living. I had rather such men as you came, than the Broadway people, for we shall have the truth from you"—while we were in the room, 1 saw Ashton turn some dirty water out of a pail, and in the pail he found three crown-pieces, with some small pieces of plaster of Paris mould—they were put on the hob to dry, being in a wet state—on one of the pieces I saw the date of 1818.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 11.) I accompanied Reynolds, and followed him up stairs—we attempted the door several times, and found we could not get in—I burst one of the pannels in, and got my head and arm in—I saw the bedstead against the door—Oliver had got his back against the bedstead, and his feet against the table, which was against the wall on the other side, pushing against it. I saw the prisoner Wood in a stooping position before the fire, trampling hard on something—I saw Birch take a quantity of crown-pieces and smaller coin from the table, and put it into a pipkin on the fire—I Found we could not get in,—I asked Reynolds to lend me his pistol, Which he did, and 1 said to the person inside, "I see what you are doing; if you do not desist this instant, I will blow your brains out"—the woman said, "It is too late, you are too late"—and Birch said, "Now let the b——s in, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, it is all right"—the door and frame and all then gave way, and we all got in headlong—the prisoners were secured—on a chest of drawers in the corner of the room, I found these four metal spoons, and on the hob these two small files, apparently with white metal in the teeth of them—there was a pail containing dirty water, tea leaves, and other filth, which I poured into a tub, and found in the pail these three crown-pieces in an unfinished state, and these three pieces of mould in a very wet state—I saw some letters on them, the letter G in particular—I placed them on the hob to dry, and while so engaged, with my back to the prisoners, Birch made a rush, though he was handcuffed, and, got the three pieces of mould and put them in his mouth—as soon as he had spat some of it out, he said, "It is all right, that has saved the <hi rend="italic">bellowsing</hi>, "meaning transportation for life—when we were in the coach, a person in the street called out "What have they got you for?"—Oliver answered, "Only for four <hi rend="italic">bulls;</hi> it is that b——y old Ross put them upon us—I had an order for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into the country."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-factor and farmer, residing at Layton-stone, in Essex. The prisoner Harden was in my employ—I observed that my horses looked particularly thin in April, and searched my corn bin, with my son, on Thursday morning, April 20th, about eleven o'clock—it has a division—one part was empty, the other had a sack in it—there are two keys to it, one kept by Harden, and one by myself—about a bushel of oats was in the sack, some white and some black—I measured them—I marked the sack, with a pencil, with two crosses on the letter "P"—the bin was locked up again, leaving the sack in it, as it was before—next morning we found a part of the white oats that had been given for the horses on the even<lb/>ing before by my son, but the sack was gone—I went to Harden, and asked what he had done with the oats that were in the sack the morning before—he said he bad shot them into the bin with the others, and part he had given to his horses—when I saw these oats the second time in the bin, I did not find any black oats there—we went to Hudson's—we did not find any thing there—we went to Sparks's with a search warrant, know<lb/>ing they were intimate—the constable found about the same quantity of oats as I had lost, and exactly the same sort, in a corn bin in Sparks's stable—he was in the yard—the constable asked if he would allow him to look over his premises, as Mr. Payze had lost something—he said, "Yes"—when he found the oats, he asked if they were mine—I said they were—he then said to Sparks, "This is a bad job; how did yap come by these?"—he said, "I don't know; I have not bought any"—he said he hoped Mr. Payze would not hurt him, but look over it—I have since seen the sack—I observed the same description of oats sticking to the sack as those found at Sparks's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 20th of last month I examined the corn-bin, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I found about a bushel of oats in a sack, and the other part of the bin had nothing at all—I measured the oats—there was about a bushel—they were white oats, with a few black ones—Lingard, my boy, came to me about twelve o'clock, for some corn for his horses—I sent about two pints of beans to Harden by him, and told him I would give him the rest of the corn in the evening—he came to me himself in the evening—I gave him two bushels of white oats, for the rest of the week, for his three horses—I had seen the bushel of white and black in the bin at eleven o'clock, and he sent the boy at twelve o'clock—that bushel was sufficient for the noon meal of these three horses—the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I examined the bin, and found in it a part of the two bushels I had given him the night before, but the bushel of oats that was in the sack was gone—I should think from two to three pecks of the two bushels were gone—there was no stint of the hay and chaff—they had as much as they pleased—about a peck of oats a day is given to each horse—they feed them when they please—the quantity that was gone of those oats that I sent in the evening, together with the beans, would be sufficient for the horses' food from that noon to the Friday morning, and it was rather more than we generally give—my father did something to the sack in the bin—it was found afterwards concealed behind the bin—I was present with my father at Sparks's, and saw some oats found there—they corresponded in appearance with those I saw in the sack at my father's bin—they were the same sort—he said he did not know how they came there, he had not bought any, and he hoped Mr. Payze would not hurt him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Pennington, the owners of Neckinger Mills. The Greenwich railway runs through their premises—on the 3rd of May, between four and five o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, my attention was drawn to a donkey-cart, standing not far from the gate, on the side of the arch, on the premises of the railway—I saw the prisoners, Maloney and Langham, in a hurried manner, throwing iron into the donkey cart—I stood some time and saw them loading it—Adams was standing at the top, watching to see if any body saw them—they looked at me at the time—I stood some minutes looking at them—when the cart was loaded, Adams came down and assisted in shoving the donkey off with the cart—all three gave a heave to shove the cart into the road—I followed them, and when I had got a little distance the cart stopped, and they appeared to be throwing something over the cart—an old basket and cloth was thrown over the iron—in consequence of this I gave informa<lb/>tion to Crook to follow and watch them—Langham returned after some time, and I gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>accompanied with a burning sensation in my stomach—I poured out ano<lb/>ther cup, but put it back and rang for the servant—she came up, and, I ordered her to take the tea away—I did not suspect any thing was the matter with the tea, but I thought I was taken suddenly ill—I went up stairs, and stopped some time before I went to bed—it was more than an hour or perhaps two, before I saw the prisoner again—I began to find myself ex<lb/>ceedingly ill—I rang the bell, and said "Ann, I am taken very ill, I think I am taken for death," and I wished her to assist me to bed—I found my head grow very heavy, I could not hold it up, I could not support it—I found I could hardly articulate a word when I went to speak, and when I at<lb/>tempted to get up off my chair I staggered very much, but I did not fall—I held by the table and went into the passage—I asked her if the back door was bolted—she said it was, top and bottom, and she ran and examined it—I then told her to see that the bolt of the front door was done, and desired her to lock it as well—I went and examined it and found it Was locked—I asked her to look at the clock, and she said it was nearly nine o'clock, about nine—I then told her, as I was so ill, she might as well retire early too, and put out the kitchen and parlour fires—I asked her to bring me up a few coals in the warming pan—we were then at the foot of the stairs, and I said might I depend on her to see that all was safe and then come to bed—she said I might—I then put my foot on the first stair, and nearly fell backwards—I screamed out, and said "Oh! 1 shall fall down and break my back"—she said "Oh no, you sha'nt, I will pot my hand to your back"—I then went up stairs, and as soon at she brought up the coals I shut my bed-room door, bolted it, and wound up my watch, and hung it in its place over the mantel shelf—I then got into bed with all speed, and after a few uneasy sensations I got into a profound sleep or swoon, and did not awake all night—I am gene-rally very wakeful—I awoke before six o'clock in the morning—1 was hardly sensible at first—my eyes were swollen, but in a few minutes I came to myself, and then found a small, green painted trunk, which usually stood under the bed, was standing by the bed side, partly from under the bed—it was not in that position when I went to bed—it had been under the bed—I got out of bed, and found the swing-glass on the floor, and my dressing-table removed from its place—I went round my bed, and found all the drawers, one above another, forced open—the bed-room door had been forced open—my dressing-table was standing outside the door on the landing—the drawer of it had been forced open and was out—it had been locked overnight—I lost two £5 notes, six sovereigns and a half, two half crowns, and two or three shillings, from that drawer—I then called to my servant as loud as I could, "Thieves, thieves! Ann, my house is broken open!"—I got no answer—I then called again, and said, "You can hear fast enough at another time, if you won't answer now"—I then went round-to the side of my bed, and partly dressed myself—I came back, and called to her again—she was then coming down the stairs, and had got very little on but her under things—I told her to go back and put her clothes on—we then proceeded down stairs together—I told her to run and see if all the doors were safe, and 1 went with her—she said they were all safe, and said, "I will be on my oath I fastened them"—I said, "I saw you fasten them"—they were still fastened—we went to the back door, and found both the top and bottom bolts as I had seen them the night before—we went to the front door, and found it locked and bolted—I came along the passage, and pushed open the parlour door—I found all safe there—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the morning of Monday, the 17th of April last, I went to the prosecutrix's house, between seven and eight o'clock—I examined the back parlour window, and found the shutters partly opened, about six or eight inches slid back—the center pane of the top sash was broken—it was a very small hole, about an inch wide—a hand could not be got in, and scarcely a finger—it was not large enough for a person to get part of their hand in and undo the fastening—I found some pieces of glass outside, but none within—I examined the window sill, and there was some dust on the outside, and on the water-butt also—there were no marks whatever, either of foot or hand prints—I took particular notice of that—none of the outer fastenings of the premises appeared to have been broken—they were all perfect—I examined the whole of them—I went down the garden with the prisoner, and she pointed to the back garden gate—which opens into a passage which leads into the fields, some distance from the house—she said, "This is the way they must have come, for the locks are forced off"—I saw a padlock lying on the ground—she pointed it out to me—I examined it, and found it perfect—there was no breaking as I could perceive then—the hasp was open, but it did not appear to me to be at all forced—there Was a door lock oh the same door—that was unlocked, but not injured—there was no force on the wards—I afterwards got the keys, and tried both the locks, add found them perfect—here is the padlock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not these common locks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—many keys that housebreakers use would very easily open them—the hole in the glass presented a rough appearance—it was starred—it was merely a hole punched through, either from within or without, I will not be po<lb/>sitive which—one finger might be put through the hole, but I should say, if they put two through, they must have been cut—I should say there was not room for two—a person might put their finger through and get hold of the catch, but not without great difficulty—the hole Was directly opposite the hasp, in the centre of the pane—they could move the catch, and then lift up the window—there would then be nothing to prevent the shutters being opened—they might get out the same way—I saw no injury to the fastening at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker and jeweller, and live in Fre<lb/>derick-place, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Sur<lb/>rey. I occupy the house—I and my family sleep there now, but did not at the time of the robbery—we moved in the next day—at that time we slept in Coburgh-place, Old Kent-road—the prisoner was my errand-boy since October, but I had known him four years—he is nineteen years old I—I had no other man-servant—he slept in the shop to take care of tile I property—it is part of the house, and communicates with it—all my stock I in trade was moved into the house then—the house was being repaired, and I had moved my family to the other place while it was done, and meant to return the following morning to Frederick-place with my family, which I did—on the 3rd of April I left the house, about ten minutes after nine I o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner promised me that he would go to bed I within ten minutes after I left—the doors were all locked when I left, except the private door, which I came out at, and left him to secure—I sent the prisoner round the house to see that all was safe before I left, and I locked all my watches up in a box—I had a key made to toe street door I by Benn, who lives nearly opposite—he only made one key for me—I gave no orders for a second key, and did not know about it till after the robbery—I received information, about eleven o'clock that night, from two neighbours, and went to Frederick-place—I found two or three policemen with the prisoner in the shop, and several neighbours, who were question<lb/>ing the prisoner how he had spent the evening—I heard him declare that I he had not been out at all—I missed all the watches which had been put I into the box, and all that had been in the window, except one, and all the valuable jewellery was taken out of the shop window, consisting of brooches rings, ear-rings, watch-keys, and seals—there were about three doses watches, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, averaging one with the other—the other articles were worth at least 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said that directly after I left he considered that the men had concealed themselves in the house—that he heard men walking in the passage, and one of them came into the shop and seized him, and threw him on his back by the mat at the shop door, while the two others took away the property—he said they threatened they would make away with him if he made the least noise or resistance—that two of them had large smock-frocks on, with large pockets underneath, into which they put the property—I asked him if he had left the shop at all that night—he said he was just going to make his bed when on came and seized him, and he considered they were in the house before I left said I thought that very strange, when he had looked over the house—he said he did not look at the three pair of stairs—I never slept at that house till the day following—I occupied a house lower down, as this house was not ready for me—I took it at Christmas—the prisoner slept their daily from that time—when he mentioned about being thrown on his back, Mr. Gardiner, a neighbour, asked him to turn round to show his back—he said so, and there was no appearance of dirt on it—Mr. Gardiner then desired him to lay down, and get up, and show his back—he did so, and then it was covered with dirt—this was inside the shop, by the door—there was a mat at that door, and there is always a great deal of dirt from people's feet—the policemen then took him to the station-house—I had locked the box the watches were in, before I went away, and hung the key on a nail in the</p>

I met Brooks—he asked me if I would have some ale—we went to the Castle and had a pint of ale—I did not stop more than five minutes, and Brooks said he was going down East-lane—I went with him to the Rising Sun, in East-lane, where we had another pint of ale—after stopping there some time, I said it was getting late, and I must get towards home—as we walked along, Brooks told me to stop and he went away—he came back to me in about three minutes—we parted near the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, and I went home—I found the door single-locked, the gas was burning, but it was suddenly turned of and I was seized and dragged over the counter, and was held by one of them, while the other two packed up the goods and took them away—they turned the gas on before they went—I think they remained in the house about half an hour—when they went out they locked the door after them and I remained about ten minutes before I gave the alarm.</p>
