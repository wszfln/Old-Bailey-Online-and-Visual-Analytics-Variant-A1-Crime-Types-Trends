                  </hi>. I am one of the Edmonton police. On Saturday morning, the 16th of December, about four o'clock, I was on duty at Winchmore-hill, and saw the prisoner and his brother William with a pony, in Hopper's-lane—William was leading it, and the prisoner driving it—it was in an hempen halter—they were about three miles, from Chase Green-common—it was the same pony as was afterwards claimed and de<lb/>livered up to Hill—I suspected by their manner that it was not their own property, and asked them about it—they both said they were going to take it to the pound, but they were going in a different direction—they were on the way to London—I took the horse from William Norton, and led it myself—I told them I was not satisfied, and they must go with me—we went for a quarter of a mile, or further—I questioned them closely, and not being satisfied with their answers, I took out my truncheon to secure them, and William ran away—I secured the prisoner—William was taken a fortnight afterwards, and tried—the prisoner was committed to the House of Correction as a vagabond, and was there at the time of William 's trial—he was afterwards taken for this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Harding, who keeps the Three Compasses public-house, in Glasshouse-street, Whitechapel. On the 13th of January the prisoner hired a furnished room in Compasses court, which runs up by the side of our house. On the following Wed<lb/>nesday I employed her to clean part of our house—I had a watch hanging in the bar parlour—I missed it that evening, when the prisoner had not beta gone five minutes—my husband was serving in the bar at the time she went—I directly went to her room with the police-sergeant, but saw no more of her till she was apprehended—the watch was worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not lend it to her—she was apprehended about a fortnight after—my husband happened to meet her accidentally in the highway.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I employed in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when you came in the morning you said you were very cold, and I lent you an old shawl—you were cleaning the bar out—I did not lend you the watch to pledge—you did not ask me to lend you money on a monthly note, and I did not say I would if my husband would do so—nothing of the sort passed—a monthly note was shown to my husband, to be left with us as a sort of security, but I never lent you the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not I leave money at your bar on Monday night, and in the morning spend every farthing I had with you in drink, which was the change of a sovereign I got from a captain? and did not you tell me in the morning, "I have got money belonging to you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, you paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in advance for a week's rent, that is all the money I received from you, except what you might have spent at the bar, that I know nothing about—you took the room on the 13th, and on the 17th took the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I left money with her to get a gown out of pawn—she was very much in liquor at the time—she told the Magistrate I was a stranger to her—he said it was singular I should be allowed to be in the bar-par<lb/>lour—then she said I was a friend. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

About nine o'clock in the morning of the 31st 3rd March, I was at the window—there was a pair of trowsers and a waist coat inside the door—I saw them taken down—I did not see who took them, but I saw the prisoner walk past the window with them—I pursued him—he turned down a court and dropped them—I believe it was the pri<lb/>soner, but his back was towards me—I pursued him, and cried "Stop thief"—he was stopped by a man at the top of the court—he came back and was given into custody—he did not deny the robbery—there was no other person that could have dropped them that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and cashier in the banking-house of William George Prescott, Grote, and Co.; there are more than one other partner. On the 21st of February, 1837, this cheque was produced to me, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I believe it was the female prisoner who presented it—I speak from a recollection of her person—Mr. Pearson saw her—I believed it not to be the writing of the drawer—I believed it not to be a genuine cheque—I showed it to the adjoining cashier, and then referred to our signature book, but, that being rather new, it had not the signature in it—I then referred to the pass book of the society, but that is not here—I then took it to a senior clerk, and showed it to him, and then showed it to Mr. Prescott, and, after some hesitation, he gave me instructions to pay it—I paid it in notes, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the person who brought it—previous to paying her, Mr. Prescott asked her if her name was Hall—she said no, she re<lb/>ceived it for Mrs. Hall—he questioned her as to the nature of the cheque, and then requested her to write her name and address on the back of it, which is here now—I suppose she was a quarter of an hour, or longer, in</p>

The prisoner was in our employ as clerk from the 1st of January, 1832, down to the 15th of August, 1835—at that time we kept a cash account at Bosanquet's—I was in the habit of drawing cheques on account of office business, and sending them by clerks, and I was also in the habit of paying in drafts which I received on other banks—we generally paid in and presented drafts at the same time, if we had occasion, as we lived at some distance from the bankers—the prisoner would have the opportunity of knowing that prac<lb/>tice—in July, 1835, I received a letter from Griffiths Jones, of Welsh Pool—I had before that spoken to the prisoner about his irregular attend<lb/>ance, and he said if he did not give satisfaction he had better go, and I said he had—I afterwards received this letter from Welsh Pool, to which I wrote an answer, and gave it to the prisoner to take a copy of by the machine—after making the copy he brought it to me himself—he had no authority from me to make a second copy—he never told me that he had done so—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two sheets of paper</hi>)—these appear to be copies of the two first sheets of the same letter—they were no doubt made the ma<lb/>chine—the signature I use in drawing drafts on bankers correspond gene<lb/>rally</p>

               <p>with the signature I use in signing letters—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the cheque</hi>)—this certainly not my writing, nor my partner's—it is a very bad imita<lb/>tion—I did not authorise that cheque to be drawn—the signature to this copy of the letter is my hand-writing—the signature to the cheque is cer<lb/>tainly like the signature to the copy of the letter, particularly in the K—Kerslake—it is seldom I make such a K, and the cheque and letter corres<lb/>pound in that particular—I never authorised this cheque on Dixon and Brooks to be paid into Bosanquet's on my account—I believe the words "One hundred and eighty" and the signature James Smith in that cheque to be the prisoner's hand-writing—they bear the strongest mark of his hand<lb/>writing; but I should say all the cheque is his hand-writing decidedly—he was three years and a half in our office, and I saw him write almost very day—I believe the whole cheque to be his writing, but this portion more strongly than the rest—the figures of the year 1838 on this 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque I should say are his figures—it is an imitation of my own hand<lb/>writing throughout—the character is not like the characters, of the prisoner's ting.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 13th of December, 1836, I was in London—and near one of the bridges a man came across the road, and asked me How beasts sold at Smithfield the day before—it was the show at Smithfield the day before—I told him I did not know, for I had not any to sell—(this was not the prisoner)—he said, "I had, but they were sold badly"—he then said, "Do you know much about London?"—I said, "No, not a great deal; I know enough to find where I want to go"—he said, "I never was in London but once before in my life; if you have no objection, I should like to walk with you"—we walked together, till we came to the top of the Haymarket, and near the corner house, called the Black Horse, he said, "Would you like to take a draught of ale?"—this was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—we went in and had a pint of ale, and the prisoner then came in—he passed us, went round the table, threw himself back, and threw his umbrella on the table—he was dressed in black—I got up, and said, "We are going"—he said, "Oh, gentlemen, I wish you only had the good luck as I have had"—the other man said, "Oh, How is that"—the prisoner said, "Oh, I have done them! I have done them! I have done them!"—the other man said, "What do you met by doing them?"—"Oh," he said, "look here"—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out what appeared a handful of notes, and sovereigns mixed with them—he said, "Look here; I have done them"—the other man gave me a <hi rend="italic">jog</hi> of the arm, and said he never saw such a fool in his life; to show his notes—I said, "Well, I am going"—he said, "Oh, let us have his story out"—the prisoner had called for some ale—the other man said, "Don't be in a hurry; How did you do them?"—the prisoner said, "I wish every body was as lucky as I am now; I lived with an uncle and a brother, and they treated me very ill; I left them, and lived some distance from them; after some time I came back, and found my uncle was dead; there was an old woman, named Betty Meachan, and she said, 'Oh Teddy, then, you are back again, why don't you go and take the farm your brother is in?' I said, 'I have no business with it;' she said, 'Yes, it belongs to you;' I said, 'I don't think that;' she said, 'Give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will tell you How you can get it;' I went to the lawyer's, and had an agreement drawn up that I would give her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I got the property; the old woman then told the story How I was to have it, and I said, 'How can that be, when my brother is older than I am?' she said, 'Never mind, your brother was born out of wedlock, and you will gain the property'"—we then came out—the prisoner followed, but before that the man said, "Ayn't there a place called Gardens worth seeing?"—I said, "I suppose you mean the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park"—we agreed to go there—I had occa<lb/>sion to call in Old Bond-street, and left my great coat and an umbrella there—I told the gentleman there that two friends were going with me to the Gardens, and I should not be home till night time—I considered them both friends—the prisoner had joined us before I got to Old Bond-street—we walked together, and said very little—when we came to the Regent's Arms, York Terrace, the man I first met proposed to go and have some<lb/>thing to drink, and we all went in together—refreshment was called for—I said, "I do not think we can go in without a ticket"—I went to the bar, and asked for one, and they gave me a ticket to go in—we sat, <hi rend="italic">chatting</hi>, nearly an hour, in the tap-room—at last the prisoner showed his notes again—the other one said. "I suppose he thinks nobody has got money but himself"—he pulled out a pocket-book, and said, "I have got two</p>

               <p>£10 notes as well as him; I am not without money"—he said, How careful we ought to be for fear of being robbed about London, and he thought it a good way to mark the notes for fear of being robbed, if we had got any—the prisoner said, "Oh, is that right? well, we had better have them marked"—they accordingly went and got pen and ink brought into the parlour—I had my notes all doubled up close in a little bag inside my shirt next my skin—I pulled them out and a little book to take down the numbers—I had them down by the side of me, and got ready to pull them out, but the prisoner jumped up and stamped on the floor, and said, "Shoot, shoot! if you want to shoot, I have got guns enough at home: I have two or three"—I looked sharp at him—he seemed crazy, and in the mean<lb/>time while I was looking, my notes were taken by one of them, and the prisoner went out and the other followed him—I went to take up my notes, but instead of them there was a piece of paper doubled up much about the size of my notes—I saw what was the matter, and ran out directly—the Regent's Arms is nearly a corner house—I asked a man if he had seen any body run out—he said a man in top boots had run across into the New-road as hard as he could run—I could see nothing of him, and thought it best to go down to the Bank, where the notes were payable—I told them what had happened, and asked their advice—they said they would stop them, but I did not know the numbers of the notes—I had drawn them from the bank at Hadley, and they took the numbers down—I went to Marylebone office and told them—they wrote a letter and sent to Suffolk to the bankers to know the numbers—I went about for two days to look for the men, but could not find them—I described the men to the landlord of the house, and a short time ago I had a letter to say the prisoner was in custody—I came to town and saw him at Bow-street office, and am sure he is the same per<lb/>son—I will swear to him—if he did not take my notes, he assisted in tak<lb/>ing them—he is the man that said, "Shoot, shoot"—I had 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in£5 notes, and I lost them all.</p>

On the 13th of December, I recollect the prosecutor and two men coming into the house—it happened to be my birth-day—they went into the parlour and called for refreshment, which was served them, and in a few minutes after the prosecutor came to the bar and asked for a ticket of admission to the Zoological Gardens, which my daughter-in-law gave him—he took it, and Mrs. Tarr said, "You are very late to-day"—they staid for an hour, and then the two men deliberately walked out of the parlour, and along the passage—one stood at the door with a pipe in his mouth till the other came up to him, but he never turned his face to enable me to identify his features—immediately after the prosecutor came to the bar and said he was robbed of his money, and said, "Which way did he go"—we ran out, but they had made their escape—I had not any opportunity of seeing the prisoner to say whether he was the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I met with the prisoner on the 20th of February, at the Saracen's Head, Snowhill—I had come by coach the day before from Yorkshire—I had been out to leek for a lodging, and had come to the Saracen's Head—the prisoner followed me in in the course of about two mi<lb/>nutes—I was reading the paper—a young woman was there, who was going to Brignal, Yorkshire, and she was conversing with the guard of the coach she was going with—I said I knew Brignal perfectly well—the pri<lb/>soner said, "Yes, and I know it perfectly well, I have been there often"—I said, "Indeed! I was not aware I had one of my own countrymen so near me"—he said, "Yes, I am a Yorkshireman"—we got into conversa<lb/>tion, and conversed about half an hour—at last he said, would I have a walk—I said I had no objection—I went out with him, down Newcastle-street and Farringdon-street, till we came near the Fleet Prison—he then said, "What do you say to a glass of ale?"—I said I had no objection—crossed the street, and went into a public-house on the contrary side of the street, and had a pint of half-and-half, which I paid for—in the course of a few minutes, an old gentleman came in, with a drab top-coat on, and a stick; and he said, in the course of conversation, that he had been having a trial with a brother in town here, and he had won the day—he pulled out a lot of notes—as near as I could judge I took them to be about 200£10 notes—I said to him, "Sir, you will excuse the liberty I am about to take, but I should advise you to keep your money rather more secret, and not hand it out in public company"—he said, "I am not at all afraid, it is my own; it is what I earned at the trial, and I have a right to it"—I said nothing against that, but I said, "You are not, perhaps, aware what kind of com<lb/>pany you may be in"—he said, oh, he was not at all afraid—I said, "I have no occasion, if you have not"—he said he thought he had met with two friends, would we partake of a glass along with him—I said I had no objection, but he must ask the one on my right, the prisoner, who was a perfect stranger to me—I never saw him before in my life—he said, "Well, what you think proper"—accordingly I said, "Well, I have no objection; if you think proper, I will have a glass of whiskey and water," which we all three partook of—in the course of a short time the other man said again, "Well, I am so glad I have met with two friends"—I said, "You don't know whether they will be friends or not, probably"—"Well," he said, "you appear to be friends, you guarded me against being robbed"—I said, "Yes, I should always wish to do that, because I have heard speak of rob<lb/>beries in London, though I never was here before, but for a day or two"—he then said, would we go along with him to the Zoological Grardens—I said yes, I did not mind, I should much like to see them—he said he had got a ticket in his pocket, which would admit as many as he thought proper to take—he took it out, and it was half torn in two—he said, "I should much like to see them myself, and if you think proper to go with me I shall be most happy," or some such language—we conversed about something else, I cannot exactly say what just now—he repeated the terms over again that he had met with two friends, and he was so exceedingly glad, and he would treat us to the theatre—nothing had passed about my money then—he had handed his out, but said nothing about mine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020035"/>
               <p>—when he said he would treat us to the theatre, I said I did not wish to infringe on his property in that way; if he had got it easily, we would pay each for ourselves—he would not hear of anything of the king, but would treat us—it was fixed that we should go the day after to the theatre—he then said he should like to have a walk, and we went through Farringdon-market, and from one street to another—being a stranger, I did not take particular notice of the names of the streets—we went from one street to another, and so on, till we came to Water-lane—the prisoner went into several houses there, to see, as he said, if there was a fire in the parlour—he came out of several of them again, and said there was no fire—at last, he went into a house, and came out, saying, "There is no fire here, but the landlord will put one in if we go"—accordingly we went in—he then asked if we had any objection to go without a fire—I said, "Not the least"—he asked the old gentleman, and he said he had not the least objection—he went to the counter, and said he would treat us again—we had another glass of whiskey each, which was brought in to us—while the man was lighting the fire, the old gentleman said, "I don't much like whiskey, I will have a glass of gin-and-water," which he had, and paid for the whole of the three—in the course of a few minutes he pulled out his notes again—I again cautioned him about it—he said, "Well, I will take your advice; I will have them placed in my fob, or home secure pocket"—I said, "Yes, do so"—he said, "Have you got any paper in your pocket?"—I said, "I don't know"—I began to feel, when the prisoner brought out a piece of brown paper, and gave it to the old gentleman—he wrapped up the notes, and asked me if I would place them in his fob—I said, "Yes, with pleasure," and I did so—in the course of a few minutes, he said, "Well, as you are a stranger as well as myself, I should advise you to have yours placed in a secure pocket"—accordingly, pulled out my purse, and placed ten sovereigns and a half on the table—the prisoner placed his hand on them, placed them out, and said, "There is ten sovereigns and a half, I think"—I said, "Yes, I am aware of it"—he said he would wrap them up for me, and place them in my pocket—I thought he was doing so—I stood up, and pulled up my waistcoat, for him to place them into my fob, as I thought, and sat down again—in the course of a minute or two, the old man said he must go to the door—he went out, and the prisoner said, "Well, I don't know what our old friend is doing; I will go and see, and bring him back"—accordingly he went, and staid a few minutes—I thought to myself, it was time I should see what they were both doing—I went out, but could see neither of them—I again returned, went into the parlour, and thought to myself, I will see what I have got in my fob now—I put my finger into my fob, and brought out this piece of paper, and looking into it, found five farthings and two halfpence, in place of my ten sovereigns and a half.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you come into my room and knock me off my seat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I showed him some rooms on the opposite side—I never showed him the room in question, nor saw him in it till I found him there—I might have sent him up to look at it, but I distinctly declined setting him a room without a deposit—I asked him if he would go in a week, a fortnight, a month, or two months; and if he had promised to leave then, I should have communicated with my father, and asked his advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The first week he came I owed him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he wanted to throw my wife and infant into the street, and brought a policeman up to have me turned out. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did so after having seen him there, but the policeman refused to act—I did not intend to turn him out, but to take the wife into custody to answer for being there—the policeman refused—I went to the station-house, and they refused assistance—I went to a Magis<lb/>trate, and he said he was very sorry, but he had no power to interfere—I did not go near the prisoner for two or three months after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He told me to look at the room, and take it if I gave him a deposit, and said he would give me a lock and key as soon as I had got my things in it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I never did—I did not apply for any rent when I found him there with his wife confined in it—he has said he would pay me, but I always said, "I will not have your rent, you came without my leave, and I will have you out"—he never produced any money—the rooms are generally locked, but at times a lock it broken, and he might have found it open.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 22nd of March, I found the prisoner in the Bridewell, at Liverpool—he was delivered up to me on this charge—I informed him who I was, and that I was going to take him to London—he asked me whether his father intended to transport him—I said I did not know—he said he had been trying to get rid of him for the last four years, and now he had an opportunity of doing so—he said he had let a boy named Reynolds into the house two nights—that he concealed him the first night, then took him up stairs and concealed him under the bed—that the night before he stole the jewellery, and put it under the bed, and the night before the boy brought a skeleton key and auger—that they staid till his father came home in the morning, which was about one o'clock, and when they thought his father was asleep, they crept through the hole and picked his pocket of the sovereigns, and then the dog barking, awoke his father, and they had just time to escape from the house—that on the road to Birmingham they bought the pair of pistols which were found on him—he said Reynolds had brought the pistol to the bed-room, which was found there—I have made inquiry, but cannot find that there is such a boy as Reynolds—here are some necklaces, rings, neck-chains, work-box, and ear-rings of coral—the pencil-cases have not been found, nor the thimbles or money—he told me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some silver had been found on him when he was first appre<lb/>hended, which was returned when he was discharged, and he had spent it before he was taken again.</p>

On Thurs<lb/>day evening, the 29th of March, I went out of the shop on a message, and returned about twenty minutes to ten o'clock—the shop was then shut up—I tried the door and it was fast, and I went on my way home—a short distance from ray master's shop I met somebody, in consequence of which I turned back and passed the shop, and stopped talking to him for about a minute—I saw the prisoner at my master's door—I saw him stoop down to the lock, which you must stoop to undo, and use both hands at the same time—you cannot open it except you hold it, and use the key at the same time—he stooped as if he was opening the door—he opened it, and went in—I then ran to the door and rapped—I received no answer the first</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live in Tenter-street, Spital-fields. On Friday afternoon, the 23rd of February, the three prisoners came to my house, and engaged a room on the ground floor—Elizabeth Leonard said she would come in the afternoon and take it, as she was waiting for a person from the London Dock—she said she must come in that night—I asked her for a deposit—she said, "I cannot leave any deposit at present, till I hear from my friend in the Dock, who leaves at four o'clock"—she did not come again till nine o'clock at night, she then said, "I am come at last, the rain kept me back"—the two male prisoners were with her—they had a porter with them, who brought some baskets of wadding, and put it into the room—they all went out again about a quarter after nine o'clock—Lofthouse and the woman came back—Thomas Leonard had stopped at the place—the woman said it was a very wet night which was the reason she had moved her goods so late—she said she would make my room glitter with china and beautiful furniture, which she was going to bring on Monday morning—I went with her and Lofthouse to a public-house, and they gave me some porter, and then went away—next morning (Saturday) I heard a knock at the door, and found Lofthouse and Thomas Leonard—Lofthouse unlocked the room and went in, and was there an hour and a half—I then heard the door go, and he was gone—on the Sunday the officers came to my house, and took away the cotton, which the prisoners had brought there.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a sergeant of the police establishment at Ux<lb/>bridge, Middlesex. On the evening of Friday, the 9th of March, I was on duty there—I had occasion to see one Richard Pearce about a fortnight before—he is not at present in custody—I had seen his stable open about one o'clock in the morning, and thinking it my duty to see if anybody was in it I went in, and saw Pearce lying with a prostitute, both asleep—I awoke them up, and informed him that his door was open—I knew him to be a married man with a family, and disturbed him—on Friday evening, the 9th of March I went to the Rockingham-road—there is a beer-shop there—fortman, a policeman, was with me that night—I saw the prisoner Latham knocking at the window of the beer-shop, about half-past nine o'clock at night—there were several persons near the front of the shop—some of them were drunk and making a noise—I did not interfere with them while they stood there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020063"/>
               <p>—I said nothing to either of them—I placed myself about ten yards from the beer-shop, thinking that, seeing me, they would move away—I had not been there above ten minutes before Pearce came up to me, and began to abuse me—Latham was within hearing—Pearce said, "D—n you, what business had you in my stable the other night?"—I said, "My good fellow, I do not want to have any thing to say to you," and immediately left him—I was proceeding towards the station—Fortnum went away with me—as we were going along, we were followed by Pearce and Latham—Pearce was on before Latham two or three yards—Pearce called out, "You b—y po<lb/>lice we will get you out of this town; we will make this town too hot for you; we will do your business," and such expressions as those—I cannot say whether Latham used any expressions, for I walked on quickly to get away from them—I arrived at the gate of the station-house before any thing was done—as I was going in at the gate, Pearce put himself into a righting attitude, and again used the expressions I have named—he was not more than six or seven feet from me—he was within reach of me, if he had struck me—(Latham was close behind him—close to him—he did not say any thing)—I found it necessary, as the peace was broken, to lake Pearce into custody—there were fifty or sixty persons collected together in a mob—they had been followed by all the persons who were at the beer-shop, and the mob collected as they came along—I took Pearce by the collar, to take him into the station-house, and immediately Latham hung himself right round Pearce, as I suppose, for the purpose of rescuing him from me—we gate a sudden pull, and got them both inside the gate—they had both been drinking pretty freely, and were labouring under the effects of drink—I got them both into the station-house, and Fortnum shut the gate—the door of the station-house is not more than two or three yards from the gate—it is a small room we have for the purpose of taking the charges—I succeeded in getting Pearce and Latham into the charge-room—we have a strong-room eight or ten yards from the charge-room—Fortnum left after getting them into the charge-room—they were both in liquor, and clinging to each other—when I got them into the room, they both fell down on the floor, and while there I and my wife kept them down as well as we could, while Fortnum went to open the door of the strong-room—while I was endeavour<lb/>ing to keep them down, Latham got himself round so as to get on one leg—he pat his arm round, and took something from his pocket—there was a strong light in the room, a fire and a candle—I saw something in his hand which appeared to me to be a table-knife—he made several thrusts at me—here is the great coat I had on—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—here are seven stabs in the coat in the part which covers my thigh and leg—there is one stab in the arm—I felt the knife go into my leg—I called out, "Oh, the villain has stabbed me"—Pearce, who laid down in one part of the station-house, hearing me say that, called out, "That is right, give it the b——r," quite load.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you feel that you had received more than one wound at the time pearce called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the particular wound I felt was of a particular description—it went nearly through the calf of my leg—I have reason to recollect the moment I received it—I felt the knife enter the calf of my leg—after receiving this wound, Latham got himself up on his legs, in the charge-room—I stepped back off the step, and he made another plunge at me—I drew my staff out, and struck him on the side of his head—I got out into the yard, and he followed me, making thrusts at me as he followed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020064"/>
               <p>—I discovered I had two wounds—I hardly know How many stabs I had before I used my staff—he followed, and thrust at me—I struck him again with my staff, in the yard, and at that moment the station-house yard gate was burst open, and a mob of persons entered—the first person I saw was the female prisoner, Clements—at the time the gate was being opened my leg was bleeding—I felt the blood flowing from me—it was pouring over my boat—at that time, I should think, there were two hundred persons collected round the station-house—fifteen or twenty accompanied Clements, as many as could crowd in at the gate—on her coming in, she was close to me and Latham, as we were close to the gate—I will not say that Clements could see the state of my leg—as she entered I and Latham were fighting—he was stabbing at me at the time, and I was keeping him off—she saw us fighting, and clapped her hands, and called out, "Give it him, give it the b——r"—she turned round to the others, and said, "Get out your knives we will give it to the b——r," and such like expressions—the mob got both prisoners out of the yard—they caught hold of them, and pulled them out of the gate—Pearce had got out of the house then—he had got into a cornet, and was still calling out to Latham to give it to me, but did not join in it himself—he was standing up in a corner, not above two yards from me and Latham—I had got two men taking their rest, before going on duty, and Fortnum had gone to call them, believing they would make an attack on a—a great number of the windows of the station-house were broken, and we heard the stones fly up at the windows, at least we heard the windows crack—I then went, and saw my three men come down stairs—the prisoners at that time, were gone—I suggested that we should go and take them—up to the time, I used my staff, to protect myself, I had never spoken it Latham, nor put a hand on him—I became exhausted from the wound—we had left our cutlasses exposed, in the little room, near the gate—I pro<lb/>posed to go back and secure the cutlasses; and on going back, the gate was again broken open; and the female prisoner kept calling out, "Here they come—Get out your knives, my boys, let us give it to the b—n—I bad just pushed down the catch of the gate—the latch was broken of by their bursting it in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the police-constables of Ux<lb/>bridge. On the evening of Friday, the 9th of March, I was with Cooper in Rockingham-place, about half-past nine o'clock—there is a beer-shop nearly opposite to where we were—I observed a vast crowd around the beer-shop—the prisoner Latham was much enraged, holding his fist up, wishing somebody to come out, I believe, whom he had been quarrelling with—I believe the persons were in liquor—I did not interfere with them, nor did cooper—they made use of bad language, and called us b—y police and b—y half-starved looking b—s—Pearce used bad language, and said, "B—y police"—neither I nor Cooper took any notice of him—we walked on towards the station-house, followed by a number of persons—Pearce was foremost—I did not see Latham follow, but he hung on Pearce when he was collared—Pearce used language respecting being caught in the barn—I saw Cooper collar Pearce, and Latham hung on him—I aid not see Pearce do any thing to Cooper before Cooper took hold of him—when I got to the station-house, Cooper endeavoured to pull Pearce in, and La<lb/>tham hung on him—we succeeded in getting them both into the yard, and shut the gate—we got them into the charge-room—there was a great struggle between Pearce and Sergeant Cooper and Latham—Pearce was on the ground, flat on his face, and Latham on the top of him—there is a strong-room near the spot—I went to open it, by the desire of my sergeant to get the prisoners in—after I returned from the strong-room I was Latham on one knee, making two distinct stabs as it were at Cooper, who said, "I am stabbed; run and get the men up"—I did not hear what passed from Pearce when the sergeant said, "I am stabbed"—but I heard Latham, when he stabbed him, say, "Take that, you b—r"—I went for the policemen, who were resting, to take their turn at twelve o'clock at night—Latham and Pearce had got away, when I returned from calling the men, and I found the gate of the station-house yard had been burst open—I did not see the female prisoner till she was brought in in custody—I did not hear what passed with her—while Latham was in the charge-room, after hearing a cry that the man was stabbed, I saw something shine in Latham's hand—I cannot say what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of George Harding, and live with him. On Thursday evening, the 2nd of March, I left the parlour at a quarter past six o'clock—on returning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, I found half the blind open, and the articles in question stolen from the op<lb/>posite side of the room—I found a decanter taken out of the cupboard, and placed on a chair; a tea-caddy, a glass sugar-basin, and five books, were taken from the sideboard on the other side of the room—the decanter was left</p>

                  </hi>, (a prisoner.) On the evening of the robbery Stone and Paine asked me whether I would go with them—I went with them to Helmet-row, and stood about there a long time—then Paine and Stone went up to the prosecutor's window—I was a little distance from them—they came, and said, "Now then, come along, it is all right"—they told me to get in at the window—I asked them what I was to give them when I got in—they said "Any thing"—I put my foot on a bar by the side of the house, and got in at the window, and gave them out the tea-caddy and some books—the window was open, the sash <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up, the blind was open—I gave them out a tea-caddy and some books—Payne took them—there was a decanter I had in my hand, but I heard somebody coming, and put it down, got out of the window, and ran away with the stopper in my hand—I met Paine a little way from the place, and we went to Stone's house, and the property was there on the table—I stopped there some time, and then went home—I went there again at eight o'clock the next morning, and in about half an hour a boy named Cox came, and he was going to the pawnbrokers, and they asked him to pledge the books—he took them, came back, and said they would not take them—Paine and Stone were both in the room at the time Cox went away—he brought them back the prisoner bill and another young woman came in soon after, and then Mrs. Stone came in out of the country—we had not been there long before the officers came and took us into custody—I do not know that Hill did any thing—she was in the room—when the officers came Paine and Stone were gone out—they were in the room when Hill came, and she asked Stone if his mother was come home, as he expected her—Hill sells fish in Whitecross-street—the books were not there then—I do not know what had become of them—the tea-caddy was there—Mrs. Stone came in, and Paine and Stone went out to get some shavings for a dog to lie on, and the policeman came and took me and Hill.</p>

In consequence of information on the 3rd of last month, I went to No. 12, Graham's Buildings, Twister's alley, St. Luke's, to a front room—I saw Hill, Lawrence, and another female—Hill and another fe<lb/>male were sitting on a bed—a young man sitting between them endeavoured, as I thought, to conceal something underneath the bed clothes—I proceeded to search towards the bed—the prisoner, Hill, said, "That is Mrs. D. V—" What is?" said I—"The box," said the—I asked her what box—the other female replied, "The work-box"—on search<lb/>ing the bed, I found the caddy and sugar basin inside it—I also received a boot from Lawrence, which corresponded with a mark on the chair in Mr. Harding's parlour—after he had been discharged by the Magistrate, I saw something which induced me to take him into custody again—I saw him <hi rend="italic">Judge</hi> the other prisoners, and very anxious to get away—winking at them</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hugh M'Intosh—he is contractor for the Great Western Railway, and is executing a part near Han well—Addison was his carter—Mr. M'Intosh finds food for his horses. On Saturday, the 24th of March, from information I received, I went to his stable at Drayton-green, and ascertained what horse provender Addition had taken out with him that morning—I then went after him to Ealine I found him about seven o'clock in the morning, and asked him where the chaff was that he had taken out from the stable—he said it wag in the nose-bag—I asked where the sack was that he had taken out three quarter full—(I put that question from information I had got)—he told me he had got none but what was in the nose-bag, and denied taking any other out—I then took him out of the cart, and he voluntarily admitted to me he had left a sack with Tom, the ostler, at the Coach and Horses—this was cart of bricks he was loading—in consequence of what Addison said I went to the Coach and Horses, at Ealing—I saw Smith sweeping the front of the house—he is, I believe, under-ostler—I took a policeman and Addison with me—I asked Smith what he had done with the sack of chaf corn and beans that Addison left with him—Smith, at first, denied having seen Addison, or the corn, or sack either—I gave him into custoday he then said he had found the sack down in the shed—I looked under the manger of the stable, and found the sack produced, about three quarter foil with chaff, corn, and beans—I know it to be the same sort of sack we have for our oats and beans—it had some grey hairs upon it, as if it had been laid across a grey horse's back—I gave them in charge—when Addi-son went out in the morning, he had no business at the Coach and Horses.</p>

On the 24th March, Addison took some grey horses from the stable at Drayton, a little after six o'clock—they were going to work by the rail-road—be took his two nose-bags, and about three parts of a sack of mixed corn, chaff, beans and oats, on a grey horse's back—I have since seen a sack in the police man's possession—it has the same mark on it as my master's had that the took that morning, and it had the same grey hairs on it—I then went to find Addison, and took him at Ealing—he ought to have had the same sack of food he had taken in the morning, but he had not—this is the same sack as we have.</p>

At a quarter past seven o'clock, on the with of March, I saw the prisoner go into No. 5, which belongs to my father—in a quarter of an hour I saw him come out with the range on his shoulder—I ran half way up the street, and stopped him—I told him to put it down, which he did, and told me to take it home, but I followed him—he struck at me twice with an umbrella—I then followed him to William-street into Stephen-street—where my father came up, and took him—he was then in the act of striking me.</p>

I recollect Thursday, the 8th of March, the prisoner came to my shop about tins o'clock—she had a few small articles, bread, tea, and sugar—they came to about—she gave me a shilling—I gave her the change, and she went away—I put the shilling into the till—there were two more in, this made the third—she came about four o'clock the same day—she then had some bread, tea, sugar, and butter, which came to about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a shilling in payment—I put it into the same till—I recollect her coming again about five o'clock—she then bought some bread, tea, sugar, and become which came to about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a shilling, which I added to the others and gave her change—that would make about five shillings in the till, not more—she came a fourth time that day, about half-past five o'clock—she then had a pound of bread, which was 1 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she offered a crown-piece, which I placed in another till, on the other side of the shop, and gave her change—my husband came home about seven or eight o'clock, which was about two</p>

               <p>hours after, she came the last time—I went out after that, and when I came back, he said he had taken two bad shillings from the till, where I put the shillings—I had not taken a shilling from any other person from the time the prisoner first came—I recollect the morning subsequent to that—I went to the till where I placed the crown, took it out to examine it, and found it a bad one—I examined the till where the shillings were kept, and found a third bad shilling there.</p>

I saw the four prisoners drinking beer and eating in the tap-room, all together—after they were gone out, I saw a half crown on the table in the bar—I marked it, and put it into my pocket—here it is—I went about a mile and a half before I overtook them—I first at saw Treadaway standing at the corner, just against Hill's house, where there roads met—Mr. Rowe, who was with me, got out to go to Hill's house,—just as he was going there, Jones came out with a pipe—he was followed by Hill and Rowe—I beckoned that they were the two men—Jones came to Treadaway, and Rowe collared them—I had asked Tread away if he would ride in the cart—I assisted in taking them—they got away from Rowe, and ran round the corner—we all pursued them—Tread away struck at Rowe—when they resisted, I got out of my cart to help them, and collared Tread<lb/>away, while they searched Jones, who kicked at them—then there came more assistance, and the two men were taken to the Led Lion—I went in pursuit of the women, and found them four or five hundred yards further down the road—I asked if they would ride, they refused—I said, "I shall take the liberty of handing you into my cart, and taking you to town"—they went, and were taken to the Magistrate.</p>

My father, James Green, is butcher—before nine o'clock on the morning of the 25th of March I was in the shop serving a customer—the prisoner came in—he had a bag with him—after I had served the other customers I turned to the prisoner, and asked what he would give for the meat he was cheapening—he made no answer, but walked off—I missed two pieces of meat—I went and found him in a door-way twenty yards up—he was taking the meat out and putting it into a handkerchief—I took him—two pieces of mutton and two pieces of beef were found in the handkerchief—it was Yorkshire mutton—I know it by the scoring, and we had the fellow pieces.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember on either of those occasions, or on any occasions down to the 12th, whether he pointed out or spoke of any other errors, omissions, or corrections, except such as appear on that copy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot recollect—I have no recollection that he said there were any other errors—I saw him on the 12th in Mr. Toplis's office—we met there by appointment—I had made the appointment with Mr.</p>

               <p>Miers about seven o'clock in the evening—we met at Mr. Toplis's own private house in Bridge-street—only one inventory was produced in the first instance—that was No. 1.—Mr. Toplis produced it—he had it previously—I believe Mr. Miers was requested to sign it—he then said he could not sign it because there were many errors in it—then Mr. Miers produced the copy I had given him, (<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 2,) which was intended for his own private use, marked as to errors—it was produced as altered by him-self, with the alterations which have been read—I have no recollection that the pointed out any errors besides those which were altered—Mr. Toplis asked him many questions about No. 2.—I cannot recollect exactly the particulars—there was a great deal of conversation between Mr. Toplis and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see, with regard to the amount of stock, these two statements com<lb/>pletely agree as to the loss sustained at the fire, 3217<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I want to know whether, during the whole of the conversation, any objection was made, or any error stated to have been committed with respect to the amount of the stock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—as far as I recollect, no error was pointed out except those mentioned in No. 2.—I think I recollect now that Mr. Toplis, after Mr. Miers refused to sign No. I, asked him to sign the other, No. 2.—I think so—I think he refused to sign it—he certainly did not sign it—I signed nothing except this declaration—I think we separated about half-past ten o'clock—we had been together from seven o'clock till half past ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you say, with any degree of certainty, that it was after Sunday, the 4th, you made the copy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was on the 8th or 9th—I have nothing entered relating to it—I have no book with me in which I enter what I do on any particular day, or How I pass my time—I have a day-book where the time is entered—that book is at home—I have no objection to bring it—this book I have here is a mere diary—here is entered on Monday, the 5th of February, "Received a letter of appointment from Mr. Toplia, and sent to make proper arrangements with Mr. Robert Miers—when I went to make that proper arrangement he was not in the way—It is not stated in that book that he was not in the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor and appraiser, and act as agent for the Union and several other offices. I understood that Mr. Miers had insured some property in High-street, in the Union office—I heard of the fire on the Sunday morning—I believe the fire was on the Sunday morn<lb/>ing, the 21st, and I was there about twelve o'clock at noon—I have general instructions from the office to investigate claims, and I took that step here—I met Mr. Campion on the Tuesday, as the agent of Mr. Miers—I declared his claim to be sent in, with a specification of the loss, and this inventory No. 1, was delivered to me on the 1st of February—it had not them the declaration at the end—in other respects it was exactly as it is now—the stock is mentioned in one round sum of 3200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd pounds—no specification or intimation was given me at that time as a what that stock was, except what appears in that paper—I gave directions to have a specification of the stock charged to that amount—no books, papers, or vouchers were produced to me when that inventory was first de<lb/>livered—I had appointments for Mr. Campion to attend me prior to the 12th of February, but they were not kept—we at last met by appointments on the 12th of February—until that time I had never seen the prisoner on this matter—I did not know him at all—at that interview I requested the par<lb/>ticulars of his stock, and he produced to me some papers relating to as old stock taking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he before that put in his copy of the inventory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say which was done first—it was all simultaneous—he handed in an in<lb/>ventory which I have marked on the cover, No. 2.—when I asked him for the particulars of his stock, he produced some papers, which I have put together in the form they were in when I received them—he said they were the particulars of the stock taken on August 31, 1836—I asked him for the particulars of his private mark, which he gave me,—I have it here in his own handwriting—he said he had been engaged in making out the detail of the stock, and handed to me a list as far as he had gone—this is the list, which with these papers were given to him when he went away, and I became possessed of them at the hearing before the Magistrate—this list was, as I understood from him, a detail of the stock on the premises at the time of the fire as far as he had gone with it—he said the stock on August 31st, 1837, was as he stated in the several papers, and handed me papers of goods bought since, and here they are, and there is also a list of goods bought before—in support of the statement of the cash, he had taken since the stock was taken in 1836, he handed me in that paper, stating that the books which would have told the transactions were burnt—this was cash taken for goods sold—there were no other papers in reference to the stock—he brought his books, which I have here—he said two books, a cash-book, and what he termed a small ledger, which would have told the whole of the transactions had been burnt—other books had been preserved, and those he produced—I asked him How it was he gave me an account of the cash taken if the books were destroyed—he said he had received that account from his brother, that his brother attended once or twice a week, as he was largely indebted to him, and took from his books the account of the cash taken—he handed me a vast number of bills of parcels to confirm the buying which had taken place, to the amount of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—many of the papers are duplicates—he left me with a promise to finish the detail account of the stock, which was to come to the sum he stated—I did not return the bills to him—I returned the stock-paper, and the account rendered of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020135"/>
               <p>stock burnt—he did not ask for the books—I returned him all he wanted, and he promised to complete the account, to sustain the sum he had claimed—he did not say that there was any thing incorrect in the amount of the stock—no error whatever was pointed out as to the amount of the stock—I do not recollect whether the inventory or the stock papers were produced first—the inventory, No. 2., was produced with some erasures and correct<lb/>ions on it—he said he wished to take them out—I asked him to sign the original claim, No. 1., which it is the custom to get signed—he refused to sign it, and I wrote the declaration at the end of it as a qualification for him to sign it—Mr. Campion said he would sign it, and did—the prisoner himself refused to sign it—the declaration was put before him to sign, and he refused—(<hi rend="italic">Declaration read</hi>)—"I hereby declare this claim to be made out from instructions and list given by Mrs. Miers, with the assistance of her servant and Mr. Miers; cut it is admitted that Mr. Miers shall have the opportunity to make such alterations as he can prove are in error—otherwise he hat refuted to sign the above—<hi rend="italic">signed</hi>, GEORGE CAMPION. 12th February, 1838."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He did not sign it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the alteration was made to meet hit views—the addition was made because he said he would sign it if it was added, but he refused to sign it, and on his doing to, a discussion took place re<lb/>specting the corrections he had made in his copy of the inventory—he said Mrs. Midgley, the sister of hit wife, was about to be confined, and the baby linen had been lent to her, and the child's coral and bells—there is a note written in the margin "See Midgley" against that—I under<lb/>stood him that the coral was at Midgley's—I do not remember any thing else being said about the child's coral—I asked him what he meant by erasing some of these things, what was I to understand? (I had before this received certain information from some of the police), he said he had taken tome things to a house, he did not know the street, it was to a coffee top, a friend of Midgley, where he was known—I asked him if he had been there since he had left them—he said no, he thought he could find the shop, but did not know the person's name—he said that Midgley had been in his service up to May, and since May he had only had a boy and no shopman—he said Midgley had taken a shop, and fitted it up, in Crawford-street—that he advertised three times to open it, but had not opened it—I do not know that he said why in express words, but the meaning was that he could not obtain stock sufficient—he said he (the prisoner) had kept from four to six shopmen in Oxford-street from his commencement in October, 1835, I think till March, 1837, when he left—he said he considered his stock of the same value when he left Oxford-street, as when he took stock "August, 1836-it is stated as 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd in the paper—he said the stock was of that value—in the written inventory it is reduced to 2910<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he states it in a debtor and creditor's account—the turn of 1202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it the amount "If stock he was getting forward to deliver to me—he gave me that, being the detail of the stock as far as he had gone, and I apprehend the numbers on it refer to the number of divisions or drawers, because he produced a plan of the shop—this paper is the statement of the stock at far at it went, but which he was to complete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he left on the evening of the 12th of February, did he say any thing as to How the fire happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him the particulars—he said he had turned off the gat before he left the shop, and went into his Parlour, he had been there a considerable time taking his supper, and from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock (I think he said) Mrs. Miers went up stairs to bed, the servant attending her to warm the bed—about half an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020136"/>
               <p>hour after, he went up stairs—his wife was in bed, and the servant is the room—that she stopped some few minutes, and then came down that the servant was down a short time, and I understood went up to call him, or told him that there was fire in the shop—he came down stairs, unlocked the door leading into the shop, which had a glass sash, and the shop was full of smoke—he returned up stairs to his wife, told her to get up and dress herself, for the shop was on fire—he soon came down stairs, and he and the servant procured a small quantity of water, and threw on the fire, and he left it—he said he had lost the two books I have referred to, but I under<lb/>stood nothing else but those, not of his books and papers—I asked him what servants he had—he told me he had taken a boy on the Friday preceding the fire, who was the only servant in the shop—he said he had taken the boy without a character, and the boy had gone out on Saturday after<lb/>noon to return at six o'clock, but had not returned, and he had not seen him since—he said he had given him leave to go out to fetch some things from Bermondsey—I understood him it was in the afternoon—he said the boy told him he had been in service at Chatham—he could not tell me the boy's surname, Christian name, or any thing about him—during the whole of the conversation he said nothing whatever of any error in his claim in respect of the stock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long altogether did the into view last between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about two hours—it took place at my house in New Bridge-street—the solicitor's clerk was present—he came there by my directions, and Mr. Richards called in while we were so engaged—they were there a great part of the time, and Mr. Campion also—the prisoner and Mr. Campion came together—the first thing that took place when they came into the room was, I told him that that gentleman was the solicitor's clerk; and when Mr. Richards came in I told him he was the solicitor to the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say when the prisoner first came in with Mr. Campice, that you had merely sent for him to sign the claim sent in by him, and would not detain him longer than to sign it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I cannot tell the exact period at which I asked him to sign the claim—it is very likely I might ask him to do it when he first came in, I cannot tell—I will not swear I did not ask him to do so the very first thing when he came in—I will not swear whether I put a pen into his hand, and asked him to sign the claim or not—I did not make any memorandum of my questions or the prisoner's answers—my account is generally from my recollection—the prisoner did refuse to sign the first inventory—that was why the qualifica<lb/>tion was put at the end—I can say distinctly that the qualification was put before the prisoner to sign, and then I asked Mr. Campion to sign it—Mr. Campion said he would sign it—he said he would sign it to prove to me that he had the prisoner's instructions to make out the claim—he said so at the time—I cannot tell whether it was before I asked him to sign it, or after—I requested him to sign it—I do not recollect whether I put the pen into his hand myself—I will not swear about it—there were two ink-stands and pens on the table—I will not swear who took them up—I will not swear I did not put a pen first into the prisoner's hand, and ask him to sign it, be<lb/>cause I cannot recollect whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say he spoke about some stock of Midgley's, was there any thing in the inventory about that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there is no account of stock, except his own—he said Midgley had obtained goods from houses in the City, not paid for, to the amount of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020137"/>
               <p>me those were some of the goods left at the coffee-house—he did not tell me he had not included Midgley's goods, of the value of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the general account as claimed—he did not say so in those terms—I will tell you what he did say, he said when Midgley found he could not open the shop, he had goods to the amount of about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and those were sent to his (Miers's) house, but were not in the claim, for something else was done with them; they never went into his stock—he said the goods sent to his house were about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, the residue of the 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not say that he had not included them in the general account—I was examined before the Magistrate—my deposition was read over to me—I called at the office after it was shut, and the clerk read it to me, and I signed it—I was only exa<lb/>mined once at the office.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The Court read from the witness's deposition as follows:)—"He had sup<lb/>plied Midgley with various goods for persons, but, ultimately, the whole stock was removed to his (the prisoner's) house—that he considered them the value of</hi> 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabout, but he had not included them in the general amount as claimed here."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were before the Magistrate, did you state any thing at all of what the prisoner said to you about the mode in which the fire occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect at the present moment the precise statement—when I asked him what he meant by erasing these things, I alluded to the articles the amount of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. struck out in the inventory—it was on that he said what I have mentioned about the coffee-house—he said he did not wish to say any thing about Mr. Midgley's affairs, as he was in some degree of trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, with respect to the gas, did not he tell yon he had turned off the gas in the shop, but he could not turn it off at the main? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have on recollection of the word main being mentioned—I will not swear it was not, but I have no recollection of it—I have no recollection of his speaking of the had state of the pipe—my impression is, that he did not mention about the gas being faulty, either at my house or any where else, in my presence—I will not swear he did not mention about the deranged state of the gas-pipe in the conversation at my house, but I believe he never said a word about the gas-pipe—I have no recollection of his saying any thing about the frost—I will not swear he did not—after he gave me all the papers and books, and made the statement to me, he left with a promise to supply the remainder of the account in a few days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not, on going away with that promise, taken into custody immediately by an officer whom you had <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> the officer—the commissioners of police did—it was not by my application—I did not apply to them—he was to come to my house—I knew the officer would be there, but my advice was not to take him—one of the officers was stationed in the adjoining room—he could not hear what took place—it was before the interview that I advised the officer not to take him—I did not understand, from my conversation with the prisoner, that some of the 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were the goods that were taken to the coffee house—I will swear nothing of the kind occurred in the whole course of conversation, because he never mentioned stock—I did not tell the police<lb/>man, after the prisoner had gone away, he must not take him—the policeman went out of the door, I believe, before the prisoner did—I am always concerned for six Fire-offices, and I settle for ten sometimes—I was con<lb/>cerned for the Sun Fire-office in the case of a person named Jacobs, who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020138"/>
               <p>was prosecuted here, which was afterwards referred to Mr. Justice Patte<lb/>son, before he was a Judge—I have been concerned for the Sun Fire-officer nearly twenty-eight years—I was examined as a witness on that occasion in this Court—the prisoner was acquitted after a trial of twelve hours and a quarter—I was a witness before the arbitrator—I gave evidence on the side of the Fire-office—I have not assisted in getting up this case, or sub<lb/>poenaing witnesses—the man Jacobs did not recover his claim—he did not recover one farthing on his stock—the mortgagee recovered his amount, but the man nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mr. Miers went away, did you expect he had gone away to come back in a few days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you will allow me to explain—when information came to the police of goods being left at the coffee-shop, and they came to tell me they thought they were goods abstracted from the fire, I said, "How do you know it is the same person? let him make his claim to the goods, and then we shall know, but you may go and take up an innocent man"—I did not see the policeman after the prisoner went away—I had my doubts whether the prisoner was the man who had left the parcels—I always had my doubt of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 29, Molyneaux-street, which is about half a mile from High-street—one end of it comes into Queen-street, and the other leads to Edgware-road. On the night of Saturday, the 20th of January last, I happened to be at the corner of Weymouth-street, between twenty and twenty-five minutes past twelve o'clock—it leads into High-street—I knew the house that was occupied by the prisoner before it was burnt down—it was at the corner of a street called Bowling-street, in High-street, on the northern side of Bowling-street—Bowling-street runs into High-street—I observed smoke issuing from the shutters, carrying a smell of fire with it—I knocked at the shutters, but received no answer, and I went to the private door—I knocked at the private door, and was answered by a female, who I supposed to be a servant—she came to the door—it was Ann Wright—when she opened the door I asked if there was any thing the matter in the shop—she answered, "It is a hit of an acci<lb/>dent"—I looked into the shop, and saw it was full of smoke—I went into the passage, and looked through a door, which was half glazed—that was open, and I could look into the shop—I saw smoke coming from under<lb/>neath the stall board of the window—I said to the girl, why did she not give some alarm—I thought the place was all on fire—there was a good deal of smoke in the shop—I observed some woollen goods or shawls hang<lb/>ing up in the shop, and observed an appearance of light through the shawls—I saw one, two, or three lights—they were in different parts of the shop—I staid there about five minutes—I did not see the prisoner or any part of the family, but the servant—I left, and went to the adjoining house—the fire appeared to grow up very rapidly indeed—when I first observed it in the shop it was nothing more than smoke, and in less than five minutes after it was all in a flame—there were gas burners in the shop—I did not observe any fire coming from under the stall-board when I first went, but I did about a quarter of an hoar after, when I returned—two gas-burners appeared to be nearly over the stall-board, and one to be nearly over the counter—I did not observe any flame at all near the stall-board when my attention was first called to the smoke under it, but I did when I came back the second time—it was then all in a blaze—I gave an alarm to Mr. Bicknells, next door—when I first observed the smoke issuing from the shutters I was outside.</p>

               <p>on the night of the 20th of that month in High-street, and about half-past twelve o'clock a servant-girl came to me, and gave an alarm of fire—I went immediately to Mr. Miers's house, and went in at the side-door, in Bowling-street—that door opens into a passage, and then there is a glass door, which opens into the shop—the shop-door is in High-street—when I went in at the private door I looked through the glass door, and saw fire burning on the left-hand counter as I went in—it was a very small light, I should say, about a foot above the counter—Mr. Miers was in the pas<lb/>sage as I went in—the same passage by which I entered—he was dressed the same as I am now, all but his hat—he had no hat on—his wife was with him—as I stood, the fire was on my left hand, at the stall-board, or counter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time was after Gattrell left? was it not till after he had gone, that you first knew the lights left at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was after Gattrell left—before he left they used to be put out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do you remember the night the fire happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my master went out about eleven o'clock that night—he was not song out—he came home from eleven to about a quarter or twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, and he had been out in the afternoon—when he came home me he had his supper, and then shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember whether when he shut up the shop he put the gas fights out or lowered them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot say—I do not remember one way or the other—when he had had his supper and shut up the shop, went up stairs with my mistress—that was at ten minutes or a quarter after twelve o'clock—I remained with my mistress from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes before Mr. Miers came up—during that time he down below alone—he then came up—I remained up stairs about five minutes after he came up—I remained in the room—I then went down stairs with the warming-pan in my hand—when I got down, I observed he curtain was undrawn, and a large worsted needle stuck in the curtain—seeing the reflection in the glass, I looked on the counter, and saw a light, was a muslin curtain to the glass-door which separates the parlour from the shop—the bottom part of the door is wood—the curtain of that door was undrawn—I looked through the glass-door, and saw a light on the left-hand side of the counter—as you look through the glass-door the counter is on the left-hand side—there were two windows to the shop—the window was near the end of the counter—there were two counters—the light was at the left-hand counter, near the end, near the window—there were some prints hanging, and there was a light as if it went from these prints, and they were in a flame—when I saw the fire, I called to master twice, please, Sir, will you come down stairs"—the door was locked which led into the shop—I did not try it, but the keys were up stairs—my master came down, and desired me to go for the policeman—he had his coat and waistcoat</p>

               <p>off—he went up stairs again—I did not do as master desired me—I went up stairs with him—he said to mistress, "My dear, get out of bed, the shop is on fire"—the keys were on the drawers—I took them off and gave then to master, and then went down to the policeman, leaving master in the room—I went down stairs and got some water for the policeman—I brought the policeman in with me—I got the water from the wash-house in the yard—there was a pail and a foot tub, with two handles—I had put the water in the tub for the next day's use—I had got the water out of the wash-house, which was up stairs in the yard, in a large water-butt—I could not draw the water out of the tap—I dipped it out with a jug—the water was frozen—I brought the water and gave it to the policeman—I then went up stairs for mistress's cloak and bonnet, but I could not get the closet open where her bonnet was kept—I went down with the cloak, and master told me to go into the back warehouse with mistress, and I went out with he—I did not remain more than a minute after I brought the policeman in—I went with my mistress to a neighbour named Watkins, but I did not stop there when mistress was there—I did not stop long in the parlour—I went after the engine to Marylebone station-house—I went of myself after that, Mr. and Mrs. Miers had a coach, and Mr. Miers left me at any own home, at three o'clock in the morning, and was to let me know when to come to them—he came on Monday and told me to go; and on a Tues<lb/>day morning I went to my mistress in Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, the house of Mr. Bustin—he is a relation of Mr. Miers's, I believe—I mained there, I think, a fortnight with mistress—I staid there till the Campbell, the policeman, came—Mr. and Mrs. Miers remained there also—I went into Mr. Miers's service on the 15th of November.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Miers get any quantity of goods in after you went in No<lb/>vember—was there any considerable quantities of goods brought into the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not see any—I think if there had been any large quantity I should have seen them—I could see into the shop through the glass door, and when my master had no man I used to watch the shop door while master and mistress were at dinner—I did not serve in the shop—the shelves were not full, some of them had two or three things on and the others were not full—the shop was not well stocked.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020151"/>
               <p>brown paper, and some with wrappers—some were the length of a long cane—all the parcels that master had placed on the stairs were put into the each—nobody went with him then—the coachman and he drove away—did not hear where he was going—his wife did not go with him—he came back about half-past twelve or twenty-five minutes to one o'clock—he then went up stairs to dress, and dined with Mrs. in White<lb/>chapel, and mistress went with him—I do not remember any goods coming into the shop after Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do you remember during the time you were there any other goods going away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the time Mrs. Midgley went away, before Christmas morning, there were two trunks, and master took some parcels hen, but I did not look at the size of them—one trunk was a black one and the other a coloured paper one—I do not know from my master whe<lb/>ther he went the night before the fire to Ingram-court—he went out on Friday, but I cannot say to any time—during the latter part of the time I was there my master was not much at home—he did not spend much time in paying attention to his shop during the latter part of the time—not more than usual—mistress attended to the shop, and master went out—a lad was hired as shop-boy, and came on the Friday before the fire, and went away on the Saturday afternoon—his Christian name was John, his other name I do not Know—I did not hear my master say who he was, or any thing about him—he went away on Saturday, and was to return at six o'clock on Saturday, but he did not return—that was the night of the fire.</p>

               <p>The best books which I have seen were kept up stairs, on the toilet cover—what I have seen in the parlour was "Chambers's Edinburgh Journal," but only a few of them—there were no books in any place besides the toilet in the bed room and the parlour—I should say there were not more than a dozen volumes up stairs, but there was a closet over the parlour with numbers of "Chambers's Journal" in it—I have seen very few books, only numbers—I mean unstitched books—there were no books in the parlour, no volumes, only numbers—I should say it was not possible for 109 volumes of printed books to be in the house, or any thing like that number—there were about a dozen, and no more, up stairs, and some unbound numbers of "Chambers's Journal"—I have seen two or three taken to read from the closed in the parlour—that was the first time I ever saw them—that was one Sun<lb/>day evening, when master went out; and mistress came home with master—Mr. Midgley had them reading—there was no rose-wood sofa table in the front room, second floor—there was no linen-press, with shelves, in that room, nor any chintz drapery for three windows with brass supporters—there were only two windows to the front room—there was no chintz dra<lb/>pery—there were some muslin curtains in the back parlour, but they were not up—there were none at all in the front room—Mrs. Miers bad not any rich silk cloak—only the black silk cloak she had on on the night of the fire, when she went to Fenchurch-street—she had no boa—she had a muff, which was moth-eaten very much—I was desired to take it out into the wash house, and beat it, but I did not beat it then—I was desired to do that a week or a fortnight before the fire—at the time of the fire it was in the box—it was not fit to wear—there was no boa in the house—there were five pairs of sheets and six table-cloths sent away with Mrs. Midgley in a coach—at the time of the fire, there were only the sheets on the beds, except the sheets that went to the wash—there was master's bed, and the bed I slept on—there was a pair of sheets to the bed the boy slept on in the ware house—they were on the bed at the time—I do not know whether my master had any gold watch—I did not hear him speak of any gold watch, till he was in Fenchurch-street—I then heard him speak of one—he was making the in<lb/>ventory of the things lost in the fire, and he named about the watch to me then—he asked if I had seen the gold watch—I said, "No," I had not seen it—only a small silver watch he had in use, with a chain—he was writing down on paper the things that were lost—there was no gold watch in the house that I saw—I never saw one at all in the house, nor ever heard of his having one in his possession—it was a week, ten days, it a fortnight before Christmas that Mrs. Midgley took the trunks away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any plate taken away in those trunks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two table-spoons, two salt-spoons, six tea-spoons, and a fish-slice—I did not see any plate in the house after they went away—the metal table and tea<lb/>spoons were always used after that—in the black trunk there were five pairs of sheets and six table-cloths, and some pillow-cases—I do not know How many—I did not see any of those things come back—my master went with Mrs. Midgley when those things were taken away—I was present in Ingram-court when master was making out the inventory—he described to me a sofa-table—I did not know at the time what one was, but when he described it, I had seen what he described, a table with two leaves and drawers—I remembered that I had seen such a table, but there was no sofa<lb/>table in the house at the time of the fire—he also named to me a sofa, but there was no sofa in the house—master was writing down when I said</p>

               <p>there was none in the house—he told me if I was asked if there was a sofa<lb/>table I was to say yes, if they asked me at the Insurance office—this was on the Tuesday, the day he desired me to go to Ingram-court—nothing else passed between us at that time—he said he had the sofa-table in Ox<lb/>ford-street, but it was sold when they came to High-street—he also mentioned having a polished steel fender and fire-irons in Oxford-street—there were no such things in High-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you sent at any time in February to Surrey-place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one Sunday morning after the fire—it was about a fortnight after the fire I went to No. 30, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road—it was a linen-draper's shop—I saw Mrs. Midgley there, and her sister Miss York, and Mrs. York—Mrs. Midgley and Miss York served in the shop—the next night Mrs. Midgley and Miss York, and a child, came to Ingram-court.</p>

               <p>mistress with a boa—I have seen her with a short ruff, but not a box—it was not a squirrel ruff, it was a plain one—I never saw her me the muff—it was not fit for use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect Mr. Walters dining with your master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he dined there often on a Tuesday—I cannot say How recently before the 20th of January he dined there—it might be a week or a fortnight, or two or three weeks—I waited at table on that occasion, and attended as servant—I was in and out—metal table-spoons and tea-spoons were used on that occa<lb/>sion, the same as usual—at times the gas-lamps in the shop were left burn<lb/>ing all night—they were left low, not full, but about one-third the usual height—I did not observe the lights left so till after I had been there some name—I went up stairs with my mistress about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, as near as I can say, on the night of the fire—we went up stairs together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take the keys of the shop with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mistress's combs were in the candle-stick—as to the keys I cannot say, but I took the keys from the toilet, and gave them to master in the bed-room—I found then on the drawers near master's bedside—there were two keys tied together with a string—master always took the keys of the shop up—they were usually placed on the candlestick, or on the drawers, or on the looking glass—I found them on the drawers—I cannot say positively that the keys were not taken up in the candlestick or by my mistress in her hand—I left mistress in bed, when I left the room, undressed, as usual—when I went up with mistress I left master in the parlour, and master gave me a shilling to go for a shilling's-worth of brandy, which I got in a mug—when I discovered the fire, the parlour door was open, which goes into the parlour—I could see the reflection of the glass—the door was Jocked which leads from the parlour into the shop—that door was usually locked—the parlour door itself was open.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020155"/>
               <p>—if I was in the wash-house, of course, I could not hear—I do not mean to swear that no goods did come in—the lace was kept in boxes in the shop—I have seen the boxes as they have been serving—the boxes were the size of those books there—I cannot say whether they were kept in blue cartridge-paper cases—there were no merino window-curtains there—I was not there when Mr. Smith, the lodger, was there—whether the room was furnished with merino curtains while he was there I do not know—there were no lumber trunks in master's bed-room—there was a closet leading out of master's bed-room with a lumber trunk there—there were holland blinds to the windows—there was no cornice—there was a piece of flat wood on the top of the window, on which the curtains would rest, but there were no curtains up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever look into the trunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took a counterpane out or the kitchen, the same kind of counterpane as the boy had in the ware-house—there were no curtains in the trunk at that time—there were old tassels there, which looked dirty—they were not moreen—tassels are not made of moreen—they were a lightish colour, but dusty and old, not fit to put up—it was small worsted fringe—that is not in general used to moreen curtains—they are generally trimmed with velvet—it depends on the taste of the person—there were tassels, but not much of them—I have seen worsted tassels used with moreen curtains, but they are not used now.</p>

I wag in the habit before the 20th of January last, of going to the prisoner's house changing and in the course of the time I was there I became acquainted with the lines in the different rooms of the house—about six months before the fire I was there for a fortnight or three weeks—the parlour was furnished—the first-floor back room was not furnished, it was entirely empty, and the first floor front, too, was quite empty the prisoner occupied the second, floor front room as his bed room—I removed the furniture out of the second floor back room down stairs during the floor tnight or three weeks that was charing there—there was a stump elm bedstead, a little upright washing stand, a deal table, two mattresses, and a common looking-glass—I know the sort of wooden rollers that it is common for linen-dra<lb/>pers to have silk on—there were none in the second-floor back room—they were in the warehouse at the hack of the house—that was the place I re<lb/>moved the furniture to from the back room second floor—I do not recollect any thing else that I removed from there—there were several wooden rol<lb/>lers in the warehouse—I think I removed those articles about a week before I left—it was the first week I was there—there was a room over the warehouse, that was at the back of the premises—a yard divided it—there was only a sort of loft and a bed-room over the warehouse for the boy—there was a stump bedstead there of the same sort as had been in the back room on the second floor—there was also a common deal washing stand, a plain deal table, a flock bed, and I think three blankets and two bolsters there—there was no furniture in the rooms higher than the second floor—only one of the kitchens were furnished—there were two white dimity curtains to the bed which the prisoner occupied—there was no valance to the top of the bed, there was to the bottom—the furniture of the house was all com<lb/>mon furniture.</p>

                  </hi>. In November last I lived at No. 29, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road—Mr. Miers came to occupy the next house, No.10, and the shop was opened as a linen draper's—before it was opened saw some furniture come—I think that was about the beginning of December, but I cannot speak to dates—I saw a cart of household fur<lb/>niture, and the shop goods together—they were goods that are sold in men drapers' shops—I saw some boxes in which ribbons and Jaces are kept—I think it was in the early part of December that the shop was opened—on the morning of the day it was opened, I observed a coach stop at the door, and Mr. Miers get out of it—he handed out a female, and in me coach was a number of boxes and trunks which were handed out, and carpet bag—I do not know who the female was—she went into the house with Mr. Miers, I believe—I cannot say How many boxes there were—there might be three, or four, or five, I cannot say—I saw the pri<lb/>soner the shop a few days after it was opened—I cannot say whether he was there every day—I saw him there as much as three times—it was in the evening that I saw him—the shop was closed in the early part of Feb<lb/>ruary—I cannot tell the day it was closed—I was from home that week with my daughter who was sick—I have a daughter who can speak to the fact—I observed the shop closed when I came back—I think it was on a Thursday that I returned and saw it closed—it did not open again that I recollect, until very lately. Quite at the end of February, I think—there were then bills in the window stating that the stock was to be sold off on the Monday following—it was open on the 1st or 2nd of March, and two or three days before that. Quite at the latter end of February—on the day I saw the bills in the window, stating that the stock was to be sold off; I observed the shop partly open—the shutters were down—there seemed to be stock in the shop in a confused state—I saw carts and a coach arrive, I think on the 2nd of March—that was not the day the stock was to be sold. but before—there were five small carts and a coach—I saw them go away Full of linen drapery—it was the stock of the shop which was taken away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020164"/>
               <p>—they drove up to the shop—I saw the linen drapery put in—I did not see Mr. Miers there—I had frequently observed coaches coming before that—I cannot state whether any thing was taken away—yes, once I saw a coach go away with trunks, and a carpet bag, similar to the trunks I saw arrive—that was some time before the 2nd of March—I saw the coach take away stock similar to that I had seen arrive in the coach with a female and Mr. Miers—trunks and a carpet bag—I did not see Miers when the coach took away those goods—a respectably-dressed man was with the coach—he get in after the coach was loaded.</p>

On the 22nd or 23rd of February I heard of the sale of a linen<lb/>draper's stock, at No. 30, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road—in consequence of what I heard I went, on the 23rd of February, to Queen-street, Cheapside and from there went with Mr. Jervis to No. 30, Surrey-place, Old Kent road—I effected a purchase there of him of some linen-draper's stock—there were shop marks on those goods—I told Mr. Toplis what those shop marks were, and they corresponded with those which Mr. Toplis had—I bought the stock in the lump, and afterwards disposed of it—among the articles there were a great quantity of satin ribbons—Mr. Jervis did not take down the quantities—it was taken by eye-sight—Mr. Weston took down the particulars—Mr. Jervis went away, and left us there—I paid for the stock—I gave Mr. Weston a cheque for£350 to give to Mr. Jervis—I afterwards disposed of the stock to Messrs. Warren—the stock of ribbons at the Surrey-road bore an extravagant proportion to the rest of the goods—about a fortnight ago I effected another purchase with Mr. Jervis of some shawls—those shawls bore the same shop mark which the other stock had borne—that purchase was effected by my partner at Mr. Jervis's office, in Queen-street, Cheapside—we gave 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for shawels and other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer.

               <p>to let the house in King-street, and wished to get rid of it, as it did not ex<lb/>actly answer his purpose—I bought the furniture to put into my house in Crawford-street—I was to pay 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I married Miss Maria York, a sister of Mr. Miers's wife—he did not know we were married at the time I bought the fixtures of him—she was managing the coffee-shop at the time I married her—I had an idea of having a bill of exchange got, before I bought the fixtures, from an uncle of mine, of the name of Bowler—I afterwards obtained it—Mr. Miers furnished me with goods to the amount of between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of stocking my shop in Crawford-street and while the shop was being fitted up he lent me between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making altogether between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture—when I obtained my uncle's acceptance, I took the bill to Mr. Miers as I had promised him—I gave it to him according to pre<lb/>vious promise—it was for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was drawn by me, and accepted by my uncle—I delivered it to Mr. Miers for the payment of the goods I had, the money lent, and the coffee-house fixtures—it was as security—he was to pay me over the difference when the bill was paid—it had a month to run—if it was paid at the end of the month he was to give me the difference.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having possession of that bill, did you make any purchases of Walters and Co., wholesale warehousemen in Wood-street, Cheapside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the amount of between 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I bought, at different houses, other goods, to the amount of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for the purpose of stocking my shop in Crawford-street, to open it—I expended about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fitting up the shop—the bill became due before I could get the shop ready to open, or rather the same day that I was to open, the 27th of June—it was not paid—the money I expected to receive on that bill was the only means I had of carrying on the business, and opening the shop, or paying for the goods I had purchased of tradesmen, or of Miers—when the bill became due, Miers came to me, and asked what he was to do—I advised him to go to the ac<lb/>ceptor, Bowler, and I went with him—he lived at No. 38, Pickering-place Bayswater—I was not alarmed, as I expected he had not the money then, but would pay it in a few days—he did not pay it when we went to him—he offered to give Miers 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his acceptance for 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Payable at another month or. two months, whichever they liked to agree to—Miers would not accept that, and told him he should bring an action against him for the full amount, unless it was paid—Miers paid it after that to his brother, Thomas Miers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> did you say when yon hired the horse and gig in the name of Gardener that you were going to one Lines in the neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I went down into the country to try to get money to go on with the action without borrowing money—I went to Richard Gardener to ask him to lend me money—I had sufficient money to take me down, and when I got there he would not lend me any money—no, I beg pardon, I did not go to him then—I went to Newport Pagnell—I found it was too far to go, to Lines, and went there—he could not lend me any money, only a few shillings—I intended to go to London, and then take the horse and chaise back—when I got there the horse was so knocked up I could not take it back, because it was rather an old horse—I meant to come to Lon<lb/>don to get the money to pay for the horse—I have no other explanation to offer—I know a person named Bartlett—I did not get him to sell a carpet belonging to Miers, and receive the money as mine—he sold a carpet—itwas not mine—I received the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him not to mention it to Miers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at the time I received the money—after the goods were sent to Bartlett to be sold, Miers began to complain about what I owed him—it was before the arrange<lb/>ment was made—I had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Miers said I owed him money—he wanted me to give the goods up to him, which I did—I directly went to Bartlett not to tell him I had received the money, as he asked me if I had received it, and I had told him I had not, although I had—I told Miers a falseoood, and told Bartlett not to reveal it—Bowler, who accepted the bill, is my uncle—he did not owe me money, but he promised to lend me some—when I went to ask him, he told me he had not got it about him—I then asked him to give me a bill for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came the amount to be 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had borrowed 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him—he asked me to give him some of it—I could not, as I wanted to pay for my stock, which was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he wanted—I told him I could not, unless he put it in the bill, and I would go and bor<lb/>row it of my brother-in-law—he said, very well, I might get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went back and told him I could not get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as my brother-in-law was out, and I never did give him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill was to be for 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to pay him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was to borrow—I do not know where the bill is—it is lost—the verdict was for the defendant, and I have never been troubled about the bill—the money is lost, but the bill is in the Court of Queen's Bench, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not your uncle resist the payment of that bill, on the ground that it was a forgery, that it had been drawn and accepted for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only, and altered to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was his plea, but it was merely to get off the payment—he never mentioned a word about forgery—the defence was, that it had been altered from 10 to 410—the Jury found a verdict for the defendant—I saw the bill when I swore an affidavit here some month be<lb/>fore the trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was there not an alteration on that bill that anybody could see with an eye glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an alteration thus far, that behind it was my name and Robert Miers, and June 27, the day it because due—that was all the alteration—I was to have that bill instead of money—I was not examined on the trial—I believe if I had, the verdict would have been for the plaintiff—I suppose they thought they bad proof suffi<lb/>cient without me—I was in Basinghall-street at the time, at a public-house, waiting to hear the decision—I believe the prisoner was subpoenaed by the de<lb/>fendant—I do not know whether he was called—I never asked him—Thomas Miers was the plaintiff in the action—I never made any agreement about that—I paid the bill to Robert Miers—I was subpoenaed for the plaintiff, and ready to be called—nobody but the attorney knew where I was—I had lived at West Ham for a few days before the trial—I was to be found—I was in London streets every day—I was in London on the Saturday night as the trial was to come on on the 24th of November—it came on very early in December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you heard the verdict was for the defendant, where did you pass the next ten days of your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Westminster-road—people told me there was an officer looking for me on a charge of forgery, but I did not believe it—I was told one night, when I went home to Crawford-street, that there was an officer waiting for me—Mrs. Ashley wished me to go down the area steps, but I would go out at the door—I had sold her some of the goods.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it the prisoner saw you in Whitecross-street, before that letter was written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 19th of January, I desired him to send the property to the coffee-shop—I did not say Mr. Clutterbuck's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say in the letter, "be as good as your word, and send me the things to the coffee-shop, near Oxford-market, that I told you of to-day;" you had seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and told him the coffee-shop near Oxford-market—I did not tell him any name—he asked me what street it was in—I told him I did not know—I did not know there was such a number of coffee-shops near the market, or I might have been more parti<lb/>cular—he was not to tell them my name—that would be of no use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How were you to get them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have gone and asked if the things had been left there for me—they knew me, and where I lived,</p>

               <p>at Clutterbuck's—Miers was to have left his name, or say a young man would call for them who comes for me—the property was to be in small pareeln—50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property, done up in small parcels—I in<lb/>dended to take one away at a time, and sell them.</p>

I was the attoney in for action for the bill of exchange—it was in my custody till the trial—it was on a 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp—Midgley was in attendance to give evidence—he was and public-house in Basinghall-street—nobody except myself knew where have as I expected the defendant's attorney would have had him taken me custody to prevent his being examined—that was the only reason—he was not called, as my counsel deemed it would be more prudent not to state the circumstances relative to the application made by Midgley, and that we should merely prove the handwriting of the defendant—Mr. Butt and Mr. Keating were the counsel—I at first thought the costs might be about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a little more—but I found the defendant's costs were made out to at enormous amount, 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or about that—I took off about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the taxation and brought it to about 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which made the whole costs about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a motion for a new trial—I am not aware whether I personally acquainted the prisoner of the increased amound of costs, but he was aware of it by some means, I know.</p>

               <p>left about the latter end of November, I think—I think we went to Craw<lb/>ford-street in June—we did not open shop there, because it was not con<lb/>denientt—I cannot tell the reason why he did not open it, he gave up the shop and fixtures to Mr. Miers—I cannot tell whether he was indebted to Miers at that time—he was afterwards, to what extent I cannot tell—the transactions between them were, to a certain extent, without my knowledge—I have been to Isleworth occasionally, but not to reside there—I was in Surrey-place, Kent-road—when the shop at Isleworth was given up, the stock came to Surrey-place—about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth came there. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having been in business some time, can you judge the amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is from that I speak, and other things were brought from High-street to amount of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to my judgment, making about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at that plated spoon; was that such a one as you had in your grog? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I cannot tell whether it was such a shape as this—I know it was silver from handling it—as far as I know it was thinner here—I have said that it was stouter, and slanted off here—that is not the sort of spoon—I will swear that it is not the spoon—we have never been paid our account from Midgley—I cannot say what the amount is—somewhere near 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe no part of that has been paid—I have not seen Mr. Jarvis since the prisoner has been in custody, nor any<lb/>body else—I cannot say whether my brother has, but I should think not—my brother has no security for Midgley's account, nor any bill—I left the goods without taking any bill from him—I have never applied for a bill since—I do not know one Clark, as connected with this transaction—not concerning Midgley's goods. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now do you mean to tell us, on your oath, that you have not learnt, since this man has been in custody, that if he was convicted, you would never get your debt, but that you will get it if he is not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, not from anybody—such a statement has never been made to me, nor to my brother, that I know of—I never heard it—this is the first time</p>

               <p>I have heard it—I have not taken any pains, since the prisoner has been in custody, to obtain our debt from Midgley—the goods were supplied Midgley six months ago, I should think—I should think be is not worth farthing—I had no notice from him, nor saw any advertisement from his that he was about to take the benefit of the Act—I never could see him some time—I looked after him after the shop was closed—I am not away that the goods sent to Midgley went to Miers—I have no doubt some of the might—I cannot say that the greater part did—I have inquired of Miers I do not know from Miers that he has bad the goods I supplied Midgley was—I will swear he has not told me so—I applied to Miers for me to a Midgley—I applied to him, because if Midgley did not open, he (Midgley) had better let me have the goods back—I was not aware that the good had been sent to Miers—I did not follow them—I have not seen then a any time—I never went there to see them—they were gauze ribbons and lace goods, to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and plain ribbons—there were three four sorts of ribbons—I could not tell, without I saw the book, why there were—I was never at the shop at Isleworth, or at the shop in Surrey-place—I never knew there was one there till I heard of the goods being taken from there—I cannot recollect who I heard that from—it was talked of in the trade—I did not know it from Miers nor from Mr. Jervis to my knowledge—I have never talked to Mr. Jervis about it, nor about the goods there—I knew the goods were sold to Mr. Brooks, in the he rough—Mr. Brooks told me so—I think he told me he bought then Mr. Jervis.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you on intimate terms with Mr. Miers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was as in mate as most of the other customers. I called there—I have dined they two or three times—it has happened when going round there, that he on oc<lb/>casionally asked me in—he did not tell me that the shop Midgley was to take in Crawford-street was to be his, (Miers's,) or that Mrs. Midgley was to carry it on for him—I never heard him say that he had taken another shop in Surrey-place, and another sister was to carry that on for him—in that he had opened a shop at Isleworth, where he had sent another since to take charge—he never disclosed that to me—I did not know Midgly was under age when I supplied him with the goods in Crawford-street saw he was young, but I thought he was of age, of course, by his appear<lb/>ance—I thought he looked of age—if I had known he was not, I certainly should not have supplied him with goods—I became acquainted with his by his being at Mr. Miers's—Mr. Miers did not tell me he was under age</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any means of judging of his solvency except what you get from Mr. Miers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, except what Midgley said himself that he should have from about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Miers confirmed that—I heard in the course of the winter that Midgley was in Whitecross-street—that opened my eyes that we should never get paid for the goods—I felt satisfied of that—I did not go to the prison—I saw Mr. Miers soon after—I cannot say the day—it was my regular round to call—I said to him, "Mr. Miers, you told me that man was a man of property, and confirmed his own statement of having 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you have let us in for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is very odd"—I was aware before that that we should not be paid, but I did not express my surprise to Mr. Miers—Mr. Miers told me that be was in prison when I called on him—I expected before that be was insolvent, because we did not get our money for our account—I called in Crawford-street, and found he was gone—I found the shop shut up—that was the first intimation I</p>

               <p>had which made me doubt—I believe I called on Mien from Crawford-street—I cannot tell when that was—it was soon after he was supplied with he goods, in the autumn—I asked where he was, and Miers said he did not know—he did not tell me he had served in his shop, and had continued to never there the greater part of autumn—it was a very short time before the here that I learnt he was arrested—let me see, it was about a month before he fire, but I do not speak positively—it is not my duty to keep my brother's accounts, or to know what sums are paid, that is the clerk's duty—his son knows what sums were paid—he is in town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it any part of your brother's practice go round the different shops? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he would know nothing about the pri<lb/>soner's stock—I understood Midgley to represent that he should have the or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from an uncle—he told me his uncle was about receiving his rents, and he had a bill—that was not in Miers's presence—it was up at his own place—I understood from him that he was to obtain the money by bill of his uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether it is the practice to have "dummies" in upper shelves of linen-drapers' shops? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If they want filling up at all—the gas smokes the goods on the upper shelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether it is the practice to have shops in different parts, and in different names? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some houses do open one or two houses, if they are in extensive business—if I had the least doubt about the spoon I used being silver, I would not swear it—our accounts were generally paid by bills—Glover was the name of our clerk—he has left us now, but I dare say we could find him—bills could not have been dishonoured by Miers without my knowing it—I should not have gone on dealing with him If his bills had been dishonoured—we should have made further inquiry—we always considered him a very respectable man—I sold the goods to Midgley, at his house, in Crawford-street—some part of them were sold in our warehouse, and were sent to Crawford-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you, you say parcels are left, and the same person who leaves them comes and takes them away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so—I am not in the habit of receiving parcels directed for other people—if a traveller brings a parcel I would not give it up to anybody but himself—the prac<lb/>tice is, if a person does not wish to take a large parcel, they leave it, and tall for it again.</p>

I was employed in August, 1837, to paint and varnish the front of Mr. Miers's house—that was the last I did to it—I have not received orders to do any<lb/>thing since that time, but in August I received orders to compo or repair the front and put up Mr. Miers's name, but I did not do it in consequence of the weather, the compo not being dry enough to paint—it has never been done—the last time I was in the prisoner's shop was on the 10th of No<lb/>vember—I merely went there to order some goods to be sent to my house, and he said he wished, as soon as the compo was ready, I would finish it and put up the name—I told him the compo was not dry enough, and I did not do it—I did not see him about any thing after that—I was never in the shop after the 10th of November—the goods I ordered then were sent home—I cannot recollect what they were—I have dealt with Mr. Miers some time, and have been in his shop several times—I painted it in</p>

I know both the prisoners—Sarah Bell lives at No.. 2, Lower Chapman-street—on the 18th of March Starkie came to me and asked me to provide her with a lodging, as her husband, she said, had injured her in her employment—I agreed to take her in for a few days—on Sunday Morning John Bell came with her, and brought two boxes, which were put into my kitchen—those produced are the same boxes—on Thurs<lb/>day the 22nd of March, John Bell came to my house with a truck—Starkie was at my house at the time—the boxes were put on the truck and taken away—the officer afterwards came, and I denied her—she did not tell me to do so particularly—I did it of myself, because she had deceived me—I was taken into custody myself, and afterwards liberated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 102, Curtain-road. I have the medical treatment of part of the poor of the parish—on the morn<lb/>ing of Thursday, the 1st of March, I was called to the house where Mills lives, to the ground-floor back-room—the door was locked, and the key had been taken out—I looked through the key-hole, and there saw the body of some person lying apparently dead—I could see by the bed-clothes that there was no vitality, because there was no motion—I forced the door open with my knee, and on entering found the body of a female which has since been proved to be Emma Crips—the features of the face were those of a person who had died in a fit—she was perfectly dead, and from the little warmth that remained, I should suppose she must have been dead, varying from two to three hours—this was near upon ten o'clock in the morning—I cannot say for certain How long she had been dead—I hastily, at that time, looked over her person generally, but preceived no marks of violence about her, and no external cause to accounts for her death—on the table I perceived the fragment of some bread, and little portions of meat, two phials, and two tea-cups—the phials and the tea-caps each of them, appeared to have contained laudanum—by the smell and taste of each of them, I am satisfied of its being laudanum, and I should judge of the usual strength—on one phial was written, "Poison." and on the other, "Laudanum, poison," and part of the label of a particular chemist—I saw two papers on the table—I examined the body of Emms Grips externally, and found no bruises or marks whatever—on the Satur<lb/>day morning, by order of the beadle, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body, and examined the stomach and intestines with care—I could find no traces of laudanum—I found nothing but the remains of the ordinary food</p>

               <p>had taken—I found nothing of a deleterious character, nor any thing induce me to suppose that she had taken poison—I then proceeded to examine the head, and found the vessels of the brain highly congested, and the base of the skull a quantity of bloody serum. Quite sufficient to oc<lb/>cssion oppression on the brain, and to be the cause of death—I found the food of a light meal in the stomach in a state digested—rather in the <hi rend="italic">duo denum</hi> than in the stomach, it had been digested—if laudanum had been taken, at or about the same time with the food, the food would have taken up, the laudanum would have been absent—there was no smell of laud<lb/>anum in the contents of the stomach, and there was nothing to disguise the smell; therefore, had laudanum been present, it would very easily have been detected.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the contents of the two phials, divided between two per<lb/>sons, have been sufficient to cause the death of either of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> very small doses of laudanum, smaller than that, have been the cause of death—three-quarters of an ounce is, with many individuals, about sufficient to scense death—at the same time, by habit, enormous quantities have been taken—the appearance of apoplexy would be the result of having taken landanum into the stomach—laudanum will destroy life sometimes by pro<lb/>ducing apoplexy—that appeared to be the case in this instance—suppose<lb/>ing it to have been taken, there was nothing at all in the appearence I saw, inconsistent with the supposition of death having been caused by taking laudanum.</p>

In April, 1837, I went to lodge at No. 1, Dolphin-place—I did not know the deceased by name—I know an old woman lived in the house—I saw her the night she was brought there, which was about a month or six weeks after the time I went to live there—I saw her in the passage with Mrs. Marriott—she occupied the back parlour of the house No. 2—I should say she occupied it not more than three weeks or a month at the most—after leaving the back parlour, she went into the front kitchen—I was in it the day it was prepared for her reception—there was furniture brought the night she came—she was brought to No. 1 at first—that was the night the furniture was brought—I do not know How much furni<lb/>ture there was—I believe some part of it was sold—I have seen the pri<lb/>soner cleaning up furniture for sale—I do not know whether that was part of the furniture that was brought in for her—I did not see furniture at all—it was brought in the night—there was no furniture is the kitchen subsequent to the day I saw it—I cannot say whether she went into it that night or the next day—Mrs. Marriott said it was being prepared for her reception—I saw her in it the same week—I never heard the prisoner or his wife talking to Mrs. Warner—I never heard her name till after her death—I left on the 14th, and she died on the 19th—I used to ask after her as the old lady—he and his wife used to tell me repeatedly that she was well, and better than I was—I lived there from April till the 14th of February this year—at the time I left the old lady was alive—the servant has been standing at the door, and Mrs. Warner has walked about Dolphin-place, and talked to me—for five months before her death I never saw her out of her room—I have spoken to her in the kitchen before Mrs. Marriott—about the middle of October, I was sitting in the parlour occupied by Mrs. Robinson, in the house No. 1—there came repeated knocks at the door for Mr. Marriot—they were not answered by him—be was not in the house at the time, nor his wife—we went to the door, and I went with Mrs. Godwin—Mrs. Warner was screaming "Murder," and trying to get out—the entrance to the kitchen is from the area of the house No. 1, over a sink—you might go from the house No. 2—when I heard the scream, Mrs. Robinson and Mrs. Godwin went through to the door, out of the area, with a candle—I staid above—I went to the gate to try and find a policeman <hi rend="italic">to come</hi>, but I could not see one—the old lady came to the window—she said that she had got out of bed and could not get in again; and she wanted to get away from there—there was no fire in the room, and she had no light, and it was about half-past eight o'clock at night—she said they had got her clothes—she did not mention names—she said they had got her clothes and furniture—all she seemed to want was to get away—I was absent part of the time while Mrs. Robinson was holding the light—I have spoken to the prisoner about the old lady—I was cleaning a few knives and forks once, and the servant came and locked the door of the kitchen, and jumped over the place where I was standing, which is where the sink is where</p>

On the 8th or 9th of March, 1837, I called on Mrs. Warner, in Cannon-street, at the former Mrs. Reed's house, who was a sister to Mrs. Warner—I had known them a number of years—I always understood that it was rented by Mrs. Reed—I know from passing the lease into the hands of a gentleman named Wood, that the value of it was full 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Reed was not dead then—she died about the 6th or 7th of March—that was after I was sent down there—when I called on Mrs. Warner, on the 8th or 9th of March, Mrs. Reed was dead—I saw Mrs. Warner on that occasion, and had some conversation with her—she appeared in very good health, and very good faculties—her spirits were good—I never saw her in the house in Dolphin-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman. I know the house in Dolphin-place—I knew it from April, last year, down to February in this year—I attended to the lodgers, and worked for two ladies in the house, No. 2, in which Mrs. Warner lived—she lived in the kitchen, and in the parlour, at first—I was never in the parlour while she was there—I remember her living in the kitchen—I once or twice heard her making a noise, and she told me to let her out, and said it was very cold—I asked her if she had any fire, and she said she had no fire, she had only had fire twice while she was there—she told me this about December or January—when I was talking to her the weather was cold—it was that induced me to ask her—I was out<lb/>side the room—I could not get in then—I did get in once—the door was locked—she told me there was no fire—I was not able to see that myself—I looked through the window once in the cold weather, and there was no fire—I saw a screen; that was standing so as to prevent a view of the fire-place—it was something like a shutter—it was before the fire-place—I could not see the grate—I did not see into the room when she said she had no fire—when I spoke to her it was through the key-hole—it was a kind of wooden screen—it was close to the grate, to the best of my knowledge—it was not as a cloak to the chimney, but a cloak to the grate—it was close against the grate, so that I could not see it—I cannot tell whether it was</p>

               <p>touching the grate—it was large enough to screen the grate—I looked par<lb/>ticularly to see if there was any fire, and I could not see any—if there had been a fender before the fire-place, the screen would prevent my seeing that—it was a kind of board, or fire-screen, put against the fire-place—I do not know whether it stood by itself—I could not see any fire, if there had been one, I suppose I should have seen it—the screen was placed up against the fire-place—when I went into the kitchen it was very damp.</p>

On the 20th of February, I was employed by Mr. Target, an undertaker, to take a coffin to No. 2, Dolphin-court—I there saw the pri<lb/>soner and his wife—they went with me into the front kitchen—I there found the corpse of a female lying on a board—I took it from the board, and placed it into the coffin—when we took it off the board, it laid with the knees bent out—that is caused by a body not being laid out properly—it had the appearance to me as though it had died through want—it was in a kitchen below stairs—there was not much furniture in it—there was no carpet, and no bed—there was a tent bedstead, but no fire-irons, no coals, nor any appearance of fire, which made me consider there was very little comfort for a poor old soul to lay there—I had difficulty it placing the body in the coffin, from the position it was in—I could not get the knees down—I was going to put a nail into the coffin to keep the knees down, but I did not, and covered it with a cloth—the prisoner was there part of the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at No. 90, High-Holborn. on the evening of the 26th of February last, I went to the kitchen of the house, No. 2, Dolphin-place, and found the dead body of a female lying in a coffin—I looked at the body, and then returned to the Coroner's jury—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on the view I had of it first it presented an appearance of great emaciation, as if she had died from some lingering disease, or from starvation—on the same day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the immediate cause of death was water on the brain—I cannot tell what that was produced by—it might have been the cones<lb/>quence of disease, but I found no disease except water in the centre of the brain—that is sometimes the effect of inflammation in younger subjects, and dometimes the effect of great exhaustion—it may be caused by some dis<lb/>ease or by extreme exhaustion—we call inflammation disease—any thing may produce inflammation of the brain may produce effusion of water on the brain—I found no disease in the brain sufficient to produce this water—there was only a very slight appearance of inflammation of the mem<lb/>branes, or what I should call lymph, thrown up on the membranes of the brain which is sometimes, I believe, present without inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it does not arise from inflammation, to what other cause can you attribute the appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To great exhaustion—or excitement may pro<lb/>duce it also—it is my opinion that there was no disease apparent that could cause this—there was very great emaciation of the body, and the stomach and bowels were empty, and were collapsed—the heart also was empty, that is, there was a very small quantity of blood in it, not the quantity we usally find in <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What in your opinion did that emaciation arise from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is im<lb/>Possible to answer that question decidedly—it might arise from a want of a proper quantity of food—I am not aware of any thing else—we see that emaciation, when death happens, from diseased lungs; but here the lungs were healthy—water in the brain may be called a disease, but it is more the effect of disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it that inflammation being there, the result of the in<lb/>flammation was water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when the water comes, the inflammation ceases—there are at times, besides water, other appearances to show there has been inflammation, such as large quantities of lymph.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Bush and Masters, and Mr. Masters came—to the best of my belief, I did not leave the room from the time of the cheque's being brought into the room till the arrival of Mr. Masters—I do not know that I saw the cheque given to any<lb/>body after Mr. Masters' arrival—Mr. Mills was in the room, and I think, Mr. Glynn.</p>

This plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at if</hi>) accurately represents the plumber's shop, and the buildings, erecting in Belgrave-square—a person going from the shop to the square would have no business in the Mews, if he went in a direct line—on Friday morning, the 16th of March, I received information from Fitzgibbon, a little before nine o'clock, and followed Buckingham and Holden—I went through a building in Eaton-square, and saw them both in Belgrave-street—Holden was near Eaton-place, and Buckingham had just turned the corner of Chapel-street, which leads to Belgrave Mews—Carr's house is in the Mews—Holden was some distance behind Bucking<lb/>ham—I ran into Chapel-street, and stood by the corner of Belgrave Mews, where I had a view of Carr's house—I stood there about five minutes, and saw Buckingham come out of Carr's house, with the fingers of his right hand in his waistcoat pocket, as if he had put something into his pocket—he had no lead on his shoulder, nor had Holden any that I could see—Buckingham went into the Coachmaker's Arms, a few doors from Carr's—I then returned, and gave information to the police—I accompanied the officer to Carr's house, between twelve and one o'clock—Carr was at home—I asked if he had purchased a piece of lead that morning—he said he had not, that he had been from home to town, to purchase lead, he had been away in short from six that morning—I saw his wife in the shop, and asked her—she said no, there had been no lead purchased—Thatcher, the officer, asked Carr if he would allow him to look round—he said yes, and I believe he also said that was all the sheet lead he had got in the house. pointing to what was in the shop—a few words passed between him and Thatcher, which I do not recollect—I went down into the cellar and found a great quantity of lead—there was sheet lead there—the officers went up stairs and brought down some more lead.</p>

On the morning of Thursday, the 15th of March, I received information from Fitzgibbon, and on Friday, the 16th, I went to Carr's shop, a little before one o'clock—I had seen Buckingham and Hol<lb/>den go there about twelve o'clock, and beard Buckingham ask if Mr. Carr was at home—I was close behind Buckingham—I took him into custody, but found nothing on him relating to this charge—my brother-officer took Holden into custody—after they were in custody I and Thatcher went to Carr's house, a little before one o'clock—he came home while we were there—I told him we had received information that a piece of sheet or gutter lead had been sold there about nine o'clock in the morning, and requested him to allow us to look, to see if we could find it—he at first refused, saying all the sheet lead he had was in his shop—I did not hear Thatcher say any thing further, but he called him on one side—we afterwards asked him if he had not a place down in the cellar where he kept lead—he said "Yes, then is some old lead down there, but no new lead"—we then asked him to let us see what there was—I, and Thatcher, Carr, and, I believe, Adams, went down into the kitchen, and found a quantity of lead doubled up—we brought that away—after moving it out of the cellar, Mrs. Carr was in the shop, and I requested permission to go up stains to see if I could find the lead—she at first refused—Carr was not there—I went up stairs, to the top of the house, and in a cock-loft there was a bed at one corner and a cistern in the other, half full of water, and in that cistern I found the piece of lead rolled up, in much the same state as it is now—there was nobody in the room—I brought it down to my brother-officer.</p>

"I hope you will not make any great disturbance about this circumstance, as I do not wish this person to know any thing about it," meaning the person that was going to the public-house with him—I do not know who that was—I searched and found a quantity of lead in the kitchen—Edwards found a piece of lead in a extern, and gave it to me in a wet state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Seth Smith.

               <p>not in custody, got out—they walked up into the Marsh, pulled off all their clothes except their trowsers, shook hands, then fell back, and Blaker and my brother began to fight—Curtis picked Blaker up for the three first rounds, and put him on another person's knee, who I do not know—Mason then came running across the Marshes, and shook hands with Blaker—Curtis every now and then gave Blaker something out of a bottle—Mason acted as Blaker's second after Curtis ceased to pick him up—Curtis remained till the fight was over, and so did Mason—Sullins and Tantony seconded my brother—they fought about thirty-five minutes, as near as I can guess—I saw Blaker then strike my brother with his right hand under the left ear, and he fell down—it was a violent blow—he fell right down, and never rose any more till he was picked up—he was alive, but not sensible—he did not speak at all—I did not see him move—I saw Blaker get up and put on his clothes—I saw Mason take him a few yards, and tell him to lie down—he felt in his pocket for a knife to cat his, eye, to let the blood out, as his face was swollen—my brother was put into a boat—I saw him again about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, at his lodging—he was lying there—the doctor had just bled him—he was not sensible—he died about ten minutes after two o'clock—it was a fair fight, at well as I could see.</p>

I was sent for home, on the 27th of March, about half-past three o'clock—when I got home, I found Hoadley in my house, and Nelms at the door—Hoadley brought some lead, and put it on my shop-floor—he wanted me to buy it—I would not—I sent for May and Mr. Munday—I delivered the same lead to Smart—there were 541bs.—I weight it in presence of Mr. Mundy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Woolwich police. In consequence of information from Strother, I followed a cart that left his premises, loaded with coal, and in Brewer-street I saw the prisoner Baker take a sack full of coals from the cart, and go into a side gate of some premises, where a new house is, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—I followed him—he was in the cellar when I got in the premises, the coals were shot out, and he had the sack over his arm—there were coals in the cellar where he was, when I got there, which was about a minute after he got in—the prisoner Cutten was also in the cellar, he seemed to have been at work at a carpenter's bench—there was about four sacks of coals in the cellar—I took Baker into custody—he said he was not robbing his master, he would make it all right—he said the coals were going to the artillery barracks, and his master would not be the loser—I told Cutten I took him into custody for receiving these coals, knowing them to be stolen—he said he knew nothing about them, his son had or<lb/>dered them—before I got to the cellar I heard a question asked, "Shall I settle with you now?"—I believe that to have been Cutten's voice—there were no other persons to have spoken but Baker and Cutten—the cart was a few yards from the spot—the answer I heard made was, "I will see you on Saturday night"—I believe that it was Baker said that—I took pos<lb/>session of the empty sack, and took some coals, that appeared uppermost, off the heap—I had not lost sight of the cart above a second between the prosecutor's premises and the time the sack was taken out—there was not time for any one to put a sack into the cart.</p>

The prisoner, King, was in my father's employ five or six months—in consequence of inform<lb/>ation, on the 14th of March I mixed some corn in a particular way, so that I might know it again—I cut some brown paper, and mixed up with it—I put it into the boot of the Bexley Heath coach to go to Blackheath, where we send a lot every day for the horses—I did the same with a different shade of paper on the 15th, and put that into the coach—on the 16th I did the</p>

On the night of the 16th of March, I was on duty in New-street, and heard a noise at the back of Mrs. Criddle's house—I went to see what it was, and saw the prisoner Fawcett in the prosecutrix's kitchen, with another man, who I believe to be the other prisoner, according to his height, dress, and general appearance, but would not swear to him—I stopped a short time, and saw them open the dresser<lb/>drawer, and take out a table-cloth, a purse, and several other things, and place them on the dresser—they took up a pair of gentlemen's boots, and put them down again—I got over the wall, and disturbed them, and Fawcett hit at me with a hair-broom which he had in his hand—they got over several walls, and parted in different directions—I followed Fawcett—he got over a wooden fence, and left his hat behind him—he came to a ditch by the side of the Zoological Gardens—he could not get over that, but he got over a wall, and my brother constable' caught sight of him the moment I lost him did—the other man got away, and was taken next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Henry Rivers, who keeps the Fox and Hounds, at Southwark. The prisoner came to my shop on Friday, the 16th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock—he asked for three half-pennyworth of gin, and offered a half-crown—I said it was a bad one, and I pushed it towards him—he said it was not a bad one, I did not know a bad one from a good one—I took it, and put it on a back table, and said, whether bad or good I would not return it, and made a motion to a lad to fetch a policeman, which he did, and took him—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—he said I had better mark it, which I did.</p>

               <p>to the best of my recollection, the diamond-ring was the only professional business I did for him before making the codicil to the will—he came to my house at Penross, which is within a mile of Carnarvon, on that business—I did not know of any will made by Mr. Williams of Beaumaris—all I saw was the settlement on the son's marriage, and the will of 1828, and the codicil—he did not mention a word to me of any prior will that he had made—I took instructions from his mouth, as to the alteration he wished to make in dis<lb/>posing of his property—it did not appear to me to be rather a new will than a codicil to an existing will—I do not recollect what part of the will was to remain in force—his instructions were, that neither Mrs. Hamilton nor Mrs. Williams should take any part of the unsettled property, or per<lb/>sonal property, except 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the one, and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other, and every thing else was to go to his son, Barton—he did not tell me whether to prepare a codicil or another will—he left that to me, and I thought it would be more convenient to have a codicil, otherwise I should not have done so—no person was present when he gave me instructions—I do not know where the prisoner and his wife were living at that time—I know Brynbras Castle, it is four miles from Carnarvon—I have known the prisoner a great number of years—he resided at Brynhras Castle in good style, I believe—I was not on visiting terms with him, and never had been so—I should not know Mrs. Williams if I were to see her now—I believe Mr. Williams had ceased to practise as a solicitor for a good many years—he had no clerks or establishment as a solicitor, to my knowledge—when Mr. Barton Panton made his proposals to my daughter, I was aware of the will which his father bad made in his favour—I believe Mrs. Hamilton was at that time living at Chester—after I had made the two codicils for Mr. Panton, I believe I distrained for rent on some tenants of his—that was all I did for him, to the best of my recollection.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Carnarvon, and am a slate merchant. I knew the late Mr. Panton, the testator—I remember the marriage of his son, the prosecutor, with Miss Williams, the daughter of Mr. Rumiey Wil<lb/>liams—I had been requested to negociate that marriage—I know the tes<lb/>tator was gratified at that marriage having taken place—I know he said before the marriage that he highly approved of the match; and if the par<lb/>ties would live with him till the time of his death, that Mr. Barton Panton should have the bulk of his property—I was on intimate terms with the late Mr. Panton from that occasion—there was a sleeping-room in his house called after me; and in the hunting season, I was frequently a guest at his house—he appeared very much attached to his son Mr. Barton Pan<lb/>ton—I remember the birth of their little girl—the old gentleman was par<lb/>ticularly fond of the child, and very anxious about her safety and welfare on all occasions—I remember in May, 1837, making an engagement to go to Chester Races—Mr. Barton Panton was to have been my companion—the races commenced on Monday the 1st, and lasted the whole week—I in<lb/>tended to go on Thursday the 4th, but we did not go; for on the evening on the 3rd, on my arrival at Plasgwyn, the old gentleman expressed his particular wish that we would postpone our visit—he said he had par<lb/>ticular business to transact with Mr. Barton Panton the following morn<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020311"/>
               <p>—he said be was not in as good health as usual, and did not appear so—he had a severe cold—I believe he died in the seventy-sixth year of his age—I slept there that night—on the morning of the 4th of May, Mr. and Mrs. Barton Panton breakfasted with the old gentleman, and the little girl was present—on Mrs. Panton and the child leaving the room after breakfast, the testator gave Mr. Barton Panton the key of his library, and desired he would go up stairs in the library, and in the left hand cupboard he would find a roll of papers scrawled or figured on the outside, and he was to bring them down to his father—he did so; and after his bringing them down, the old gentleman took them out of his hand, and then handed them back to him—he said, "Here, Barton, these are Bank receipts for stock (or funds) to the amount of from 28, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 29, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I give you these, and on about 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of them no dividend has been re<lb/>ceived for ten years, since 1827"—he then said, "Now, Barton, I think you have staid at home to some purpose"—he then told him he gave him all the money he had in the house—all the money he had in the hands of his bankers, Messrs. Douglas, Smalley, and Co., at Holywell and Mold, and in the banking-house of Williams, Granville and Co., at Chester and Carnarvon—he then said he gave him all the arrears of rents due on his respective estates, and all the rents that would accrue due to the time of his death—his daughter was not mentioned in the course of the conversation at all—he then said, "I give you all my share and interest in mining concerns, all my canal shares, all my securities for money, all my plate;" and he handed him the key of his plate-chest—he said, "I give you all my books," hand<lb/>ing him the key of the library at the same time—"I give you all the wine in the cellar," handing him the key of the wine-cellar; "and all my farming stock, and personalty of every kind"—he said, "Take great care of all, particularly of Ann and little Missy, as I can't be long with you"—he then said he had desired I would not go in the morning before breakfast, as he wanted me to be present to witness that transaction; and he expressed a wish that I would call on Mr. Rumsey Williams for a parcel which I was to take with me to Plasgwyn the next time I went there; and he said the next time he saw me he would give me his reasons for wishing me to stop over that morning—I called on Mr. Rumsey Williams, but I did not get the parcel—the word the old gentleman used was, "a parcel of his," and I was not able to tell Mr. Williams what parcel he wanted—I called at Plasgwyn on the Monday following—the Sunday was very tempestuous—I was in the habit of going on Sundays, but I put it off—I told Mr. Panton what took place about the parcel, and he expressed his surprise that Mr. 'Williams had not known what he wanted, as it was his will he wanted—he said I should call again on Mr. Williams, and bring the will over the next time I came to Plasgwyn.</p>

"It was the will Mr. Panton wanted, I am going there this evening, have you any com<lb/>mands</hi>?—9th May, 1837."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember having mentioned the will, the testator saying any things to Mr. Barton Panton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told him it was the will under which he would take all his unsettled estate, and he said to me, "When you called on me previous to the marriage of Mr. Barton Panton with Miss Williams, I told you if they lived with me to the time of my death,</p>

               <p>that Barton Panton should have the bulk of my property at my decease," and that was the reason he wished me to stay, that I might see that realised—this was on Monday, the 8th of May—on the 13th of May, I received intelligence with respect to the state of health of the tes<lb/>tator—I went to his house in consequence—I found him very poorly—I went on the 13th—he died on the 26th of that same month—between the 13th and the 26th, I was occasionally backwards and forwards there, to see the old gentleman, either late or early, I believe every day, till his decease—he did not say any thing to me, to my re<lb/>collection, with respect to the transaction I had witnessed—I was at the funeral of the old gentleman—the prisoner was there—he came very late, just as the remains were about being removed into the hearse—he went to the funeral with the rest—I did not see him after the service had been read and the ceremony had been performed, not after he left the churchyard—in Wales, after the funeral of the deceased, it is generally the case, that parties expecting to be interested under the will, go in to hear it read—I went with Mr. Barton Panton and Paul Panton—the prisoner did not go in at all, and in consequence of that the will was not read—I know the prisoner's hand-writing—I have seen him write.</p>

               <p>No. 4.—"The illness of your sister takes me out of the country, and you have refused, on two or three applications, a meeting of those interested is the settlement of you and her father's affairs.

"Sir,—By my messages to you, requesting you to appoint a day to represent your father's affairs, I had no wish to occasion any angry feeling. Naturally, I would be anxious to have that day appointed before I left the country, and your last note puts it off for a few days longer, which will pre<lb/>vent me attending the meeting. I do not consider this acting very fairly towards your sister, and I think that your father-in-law will tell you the same, and will also tell you that you cannot; that I cannot allow you to prove your poor father's will, to which you allude in your note of yesterday, to be proved, without its being even shown to the family. Mr. Boggie, during our absence, will represent your sister and myself, and he being an honourable man, will do every thing that is just and fair to all parties; and in respect to the caveat, I did call on Mr. Boggie yesterday, at Beaumaris, after the receipt of your note; that I did not mind the threat of it, and desired him to enter it accordingly; however, appoint an early day, and after hearing from Mr. Boggie, I will tell him what to do, and we will endeavour amicably to carry into effect your poor father's intentions; for whom I had great regard, and he also for your sister and myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether your father left the house on that Sunday you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never left the house, he was too poorly—I and my wife were both there—my little girl was unwell at that time—I remember Mr. Rumsey Williams coming to Plasgwyn in a few days after that—I saw him in the room with my father on that occasion—my father called me to him, and gave a large paper parcel, saying it was his last will and codicils, and he told me to take them and lock them up—I locked them up in my dressing-room, and kept them there till after the death of my father—after the death of my father I sent notices appointing the day of the funeral—I appointed the 2nd of June—I sent to all the relatives, and amongst the rest to the prisoner—I was present at the funeral—the parties as<lb/>sembled at the house at Plasgwyn, all but the prisoner—I sent over for him to his brother's house at Rhulass, which is a quarter of a mile off—when the remains were put into the hearse the prisoner joined the procession—after the funeral I returned to the house, and so did all the parties but the pri<lb/>soner—I did not read the will that day, because the prisoner was not pre<lb/>sent—the will was on the table to be read, but the prisoner not being there, and I wished him to be present, I did not read it—I saw the prisoner after that—he and his brother came in a gig on the 5th of June, I think—I do not know what day of the week it was—I saw him, he asked if I had any thing to say to him—I said no, I was busy arranging and looking over my father's papers—he did not say any thing to that—he went off—after that I received the note from him marked No. 3—I after<lb/>wards received No. 4, which states that no will should be proved till it had been shown, and he would enter a caveat—I sent an answer to that—after that I received a letter from him, dated the 6th of June—I afterwards fixed the day for reading the will, the 9th of June—the prisoner did not attend—the will was then read by Mr. Robert Williams—Mr. Boggie was not there—Mr. Bulkley Williams, the prisoner's brother, Owen Owen, and my brother Paul, were there—the prisoner's brother came after the will was read—he saw the will and codicils, and took notes of the will and codicils—by that will I was appointed the sole executor, and I took steps to get it proved in the Prerogative Court—I advertised some property for sale on the 26th of July—up to that 26th of July I did not hear from the prisoner, or any one else, that he had a will—he had not made any representation of that sort to me, and Ihad heard of none—it was on the day of the sale that I first heard of any will the prisoner had—that was the first notice I had of it—I gave instruction to oppose the proof of those wills when I heard of them—I think it was about the 7th of February that I first received any information of these wills being written on obliterations of pencil—that was after the commission had been down Wales to examine wit<lb/>nesses—I am the prosecutor in this case—these are the stock receipts that I received, and which were put away by me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>—they amount to between 28, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 29, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know of Mr. Williams having made the codicil in 1831? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know my father went to Mr. Williams that year, but I do not know what it was about—it might be about the year 1830 or 1831, that I first began to show attention and pay my addresses to Mr. Rumsey Williams's daughter—it was before 1830—I had known the family some time—it was known to Mr. Williams before 1830, that I was paying attention to his daughter—I used to go to Penross to visit her—not very often—Mr. Williams sometimes saw me, and was aware of the object of my visit—that was before my father went to Mr. Williams in 1831—I had nothing to do with bringing Mr. Rumsey Williams and my father together—my father did not tell me of Mr. Williams having made a codicil to his will, nor did any one else—I do not know that my father went there to have his will made or altered—be told me the contents of the will under which I now claim, just before his death—he had told me that I should have the whole of his property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you so in 1826? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me so often, and often he told me he had made a will in my favour—he did not tell me so in the life of my brother Jones, but he did after his death—he said my sister, Mrs. Hamilton, was very well off, that she had married a gentleman of good property—he was not on very good terms with Mrs. Hamilton—there was no quarrel—my father used to pay a visit to Brynbras Castle once in the year perhaps—he staid over the night and returned—that was only once a year—he was not fond of being away—Mr. and Mrs. Williams used to come to Plasgwyn—they once stopped a night there—the prisoner was in the profession of the law</p>

               <p>—he gave it up soon after he married my sister—he had no longer toy establishment as a lawyer—he had not managed any affairs of my father latterly—he used to go up to London, and my father spoke to him about some town property that he had—I do not dink he had the sole management of that property—he might have something to do with it—my father did not correspond with him about it—the prisoner used not to come to Plasgwyn without my sister—my father conversed with him about this town property—I was on good terms with my sister—she was living at Brynbras Castle with her husband in February last, I believe—I knew then that there was a suit going on in the Ecclesiastical Court respecting the wills—I wanted to establish my father's will—there was a commission came down to Carnarvon—I did not attend it—I gave instruc<lb/>tions for proceeding against my brother-in-law, soon after I heard of the pretended will—I do not think I knew any thing of it till the 26th of July—I heard nothing about it—about the 12th of February I heard there was another will, and gave directions for my brother-in-law being apprehended at Brynbras Castle—I gave directions for Ann Williams and Ellen Evans being apprehended—I did not give directions that they should be carried to London immediately, I left that to the Magistrate—this was not at Carnarvon—I merely went to the Magistrate in London for a warrant—Mr. Rumsey Williams came to London with me—I cane to get the warrant—I came to consult my solicitor—I came to town on the 12th of February—the examination of witnesses under the commission was closed before then—no one came with me, but Mr. Ramsey Williams—I came to get the warrant executed against Mr. Williams, and Ann Williams, and Ellen Evans—I gave no orders for the prisoner's paper to be seized—they may have been seized—I know that Ann Williams and Ellen Evans have been indicted in another indict<lb/>ment, with Mr. Williams, for forging this will—I suppose they were to be tried on that indictment—my father purchased one or two estates for me, which were conveyed to me in his lifetime, perhaps to the amount of a couple of thousands, or more—he did not give me large sums of money besides—when I wanted, he gave me what might be called pocket-money—I am of no profession—my brother Paul was living in Shropshire—my brother Thomas died on his passage home from India—I know my father's hand-writing—I do not believe this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) to be my father's hand-writing—it is like it, but the manner of hand-writing is not like his—the forming of the letters is not like his—the "W," the "H," and the "R," are all unlike his, and the figure, and the "P" of Plasgwyn—this is certainly not my Father's hand-writing—I should say I am convinced of it—I have seen the address sufficiently—this is not my father's hand—it is like it—it is a good imitation—I think it is not my father's hand-writing—to the best of my knowledge, I believe it not to be my father's hand-writing, as far as I have seen it—this other paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is not my father's hand-writing—this certainly is a better imitation of his writing than the other, but it is not my father's hand-writing—I am positive of it, and will swear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this, scrip No. 7? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is not my father's hand-writ<lb/>ing, nor any part of it—if this pretends to be my father's hand-writing, it is a forgery—I can take my solemn oath it is not my father's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>which you have shown me, which are marked "9" and "7"—I have seen them before—I have always been of opinion they were forgeries—I saw them be<lb/>fore the Magistrate—I never had the slightest doubt about their being for<lb/>geries—on the 4th of May, 1837, my father was poorly—he complained of a cold at the time he made the parole will in my favour—I knew of no will whatever, except what my father told me—he did not tell me on the 4th of May, when he gave me the roll, and so on, that he had made a written will in my favour—I knew he had made his will—he did not tell me he had made a will in my favour—he gave me the key of the library, to go up stairs and get this roll, and he gave me the key of the library, with the roll of paper—I offered the key to him, and he said, "No, keep it along with the roll of paper"—I offered him the key directly after I brought the roll of paper down—he then desired me to keep the key, he gave it me along with the roll of paper, and then he said he gave me his books—I was going to thank him, but he stopped me—Mr. Bettiss was there—I believe my wife was in the next room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You employed Mr. Bettiss to remove any difficulty in the way of the match? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as a friend—he is my wife's uncle—he has nothing to do with this prosecution whatever—about the 5th of June Mr. Williams called—he sent for me—I came to him—he did not mention that he wished to see the will under which I claimed—I was up in the library, busy—he sent in to me—I came down, and saw him—he said, "Have you any thing to say to me?"—I told him I was busy, and he drove away instantly—nothing more was said—I saw no more of him for a length of time—I had no communication at all with Ellen Evans or Ann Williams before they were taken up—I knew them by sight, during the time they were in service at Mr. Williams's, but never spoke to them in my life—I have not applied to the Ecclesiastical Court to delay publication of the evidence till after this trial was over—there might have been an application to delay publication—I did not wish to delay publication till after the trial—I was not in court at any time when any application to that purport was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first say that these papers that are marked "7" and "9" were forgeries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said the whole of them were forgeries—I did not allude to one or two—I never had any doubt in my own mind that these two were forgeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not at first, when Mr. Williams's wills were set up, say that your father was drunk when he signed these papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I never said that of my father, that he was affected by liquor—I did not say that Ann Williams could not write—I said I thought she could not write—I believed she could not write—I might assign as a reason why the wills attested by her were forgeries, that she could not write—I did so, now recollect, and also said that John Williams could not write—I heard so.</p>

I think that was on the 2nd of March, or at the beginning of March—I examined them all—I think there was one without any traces on it—I do not know the number of it—they would not allow me to take notes, and I forget—I observed one of the foolscap sheets was penciled on the right-hand side, but not the left—I think I can show the one that has not the pencil marks—I was able to trace letters and words—I have seen the papers to-day, and am able to trace and point out with a pen, or any instrument, letters, and words on many of these papers—I could point out to the Jury letters, and figures, and marks, on many of these papers—I have not any doubt that the pencil marks on the papers have been attempted to be rubbed out—it appeared to me that the pencil marks had been rubbed out—I am able to tell what appeared to me to have been in pencil previous to the writing on No. 2, which is the plainest.</p>

               <p>"Bishopgate"—they are written in large bold round bind, not capital let<lb/>ters—I can see, on the right-hand side, the word "Cursitor," and the word "street" following it, written in the same character, with double lines—I then find a line drawn across the paper from one extremity to the other—a doable line—there are lines nearly all over the paper, dividing it into it com<lb/>partments, perpendicularly and at right angles with them—in these com<lb/>partments there are words which I could make out—I can see in all the compartments there is writing—some I can see—I can see the two words "M ground lot," written in letters not quite so large, but of a smaller charac<lb/>ter than the former ones—I can see the letters "Cur," but I cannot by this light make out the remainder of the word—I can see the words "vacant ground," and under the word "Cursitor" I can see figures, but I cannot dis<lb/>tinctly by this light make out what they are—that is under the letters "Cur"—I discovered these words during the time the examination was going on, while the commission was sitting—I am not quite certain whe<lb/>ther there was any question about any property is London—I did not, on nuking this discovery, communicate it to any one immediately—I did sub<lb/>sequently to the substitute for the proctor for Mr. Panton; but he, pre<lb/>viously to my naming it, had himself discovered the marks on the papers—the documents were never out of my custody during the whole of the ex<lb/>amination, with one exception, when I delivered them to the commissioner, one morning, sealed up in my portmanteau—I returned them in the same state I received them—there were no marks of any kind put on them by me—I am not quite clear who was sitting—it was my duty to deliver them to the registrar who was then sitting, and I did so.</p>

               <p>the adverse party of it—it would have been my duty, if I had dis<lb/>covered marks on the scrips, to have made a notarial copy, but I did not discover them—I have seen the marks since—I rather think Mr. Jennings pointed them out to me—he certainly was present when my attention was called to them—he pointed out that there were pencil marks—some I saw and some I did not—he said, "There is a letter—and there is a letter—and there is a line"—I saw lines, I did not see any letters, nor other marks but the double lines that day—I have since seen some other marks on the same paper—they were flourishes—they might be parts of letters, or parts of figures but I could not discover any marks so as to make out any letter or figure—I looked with a magnifier—Mr. Adlard described, in his examination at Guildhall, that he could make out certain words on some of the papers—I did not look at the places he pointed out at that time—I had not an oppor<lb/>tunity—I can now see a double line down the paper—here it is, on the left-hand side—it appears to be one line—I could, if there were light enough, point out to the Jury where I discovered what I considered to be parts of letters or figures—it is on the same paper, a little to the left of that—it appears to be pencil marks—I could not say that they had been obliterated—I saw the black line of what appeared to me to be a common pencil mark—I have no doubt I could point it out—I tried see lines the other way, and could not see them—no one traced the lines, or the figures or letters, I did it for my own satisfaction—I traced them with a glass—this is the only paper on which appeared to be pencil marks—I could not make any marks out on any of the others—the nibbing which I saw, had the appearance of dirt in the middle of the paper—if I had seen that when I first had it in my possession, it would have been my duty to have ascertained what it was, and whether it would have been proper to have a notarial copy of it—my opinion of it now is, that it has been rubbed in some way for the purpose of obliterating something—it would have been my duty to have called the attention of the registrar to it if I had observed it, but I did not—the mark of this line down is so plain that I think I must have seen it—I do not say that a casual observer would, but the papers having been be<lb/>fore me several times I think I must have observed it—I do not mean to take my oath that the line was not there, or that the rubbing was not to—the papers have been very much torn since.</p>

               <p>line going down the paper, it does not come down quite so far as the double line in one case, but in the middle of the paper it comes down to that line, and seems to join it—there are other lines drawn across the paper, and at right angles—if I turn the paper up, I can read the word "Devonshire," and there are numbers under it, and above it there is "Ground," and what appears to have been "Vacant," but the letters are very indistinct—the word "Court" I can read—I can see there are letters before the word "Court," but I cannot distinguish them—above that I can see what appears to me to be "13," and "12" above that—here is more writing between "12" and "13" and "Court"—here is what ap<lb/>pears to be a "v a n d"—I think I can distinguish a G, an r, part of an o, and a d; and a letter has been between them, which I cannot make out—above that there is a "u," an "r," part of an "S," an "i" and a portion of a "t," I think, very much rubbed—in following that line on, I think I can make out the word "Street."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many years have you been in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years—I attended two commissions—they were not both the prosecutor's—I got down on the morning of the 5th of January—I went to the Goat Inn, at Carnarvon, and proceeded to open the commission the same morning—there was a mistake subsequently dis<lb/>covered in the commission—I did not come back, but I went away from Carnarvon altogether, in consequence of being informed there was a strong jealousy in the family—I went to Chester, and went by the rail-road to Liverpool, Manchester, and some other places—I took all my papers with me, and returned on the Wednesday, and the same day we opened new commission—when I opened the commission I kept my papers in my bed<lb/>room, locked up in a cupboard, the key of which I kept in my pocket, and the key of my portfolio also—I left the Goat in order to open the commis<lb/>sion, and I am not aware that I left it at any other time with the papers in the house—I might have left it for five or ten minutes—I did not go out to dinner the whole time I was there—part of the time there was no key to the door, and I had the door sealed—I never left the Goat without having the papers locked up, or a paper on the door sealed with my own seal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it less trouble to get the key than to get a candle, and seal the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had candles burning in the room, and when I went out I took one candle with me, and put a seal across the door, till the lock was mended—it was two days before the lock was mended, but I did not Jeave the Goal—I believe I was on the same floor—I sealed the door because it would have flown open—I do not know that I always sealed it with paper—I might once, but I sent for some tape to do it with—I only went to my dinner</p>

               <p>in the next room but one, and when I returned I found the seals all right—I broke them, and went in—I locked the papers in my bed-room some<lb/>times—that door did not require sealing, because there was a lock to the door, and to the cupboard—Mr. Tyrer looked at these papers very casually, and said, "I see marks on these papers"—that was subsequently to the 16th of January, I think it was after the closing of Wadeson's commission. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had your door mended before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I moved from one room to another, and that had a very good lock—I had made the discovery before I moved—I had got a key to the door before I made the discovery, because that room never was without a key—I required the key to be given to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been there before it was necessary to seal your door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the extension of the time, after the commission recom<lb/>menced—after the term pottery expired, I came to town, and brought my papers sealed up with me—I finally brought up the scrips in the beginning of February, the 3rd or 4th—they were not lodged in the Court till the 13th, but they were sealed up in my iron safe till that time—I never produced them in Court—I made a facsimile of them in Wales, after I discovered the marks on them—I made it all on tracing-paper—the part that was in ink, and drew the pencil marks distinctly from it—that was after I made the discovery, and during the time the commission was there—Mr. Tyrer obtained the tracing paper at my request—no one helped me to make them, but they were examined after they were made—no person assisted me in making the copies—I am not certain whether or not Mr. Tyrer was present at any part of the time; in met, I think he was present at part of the time—I think it probable he was present during the time I was copying the pencil marks, because I did them by day-light—he examined the copies—I considered it my duty to make these copies—I did not put down all, as there is on one of these scrips "nee," which I did not see at first, and did not put that down—I put down every thing else, I think, as far as I can call to memory—I put them also in the same position as nearly as I could, because I put them in governed by the mode I have named—there may be a little variation in some of them, but, gene<lb/>rally speaking, they are correct—I did them in that way—I came to town on the 4th or 5th of February—no one came with me—I brought the fac<lb/>similes I made to London—they were delivered up afterwards by direction of counsel at Guildhall, to Mr. Bodkin—I gave them to him by his direc<lb/>tion, he stating that it was my duty to do so—I made them for the Court originally, that it might be seen what discoveries I had made on the papers—when I came to town I showed them to various persons, officers of the Court—I attended at Guildhall with them—I went down to Carnar<lb/>von again—the commission was over then—my own feeling took me down—I did not go with the officers—they went one or two days before me—I had made the discovery, and was very anxious about it—I do not recol<lb/>lect the day I went—I did not go with the officers to Brynbras—I came up with one of the officers and Ellen Evans, in a post-chaise, having taken a place outside the mail, but it was so cold we could not go by it—Mr. Tyrer might have been in another post-chaise with Ann Williams, but I am not aware of it—I never saw him coming up, or in a chaise—I did not see him on my way up—I saw him at Carnarvon, at the Groat hotel—I saw Mr. Rumsey Williams at his own house, at Penross—I did not sleep there—I dined there—Mr. Barton Panton was not there—we most probably talked</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not put many questions to Ellen Evans as you came up with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Various questions—she was in custody of Dodd, the officer, at that time—I did not tell her she was in custody for forgery—I gave her a sovereign, upon her stating that she had but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her pocket, and that was not her own, and she did not know what she should do—that was at the inn, at Oswestry—I did not see Mr. Tyrer, nor Ann Williams, in coming up—I went down with Mr. Rumsey Williams—I gave no directions to Dodd about Ellen Evans's box—it was not at my instance that the pri<lb/>soner's papers were seized—the prisoners were all apprehended before I got there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you made fac-similes, did any body else do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—no person whatever had a copy of these fac-similes—before I gave them to Mr. Bodkin, Ruthven, the officer, had possession of two of them for two or three days—as I was going down from London to Bangor I saw Mr. Tyrer and Ann Williams at Tyn-y-Maes—no one was with me then—Mr. Rumsey Williams travelled with me, but he went on by the mail—I stopped because Ann Williams was there—it is a small public-house, the only place there is there—I went into the house, and remained three-quarters of an hour—I did not see Ellen Evans—I saw Ann Williams, and asked her some questions, and I believe Mr. Tyrer did, and then I went on to Bangor, in a closed car—I slept at Bangor that night, and then went on to Carnanron—I paid my own expenses—I do not know that anybody asked me to go—Mr. Rumsey Williams did not ask me—I went down, both from curiosity and the love of justice—I drew a statement which the Court directed me to give in, in consequence of the state of the papers coming to their knowledge—I drew the statement by the judge's direction—I drew the pe<lb/>tition at the request of Mr. French, because I was in possession to the papers—it was for permission to plead—the papers are not before the Court, and it was necessary to state them—it was merely a formal petition to the Court for permission to give in a fresh allegation—the publication cannot pass if a plea is permitted to be given in, but the publication was stopped before I gave that in—I drew it a fortnight or three weeks ago, imme<lb/>diately after Mr. Wadeson withdrew his allegation.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long hare you been clerk to Mr. Rumsey Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since the 14th of October last—I had been in other service before—I had never acted in a commission of the Ecclesiastical Court before—I had my instructions from Mr. French—I cannot fix the day on which I first saw these scrips—it was after Mr. Wil<lb/>liams's witnesses had been examined—the first time I saw them I observed marks on them, and I asked Mr. Jennings if I might inspect them, as part of our case was to prove that one of the attesting witnesses could not write, and I wished to look at the signature—it was merely out of curiosity—Mr. Priest, of the Bank, at Carnarvon, and Mr. Owen Owen, had seen the scrips—when I saw them I immediately saw some marks—Mr. Jennings was lodging at the Goat—I was there every day, and I saw his room sealed up every day during his dinner-time—not more than two days—the papers were only sealed up in one room—that was after the time for the examination had been extended—the door was sealed with a piece of paper put across—I held the candle while Mr. Jennings sealed it—he did not ask me to do it—he only sealed it twice while he went to his dinner, and he dined with his door open—his door was only sealed twice, to the best of my recollection—it was sealed, I think, with paper—I am not aware that it was ever sealed with tape—I dined with Mr. Jennings several days—Mr. Wadeson did not—he was asked, but did not do it—I think I might positively say I dined fif<lb/>teen times with him, if not more—we had our dinner, and he immediately returned to his room—I had no conversation with him about the witnesses</p>

               <p>who were examined—if I commenced the conversation, he refused to answer me—that was two or three times—the moment I saw the pencil-marks, I said, "Good God, there are pencil marks!"—I think he told me he knew what they were, but he did not tell me what they were at that time—I examined the fac-similes with him—he said he thought it his duty, lest any thing should happen to him, to point them out to me, and accordingly he did, and I saw them then—I think that might be a week or more after I had asked permission of him to look at them, and had inspected them—he pointed out to me what he had discovered—I made out "Bishopgate-street," and "Cursitor-street," and parts of some other words, but I had not time to apply to them, as Mr. Jennings was examining witnesses, and at the end he pointed them out to me—I examined the fac-similes with him—I did not at all assist in making the fac-similes—I bought the paper of Mr. Pritchard, the bookseller, at Mr. Jennings's request—I believe it was charged to Mr. Rumsey Williams's general account—I saw Mr. Jennings making the fac-similes from time to time, but I never assisted him in tracing either the writing or the pencil-marks—I am sure of that—I swear it—I was in and out of the room on different occasions while he was making the fac-similes—there was no one else there—the fac-similes were made, I think, mostly at night, and in the morning I saw the greater part of the pencil-writing traced upon the tracing paper, but T did not at all help him—I cannot tell How long he was employed—I saw the fac-similes lying on the table—I am not aware that any one else saw them—I never saw but one copy of them made—I examined them with him—I might be two or three hours employed about that—I think we examined the duplicate and the original first, and then the others another day, but I would not charge my memory precisely with that—Mr. Jennings had the fac-simile lying before him, and, from time to time, he took up the papers which he could see with the naked eye; and when he could not, he used a reflector, and then he traced the marks on the fac-simile—he had the fac-simile before him, and he took up the will, and saw through what part of the letters the marks went—he traced them through the dot of an i, or the tail of a g—he cer<lb/>tainly placed the tracing paper over the papers, and with regard to the ink, he traced that over it—he had no pencil to make an imitation of the pencil-marks—I think he did them with red ink—there was a pencil, his own pocket-pencil, but he never applied that to the original will, that I saw—I had a fall opportunity of seeing the fac-similes, and I told Mr. Rumsey Williams what I had seen—I did not tell Mr. Wadeson—he was gone before the fac-similes were made—Mr. Williams attended the commission himself daily—I did not mention to him what I had seen, nor call upon him for any explanation—the fac-similes were finished the day the commission was closed—I then proceeded to my lodging, about a mile from Carnarvon—I did not go to London till after Mr. Williams was in custody—I did not go to procure the warrant—I remained at Carnarvon—I knew the warrants were coming down, but I cannot tell positively who told me—I think it must have been Mr. Rumsey Williams, but I would not charge my memory—I had no conversation with Mr. Jennings about any warrants—I swear that—the officers sent to my lodging for me—I was not there, and they sent to a friend's house—I met them at the gate, and accompanied them to Brynbras Castle the next morning—the officers did not think themselves justified in going, without some one to identify the prisoner—Mr. Williams was at home at Brynbras Castle—he took his papers in his own custody to Lon<lb/>don</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020343"/>
               <p>—I picked them up for him, and they were taken, by Mr. Williams's desire, to London, to be inspected by his professional advisers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the officer seize a large quantity of papers belonging to Mr. Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said to Mr. Williams, "We shall want your papers," and Mr. Williams filled one bag with papers, and said they should be taken to London and inspected in the presence of his legal advisers—Mr. Williams, the officer, and myself went to the iron-chest, and Mr. Williams took them out and put them into the bag—that was certainly under the requisition that they should want his papers—I have not detained a great portion of those papers—I do not know of their being detained—Ellen Evans was taken at Brynbras Castle at the same time—I was not present when Ann Williams was taken—I accompanied Ellen Evans to Tyn-y-maes, and there met Mr. Jennings—I was surprised—he and I entered into conversation with Ellen Evans and Ann Williams—I put some questions to Ann Williams—I told them they were charged with forging the will, and then asked ques<lb/>tions—I did not see either of them during the rest of the journey—I left and went home—I bad come in a post-chaise with Ellen Evans alone, about fourteen miles, and the officer was on the box—I had some conversation with her, and put questions to her—that was not by the desire of Mr. Rum<lb/>sey Williams, but out of my own head—I came to London in the beginning of March—I saw two of the fac-similes in the country with Mr. Jennings—I saw them again on my examination—Mr. Jennings brought the fac-similes when I saw him at Tin-y-maes—he showed them to me—I had two of them in my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you them at Carnarvon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had two—I showed one to Captain Boyle, and I showed them to Mr. Morgan, at the bank of Carnar<lb/>von, now you remind me of it—I went there for money, and I showed them as cariosities—when I was examined in London, I saw the same fac<lb/>similes—I have seen Mr. Jennings since I have been in town—I saw him yesterday and to-day waiting outside—I conversed with him as I would with any other person—I have assisted in the prosecution as clerk to Mr. Rumsey Williams—I have conversed with Mr. Flower—I conducted the prosecution in the country in Mr. Rumsey Williams's office, as his clerk—I have communicated but little on the subject with Mr. Rumsey Williams—he would not communicate with me—I brought the witnesses to town myself—I subpoenaed a witness named Jane Thomas, but she did not come under my subpoena, she was on her way to London when I subpoenaed her—I believe she was one of the house-maids—I subpoenaed Owen Roberts—I do not know that he was the gardener—I was not directed by Mr. Rumsey Williams to subpoena them, but by Messrs. Harmer and Flower—I came to town and instructed them—I drew up a brief and gave it them—I sub<lb/>poenaed Grace Jones—she is here—I have never said that I was directed by Mr. Rumsey Williams to subpoena these witnesses—I do not know that Mr. Rumsey Williams is employed by any one to conduct this prosecution.—I am not the agent of Messrs. Flower—I have conducted the prosecution as Mr. Rumsey Williams's clerk—I saw Mr. Jennings in London—I called at his house three times to see him, and talked to hirer in general terms about this business—I dined at Mr. Rumsey Williams's house at Penross in company with Mr. Jennings—but I went home—I was not very well—I went in the same chaise with Mr. Jennings—I do not know who paid Mr. Jennings's expenses of that journey—I met Mr. Jennings at dinner at Mr. Rumsey Williams's on the day after the apprehension of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lithographer and fac-similist to the British Museum. I can see marks on this scrip No. 1—I see a capital "D" here written in pencil; and at the top, under the word "Amen," there are pen<lb/>cil-marks—I see the double line of a large letter under the second and third lines—I see double strokes of large letters, but I really cannot at pre<lb/>sent distinguish what they are—here is "Map" on the left-hand side of the paper—here is "hopgate-street"—on the right of the paper in the same line here is "Cursitor-street"—I see a double-line ruled transversely, im<lb/>mediately under the "s" of "Cursitor"—I do not see any horizontal rul<lb/>ing—I see two lines under the word "sirname," but they do not go hori<lb/>zontally—here appears to be a line from "my sir name of Panton," running through the word "and," and going through the line—if I turn the paper side<lb/>ways, I see some more of that kind of writing, double lines in pencil—it seems to me as though there were a capital "C," and I see a kind of final "t," about four inches from the "C"—under the "C," to the right, before yon get to the double-ruled lines, I see some small mark, which looks like a figure—it looks to me like part of a "6"—I cannot speak to any other figures—a little to the right I see some remains of pencil, apparently a "C" and an "O," but I see it more by the indentation of the paper than any colour of pencil—if it is a "C," it is a capital "C"—about two inches down the paper, to the right-hand from "stock all and singular," runs a line, and under that is a small capital "C," as though the words were small altogether—I see parts of three letters between the "C" and a final "t"—there appears to be room for three letters between them, but I really can<lb/>not make them out—I see after the "t" a loop—under that word I see more bits of writing, in large letters, but I really cannot make them out—under the marks I see some ruled lines, and under the lines I see a "1," and a "2" after it—that is to the left of the paper—to the right, on a line with the "1" and "2" I see a "3," and beyond it, two lines—below the "3," and near the words "lastly," and "witness," I see parts of figures, it may be a "1," or part of a "4"—below this appearance of figures I see part of a ruled line running in a line with the word "pictures"—I see some large writing, and above that, near the end of "witness" and the "x" of "six," there appears to be a ruled line on which large writing has been—on the left side of the paper I see there is a long word, but I really cannot distinguish it—I see a long continuity of letters—I do not mean that letters continue all the way—there may be two words—now I see under the writing which appears a continuity of letters the word "ground," and in a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020348"/>
               <p>line with the word "ground" I see a pencil-mark across the word "entitled"—it is a letter which I cannot make out—I observe there are figures or letters—at the end is a "6," or it may be a turn of an "0"—just to the left of the word "eldest" I see a long word, and evidently the word "Court" after it—I can see an "s" near the close of the long word, the last letter but one or two—under that long word I can distinguish two small ruled lines across the word "Wales"—below that is the same kind of writing—here is a capital letter apparently—it is the word "Ground" again, but part of this is not double down-strokes—after I pass that word I see "o t," or "o l," written apparently in a hurry; and here is a large flourish of a letter I cannot make out—under the second word "Ground" I set "Devons;" and there is more writing, but I can scarcely make it out—it contains four letters more apparently, and then another capita—I say it is a capital because it is higher than the others, but I cannot make it out; and there appears a final "t"—under the "D" there appears to me to be a "2" and a "3," very large; and about three inches on the right from the "3" here appears a very large "7," with a "6" before it, after it a very small "8;" and then I see the last sweep of a letter, but I could not swear it was a "9"—the letters are uneven, large and small—the principal parts of what I see are the indentations of pencil lines, and not the lead—the pencil has been rubbed out, and was a very bad pencil, but certainly the pencilling was done before the writing—this is the worst kind of paper to write on—there is no indenture on the ink—(<hi rend="italic">examining scrip No</hi>. 2)—here is evidently, in the middle, the word "Map"—a little below it is a capital "B"—I see the word "Bishopgate-street," and in the same line I see "Cursitor-street" in full.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Turn the paper up, and look if you see any ruled line horizontally along the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, I observe lines in various direction—under the horizontal line is the word "Cursitor," and under that the word "street" and two lines—along the same line is a capital "C," and some other letters, which I cannot swear to—here is "r t"—I should read it "Cursitor-court."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you look at that a little more carefully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was wrong, what I took for an "r" is an "s," with a "r" following it, or a looped "1" and "e"—it appears to be "Castle"—there is a line under it, which I think it impossible to speak to—in the last line but one, in the "t o" of the word "Hereunto" under the word "Castle," if it is "Castle," I see a long ruled line, and under that I see "1 2," and "1 3," in figures, well made in double lines—to the right I see another figure, either a "2" or a "3," and there is a "4" distinctly, and under that two more figures—the last is a "5"—the first I cannot say whether it is a "2" or a "3"—it is either "20," or "25," or "30," or "35"—here is a capital not well made out—a "C a," and part of a letter, and a final "t," and a little below it, im<lb/>mediately under the "a," is a capital "G," an "o" in the centre, and a "d" final—there is an "r" following the "G"—under that there is a strong line passes horizontally through the whole, and under that another line and some writing between the two lines—there is a large down stroke of some capital letters, as an "I," a "P," or a "D," or any other—I can read the word "Court" at the end—under that I can see another line—I perceive writing below under these lines, here is a capital "G," and "r," and "o," and then I lose it—then there is a "d," and I can see nothing beyond that—I do not see any thing in continuation of that word—under</p>

               <p>that I see a ruled line, and then under it a very good capital "<hi rend="italic">Devon<lb/>skire</hi>," a little beyond that, in the same line, is "<hi rend="italic">Stre</hi>," one "e" obliterated a little, and a "T"—under the capital "D" I see figures—there is a "2 3 4 5 6," a long stroke, which might probably be part of a "7," and an "8," and a "9," very plain—I see a line over the word "Ellen Evans," running horizontally—it has been rubbed out very much—I should say decidedly from my experience, that the marks of letters which I see on this paper were made before the writing—this paper appears to me to have been rubbed to remove pencil marks, particularly in this part—I can see there were marks, which have been defaced—the ink certainly does not appear to have been at all removed—it appears to me to have been a very bad pencil, and if that had been done since, the grease of the pencil would have appeared over the ink, but the ink has covered the pencil, not the pencil that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now take No. 3 into your hand, let me direct your attention to the upper part, about the centre division, and see whether you discern any writing upon that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I observe something immediately under the "No. 3"—I cannot make out the first letter distinctly—there is a capital, and a long tailed letter following—then there is a small "e" following it—then there seems a continuation of larger letters, but I cannot distinguish what they are—I cannot distinguish what the capital letter is—it is a capital "A" or "M," or such letter, with the turn they have—the final letter is very much rubbed, and taken away, but I see a "t," and I should sup<lb/>pose a long word before it—I cannot make out more that I should like to swear to—under the capital I discern other writing, but it has been so rubbed and smeared, that I cannot see it—there is considerable quantity of marks of writing, before I come to the writing—above the words "Last will," is a small running-hand capital "D," I should say that is all dirtied over—and then "d," and the first part of an "a"—through the word "Last" there appears to me "the city"—it appears like a good round "C," and "ty"—under the word "added," I can see a stroke, and then a "t," and an "e," but I cannot connect them—under the word "and" there is a letter at first sight, I should say it was a capital "B" at the begin<lb/>ning—under the words "on or about," in the second line, here is writing again—under the word "or" there is "at"—under the word "about, there is writing which runs into it, but I cannot make out the letters—under the word "the" there is what would appear double "e," or a scrawl—in the 4th line there has been a great deal of erasure above the word "contained," and under it for some considerable space, and there is pencil writing before the "c" of the word "contain," and that continues on, but whether the commencing letter is a "t," an "1," or a "p," I cannot say; and an "A" it may be, "ga" "la" or "pa"—under the words "Jones Panton" there has evidently been writing rubbed out, but I cannot swear to the letters—under the word "intention," two lines lower, I see a capital "I"—I can very well discern that there are letters following it, but I cannot read them—I see after the "I" there is a com<lb/>mination of writing for two inches, and then comes scratching out again—under the words "and singular"—I see between the words "and" and angular 'a capital "D," and it runs up between the writing, "a ted"—here is a long stroke on and above the word, "other," in the same line, but I cannot distinguish any thing further—under the words, "and hereby also confirm," in the last line but two, there is the appearance of writing—and over that has been the word "one"—under the word "and"</p>

               <p>there is the loop of a letter—there is no pencil writing below "I have hereunto put,"' and no pencil writing at all on the left hand side of this sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now look at No. 4, I would direct your attention to the words "Codicil to?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is very much rubbed indeed, but I see the traces of writing—over the word "One" in "One Thousand" in the 7th line I see writing—it appears to be a capital letter—the first part of a stroke, which some persons would make a capital "N"—under the "N" of the "thousand" there appears much such a capital as I saw before, which I should make a "D"—there is a short word following the "D," but that has been written through—it appears a "t," and part of an "o"—I should read it "dot," but it has been very much rubbed—the nap of the paper is completely rubbed off—there appears to have been other pencil writing—under the "d" of the word "housemaid" there has been a very great erasure—it appears as though some long letter had been there—over the "yn" of "Plasgwyn" there has been writing—I see writing over the word "confirm"—under the "s" of "said" I see there has been writing, but it has been so completely rubbed that one part of the grease has got into another—under the words "said" and "mentioned," and between those two words, there are faint marks of writing, but I cannot distinguish to make out what the letters are—above the "sand" in the word "thousand," there has been a long word, which appears to me to have begun from the "t" in "thousand"—there is an "o" over the "S" with a stroke to it—it may be "a," or "q," or "g"—these marks were done before the ink-writing, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at No. 5, begin at the centre of the paper, under the 5? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here appears a very large part of a capital in the same double-lined writing—it may be an "A" or an "M"—the next letter appears a "G," but I cannot make out exactly what that is—at the left hand corner here is "J. Panton, Esq."—in the opposite corner on the right, I discern a capital "B," and a continuation of writing, and a "Q" at the end—there appear indications of writing near the capital "B"—about two inches be<lb/>low the "J. Panton, Esq."—there is "Bis," along stroke, and "op gate"—after the "e" I see "s t"—if I turn the paper sideways, I see the figures "1 2," and "1 3," and I see here is writing under the 13—here is a capital letter, but it would take me a very considerable time to make it out—under that there is some other writing, in the same double-stroked letters—there seems "n t" and "r o" under it, and the "T" is a final letter—there is no doubt in my mind that the pencil marks of this have been done first, and the ink after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at No. 8, just above the "I" in the word "instructions"—? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here has been something rubbed out so completely, that there is not a pencil mark—there is an indenture following some letter—there is a long word at the beginning—the first part of the letter which I can see the indenture of, appears to me as though it was a capital "I," or it may be the up-stroke of an "M" or an "A"—there is the remnant of a long word after the "o" in the word "instruction"—a little bit of pencil remains, but I cannot form a letter—there is the pencil mark of a letter in the "f" of "for"—there is other writing, which appears to have been removed by a knife, not rubbed—under the line, "I give to Paul Griffith Panton" there has been writing, through the word "Paul" I see capital strokes I see clearly "of" over the word Panton—and through the "N" is a stroke—but there is an erasure again, with the thumb nail or a knife—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020351"/>
               <p>there is some writing continued to the end, and going down a little, as if there was not room for it—in the word "all," there is a letter through the "o," and a long stroke through the "1"—it might read, "at the"—and through "Plasgwyn," also, there is writing—there is an "a" and what appears like an "f" through the word "Gwyn"—through the words "whoever has" there is an "a," an "n," another "n" or an "m"—there is writing also in the next line, under the words "the" and "An<lb/>glesey," but I can only see the tops of letters—I think I can make out an "a" there, and the others may be "I's" or "t's"—they are long letters—under the word "property" I do not see any thing but erasures—lower down, under the words "all the rents," there is evidently the word "cove<lb/>Dante"—through the word "law," I can see pencil marks—a long stroke, which may do for "f" or "t"—I can see distinctly "and" written through and under the words "my will"—there are letters before it, and after the word "which" I see an "x" distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the words which precede the x attentively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here is "six" after the word "and," and before the "s" I can see a "t y," writ<lb/>ten up and down in a careless way—now I look at the marks preceding the "ty" I see it is "thirty"—! now read the words "And thirty-six"—in the line immediately above that the last words are, "To draw," and through these words there are long and short strokes—but I really cannot tell what they are—there is "th" and some others—the words "And thirty-six" are apart from each other, and a little downward—that is not the case with the rest of the writing, generally speaking—the lines are more regular than that happens to be—there is a little inclination in the line under "Griffith Panton," but not equal to this—that is not in a straight line, but this is very much out—I cannot trace any thing after the letter "x" in the word "Six."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take No. 10, and look at the word "June?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This it written across with that same kind of character, double strokes in the down-strokes—I can only make out the turns of letters, apparently three lines of letters—I see a double line before the "29," but not letters—about a quarter of an inch from the "29," and running through the "th" in the word "no<lb/>thing," about half an inch lower down, I find the words "No. 10" written, and across it some pencil marks, but I cannot make out what they are—still lower, I see a little mark on the "t" in "instruction" and a mark after it, but I cannot form them into letters—lower still there has been something, but I cannot make it out—the pencil marks on this paper, also, appear to have been written before the ink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take No. 11, and look at the words, "and part" in the second line? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see there has been writing here, but I cannot trace the words till I come to the end of "last will and testament," and there is a capital "B," a capital "H," some way on, a "c," a "k," and "Esq."—I cannot swear to what there are between the capital "H" and the "ck" there is" a capital "C" running through the word "November," in the fifth line, and reaching to "thirty-four"—here is a "Cu," or a "Ca" and I see a "t" and an "s," the "s" appears to be across the "I give"—the "s" is two or three inches from the capital "C," but I really can hardly swear that it is an "s," it is not a capital letter—I can distinguish two "e" and a "t" finishing that line, not capitals, but double-lines—I do not see the double lines of the capital, but the small letters are double-lines—I now reverse the paper, and look at the words "Jones Panton" I see across that a capital "C u"—I can see distinctly enough to read</p>

               <p>the word "Cursitor"—the letters are not all plain, but I should take them for nothing else—under the word "Cursitor," about an inch below it, is double et"—under that again here is the remains of some large capital, the two down strokes of the commencement of a capital—here is the head of a "2" or a "3," and under that again appears another "2"—under the second figure I see two faint lines, but I see no words—in "ratify and confirm," here are faint marks, but I cannot make out a letter—here are double marks forming letters—on the right of the word "Cur<lb/>sitor," there appears another capital "C," and the tops and tails of letters, and it appears to end with a final "t" or "d"—under the word "Cur<lb/>sitor," I see a mark which may be the down stroke of a "4"—I now see it is the figure "1," and immediately next to it is a "2"—under this "1" and "2," there is the same down-stroke, which having a "3" an<lb/>nexed to it, appears to be "13"—on the left-hand side, there is large writing across it, but I cannot distinctly trace the writing—on the right-hand side there are the remains of a capital "D"—under the figures "2" and "4," there is another "2," but I cannot see the figure which follows it—there is the remain of a figure—these marks, like the others, appear to me to have been on the paper before the writing.</p>

               <p>front door was kept locked, and whether it was necessary to ring to gain admission—I cannot say that it was always, or generally shut—the iron gate opens to the front of the house—I do not mean the gate of the lodge—I cannot understand a plan—the iron gate opens into the road which leads up to the front—it opens into the park—it is a gate in the road that opens from Mr. Panton's carriage-road, up to the house—it is necessary to get to the iron gate to pass through the lodge gate leading to the park—I got down and opened the lodge gate that day myself—I cannot know whether there was any one in the lodge—we shouted out—you must pass the kitchen window before you get to the iron gate, and the windows of the other rooms in the house—I did not see any of the people of the house as I went to the house, nor when I drove back—I went back imme<lb/>diately to Rhuulas—I went through the farm yard to Rhuluas—I did not see anybody, or take notice of anybody—I saw my master about three o'clock, at Rhuulas—I left my master at Plasgwyn about one o'clock—Rhuulas is about a quarter of a mile from Plasgwyn.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a road that takes to Rhuulas when you enter the lodge gate at Plasgwyn? Yes, certainly—my master used to go by Plasgwyn to Rhuulas, and always called there—I cannot say exactly whether that is a nearer way to Rhuulas than by the high-road, but I should think it is a little nearer—during the last three years that I have been with Mr. Thomas Williams I never put up the horses at Plasgwyn—I had always put them up there when I lived with Mr. Thomas Williams before—we did not put them up there, became Mr. Barton Panton would not allow us to have oats or any thing for the horses, therefore it would not do to put them up there—the iron gate it for persons that are going on foot to the front door—that used to be the way that Mr. Panton always came out with my master and mistress—I am quite certain that the day I met Mr. Barton Panton, and Mr. Price, and Mr. Bettiss in the Clay-lane was the Sunday before Whit-Sunday.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give us any notion about what time of the day it was you saw Mr. Williams at your master's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what time—Mr. Panton generally dined from a quarter to twenty minutes past five o'clock—I cannot tell whether it was before dinner or after—I beg pardon, I made a mistake—it was before my master's dinner, but I cannot say How long—I cannot say who let him in then, or on Whit-Monday—it was a few days before my master was ill on Thursday, that Mr. Thomas Williams came to Plasgwyn—that was the day I saw him going across the hall—I do not remember seeing his little chaise it the door—Mr. and Mrs. Williams came on Whit-Monday in their pony-car<lb/>riage—they drove up to the door, I was told—I cannot tell what time they came, nor How long they staid, nor who let them in, nor who let them out</p>

               <p>—I do not know where Doctors' Commons is—I was examined in London within this fortnight—Hugh Thomas, the butler, generally lets people in and out—Richard did so very seldom—I did not speak to Mr. Thomas Wil<lb/>liams, as I saw him crossing the hall—he did not see me—I was crossing the best stairs—I did not hear a doable knock at the door, nor a loud knock or a ring, just before I saw him—the hall-door is sometimes shut and sometimes not—I cannot say particularly whether it was shut on Whit-Monday, when my master was ill—my master always behaved like a gen<lb/>tleman to Mrs. Barton Panton—I cannot say whether he was very fond of her—I cannot say whether he was cross when he was ill, and could not bear the sight of the child—I never saw him take it on his knees—I cannot say that he was particularly fond of it—I did not give my master his medi<lb/>cine—sometimes Pritchard did, sometimes Henry Brereton—I never gave any—I was not often present when medicine was given to him—he very often told me I should not be a loser by him—no one here ever heard him say so—I have been nearly nine yean in the service altogether—I lived with him about two years before he mentioned that at all—and he fre<lb/>quently told me so for the last six or seven years—when I first went he was so bad as to require his legs to be rubbed—the last time he said I should not be a loser, was three weeks or a month before his death—I have never said since his death that I did not expect he would leave me a legacy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used there to be any person present when you rubbed your master's legs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was upon those occa<lb/>sions he used to say I should not be a loser by him—at Plasgwyn the front door was sometimes open, or ajar, so that a person could come in without ringing or knocking—I was subpoenaed on the part of the prosecutor as well at the prisoner.</p>
