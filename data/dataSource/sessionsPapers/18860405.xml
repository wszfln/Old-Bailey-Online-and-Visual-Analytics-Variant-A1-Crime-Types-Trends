                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Constable</hi>). On the morning of 2nd of February I and another detective, Eagle, were in Newgate Street, near Messrs. Newbury's establishment, about half-past 11 a.m.—I saw Lever, Freeman, another man and a boy after they had come out of Newbury's—Eagle spoke to me as to something he had seen—after they came out I saw Lever hand a black leather bag to Freeman; I should fancy it was empty—the man not here and the boy went towards Holborn, and Free<lb/>man and Lever went towards the Mansion House and Broad street—I and Eagle followed them some little distance, they went away by train from Broad Street station—I was at this time merely on ordinary duty and not making special inquiry into the matter—I went into Newbury's and made inquiries—as the result of it I and Eagle waited between one and two in Newgate Street, and about two o'clock saw Lever and Free<lb/>man coming from Cheapside—Lever was carrying a parcel, which I have part of here—there were nine dozen bottles of scent wrapped in three larger and six smaller parcels, which were wrapped together in this brown paper—Freeman had hold of Lever's arm—I went up and stopped them and said, "We are two police officers; I want to know what you have got in that parcel"—Freeman said, "Perfume"—I said, "How much"—he said. "Nine dozen"—I said, "Where did you get them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050004"/>
               <p>from?"—he said, "I got them from Dr. Williams, 91, Hoxton Street, Hoxton"—I said, "What did you give for them?"—he said, "11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said, "What were you going to do with them?"—he said, "They don't belong to me now, they belong to Lever, I have sold them to him"—I said, "What for?"—he said "For 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; I merely get 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. profit"—I turned to Lever and said, "What were you going to do with them?"—he said, "I was going to take them into Newbury's"—I said, "What would you get for them there?"—he said, "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said, "That seems rather strange to me, this man going to get them and only gets 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and you get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Lever said, "That is a lie, he gets 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I give him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sell them for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "I shall have to take you to the station"—I took them both to the station and left them there—I examined the parcels, each of the six small and three large parcels contained a dozen bottles—outside the parcels is a label with the picture of a civet cat and the name Bailey and Co., Cockspur Street. (<hi rend="italic">On each bottle was also a label "Ess. Bouquet, made only by Bailey and Co., Cockspur Street.</hi>") There were six dozen small bottles and three dozen large once—I went to this address at Hoxton, where I saw Williams, who keeps a chemist's shop at 91, Hoxton Street—I said to him, "I am a police officer"—I pulled out this one of the smaller bottles and said, "Have you sold any like this to anybody to-day"—he said, "No"—I said, "You have had some like this?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who did you buy them from?"—he said, "I bought 12 dozen from a man, I believe his name is Defrieze"—I said, "what did you give him for them?"—he said, "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said, "Where is he to be found?"—he said, "I don't know now, he has gone abroad; he was hard up and asked me to take them"—I said, "When did you sell any last?"—he said, "I sold two dozen last night"—I said, "What did you sell them for?"—he said, "15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said, "To whom?"—he said, "I believe to a man named Philips"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I believe he lives somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kingsland"—I said, "What made you sell them for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen when you gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them?"—he said, "Oh, when I found I could not get rid of them I was glad to sell them at a loss"—I said, "Who have you sold the others to?"—he said, "Oh, to different people in the trade that I know," he could not name anybody particularly—I said, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—I pulled a larger bottle out of my pocket and said, "This is a larger size than the other"—he said, "Oh, I did not know there were two sizes, I never opened the parcels"—I then left and went back to the police-station—Freeman and Lever were de<lb/>tained and charged next day, the 3rd, before the Magistrate with unlawful possession of a quantity of scent found on them; because the owner could not then be found—they were remanded till Friday, the 5th—I went on the Thursday again to Williams's place, but he was not at home—I saw him on the Friday morning, the 5th—I said, "I shall want you to attend at the Guildhall this morning about that perfume; you told me you never sold any to those people that day"—he said, "Yes, all right, I will be there. I suppose you would be surprised to hear that that stuff is not Bailey's. That stuff never came out of Bailey's; I know the party that made it. It was made in a private house; I shan't divulge. I did not know it till yesterday, when I saw the party"—he told him that he made it—I said, "Well, that is a matter for you; if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050005"/>
               <p>you will attend at the Guildhall this morning before the Magis<lb/>trate, that is all I want you to do"—in the meantime a warrant was placed in my hands to arrest Williams on a charge of conspiring with the other two men to utter counterfeit goods, and when he came to Guildhall I arrested him—I read the warrant to him—he said, "What does it all mean?"—I said, "I have read the warrant to you; do you understand?"—he said, "I don't understand it. What business I have done I have done legitimately"—I said, "I shall have to take you to Snow Hill Police-station"—he was taken there and charged—he made the same remark that what business he had done he had done legitimately—after he was locked up he said to me in the cell, "I can tell you who the party is"—I said, "Well, you will understand it might be used against you—he said, "I am only speaking the truth, His name is Defrieze Boyes, and he lives at, I think, 22, New North Road. He has got two rooms at the top of the house"—he said he believed his name was Boyes, but he went by the name of Defrieze as well—he said, "He told me it was a piracy, that he saw him the day before, that was yesterday, and he told him they could not do anything with the two men that were in custody, for the stun was a piracy, and that it had not come from Bailey's at all; that it was a piracy, and that he, Boyes, had made it, and "till then I did not know but what the stuff was all right. I have had various dealings with Boyes for a long time," and that that would dispose of the charge of unlawful possession—Williams was charged on the Saturday, and was remanded, and came up with the other two on the following Thursday I think; on the Sunday they were all three admitted to bail—I had not got Boyes at this time—on Sunday the 7th I went to Williams's shop between 1 and 2. I saw him and said to him, "Have you seen Boyes?"—he said, "Yes, we have been keeping him here an hour expecting you"—I said, "What account does he give of it?"—Williams said, "He said 'I shall be lagged for this'"—I said, "And is he going to make a clean breast of it?"—he said, "Yes"—I went to Boyes's house in the evening—I had been there before I went to Williams's, and had seen him outside in the street—about 6 o'clock on Sunday night I saw Boyes at his house, and said, "You know me?"—he said, "No"—I said, "My name is Gross; I am a police-officer"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You have sold some of Bailey's and Atkinson's perfume to Dr. Williams, of Hoxton"—he said "This is Sunday night"—I said, "Yes, I know it is, but it does not make any difference to me"—he said, "I decline to say anything, I will see Dr. Williams"—I made an appointment for the next morning, and went up into his rooms—the place smelt of perfume—he again said, "I have nothing further to say"—I said, "Well, perhaps you will consider the matter over"—I made an appointment for the next day—he still declined to say anything at first: he said, "Who told you that I sold this stuff to Dr. Williams?—I said, "Dr. Williams told me himself, and where you lived"—he said, "Well, I have nothing to say. I have got an answer to the charge if I am wanted at any time. That stuff was not stolen, it is a piracy. I have been in Bailey's employ, also in Atkinson's. The fact of it is, Atkinson's people cannot make it; but I have got no more information to give you. If I am wanted at any time I shall, stand it like a man"—he said he had been employed at Atkinson's as a mixer—on 11th February I arrested Boyes on a warrant—in the cab on the way the station he wished to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050006"/>
               <p>make a statement to me—I cautioned him, and said he had better wait till we got to the station, as I could not take a note of it there—at the station he made this statement. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that his moulds for making A Atkinson's and Bailey's bottles would be found at Roberts's</hi>, 86, <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Street, New North Road, and that Glindon, of</hi> 86, <hi rend="italic">Westmoreland Place, City Road, made the stoppers for him; that Bailey's larger bottles he could get anywhere, and had no mould; that three years ago he went to Liverpool to look for employment, having with him about</hi> 300 <hi rend="italic">recipes for the scents of the principal perfumers; that while going from there on a boat for an excursion he got into conversation with a man named Sampson, to whom he told all his business, and that he possessed an entire knowledge of the trade; that Sampson said he knew chemistry, and could speak four different languages, and had got plenty of money, and proposed establishing a business; that he (the prisoner) said that if he had money he could make a fortune in five years in a foreign country by pirating the finest perfumery houses in London; that Sampson asked why it could not be done in that country, as it was only an action at law; that next morning they met, and it was arranged between them that the prisoner should get the bottles, and that Sampson should get the labels and make the stuff for Ess. Bouquet and Atkinson's White Rose, and that Sampson always brought the perfume to him, with the labels, and the prisoner got the bottles, corks, and string, and bottled it himself, the other man taking them away, and paying him so much a week; that he believed Sampson lived in the neighbourhood of Clapham, but about</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">months ago they thought there was something moving, and bolted to Plymouth, and Sampson went abroad; that eventually he went back to Bristol, and having a stone with him, tried to rub the letters out with sand-paper, and left it in the cupboard; that after some time he met Sampson again in London; that they came to terms, he getting the bottles and Sampson the labels and the perfume; that he did not know where Sampson lived, but that he saw him at Brighton last Saturday, when he wanted him to go abroad, and that he (the prisoner) used to go round to marine-store dealers to buy up Atkinson's genuine empty bottles, making them from the moulds when he had not got enough.</hi>) After that I went to Bristol to the address he mentioned, 11, North Place, and found this stone—I found these documents, marked 1 to 5, on Williams when I took him at his house. (<hi rend="italic">These were invoices of perfumery and chemicals from Freeman to William.</hi>) These documents were found on Freeman. (<hi rend="italic">These, marked J., were invoices of White Rose and other scents bought of Freeman.</hi>) I found these papers at Freeman's house. (<hi rend="italic">These included letters and telegrams from Lever and Williams to Freeman, asking for the delivery of scent and chemicals, and relating to scent.</hi>) These four letters were found on Lever. (<hi rend="italic">These were invoices, and letters relating to scent between Freeman and Lever.</hi>) I have noticed Lever walking some distance from the Mansion House; he can walk by himself without difficulty—I met him in Pall Mall walking by himself—he went down the steps by the column, slowly—he did not touch anything to feel the way—when I saw him by the Mansion House, it seemed to me he could not see when ho got close to the Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LYON</hi>. I first saw Williams in this matter on 2nd February, and next on the 5th—I had known nothing about him before that—I have found since he has been there some few years carry<lb/>ing on business as a chemist—I do not know that he has been there 13 years—the shop was that of a dispensing chemist, he had a stock—I looked over his house, I found no more of these perfumes; those I had seen on Freeman and Lever were the only ones I had found—Boyes had bottles and some things at his house—on the very first occasion I saw Williams he told me he had had 12 dozen of these perfumes, which he had bought from a man he believed was Defrieze—it was after he was locked up he said his name was Boyes—I did not tell him then I had any suspicions of unlawful possession of such goods—he appeared to shake when I told him I was a police officer on 2nd February—I asked him if he had sold any of that stuff that day—I did not tell him that any of the scent had been stolen or anything of the kind—our interview lasted three or four minutes perhaps—I did not mention Freeman's or Lever's names to him—I knew nothing for or against Williams then—I had the warrant for his arrest given me at about 12 o'clock on the 5th—I saw him between 10 and 11 o'clock; I had given information to the solicitors before that—the warrant was applied for that morning, I think—I did not know when I asked Williams to go to Guildhall that I should have a warrant for his arrest—I told him nothing about the charge against Freeman and Lever—after he was out on bail it was arranged that I should meet him on Sunday, the 7th, and meet the man who had sold him the perfumes—no doubt it was through Williams I was able to perfect my case against Boyes—I have made inquiries about Boyes—I heard he travelled with bottles and that kind of thing for years—I did not know he manufactured and sold scent with a label of his own; I knew he dealt in perfumes—an information was sworn in this case on 11th February, in which I and Dr. Humphreys and Miss Williams took part—Boyes was arrested on the 11th after the information.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 337). On 2nd March last year I went with Tarroll to 103, Greyhound Road, Hnmmersmith, to communicate with the prisoner in reference to her husband, who was in custody—it is a fried fish shop; the door was open—I spoke to Smith, the landlord, and the prisoner appeared at a door at the bottom of the stairs, and said,</p>

               <p>"Are you come to see me respecting my husband?"—we were in plain clothes—she went by the name of Saunders while she was there—I said, "Yes, I wish to speak to you privately for a few minutes"—she said, "I want to get a haddock for my tea before I go upstairs," and turned into the shop and disappeared—I waited a few minutes and then went upstairs with the landlord to the second floor front room, which the prisoner occupied with her husband; but I had had him in custody for a week, and he was on remand for another week—the fire was burning very brightly, and in front of it I found this mould drying, with a new sixpence in it, good—these acids and quicksilver were on the table, and some black powder, and in a box near a corner of the room we found these spoons, and a quantity of silver sand—I took them all to the station, leaving Fowler in charge of the house—another officer handed a battery to me—the prisoner's husband was not let out on bail—he was kept in custody 10 days, and had been in custody a week then—he was com<lb/>mitted for trial, but not on this charge.</p>

On 13th March last year I received the implements produced from Golder—I have kept them ever since—I have made inquiries after the prisoner, and on 10th March this year saw her with two other women at the Hop Pole, Hammersmith, about 1 o'clock—I followed them for three hours, and stopped the prisoner near the Glenthorne public-house, and said "Good morning, Mrs. Smith"—she said "That is not my name, you do not know me"—I said "Well, I am a police sergeant, and I am going to take you in custody for having in your possession about 12 months since, at 103, Greyhound Road, Fulham, implements for the manufacture of counterfeit coin"—she said "I don't know anything about it"—I took her to the station, where Golder identified her—there were no other women in the room; I tried to get some, but at that time of night I could not—I had never seen her before; I took her on a description—shortly after these implements were found the landlord of 103, Greyhound Road went away, and I have tried in vain to trace him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Knotty Ash, near Liverpool, and am a wholesale grocer, and also a pigeon breeder of many years' experience, particularly of Jacobins—on 8th July I sent a box to the Liverpool station by the boy Owen, addressed to the secretary of the Hatfield Show, and containing two pigeons, to go by the 12 o'clock train—a few days after<lb/>wards I received a communication from the secretary, in consequence of which I made a demand on the Great Northern Railway Company, and further circulated handbills offering 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two birds I sent from Liverpool, I know them by their general appearance—the hen bird I bought a year ago, on the 1st of January, from Mr. Hunt of Eastbourne, it is named Ruby Xing, and is six years old—the black bird I bred myself three years ago—on 1st January this year I received a telegram, in consequence of which I went to the Kilmarnock show, where I saw the red bird exhibited in the name of James B. Stevens—I spoke to Mr. Gibson and Mr. Brown, judges of the show, and went with them to Henrietta Street, where we saw James B. Stevens, and then the prisoner, his brother, came into the room—I told him I had come to see about the red cock Jacobin that was shown at the show and had won the first prize—he said "What do you want to know?"—I said "I want to know where you got it?"—he said "I bred it four years ago"—I asked him if he had ever shown the bird, as if he had shown it I must have seen it, because I had attended all the principal shows—he said he never had shown it, he did not keep them for exhibition, but for pleasure—I told him he could not have bred the bird, because it was mine, and Mr. Frame of Belfast bred it—the prisoner had a consultation with his brother, which I could not hear, and then I asked him if he had not made a mistake, had not he bought it—he said he might perhaps have done so, as he had bought several birds of that description—I pressed him to tell me where he had bought it, and after a good deal of talking he said that he had bought, two at Glasgow market, and that he had given 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the other—Brown said very likely the red cock in question would be the one that he gave the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and that if I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., would he give me an order on the secrerary of the show to deliver up the bird to me—the prisoner did agree to that, and I got the bird—the prisoner gave me his address as Tottenham Court Road, London; he would not give the number—I told the prisoner that at the time I bought the red cock I also bought a black hen, and asked him if he had any black hens</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050031"/>
               <p>at home—he said he had two or three at his lodgings in Tottenham Court Road—I said if he could find the black hen I would give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would send me on all the black hens he had got at home for my inspection, I promising to pay all expenses—on 11th January I received this letter, which I believe to be in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This letter headed "The Swan with Two Nicks, Finchley" stated that the prosecutor's letter had been forwarded to the prisoner who had no black Jacobins answering the descrip<lb/>tion, "but that he sent off one, which he had witnesses to prove he bought for a fair price in a market, and that he had no wish to keep stolen birds.</hi>) With that letter I received a young strawberry Jacobin hen, which I should say was the 'bird that this pair would probably breed, a black and red together nearly always throw a strawberry—I sent that bird back to him—I then received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged a letter of the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th instant, and stated "You can come and see my pigeons at any time I reserve my defence.</hi>") On receipt of that letter I communicated with the Cheshire Lines, and was put into communication with the Great Northern Company—on 9th February I went with Inspectors Parish and Dod to the Swan with Two Nicks, at Finchley, where I saw the prisoner—Parish introduced himself and Dod, and said "You will probably know Mr. Maughan"—we al four went into the bar parlour, and some conversation took place, and then the prisoner showed us some pigeons then in a little garret at the top of the house—I saw the strawberry hen which had been at Liverpool, and is referred to in the two letters, a black barb—there were no other Jacobin hens in the garret—I should say the strawberry hen was hatched about the middle of 1885—the prisoner said it had been bred from the red cock and black Jacobin—in consequence of that I afterwards commu<lb/>nicated with Mr. Waters of Belfast, and received from him this black Jacobin hen, which had been exhibited at Kilmarnock as well as the red cock—I told the prisoner in the garret I thought the strawberry hen was my property as it had been bred from my birds, and asked him to give it up to me—he said he would give it up to me if I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would not give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would screw its neck round first—on this same day I heard a conversation between Parish, Dodd, and the prisoner about the red cock and black hen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A large number of Jacobins are shown about the country, and there are a large number that are not shown, I have no doubt there are thousands of them—their colours are in nowise un<lb/>common for Jacobins—Hurst, of Eastbourne, bought the red cock from Frame, of Belfast, he told me—I put the birds up myself for the Hatfield Show—I made a claim on the railway company of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for compensation for the loss of the two pigeons, they have given me nothing, the case was never settled—I had said the birds were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I sent them—about 120 Jacobins would be shown at a Crystal Palace Show—the first prize at the Kilmarnock Show was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—from July to January 'I never saw my birds—fancy pigeons and Jacobins are sold all over the country, in every large town, and in a great number of small towns—Stevens was showing three Jacobins at the Kilmarnock Show, I don't know what else—I went to his father's house to see him—before I went there I had seen the three Jacobins at the show—I saw this hen there, she was in the selling class, not the Jacobin—I did not recognise her—we went together to look at it, and Mr. Waters told me Stevens was showing it and pointed it out to me—I said I thought it was not my hen, I could not</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This reminded the prisoner of his promise to send on thee black hens, and stated that he had no doubt his black hen was amongst his (the prisoner's), and that the man that stole the red bird had got the black one, and that if the black bird was not forthcoming he would set about turning up how the prisoner came by the red cock; that he would give the railway authorities full particulars of his visit to Kilmarnock, and instruct the Kilmarnock police to investigate the case, and put his own solicitor on the case; that he could give them a good idea of how to find it out, and that if the prisoner were in possession of stolen property, and could not give a good account of it, the case would go hard with him in a police-court.</hi>) That was not a threat to prosecute—in answer to that I received the letter with the strawberry hen—he told me at Kilmarnock he had no wish to keep other people's birds—I wrote to him again. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the receipt of the letter and the strawberry hen, expressing surprise that it had been sent, as he had asked for a black hen, which he had no doubt the prisoner had, and stating that he would give him another chance to send the bird.</hi>) There were no bidders when Mr. Waters bought the bird for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was arranged he was to buy her—he answered me inviting me to do as I liked, and I replied that I would do my best to find out where he got the red cock, as I was satisfied some of them stole it; I meant by that some of his friends in London; I said I had asked Robert Fulton, who is a provision dealer in London, to call and see him—a few days after I saw the prisoner at Kilmarnock; he wrote in answer to my letter, giving me his address at Finchley—I got the hen from Waters after I had been to the prisoner's place in town—I saw the prisoner's pigeons; I wanted the strawberry hen—Parish suggested I should have that, and there would be an end of that matter, as far as that hen was concerned; there still remained the black hen—there was a long interview on that occasion; I went away not getting the strawberry—I had nothing to do with getting a summons—as soon as I got home I wrote to Waters, and he sent me</p>

You can do is to give up the birds"—he said "Do you think I stole the birds?"—I said "No, certainly not, but is it not possible that you have got mixed up with your pigeons, and that you imagine you bred this bird when you really have not, but have bought it in some market place, and that the party that has sold it to the party in the market has stolen it?"—the prisoner then said he had bought two pigeons in the market, one for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he did not mention in what market—he said "Am I to be the loser of the money I paid for it?"—I said "Certainly not, Mr. Maughan, You will surely give him the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he has paid for it?"—he said "I will—the prisoner said he had one or two more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill poster—I have known Stevens about two years; in the spring of last year I had to take care of some pigeons for him; I kept them for him till July—up to the end of June the prisoner was in the employment of Mr. Johnson, a draper, of Milsom Street, Luton—on 9th July I sent some pigeons for the prisoner from Luton to Hatfield, for the Hatfield Show—I packed them and took them to the station myself—they were not these pigeons—I had never seen pigeons like these—they were three Fantails and a Barb—up to 9th July I had, as far as I knew, taken care of all the pigeons the prisoner had—I do not know anything about pigeons—I know what a Jacobin is—I had never seen anything like these in the prisoner's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Swan with Two Necks at Whetstone—up to 18th June, 1885, I was barman at the Swan with Two Nicks—the prisoner succeeded me there as barman—on 1th June, 1885, I returned from Margate—a few days after that I went with the prisoner to Elworthy's in Sation Road, New Southgate—heard the prisoner say to Elworthy, "I want to take my pigeons away"—upon that Elworthy went up the loft, he came back and said they were not there—I did not see him go up—there was a little swearing and questioning about it, and I said he had better go and see whether they were there; he accused Elworthy of having made away with them—we then all three went down the yard to the loft above the stable—Elworthy and Stevens went up in the loft, I remained at the bottom—I heard Stevens say, "Here they are," and I went up in the loft and there saw two pigeons in a drain pipe—they were much feathered about the heads; they were pigeons such as I had never seen before, they were of different colours—I don't remember what colours they were, it was not a very good light—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050038"/>
               <p>they were after the style of these—one was much darker than the other; the heads were very much the same as these—they were put in a box and brought down, I don't know by whom; they came down together and left together, and we all three went away in a cart with the box containing the pigeons—I afterwards saw them at Woodside Park railway station, or a pair resembling them.</p>

I am chief inspector of the Great Northern police—I have had charge of this case from the commencement, when the complaint was made to the Company—about 27th July I received information of the loss of two pigeons—in January last I arranged with Inspector Dod for an interview with Stevens at the Swan with Two Nicks, and it took place on 17th February, 1886—Mr. Morris was with us and Inspector Dod—I went to the bar and saw Mr. Cole, the prisoner's master—we went into the private bar; the prisoner was called in—I said, "I am chief inspector of the Great Northern Railway Company's police; this is Inspector Dod, of the Metropolitan Police, and Mr. Morris, whom you know at Kilmaranock; I have called to see if you can give me any information as to how you came in possession of the red cock Jacobin that you gave up to Mr. Morris at Kilmarnock"—at first he said, "I decline to give any information whatever"—I said, "The bird has been stolen, and I want to gain some information if I possibly can; how did you come into possession of that bird?"—he said, "I bought the bird, I paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; do you think I stole the bird? I was very foolish to give up the bird; I have consulted my solicitor, and you have to prove that it is Mr. Morris's bird, and if I had known as much as I do now I would not have given it up"—Inspector Dod took notes of all that passed—I said, "Have you bred any birds from this red cock?"—he said, "Yes, two; one I have upstairs, and the other one I sold to Mr. Waters, of Kilmarnock"—I said, "What hen did you put the red cock to to breed these young birds?"—he said, "I put it to the black hen, and I bred them myself twelve months ago"—I then asked him where he got it—he said, "I bred it two years ago"—I said, "Did you show these birds anywhere?"—he said, "Yes, I showed them at Chatteris, Perth, in Scotland, Galashiels, and a number of shows at other places"—he said he could take me to a man who was with him when he bought the red cock in Leadenhall Market in August or September for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the man asked him a pound—he said, "The man's name is Elworthy, and he lives at 29, Station Road, New Southgate"—at that time Elworthy came in; I then inquired of Elworthy if he was present with him—he said, "One evening, I believe, since he came to his house, I drove him to Leadenhall Market; I saw him standing by a man offering some pigeons for sale; I believe the man asked him a pound, and I believe Stevens gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; we brought the pigeon home, and put it up in a loft with some other pigeons, barbs and fantails"—I said to Elworthy, "Can you give me any description of this pigeon?"—he said, "No, I can't"—I said, "Can you tell me if it was a white or a black pigeon?"—he said, "No, all I know is that I told him he was very foolish to give 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I then asked Stevens if he had any more pigeons in the house—he said, "Yes, I have, you can go upstairs and see them"—I went upstairs with Mr. Morris, Mr. Dod, and Stevens—we there saw about four pigeons; one was a young strawberry Jacobin; I believe the others were fantails and barbs—I said, "Where did you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050040"/>
               <p>get this young strawberry Jacobin?"—he said, "It was bred from the red cock Jacobin which Mr. Morris has, and a black hen which he had bred himself two years ago"—Mr. Morris then took up the young Jacobin in his hand and said, "Well, if this was bred from my red cock it should belong to me"—he said he had only bred two from the red cock and black hen—we then came downstairs, and I said, "If there is any one present who can give me such information which will lead me to recover the black hen I shall be glad to give any one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that practically ended the conversation, besides what Dod has to tell; there was a great deal more which Dod took down; I did the talking part.</p>

               <p>Leadenhall Market about August or September. I decline to say what I gave for it. I decline saving to Mr. Maughan at Kilmarnock that I purchased them at Glasgow Fair. I was with a friend of mine, whom I can take you to, who saw me purchase the bird at Leadenhall Market; his name is Elworthy, he lives at 29, Station Road, Colney Hatch, and keeps a beer-house. I paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the bird. I have been showing pigeons fur for the last five or six years. I have had many, and I know the value of pigeons. I was passing through Leadenhall Market in the afternoon. I saw the bird; it was shown to me by a man, age 30, tall, with a moustache. I should not know him again. I saw several birds, and amongst them were two or three black Jacobins. I asked the price of them; he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He said, 'I have one here that will suit you;' it was the red Jacobin. He asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I gave him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Mr. Elworthy was with me, and we brought it home here. I put the bird with others, a black Jacobin, barbs and fantails, six or seven of them; the black Jacobin there was one I had, and I had it 12 months. I first showed birds at Kilmarnock, Galashiels, Lanark, Bootle, Perth, Bishop Auckland, Barclay Heath, Hatfield—there I showed fantails. I was in the employ of Mr. Johnson of Luton on the day of the Hatfield Show. I sent my birds from Luton to that show. Persons have kept them at Mr. Ryan's, William Street, Luton. I was then packman to Mr. Johnson. I come direct to Mr. Cole. I also showed the bird at Chatteris and Derby; Jones was judge. I did not show the red cock at the Crystal Palace. I think Bootle was the first show with the red cock, to the best my recollection. The pigeon did not get a prize. I have given you all the information in my power." That was all he said then—about that time Elworthy came in—Parish took notes of what was said by Elworthy—I then went with the other persons and the prisoner to the loft and there saw some pigeons, among them was a strawberry Jacobin—Mr. Morris took the bird in his hand—the prisoner said that bird was the product of Mr. Morris's red cock and the black hen he had sold to Mr. Morris at Kilmarnock—Mr. Morris said he thought the bird ought to belong to him, as it was the product of the birds that were stolen from him—the prisoner said rather than he should have it he would wring its neck, but he could have it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then came away from the loft—downstairs there was some further conversation about the black hen—Parish offered to give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner or any one that could give information that would enable us to discover where the black hen was, or who had stolen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The only conversation I heard with respect to the black hen was in the loft—he said that the black hen was the mother of the strawberry bird that he had sold to Waters—the object of our visit was to find a black hen—Mr. Morris did not tell me he had seen a black hen at Walters's—I did not know that he had seen it—the conversation lasted I think very nearly two hours—the prisoner was asked in what employment he was before—he said, "Mr. Johnson's"—he told us where he had kept his pigeons.</p>

I am a beerhouse keeper at Station Road, New Southgate—I have known Stevens some few years—he spoke to me about some pigeons of his coming from Luton—I did not know of his having had pigeons at Irons's place—I did not know where they were, some pigeons came to my place in a box; I don't know when that was, it was some time after he went to where he lives, at Coles' place; it was put in the stable—he said they were fantails; I did not see them—the prisoner fetched them away in the box as they had come to my place—I drove away with him—Allkins never went into the loft nor saw any pigeons—they were at my place about a day; they were never taken out of the box that I am aware of—when the prisoner came to fetch them I gave him the key; I did not go into the loft—Allkins did not, that I am aware of, go into the loft, he was there talking to another man at the time—Stevens was going to take the pigeons to Mr. Coles at the Swan with Two Nicks—I remember one day some time after that driving him to Leadenhall Market; I could not say when' that was—I there saw him buy a pigeon of a man standing by a stall; he gave 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him he was a fool to give that, I would not give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I am not a pigeon fancier; about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each would be what I should give for them—I saw a pigeon similar to this large one, it was dirty when he bought it—he took it home in the box, I did not go with him—Parish came to my place and asked if I knew any more about the pigeon—he said "I am a countryman of yours, I have done with you."</p>

               <p>this red one—I think Parish took down what I had to say; it was not read over to me—I swear that I told him I would not swear to any pigeon—I did not say it was a black one—I was not asked what the colour of the pigeon was—I did not say I could not possibly swear what kind of bird it was—Jessey Main was present when Allkins came to my place, he rented the stable of me—all the lofts lead one into the other above the stables—Allkins came with Johnson, I don't know the time or as to the date—he came for his birds; we just passed the time of day—he said he had come for his pigeons, a box that had come by the Great Northern to Luton—I did not go to the loft to get them, I gave him the keys and he fetched them himself—I don't know that any one went with him—I did not see Allkins go with him, he stopped talking to Main—I did not stop there with him, they were talking when I came back—I don't know whether he went up to the loft or not; I knew he was a licensed victualler—I don't know what he has sworn here—the man in Leadenhall Market had the pigeons in a basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Flower Pot, in St. Ann's Road, Tottenham—on 10th March, about 3 in the afternoon, the prose<lb/>cutor came in, he was followed immediately by Meekoms and afterwards by Heath—Meekoms called for a pot of fourpenny ale—when I put that on the counter he called for a separate half-pint of fourpenny ale—he then asked the prosecutor to pay for it—the prosecutor produced his purse and opened it—whilst doing so Meekoms looked over his shoulder as though he was trying to find out the contents of it—I was going away when Meekoms asked me for a pinch of snuff—I put the snuff-box on the counter; I then went to the other end of the bar—in consequence of what I was told I went back again, and I saw Meekoms in the act of doing something to the pint pot, as though he was mixing something—I saw him hand the pot to the prosecutor, which he drank out of; he then put the pot back on the counter, pretending to wipe the counter down—I picked the pot up and looked into it, and I found there had been some—thing put into it; I then took possession of the pot and put it behind the bar, having suspicion that things were not all right—I watched the prisoners and saw Meekoms in the act of meddling with the prosecutor's button holes, at the lower part of his waistcoat, pretending to button it up—I then asked a customer to fetch a policeman—the prisoners led the prosecutor out into the back place; my potman went and brought him</p>

               <p>back, and put him on the seat—I continued watching; in the meantime the policeman called in—I explained to him how things were and he stayed in the bar some little time and then went outside—one of the prisoners then said to the prosecutor "We had better go up to the Turn<lb/>pike, "that is another public-house—he lifted him up and they went to go out, and they got behind the partition, where I could not see them—they stayed there a little while and then went outside—I do not think he was drunk—after taking this drug he appeared to be drowsy, but when he came in he appeared perfectly sober.</p>

I gave to Rogers on 17th October—I cannot tell whether the bill was given in blank—the "W" seems to be over "shillings," but the next "a" seems to be under the other writing—I keep copies of the principal letters I write—I have not my book here—I do not make entries of letters I receive from my principals—they are endorsed in the usual business way—if a letter was addressed to me I should keep it; if it was addressed to a customer through me, I should send it to him—I should not make any entry of having received it—I will not swear that I did not receive a letter from my principals requiring an explanation about the orders of the London Watch Company—I keep my manufacturers' letters—I don't think I wrote to the London Watch Company asking for an explanation—beyond the 69 watches delivered to Rogers there has never been an application on the part of anybody, or order from the London Watch Company for delivery of a further portion of those goods—I received the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 27th January—I was not told that the watches had not come into Bodes possession—I gave a receipt in full—I did not give a promise that I would not go on with any proceedings—I promised to give back the acceptance of the</p>

Our terms were to pay 3 per cent, com<lb/>mission, half when the goods were delivered, and half when they were paid for—all the watches were made in Switzerland—I mentioned in my advertisement a special kind of watch—it was not an imitation of an English lever—the 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. patent lever was a special make for Bowers and Co.—I consulted you about a die or stamp being made to stamp the boxes—it was required by Goldsmith's Hall; it was merely the stamp of our initials, and not for the purpose of stamping Swiss watches with the English hall-mark—Swiss watches were to be brought into the English market with the English hall-mark—that was not to cause the public to believe they were English watches—the movements were Swiss, and they were sold as Swiss watches—the public would know the difference—it was sometime before you could get the do—you ordered it by my instructions—I called on a Mr. Wright and obtained the die and paid for it—I stamped the faces of the watches with the die, and engraved on the works "patent lever" according to instructions—that was my custom—they were compensation balance—one night you called on me when I was preparing the stamp with this die—12 dozen were stamped, not in imitation at all, they were stamped at Goldsmith's Hall—I stamped them with our initals, and afterwards the Goldsmith's Hall people put their hall-mark on—I did not instruct you to get cards describing you as an English manufacturer—I consulted you about getting the hall-mark—I did not say it was necessary for me to believe you were an English manufacturer—I never took a card to Goldsmiths' Hall describing me as an English manufacturer—I had several answers to my advertise<lb/>ment—I thought you would be of service to me in more ways than one, my choice fell on you—I asked you for security—I did not insist upon it because I believed your good speech, and that you were really in the good position you pretended to be—I did not order from Switzerland a special watch with a metal winder and a silver case—not as a sample—three accounts were executed by your orders—they are the subject of this charge—the first order was Bowers and Co.—you said you knew them personally for some years, not that Bowers had a Government appointment, nor that he was an engineer in Her Majesty's Navy—I suggested that Bowers and Co. should give references, and that it would relieve you of responsibility—you called on them for references, and wrote me the result that Mr. Bowers would not give you references, but would write me direct—I afterwards received two references from Bowers and Co. in December—this is the letter</p>

               <p>dated 21st December, 1881—I wrote to the addresses given—letters came back which gave us such good information that the Bank of England could not expect better—I afterwards wrote to you and complained that you were not giving sufficient attention to the watch business.

Bower and Co."—a few days after they wrote "W. Bower and Co." on the door downstairs—the tenancy lasted till 10th or 11th January—on 7th November, as I did not see them, I put a note in their box to ask for the rent—I put another a few days after in which I said if they did not give me the money at once I would make an end of the tenancy—the money was put in my box wrapped in paper, and with that they asked for a receipt to be put in their box—on 7th December the same thing occurred—on 10th or 11th January I let the room to Richard Norman, who is there now—there was nothing more in it when I relet it.</p>

I am a photo-lithographer at 11, Lavender Road, Clapham Junction—I first saw the prisoner on 6th February this year, when he showed me two prints and asked me if I could reproduce them, and then he showed me two sides, the back and front of a five dollar Colonial bank note like this and asked me if I could print copies of it for advertising purposes from a stone which he already had—I said I could—he asked me the price for printing 5,000 or 10,000 copies and if I could make blocks or stamps to fill in the blank spaces—I said I dare say I can manage them—he gave me the address, "W. S. Bourne, 11, Amersham Park Road, New Cross—I told him if this had been a Bank of England note it would not be allowed to be copied—he said that it was for advertising purposes and he did not think it would make</p>

               <p>any difference as the bank was not in existence now, but that ho would inquire whether the bank was in existence and whether it was right to copy it—he went away leaving those portions of the note with me that he had showed me—he asked me if I could find the paper—I said I should prefer his finding it—I sent him the price by post on Saturday and he wrote to me on the Sunday (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was making inquiries and if he found it would be legal he would call</hi>)—he called on me on the Monday and said he had not had time to make any inquiry but that he would do so and let me know, and he repeated that he believed there would be no harm in printing it as he believed the bank was not in existence—he asked again if I could make him stamps for the blank spaces and whether they could be done at once—I explained they could all be printed at one printing—he asked me for the two pieces of the notes, the copies he had given me, and I gave them to him, and he left with me this small reproduction of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, saying he would probably give me an order for a similar reproduction of a Colonial newspaper—he asked if he left me the customers address would I pack and forward them to the colonies as it would give him a little trouble—he left asking me if he made the inquiries and came to the conclusion to give me the order for printing and forwarded me the stone and the paper and a cheque, would I complete the order and send it to the address he had given me—I told him yes—I never saw or heard from him again—on the Saturday after he left and before he called on the Monday I looked in the Directory and finding the bank existed I communicated with the Colonial Bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The pieces of paper were left with me from the Satur<lb/>day to the Monday—he said when he first came he was inquiring with regard to certain modes of advertising—he did not tell me then it had been done in the case of the old West Indian Bank, of Bridgetown, Bar<lb/>badoes, for advertising purposes—I don't think that was the bank he told me which was not in existence, he may have—I have thought over every word he said—I knew nothing about colonial notes—I was doubt<lb/>ful whether it was allowable to copy them, knowing that it was not to copy Bank of England notes—I sent the price to him of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 5,000, or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 10,000.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to Hughes and Kimber, Limited, manufacturers of printing machinery—on 12th February the prisoner came for a lithographic press with all necessary materials—I showed him presses, and he selected one of the smallest—he gave his address "W. S. Bourne, Amersham Park Road, New Cross"—a litho<lb/>graphic printer named Ramsay was with him—the prisoner paid for the press, this is the invoice and receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know nothing about the pencil memoranda on the invoice—they were not made by me, or in my presence, or to my knowledge, and they were not on the document when we parted with it—the press was sent to his address—he asked if we could pack and send it abroad if he wished it—this is the press (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these stones have been used—on them now is "Hughes and Kimber," with an address and rough sketches of a cottage and of a head—those have been put there since we parted with them—when I saw the materials afterwards some of the ink had been used.</p>

               <p>compared with the sharp impression of an engraving—they fill up the blanks by means of this stamp; the blank date and number would be set up in type, a transfer taken on to stone, and then the required parts of notes printed from the stone—if you required to vary the numbers you would have to vary them on the stones, and so increase the number of stones, but you could print half a dozen at once by overlapping the notes—you could not in that way fill up all the blanks on each note at the same time; but I should have one stone for one blank and another stone for another blank, and so on, a stone to represent each blank—the proper and easiest way of filling up the numbers would be by a rotary stamp—these stones are used a great deal in business for the purpose of small circulars and duplicate letters to a great number of customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-manager to the Direct Photo Engraving Company, No. 85, Farringdon Street—I first saw the prisoner on Monday, February 22; he came and asked whether we had any novelties for advertising purposes—I said we did not go in for that, we were simply reproducers—he showed me a portrait of the Princess of Wales, a coloured chromo, and a proof of a Colonial Bank note which I took to be a circular—I believe it was the back and front of one—he asked whether I could print them—I said we could, and he asked a price for about 5,000—I said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per 1,000, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 5,000—he asked if he brought the stone if we would print them, and if we could supply the paper, or if I could recommend him to a place where he could get the paper—I recom<lb/>mended him to Messrs. Tanner and Co., Salisbury Square—he showed me also a coloured photo and asked if we went into that—I showed him specimens of our work—he seemed satisfied with the price, and said he would bring or send the stone—next day ho brought this stone wrapped in brown paper, with a piece of white paper gummed over it so as to protect the surface—he left the stone and said the paper would follow; would we have them printed—I asked his name; he said, "Stanley, Gannon Street Hotel"—shortly after, on the same day, a packet of paper came from Messrs. Starkey and Sons, with a letter signed Stanley, (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> "12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, Tuesday, February</hi> 23," <hi rend="italic">and requested that a proof might be ready at</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">p.m., as he was leaving for the North next day, and that it should be taken from his paper then sent</hi>). In consequence of that we got a proof ready, and about 5 o'clock the prisoner called again and I handed him one or two proofs similar to these, but printed on large paper back and front and not cut down—he seemed satisfied with them and simply asked whether we could print them a little bit lighter or greyer, I believe he said lighter—I said we could easily do that—I mentioned to him that we had enough paper to print about 7,000, and he told me to use it all up and that he wanted them the following Monday—he asked if we could get them packed up in a light deal box for shipping with his mark on, a diamond I believe—I said it should be seen to and then he left—he did not pay—I did not see him again till he was in custody—our attention was called to the matter, and our secretary made inquiries at the Colonial Bank—we had printed a few more notes in the interval—I have compared this genuine note with the proofs we printed, and they are a photographic <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> of it, with the exception of blanks for the name of the branch, the number, the signature, and the date—this was one of those we printed—I should say the paper which we used was as close a match as you could get in the trade to that of the genuine note—this one, except for the colour</p>

               <p>and dirt, is, precisely the same as the one we printed—dropping a note into any brown liquid would produce this colour—I should say it was printed from the same stone—the name of the engravers, Perkins and Bacons, appears on the stone and on the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The original note is from a steel engraving, and is sharp and clear—I should not call this other good work for lithography; it was cheaply done, I believe; we did not do it, it appears to me rough work—I don't say the paper is the same, but it is a close match—we had no instructions to cut the notes, and as they were printed four on one slip we should have packed them like that for shipping—I understood we were to ship them—we employ about 30 men—the order was not allotted to any particular men, but simply given into the printing room in the ordinary course of business—I took the order thinking it was an adver<lb/>tising novelty—he just discussed the Princess of Wales's portrait with me and I showed him a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> among our specimens, and he asked about that and I said if he wanted anything done with regard to that he must apply at <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> office; I believe he asked if he could get copies of it—we had not got them, <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> had—I did not catch the remark he made about how the case was to be marked—there was some<lb/>thing about a diamond, but I did not catch the letters—he might have said "W.S.B." in a diamond; he mentioned some letters—he said nothing about letters finding him at Gannon Street Hotel—he asked if I could recommend him to a firm of photographers, and I recommended him to Meisenbach and Co.; he wanted some photographs reproduced—we were talking about advertising novelties.</p>

I am clerk and bookkeeper to Perkins, Bacon, and Co., of 69, Fleet Street, and son of one of the partners—they print the notes of the Colonial Bank—this note is a genuine one of that bank, printed by us—they all bear the name of our firm as printers, back and front—we print the body of the note from a steel plate, leaving blanks for the date, number, place of issue, and signature, and those blanks are afterwards filled in when we get the order for the particular branch—the branch and the date are stamped by hand, the first two figures of the date being on the plate, and the last two being stamped—the numbers are put on by a rotary machine, and the signatures are written on by the bank manager and accountant—this note printed from the stone is a facsimile of the original note, leaving the blanks; it contains our name on front and back—I can see in the blank space for the date a faint trace of the date 1st July, 1884. which corresponds with that of this genuine note—the date and number pasted on this paper appear to have been cut out of the genuine note; I trace round the numbers and letters the stamp writing of the genuine note—the date and figures have been altered in pencil, the 4 of 1884 to 0, and the F to E in the numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Our note was worked from a steel engraving, and was sharp and clear, and easily distinguished from the blurred appear<lb/>ance of a lithographic note—one of these is much darker than the other; I cannot say if that is the fault of lithography—we are copperplate printers—the stamp writing is on the lithographic note, but it is very blurred and indistinct, and difficult to make out as being there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Where the date and numbers have been cut out the stamp writing has been attempted to be filled up, but it does not run regularly across as it should, and is far more indistinct than the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the Colonial Bank—I produce the Charter of incorporation—I have been there nearly 20 years, and was in the West Indies 11 years—I have counted thousands of these notes—if these notes were completed and presented with genuine ones we should probably take and cancel them without looking at it further—I should think this has been deposited in a solution to make it look old—genuine notes get into this condition very soon by usage; after being in use some time they feel quite different to when first issued, they get nasty and sticky.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> W. S. Bourne and Co. had an account with the bank in Demerara, when I was there, about 1876 and 1877; it was no specially large amount that my attention would be called to—I could not say if it was a substantinl account; I took no notice of what was not more than ordinary commercial accounts—I believe I was asked that at the police court—I have since looked through some account books, I have not found that between 1874 and 1879, 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were purchased on London—I cannot say if I was asked that question before—I believe I was asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050075"/>
               <p>whether thousands had passed through their account, we have no means of ascertaining—I have looked through our accounts casually, there has not been time to communicate with Demerara, we had four weeks, and it takes six weeks for the home and return voyage—I cannot say I know they were permitted to over draw their accounts on mail days—I was not asked that before—I believe I said before "Bourne and Co. used frequently to buy our three months, bills in Demerara; my memory as to these tran<lb/>sactions is now very small, and does not serve me; I fancy we can find out the amount of three months, bills bought by this firm"—I did not try to find that out, I don't know why, it was no business of mine to do so—Mr. Humphrey's clerk called at the bank to obtain information with regard to this; he was refused any information, and was told to the effect that it was a piece of impertinence his having come—I believe there was such a bank as the old West Indian Bank, Barbadoes; I know nothing about it, it was before my time—it has ceased to exist—I never heard that the prisoner had been printing his name on the notes of the Colonial Bank, in circulation, or that the bank quarrelled with him on that account—I could give you some information as to Bourne and Co. for dealing with the bank, out I should have to bring records for years and years; I was asked about it at the police court, I had the means at my disposal to obtain the information, but I have not done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Bourne and Co. ceased their transactions at our bank in 1879 I think—we cannot trace that they had any account with the Barba<lb/>does Bank last year—returns are made to the bank every fortnight, from its branches of current accounts, and drafts advanced—if the books have been kept, they are still in possession of the bank, and could be examined—firms do not always buy bills from us in Demerara, they might do so for other bankers, so the information in our books would be incomplete.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant, City</hi>). On 26th February, about noon, I and two other detectives were watching the prisoner and arrested him at Cannon Street Railway Station—I said "We are detectives, I shall arrest you—you will be charged with knowingly having in your posses<lb/>sion a lithographic stone for the making or printing of parts of a bank bill or blank bank-note of the Colonial Bank without lawful authority or excuse—he said "Yes; I did not know I was doing wrong; I intended it for advertisement"—he asked to be allowed to go and see a friend—I told him he could not—on the way to the Old Jewry he said "They ought to have told me I was doing wrong"—I said "Who?"—he said "The lithographers; they told me they had printed bank-notes before"—I searched his office, and in a pocket-book found the lithographed notes with the blanks and the original notes and this stained note, a piece of paper with the date and numbers on it cut out of the original note—also the receipt for two reams of paper from Starkey and Son in the name of Stanley—he was taken to Bishopsgate Street Police-station and charged with having these notes his possession—he said the two were pulled off</p>

               <p>the stone and the other was the original note—he gave his name as William Seymour Bourne, and his address 11, Amersham Park Road—I went to that address and found there the printing-press which is pro<lb/>duced here—he occupied two furnished rooms—in a black bag in the room I found the other copies of the Colonial Bank notes on thicker paper, not printed back and front—I received from Mr. Henschel this stone and these other proofs—I also found and produce a number of documents.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manager to my father, a lithographer, of Elm House, Peckham, who has been in business about twenty-two years and employs from twenty to thirty hands—the prisoner came there as near as I can say on 30th or 31st January, 1886, when my father was out—he brought a bank-note like this produced, but these two pieces were not cut out—he said he wished for an advertisement squib, and showed me a small copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and a portrait—he wished them copied, and we copied them—we were to copy the whole of the note and afterwards to take out two small pieces of it, the number, the signature, and the place—he said he was going to fill them up for advertisement purposes—he asked me whether an indiarubber stamp had been used for those portions of the original note—I said that was not in our line of business, but if he gave the order we would have it done—he said he thought he should want 1,000. but he might want more—we had to print the whole note in the first instance, and then erase those parts—we put it on the stone which is here and took two copies from it, for which he called, but they were not ready, so we sent one or two good proofs to 11, Amherst Road, New Gross, with a bill, which has been paid—we did not take off any other specimens, but sent the stone to him—the numbers, dates, and addresses could not be filled in by the press produced without the greatest difficulty—it could not be done with this stone—it is more for an amateur and is of no practical use—it would be much easier, except where a complete fac-simile is required to take the whole of it on.</p>

I am Superintendent Registrar of the pariah of Islington—the defendant is Registrar of Births and Deaths for the Upper Holloway sub-district; his office was at 37, Tufnell Park Road—he was previously vaccination officer for one division—as Registrar of Births and Deaths he was supplied with books printed in different columns—this is one of them; No. 9—the entries are numbered con<lb/>secutively—it was his duty to enter all the particulars, and for the informant to sign in this column—at the end of each quarter he has to make out a copy of the register, certify it to be correct, and send it to me; he has to copy the signatures—it is also his duty at the end of each month to send to the vaccination officer of his district a return of all the births registered by him for the purpose of checking the vaccination—when a birth is registered it is the prisoner's duty to hand to the person registering, a form similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced)</hi>, on the flyleaf of which is a certificate which has to be signed by the medical man who vaccinates the child—the prisoner was paid for that by the guardians, for which he makes out an account at the end of each quarter, and returns it to me, and it goes to the clerk to the guardians, and it is paid by him—the prisoner was paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each of the first 20 entries, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each subsequent entry; and a fee of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each birth in respect to his monthly return to the vaccination officer; also 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each form he gives out—in book No. 9 entries 256 to 263 are made by him on 24th August, they are the last 8 entries that day—entries 264 and 265 on August 25th are also made by him; also 494 and 495 on September 24th—they all purport to be signed by the person registering the births, except 267 and 264, which are signed with marks as if the person was illiterate—the prisoner made a record at the end of the quarter, including all those entries—I compared it with the register, and certified it to be correct—this is it, it goes to Somerset House, and is filed there—he also sent me the account at the end of the quarter to be rendered to the guardians, and I certified it to be correct—this is it, it shows 632 births registered during that quarter, including the cases we are now inquiring into—I know the style in which the prisoner writes, and he writes in a great many styles—the signatures of all these entries in the register book are his writing partially disguised—one or two of them purport to be a woman's writing, the mother—on 30th October I saw the defendant in consequence of a report from the Board of Guardians—I asked if he was aware he was charred with manufacturing entries of births, he said "No"—he came to the office two or three hours afterward; took me on one side and said "Do I understand that I am charged with making false entries; I hope you will understand that I deny making any false entries"—that was all that passed—I saw him again when I made the inquiry for the Registrar-General, I showed him these 10 entries, and asked him to give me any reasonable explanation why 10 persons should come consecutively and give false addresses; he said that they were anti-vaccinators, and explained the medical certificates as</p>

               <p>being made by them, or by the secretary to the society; I asked him to give me the name of any anti-vaccination society in the district, or any number of persons who were endeavouring to resist the vaccination laws; he said he could not; I asked him why ten persons, supposed to be anti<lb/>vaccinators should be registered, 8 on one day and 2 the next, giving false addresses, and also indulging in the luxury of forgery—he said nothing—I called his attention to two other certificates, none of these, one in the name of Lucas which contained the name of Martin in the body of it, and one in the name of Martin which contained Lucas's name; I noticed that the "M" in Martin was like the "M" in his admitted writ<lb/>ing, and asked him if he would mind writing in a back hand the word "Martin"; he wrote this, and I compared the final "tin" with "Austin," which is very like—when he mentioned the anti-vaccinators, I said, "Do you suggest that they do this in registration ink?" that is a peculiar ink ordered to be used—he seemed staggered, and did not answer for a few minutes, and then he said, "I suppose it is possible for other people to get registration ink"—I said, "It is possible, but not probable"—I called his attention to entries 494 and 495—the twins sup<lb/>posed to have been born at 82, Brunswick Road, the father's address being in Scotland; he said that he had no recollection of the case, but assumed it was given in the ordinary way, and he had marked "d" signifying that the children were dead—there is a pencilled "d" to each entry, and the entries should be in the death register; but he explained that the deaths had taken place in Scotland—one entry is by a railway porter, and another by a plasterer; they are in a very clerkly hand, which I called his attention to, but he said nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Malins first set the inquiry on foot, and the Board of Guardians reported to the Local Government Board—after I had inquired, an inquiry was held by the Inspector and the Registrar-General, Mr. James Lewis—the defendant and I were present—Mr. Lewis conducted the inquiry and took notes of the points in the case—the inquiry lasted about an hour—it was for Mr. Lewis to report to Somerset House—the defendant was suspended at that time, but he was afterwards reinstated, and has been discharging his duty up to to-day—in the regulations we have the names of two stationers given for obtaining registration ink—one is Morrell—Morrell sells ink to anybody besides Registrars—it is not manufactured for Somerset House, but it is selected as the blackest and best—the defendant had to return duplicate copies to me every quarter, and a weekly return to the Registrar-General with the names and dates only; and to the vaccination officer he sends a monthly list giving the numbers of the entries and the names and addresses—each entry is numbered consecutively—the vaccination officer never sees the register—if he sent a number of fictitious entries to the vaccination officer and missed them afterwards, the Guardians would at once detect him, because he would alter the total; the numbers are not only consecutive but corresponding—each entry has a number which covers all the entries—he was not registrar of marriages—in the case of deaths he acted on the informant's statement and the medical certificate—the entries of August 24th are considerably in excess of the other days of that week, and of the average of the month—all that the vaccination agent had for his guidance was the monthly list sent him by the Registrar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Vaccination Officer, of No. 1 District of Islington—that includes the district for which the defendant was regis<lb/>trar—I received from him the returns of births by him in August last; this is it, it is signed by him as a correct return; it includes entries 256 to 265—I also received from him this return of births registered in September, and numbered 494 and 495, the Brace twins—that is also signed by him as a correct return—I also received the vaccination certificates after they had been given by the medical men, either from them or from the parents—I received these nine certificates relating to entries 256 to 265, number 259 excepted—they all purport to be signed by medical men—in the case of the twins 494 and 495 I received no certificate, and did not expect one, because on this form the column is left blank, showing that no certificate was given out—that implies the child is dead; and he told me that the children had died in Scotland, and I marked it in pencil—numbers 256 and 257 purport to be signed by Dr. Goode—I knew his writing and communicated with him, and finding that they were not signed by him, I communicated with the guardians—I afterwards received a letter from Dr. Goode, and showed the defendant all the certificates, and said, "I have got a number of certificates here which I believe are all forgeries"—he looked at them and said, "I expect they are from anti-vaccinators, I used to have lots of them;" and he said he thought if I made inquiries at the addresses I should probably find they were false—I said, "I don't know whether it is my duty to trouble about them"—he said, "No; if I were you I should send them in"—and I did so because I get a fee from the guardians for each—I afterwards made inquiries at all the addresses, but was not able to find any of them—after I had reported the case to the guardians I received this post card in the defendant's writing, "Will you be at your office soon after 9 to-morrow; I want to get some addresses from you. J. B."—I also received this, "I sent you a post card on Friday, but I am afraid it went to your office so you did not meet me; will you be at Road at 9 o'clock on Monday morning; try and find some of these people out, and get the addresses for you"—these certificates and returns are in the defendant's writing—I have received them from him at different times.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Red Lion Square, and have been engaged some years as an expert in handwriting—I have examined the entries in Register Book No. 9, 256 to 265 and 494 and 495—I have also examined the nine medical certificates relating to these entries and have compared them with the defendant's writing and the returns made by him at different times, and in my opinion the entries in the Register are signed by the defendant, and the medical certificates are in his writing, disguised—in the case of Noon, entry 265, the signature of the Register is in his ordinary writing—some of the signatures purport to be those of women; they are more disguised than the others.</p>

               <p>cannot recollect whether any other expert has been called with me for the Treasury—an expert has been called against me for the defence—not Mr. Chabot, but Mr. Netherclift—I have practised since Mr. Chabot's death in 1882—Mr. Netherclift was before Mr. Chabot—Mr. Netherclift his only given his opinion against mine twice—I have been a witness on many occasions—I do not always expect a jury to accept my conclusions—I have not known of experts swearing that documents have been written by one individual when another individual has got up and said he wrote them, but I have been told of it—I have compared these entries with the numerous registers and sheets written by Mr. Broome, his own official work—the signature "Noon" is like his ordinary writing—the "n" finishes like a "u," but with that exception it is like his ordinary writing—No. 256 is in a lady's writing—the "mith" is like the defendant's writing when you turn it into a lady's hand, which is more sharp and angular—the remaining nine entries are some of them disguised and some very like his writing—this "Smart" is in a lady's writing—"Fish" is very like his, and so is "Fenton,' and "Noon" and "Ord" is like some of his writing, and would at once be noticed, I should say, by any one acquainted with his writing—the vaccination certificates are, I think, all very much disguised—there is the educated hand and the uneducated, and there is a great similarity between individuals of such classes. I find similarities between them—I should not say that in the uneducated classes there is a great resemblance in persons' writing; they differ much more than those of the educated class—I did not know the defendant before this inquiry—I was sent by the Treasury, but not to give evidence against him—I did not think the Treasury were defending him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This matter was submitted to me for the mere purpose of making a report to the Treasury—I was not influenced by a desire to get up a case against the man—in No. 258 W. Fish is described as a railway porter—the signature is that of an educated person—the signature of Mr. Fenton, the plasterer, is in a good clerkly hand—Noon is a house painter, and his is a good round hand—in each entry the same hand occurs in the defendant's admitted writing—in the medical certificates he writes the name of the child who is to be vaccinated, and I have his own writing with which I can satisfactorily compare the rest—this signature H. Brace is decidedly in the same writing—the signature Harry Brace and Mary Brace are the same—there are two entries in each case—there is a difference in the "H" and in the "B," but the "B" is like some that were made by the defendant some years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Henry Barker and Sons, wine merchants, Moorgate Street Chambers—in April, 1885, John Lee called and said he was travelling for Kavanagh and Co., and could induce Kavanagh to purchase cigars if we could supply him at a price that would suit him—I said we should be pleased to do so if Kavanagh was safe to trust—he said Kavanagh was possessed of means, he was a barrister, and he believed he was safe to credit—shortly afterwards I received a letter which has been lost; the contents simply were to supply a certain quantity of goods; it was addressed from Kavanagh to our firm—in consequence of that letter we supplied cigars to Kavanagh for the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in three lots, about the end of April or the first week in May, 1885; they were eventually paid for—I received these 11 orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between 13th May and November, in consequence of which I supplied cigars and wine to the amount of 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I applied from time to time for the money, I never received any—I applied personally and by the traveller, as well as by letter—I saw Kavanagh in both the outer and inner offices—on some occasions I may have seen Archibald there—on two occasions I saw George Lee—I also received these two letters from Kavanagh.

               <p>Kavanagh, Cooke, and Co.—on John Lee I found a pocket book and memoranda relating to the business—I searched Kavanagh—I found this pocket book, containing letters and memoranda, some of them bearing the heading of the Automatic Compound Fire Extinguisher, Kavanagh's patent—I examined the rooms—in the first office was a very small desk and a stool—in the next office was a stool and two or three empty boxes, and two boxes containing empty tins of the fire extinguisher, and several full tins, packed up by the side of a bench—one extinguisher was sent to Professor Tidy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the official analyst to the Home Office—on 19th March, Sergeant Reader brought me a tin canister which purported to be an automatic fire extinguisher—having analysed the contents I think its value would be 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be liberal—the contents, taking 100 parts, consisted of moisture 8.80, mixed nitrate potash and soda 37.67, crude sulphur 30.45, resin 12.16, and silica 10.92—the nitrate is worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb., sulphur Id., resin 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it would assist in extinguishing fire, as the resin would burn at the expense of the moisture, and produce carbonic acid; the sulphur would burn; carbonic acid and sulphurous acid would be produced, which are gases which have a tendency to extinguish flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Kavanagh.</hi> The canister was sealed and delivered to me with paper round it—the lid of the box was secured, and there was a fuse—it was wrapped in brown paper, and sealed with red wax—it had a label—in my analysis I found no manganese ore—it was badly mixed.</p>

The fuse comes through the tin; a great many fire extinguishers are on that principle—the difference between your fire extinguisher and others is that yours is a self-igniting one—the hand-grenade is a solution—your idea is a self-acting one, automatic—I do not think it would intensify a fire—a large quantity of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and have been so for about 24 years—on Wednesday, 3rd February last, I went to a meeting at the Holborn Town Hall—I there saw the four defendants on the platform with others—Champion was the chairman—they all four addressed the meeting—it was a meeting called by the body called "The social Democratic Federation," to call for measures to meet the wants of the unemployed; it had reference to a meeting that was to take place on the following Monday in Trafalgar Square—Champion called on those who were desirous of seeing effective measures taken, to carry out the resolutions that were submitted to the meeting, to go to 36, Hatton wall on the Sunday night to concert practical measures in regard to the wants of the unemployed, and in direct reference to the meeting to be held in Trafalgar Square the following day—I should think, roughly speaking, about 1,500 to 2,000 people were at the Town Hall meeting, the place was very full—I took a note of Mr. Hyndman's speech on that occasion. (<hi rend="italic">This was objected to and not pursued.</hi>) I did not go to Hatton all on Sunday—on Monday, the 8th, I went to Trafalgar Square about half-past 1 in accordance with instructions I received from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office—when I got there I saw a great number of persons assembled in the square, but not so many as were there subsequently—they were standing all over the square, but the greater number were round the Nelson monument—the meeting of the unemployed was to be at 3 o'clock, it was called by a different body—I did not see any of the defendants</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050098"/>
               <p>there at first, except that I saw Burns's back; I did not know him at the time, but I found afterwards that it was him—he was then on the north side of the plinth of the monument; he had a red flag in his hand—there was some speaking going on, but the crowd was so dense and moving about that I could not get near, and I was at the rear of them, at the west side of the monument—I sought to obtain the assistance of the police to get on the plinth—there were a number of people on the plinth—I did not hear anything said at that time—presently I saw Burns on the stone balustrade under the National Gallery, the terrace—I heard him address the meeting there—I have it in my remembrance that the other defendants were there from the first because somebody asked me who they were—I have Burns's speech, I made some shorthand notes of it, and after the meeting was over I transcribed them; a part before I got to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, and there I transcribed the rest—I afterwards saw a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>; I did not check my transcript with that, I only took the last part of it—the other speeches I had written before the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> came out—the original short<lb/>hand notes were left as usual on the desk at the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office; I have asked about them and was told they were destroyed 24 hours afterwards—that is the usual practice when the transcript is made—I have the transcript that I made that afternoon—Mr. Burns was the nominal chair<lb/>man, there was no chairman there, he stood on the platform in the posi<lb/>tion of leader—it was just about two o'clock, or a minute or so alter, when he began to speak there—I think I remember the clock striking two—I have made a copy of my transcript for the purpose of being attached to the dopositions—Burns had a stentorian voice, and could be heard distinctly at a great distance. (<hi rend="italic">Reads.</hi>) "He declared that he and his friends of the 'Revolutionary Social Democratic League' were not there to oppose the agitation of the unemployed, but they were there to prevent people being made the tools of the paid agitators who were working in the interests of the Fair Trade League. He went on to denounce the House of Commons as composed of capitalists who had fattened upon the labour of the working men, and in this category he included landlords, railway directors and employers, who, he said, were no more likely to legislate in the interests of the working men than were the wolves to labour for the lambs. To hang these, he said, would be to waste good rope, and as no good to the people was to be expected from these 'represen<lb/>tatives,' there must be revolution to alter the present state of things. The people who were out of work did not want relief but justice. From whom should they get justice?—from such as the Duke of Westminster and his class, or the capitalists in the House of Commons and their classes? No relief or justice would come from them. The unem<lb/>ployed too, the working men, had now the vote conferred upon them. What for? To turn one party out and put the other in? Were they going to be content with that, while their wives and children wanted food? When the people in France demanded food the rich laughed at those they called 'the men in blouses,' but the heads of those who laughed soon decorated the lamp-posts. Here the leaders of the Revolutionary Democratic League wanted to settle affairs peaceably if they could, but if not they would not shrink from revolution." The crowd had increased amazingly by this time; I should think there were 1,500 people there—a very large part of the crowd were of the orderly working class who were certainly men out of work, but the large part were very violent in their</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050099"/>
               <p>expressions—the rougher part cheered and applauded the speeches—Burns asked those who were out of work to hold up their hands, and nearly all the hands were held up—then the speaker took up another strain, dwelling on their right to work and their right to live, and warning them not to give ear to the Fair Traders who were having a meeting for heir own purposes; that was the three o'clock meeting—Mr. Champion spoke next—the defendants were in the hearing of each other when they spoke. (<hi rend="italic">Reads.</hi>) Mr. Champion "declared that the Government which had now come into power were able in 24 hours, when they thought they personally needed protection from <hi rend="italic">Dynamitards</hi>, to carry a measure. Now was needed a measure to protect lives more valuable and of more import<lb/>ance than any of the governing classes, lives which had to be dragged out in miserable homes, and it behoved this Government to set on foot at once remedial measures for the existing state of things. The speaker demanded the provision of work and the enactment of laws limiting labour to eight hours a day, and insisting upon the erection of better homes for the labouring classes at a rent within the means of workers. He also called upon the crowd not to be made the tools of the flair Trade Leaguers, who wished the people to pay more for their food and neces<lb/>saries of life, in rich men's interests, and then proceeded to say that if the demands of the workers were not granted the people must be con<lb/>tented to go back to their starvation and to bear quietly in the future, or else they must bring home in a practical way responsibility to those who had made it impossible for something to be done." Mr. Williams next addressed the meeting. "He now said he was not contented to clamour any more for work, and advised his hearers as men in want of work to regard the position from his point of view. He quoted words from Shelley, 'We are many, they are few.' The many were workers in want, the few were owners of wealth. The few were organised, while the many were not organised, and if the many organised and banded themselves together, the wealth of the country would change hands. The people should not care for Liberal or Tory, but should seek to benefit their own class. They must put the fear of man in the hearts of the rich and so obtain what they wanted." Mr. Hyndman next spoke. "He said the people out of work were asked to be moderate, but how could they be moderate when they were out of work and starving? If the thousands there had he courage of a few they would very soon alter the existing system of things. But what happened? They went away from meetings like that and forgot all about what they had heard. He and his friends would lead if they would follow, and even 500 determined men out of the thou<lb/>sands present could very soon make a change. It depended upon them whether they would drive the middle classes to bay, and if they did they would soon win." Mr. Burns then spoke again, "he observed that the next time they met it would be to go and sack the bakers' shops in the west of London. They had better die fighting than die starving, and he again asked how many would join the leaders of the Socialists, a question in reply to which many hands were held up. The men over there, Mr. Burns added, referring to the speakers at the rival meetings, were paid agitators, who were living on the poverty of the working classes. Those whom he was addressing he said pledged themselves to revolutionary doctrines, which elicited cries of 'No, no.' He concluded by asking the question, 'When we give the word for a rising will you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050100"/>
               <p>join us?' to which a large number of the audience replied that they would, and almost as large a number declared they would not." Besides these speeches other speeches were made—Mr. Burns was constantly, waving the red flag—I heard something said which I did not take down; I heard Mr. Burns make one observation which struck me very much, and that was, "We must have bread or they must have lead"—the speaking at that part of the square went on, I think, till about ten minutes past three, as far as my memory will serve; it might have been a little later—at that time I turned my attention to the other meeting—I did not see the end of the meeting at which the defendants were present; the speaking had finished where they were and the people went away, and I went to the Fair Trade meeting at the Nelson Column.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. I heard both Mr. Burns and Mr. Williams speak at the Holborn Town Hall on 3rd February—it is in my mind that they all made reference to the meeting of the 8th—I have not got the words they used, but I know they were all referring to it—I can't say that I remember the words they used—I have only part of the notes which I found among the slips on which we write, and they only refer to Mr. Hyndman's speech, the most particular parts; we do not take full notes of a meeting of that character, where only a paragraph is required—I have it now in my mind that Mr. Burns was referring to the Fair Trade League and the Fair Traders, and that the meeting on Monday was not held in the interests of the working-classes, and I remember some expression being used that they should go and break down their plat<lb/>form—I cannot tell who said that—I was communicated with by the Treasury authorities about this—I have here the original transcript that I sent in to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> office—the original notes are gone, they are not lost, they are gone before—I heard the two resolutions that were sub<lb/>mitted to the meeting at the Holborn Town Hall—some portions of the speeches I took from <hi rend="italic">The Evening Standard</hi>—the red flag I saw in Trafalgar Square appeared to be bigger than that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was on a stick—I will not swear it was twice that size—it was about the size of a very large pocket-handkerchief—the first speech I heard Burns make he was standing on the balustrade—there was a very considerable crowd below him—the rougher class were mostly on the terrace—they were fairly orderly below—I can't say how long Burns spoke—I did not care about putting my hand in my pocket to get my watch; moreover, my attention was diverted to other things—I may have said that what he spoke would make a column and a half, which I reduced to forty or fifty lines—it would be quite a matter of guess—I think you suggested that he might have spoken a column and a half, and I said he might have done so—I don't say it was a column and a half, I only adopt your words—I gave the character of the speeches in a necessarily condensed form—if there had been any qualifying words they would have been reported—it is not a matter of opinion, they are matters of fact—a reporter is an apostle of fact—I heard all Burns said in his first speech—it was not in his first speech he said "We must have bread, or they must have lead"—that was subsequently—in a subsequent part, when the meeting got more noisy, a sentence would be lost, because my attention was directed elsewhere—I was in a position to hear all he said and I heard every sentence he uttered, but I did not take it all down—his voice is a tremendous one—I can't tell how long Williams spoke; I won't pledge myself to time—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050101"/>
               <p>I said at the police-court that his speech might make half a column; again I adopted your words—I reproduced it in fifteen lines—he might have spoken about ten minutes, which would make about one-third of a column—a rapid speaker would speak half a column in ten minutes—he spoke rapidly at the Holborn Town Hall, but at a large meeting like this he would speak deliberately, in order to make his language tell—the fifteen lines fairly represents the character of his speech—Burns made a speech later on—I took a shorthand note of that—he spoke several times; then the meeting was getting of a changeful character, and the crowd had very much increased—where I was standing the crushing was not felt—the crushing was on the outskirts of the crowd, 50 or 100 feet from me—there was a roar of voices in the distance, but they did not interrupt my hearing—there was considerable noise and crushing in the square—when there was a noise the speaker turned round and stopped and then went on again—I heard Burns say "We must have bread or they must have lead"—I took that down, but I did not report it in the paper, in the public interests—had I written all the violent exclamations the public, abroad especially, might think there was a revolution in London—it would have given a fictitious character, an alarming character—at the time I wrote it appeared to me that the meeting was of a some-what peaceable character; at least, not of an unpeaceable character—<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> has an editor and a manager—they gave me no instructions as to what I should put in and what I should leave out—I was on my own responsibility and my own feeling—I had no book in my hand—these are the copy slips of the paper used in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> office, and in the same way I wrote the shorthand notes of Mr. Hyndman's speech that night—in an open meeting of this character my experience has shown me that is the best way to write it—I took down more of the speech than I wrote out—I took down as much as would perhaps make a column and a half, if it was all written out—a good deal was necessarily omitted—the short summary makes forty or fifty lines—I heard Mr. Champion put the resolution—I think Mr. Williams seconded it—I think it was the same that was given at the Holborn Town Hall on the previous day—it was certainly of the same character—I went away before the meeting broke up and moved towards the other meetings that were going on—I did not hear Burns say "A suggestion has been made to me that we should march through the West-end to Hyde Park"—I heard Mr. Champion at Hatton Wall speak with regard to the meeting on Monday—I did not attribute any sinister meaning to what he said, not in regard to life or property in the metropolis—when I left Trafalgar Square I left a very large crowd there—the rough element came on the scene then—there was a very large number of real unemployed people there; people of fustian and with stains of labour upon them—the roughs kept very much together, and so did the working class—that was how I was able to take my notes in peace and comparative quietness—the working class was below and the rough element above—they became very disorderly; in fact, the platform on which I stood was broken down—that was an hour afterwards, near four o'clock—the defendants had then left the square—this was at the other end of the square, not very far from the Nelson Monument.</p>
               <p>

               <p>long as Mr. Hyndman—I had no reason for cutting your speech short except that I had other business to do—I put the salient points—at Hatton Wall you spoke of the steps taken by the Members of Parliament—you said they had been invited to attend, and read letters from them approving the objects of the meeting in Trafalgar Square—you spoke there to the same effect as at Hatton Wall, the two speeches were much the same in tenour—in Trafalgar Square you spoke of the rapidity with which legislation could be carried out, and that Parliament was able to pass the Explosives Act through both Houses in 24 hours, and that a special act for the relief of the unemployed could be passed equally speedily if they liked—you demanded the passing of a law limiting the hours of labour to eight hours; that was the gist of your long speech—you recom<lb/>mended constitutional and legal steps for calling attention to the great distress among the unemployed—there were police all round the Nelson monument—I sought the assistance of one policeman to get on the plinth, not of Superintendent Dunlop—the meeting I went to was the 3 o'clock meeting—yours commenced at 2 o'clock—I heard no language inciting to violence—there were some violent expressions from persons in front of me—I was summoned to the Treasury the day before the proceedings at Bow Street—I objected to be called as a witness, I said it was incom<lb/>patible with my position as a reporter—I was then handed my copy, and was requested to sit down, and I was asked if I heard anything else besides what was there; the matter was then quite fresh in my mind, and I mentioned some of the expressions, and I said I heard the expres<lb/>sion from Burns "We must have bread or they must have lead," and immediately that expression was written down—I said that I heard that—the solicitor did not ask me if I heard it, I volunteered it—I saw one other gentleman in the square who I supposed was a reporter, who he was I don't know, I thought it was Mr. Stead, but I am told it was not—other reporters must have been there—I did not take my notes from other papers—all my notes were written before the evening papers came out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hyndman.</hi> I have not, prior to these meetings ex<lb/>pressed any strong opinions of this agitation—I never attended any of your meetings, and knew nothing about your opinions—I cannot tell when I took my last verbatim report before this meeting—I go to meetings every day of the week, perhaps 500 in the year; it is almost a matter of daily experience that I have to use verbatim shorthand—at the Holborn Town Hall you spoke of building artisans' dwellings, and said it would be a very profitable thing—you dwelt upon the financial question—at the end of your Trafalgar Square meeting I went over to a fourth meeting that was being formed—there were five meetings altogether in the Square—when Burns was speaking I was about 60 or 65 feet from the balustrade—I went and measured it afterwards—there was an enormous crowd of 15,000 or 20,000—there was no pushing or shoving where I was—I heard the speeches—I heard no qualifying words to what I reported—I was thrown down in the square—the platform broke down, I don't know who broke it down—I saw a bag of flour thrown—that was on the plinth of the monument—before this I saw a policeman covered with flour—I could not tell the names of the persons who were speaking then—I say you delivered a violent harangue—I did not adopt the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter for the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I attended the meeting in Trafalgar Square on 8th February, I arrived at 2.45 p.m., and saw some persons standing in front of the National Gallery—Burns and Williams were two of them; I heard Bums speak, and took down what I could hear, or that I wanted to take—these are my original notes, and this is the transcript that I made at the time—Burns said "Next time you meet here, will be to sack the bakers' shops in the West End; we have had too much talk; I stand here as an unemployed workman and as a revolutionist; the next time it will not be to move resolutions but to take the wealth and the bread they daily rob us of. You have pledged yourselves to a revolutionary platform; when you are called upon will you respond like men? the Social Democratic League and Union will assist; it is not true we are disunited; will you respond like men? Mr. Sparling, the Secretary of the Socialist League, will now address you"—Mr. Sparling did so—Burns also said "Unless we get bread they must have lead," and as I remember that was said twice—I think he spoke four or five times, and when the meeting broke up he said, "It is suggested we shall march through the West End; those who will go, hold up their hands;" I took that down—a great number held up their hands, and they moved towards the West End—Burns was carried along on the shoulders of the crowd—he had a red flag at some part of the proceedings—Williams had addressed the meeting before I got there, he made same remarks about Mr. Pigly, which I took down; I have the speech here, but I am not certain of the identity of the speaker.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sparling, he was standing behind Bums, except when he was speaking; he was between me and Burns the greater part of the time but some distance off—there is a possibility of his using the words bread and lead, and my mistaking them for Burns's words—it was impossible to pay much attention, because four or five meetings were in progress at one time—I believe Williams spoke, but I am uncertain about it—when Burns spoke of marching to the West End, I think he said "It has been suggested that we should march through the West End"—I heard nothing said about protracting the speeches until the disorderly crowd had gone in another direction; the red flag was like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and not much larger; it was not a formidable banner, it was on a stick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cricket-bat manufacturer, of 167, Tufnell Park Road—on 8th February, at 1.30, I went to Trafalgar Square—there were some thousands of people there—I saw the defendants at the base of the Nelson monument when I arrived—Burns had a red flag in his hand; he said that it was not the first he had had in his hand—there were policemen there, who turned the defendants off, and then they went to the balustrade in front of the National Gallery—I heard Burns speak there; he said that unless something was done for them, at their next meeting they would ransack the bakers' shops, and they would have to do the same as they did in other countries—he named France, and said they went there in their thousands to the Government and demanded bread, and were laughed at, and two years after the heads of those who laughed were stuck on the lamp-posts—Burns spoke two or three times—I heard all the other defendants speak, but do not remember their words—Burns made a remark about going round west, and somebody shouted out "To the clubs"—the crowd then moved to the west, and I saw Burns as he was leaving the square, with a red flag in his hand in the front of the crowd, and they followed him towards Cockspur Street and into Pall Mall, where I saw Burns climb up the parapet in front of the Carlton Club—he spoke there, but I could not hear what he said—the red flag was still in his hand—he then got down and moved in the direction of St. James's Street, and the crowd followed him—I saw some windows broken at the Carlton, but at no other club that I noticed—I saw a lot of windows broken on the left side of Ht. James's Street—they then turned into Piccadilly, where I saw some windows broken and a trunk being thrown about, but did not see where it came from—I went on with the crowd into Hyde Park and went towards the Achilles statue, and saw several carriages being smashed by the roughs, and I went and warned</p>

               <p>one or two of the coachmen in the drive; a mounted policeman followed me, and when he caught mo up I went back to the Achilles statue and saw Burns on the pedestal, and afterwards the other three—I heard Barns speak from the statue and say "We have shown them to-day what we can do with stones, and unless they do something for us we shall show them what we can do with powder and shot"—I saw Williams on the pedestal beckon to a reporter who was below in the crowd with a book, and I believe Williams assisted him on to the pedestal—some of the crowd cried "Lead us to Oxford Street," and "No reporters"—not withstanding that the reporter began to take notes on the statue—the four defendants were close together on the pedestal, and each of them spoke, I cannot say in what order—the reporter stood close to them, in a position to hear and take down all they said—the cry of "Lead us to Oxford Street" was raised once or twice during the speeches—after the speeches the defendants all went off towards Notting Hill together, and the crowd moved towards Stanhope Gate—I went with it and passed with it through Dean Street into South Audley Street; a lot of windows were broken in both those streets, and shop fronts were smashed in and a lot of things stolen—I saw a lot of bread and some rabbits, and all sorts of things; I did not notice any jewellery—I went with the crowd across Grosvenor Square into North Audley Street, and saw shops smashed in, and then into Oxford Street, where there were some constables, I do not know how many, but the crowd dispersed—I left about 5 o'clock and walked along Oxford Street to Tottenham Court Road.</p>

I have not seen my depositions since I was at Bow Street—when I was first called to the Treasury they took down in writing what I have told you—I have not learnt it by heart since, I have not seen it—I have three shops and employ four men at present—when 1 was at Bow Street I was only employing one—I supply some of the police with cricketing goods, but never played with them—I hardly know why I followed the crowd—I was not one of the unemployed—I was an idler, it' you like—I had gone in the City to call on my brother, and was going for orders as well, but not for the police—I went to the meeting out of curiosity as much as anything—I knew that there was great trade depression, and I sympathised with the unem<lb/>ployed—I arrived there about 1.30 and saw Burns on the Nelson Column—I left the square about 4 o'clock—I did not follow Burns when he left the Nelson Monument—I only heard Burns make one remark respecting the flag—I was struck by his voice; he had a good voice—I heard him on the balustrade when I was in the middle of the square—there were a lot of people; they were not very noisy—I made no note of what Burns said—I may have had greater power of hearing than others had—I am not dull of hearing—I will not swear to what I have said word for word, it is two months ago—I do not remember the portions between the defendant's sentences—before I left Trafalgar Square the crowd got very noisy and there was a good deal of horseplay—I did not notice any police, except those round the Column, guarding it, I suppose—the crowd was increasing in size and in turbulence, and the police nowhere visible—I saw no police as we went up Cockspur Street—the crowd went on to the Carlton Club, and there I saw window-breaking take place—I saw no police there—I saw some persons at the window of the Carlton Club smiling, I suppose, at the ragged army—no damage was done till then that I saw—I saw something thrown from the centre of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050106"/>
               <p>the crowd, but I will not say they were stones—after the crowd got into St. James's Street it increased in violence—I saw no police in Pall Mall or at Hyde Park Corner—I saw a few by the Park gate inside—I don't know what they were guarding—when the crowd got into the Park they separated in two portions—most of them went on the right-hand side of the statue, and I saw Burns get on the monument—there were not more than 200 people at the statue when I first got there—Burns appeared to be waiting for the others, who had got behind—there was horseplay and confusion to my right—Burns was almost in front of me—the crowd ran a great portion of the distance to the gate—I was ten or twelve yards from Burns—he commenced speaking two or three minutes after I got there with the crowd—I was about 100 yards from the front of the crowd, as near as I can judge, in the middle of it—I do not remember hearing Burns say "You have shown by your procession through the streets to-day your poverty and determination"—he may have said so, I did not hear all he said—I did not take down the words "We have shown them to-day what we can do with stones, and unless they do something for us we will show them what we can do with powder and shot," and I cannot swear to their verbal accuracy, as it is some months ago, but they were words to that effect—I heard Williams speak—I don't remember what he said—I said at Bow Street that he said "Those who insult young ladies are not worthy of the name of men," and I remember Champion using similar words; they denounced those who insulted ladies coming along—I cannot say whether it was Williams, but one of the speakers denounced those who had broken windows; one of the speakers said that they were ashamed at what the mob had done—I did not notice any of the defendants during my passage to the West-end—the Treasury communicated with me on the Saturday, but I had communicated with them on the previous Wednesday—you can, if you like, say that I am an informer, but it was not with the intention of giving any of the speeches that I went there—I offered to give them evidence respecting the riot—I had no intention of giving evidence against any of the defendants, but when I was asked if I remembered any of the speeches made, I told them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Champion.</hi> I do not remember seeing you at the Nelson Monument—I think I first saw you on a balustrade opposite the National Gallery—my brother is not a prize fighter, he is an amateur boxer; he was not with me in the square—I have no evidence to give of what you said in the square—I did not see you on the right at Hyde Park—I do not remember hearing the crowd in Hyde Park say "Shoot the aris<lb/>tocracy"—I heard you ask all those who had brothers among the soldiers or police to get them to side with the oppressed, but I do not remember your saying "If the day should come"—these riots have damaged trade very much—they caused shops to be closed, and that was my motive for coming forward—I saw you go from the meeting, in the direction of Notting Hill; you were on the right hand side of the drive, the left side facing the Statue—I should not be surprised to hear that you were in Piccadilly five minutes afterwards—I did not speak to the patrol—I saw one mounted policeman ride down the drive and go away; he stopped some carriages; I did not speak to him—I preferred this information two days afterwards; in the interim I saw the accounts in two news-papers—I did not go to Scotland Yard to give evidence about what you said, but to put a stop to these riots, as it was said each day afterwards</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hyndman.</hi> I do not remember much pushing when I first got into Trafalgar Square—there was a very large crowd after<lb/>wards—there was noise and pushing—I don't remember seeing a man put into the fountain, nor did I notice hats knocked off—there was pushing and shoving if that be horse-play—I saw a bag of flour strike a police<lb/>man, it might have been thrown at some one else—it was rather a disorderly than an orderly crowd—I could not have sworn then to seeing you on the Nelson Monument—now I do believe I saw you, if not you some one very like you—I should be surprised to hear you were not there till an hour later—I had never been to a public meeting of that sort before—I took no interest in it; but I wondered what they were going to do, and so followed as far as the clubs—I did not hear much of what was said—there was pushing and running and shouting, but I did not notice any stone throwing till we got to the Carlton Club—I believe there are jewellers shops and clubs along there—I saw some people inside the windows of the Carlton Club; I saw some of them smiling—I saw nothing thrown from the club—I saw something, I could not say what, thrown at it—I should have noticed if it had been a big stone—I noticed no one molested in the neighbourhood of the club—I noticed stone throwing in St. James's Street; at the bottom of that street there was a cart full of rubbish of some sort—I don't know what it was—there are shops on the right hand side of St. James's Street—I noticed no breaking of windows or pilfering going on there—I saw the windows broken on! the left—I did not notice one policeman from Trafalgar Square to the top of St. James's Street—the crowd was scattered and running with no appearance of any special order—I don't Bay there was any appearance of anything like design—I saw no policeman from St. James's Street to Piccadilly—I saw one or two shops broken into at the corner of Piccadilly—I noticed no policeman up to Arlington Street—I did not notice you at all—I went on with the crowd to the park; it took about half an hour I should say to get there from Trafalgar Square—I noticed no clock any where—on entering the park the bulk of the crowd seemed to go to the right of the statue—I did not notice which way they went, they did not get so far as Stanhope Gate, but they were moving that way—I did not see them come back to the statue; I don't know that I should have if they did—I was about twelve yards from the statue—I can swear to the phrase, "We have shown them what we can do with stones to-day, and unless they do something for us, we will show them what we can do with powder and shot to-morrow;" it was to that effect—I say that Burns said that—there were several remarks made, but after that there was a disturbance—there was no disturbance when he first got up, they were very quiet then, waiting for what he was going to say—when I got in the park I went and warned all the carriages just in the drive on the left by the railings close to the statue, and told the coachmen to turn back; Burns was not on the statue when I did that, as he stopped at the bottom of the statue before he climbed up, I thought he was waiting for some of you, those were the first words I heard Burns say, to the effect I have mentioned—I would not swear that was the commencement of his speech—I should think the speaking at the statue</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I was at the meeting in Trafalgar Square, I got there about five minutes past three, and stayed till about 4 o'clock; I was in several parts of the square, chiefly near the Nelson Monument—shortly before 4 o'clock I saw a crowd of three or four thousand people moving along westward, towards Cockspur Street and Fall Mall, and I went with them—at that time I had not seen any of the defendants, I had seen a red flag waving at the top of Trafalgar Square—at the Reform and Carlton Clubs a halt was made, and a speech was given by some one on the balustrade of the Reform—at its conclusion some one in the crowd cried out "Three cheers for the Social revolution"—some one spoke from the balustrade of the Carlton, but I could not hear it; there was a red flag there; no windows were broken at the Reform, but at the Carlton there were—in St. James's Street and Piccadilly, some in the clubs and shops, and all the windows of the hotel at the corner of Wellington Street were smashed—chiefly gravel was thrown about, and some loose blocks of wood paving, and empty trunks were being kicked about—I got into the Green Park on the left and went quickly along to get to Hyde Park—I there saw some carriages stopped and the windows broken, and I saw things taken away from some of the people in carriages inside Hyde Park, and missiles thrown at the carriages, at the glass probably—I went to the Achilles Statue, about 400 or 500 people were there when I got there—all the defendants were there on the stonework of the statue—Burns commenced to speak; I think the first sentence I heard was "We have shown them what we can do to-day"—I was amongst the crowd in front of the statue—I think some other words followed which I did not hear—I took out a book and began to take a note; this seemed to displease some of the crowd, who called out, "No reporters, turn him out"—I said "I am not a Government reporter, I am a newspaper reporter: let me alone"—some of the defendants then hauled me up to the pedestal of the statue, from which they were speaking—I took down their speeches—I have a transcript of my original shorthand notes, which I have compared—Burns began, "We intend to submit to the Govern<lb/>ment all the resolutions that we moved, and pending the time we shall know what they are going to do, I ask you to be satisfied with that. (Cries of 'No' and 'Oxford Street.') We must insist on their doing what we want. (Cheers.) The reporter has arrived. (<hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> reporter here arrived.) He probably knows what has already taken place. We are deter<lb/>mined that this business shall end as we the workers wish it. (Cheers.) We are determined to have an opportunity for those who through no fault of their own are starving (cheers), and I will ask this reporter to tell the Government and the people of London that unless they concede all our requests, then I say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050109"/>
               <p>there will be revolution in the streets of London. (Cheers and cries of 'Now's the time.') It is all very well for some hot-headed men to say 'Now's the time,' but you are not so large as you were. We will choose the time when we are strong enough to go, and not before. It isn't worth while losing one's life for breaking a window. When we lay down our lives it will be on behalf of the hungry. I ask you now to peaceably break up. I hope you will go away (No, no), and next when we meet we will tell you what to do." Mr. Champion: "I know perfectly well that this crowd can't stand against soldiers, or even against police. (Cries of 'Yes.') Listen to me; you cannot stand against them as you are now, but this you can do. Go from here, many of you have friends in the Army, in the regiment of Guards who will be the first brought down to clear this park. Go away and tell them, every man, so that when the day does come for taking sides in this great class struggle they will not side with these people who drive up and down here to-day, but be on the side of the suffering and privation you see here. (A voice: 'Shoot the aris<lb/>tocracy.') No, no, you want to upset the system, and breaking windows or interfering with women in carnages won't do that. I saw the window (interruption) that girl who was frightened. You who are fighting for the (<hi rend="italic">Qy.</hi> emancipation) of your class, are you going to fight against your-selves by frightening timid women like thin? (A voice: 'It wasn't a man, it was a cur.') I was ashamed of the men who took the brandy out of the wine shop, and tore down that shopkeeper's (<hi rend="italic">Qy.</hi> ties). Those are not the men. If your peaceable (? reasonable) demands are not met (confusion), my counsel to you is separate from here; go each man to his own home, but before you go to bed to-night find out some man in the soldiers or police, spread among them the truths we have told you to-day, so that if we have occasion to call another meeting it shall be so large, so organised, so orderly, so threatening, that your demands will be conceded without bringing you face to face unarmed and poverty stricken as you are (sentence unfinished.)" Mr. Hyndman: "Those who broke the windows were the paid champions of your enemies. If you are firm friends they must give in. They have seen you to-day, seen you march past their palaces. I ask you not to forget that you are (interruption). I ask you as a friend, both a middle class man and an officer (renewed interruption). You know perfectly well we are trying what we can do, at some risk to ourselves, against a system. I ask you not to render our work impossible. We are not organised. Mr. Champion is an Artillery officer and he knows you will have no oppor<lb/>tunity against them. Organise, organise, and educate each other. We are going to demand from each party, so that the labourer may live in the land of his birth. I say have a good try first, and if all peaceful means fail we will be the first to call upon you to prevail." Mr. Burns: "Probably all the speakers here to-day will be in prison to-morrow. I hope so. I will tell you for why—the more they prosecute and imprison, the greater the cause of the workers will become. We are not strong enough at the pre<lb/>sent moment to cope with armed force, but when we give you the signal will you rise? (Loud cries of 'Yes.') Then go home quietly; the signal will be given if the Government doesn't move. (Oh!) We have shown our devotion to the cause of the people for five or six years. We have done everything men could do, and I (urge Qy.) you as a workman, as chair<lb/>man of the meetings to-day, to disperse and arrange when we shall strike a blow for our own emancipation Kindly disperse; now kindly go home."</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050110"/>
               <p>Then Williams again spoke: "Kindly go home for the very simple reason that there are a number of roughs who take delight in smashing windows, and don't do it because they want work. Don't attempt a revo<lb/>lution when you are not organised for it." (Cheers and cries of "Oxford Street." Then Burns and Williams said "No more speeches"—I took those speeches down from the lips of the speakers, so that I can speak to the accuracy of them—there had been little movements towards Stanhope Gate, and when the speeches ended the crowd went in that direction—I got off the stonework and ran with the crowd to Stanhope Gate—I did not see what had become of the defendants then; I do not think they had got off the stonework then—I went into South Audley Street, where I saw shop windows broken and goods thrown about in the street—Minton's china shop windows were smashed and the goods thrown about—I waited there some time and then went across Grosvenor Square into North Audley Street, where I saw the same sort of thing had taken place—windows had been smashed and things thrown about—I went as far as Marylebone Lane, where there were policemen—the crowd had begun to dwindle away then; I followed a portion of it into the City—I think about the last damage that I saw done was in Oxford Street, opposite Marylebone Lane—on the Wednesday after I was sent for to go to Scotland Yard, and afterwards I was seen by the Solicitor to the Treasury and my statement was taken—I produce my notes, and this transcript taken from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMP<lb/>SON</hi>). I don't think I saw the leading article in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I had a communication from the manager of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> asking me to go to Scotland Yard—I was at Trafalgar Square on 8th February for about three-quarters of an hour; I was there for the purpose of taking the speeches, I took some, but did not report them—I arrived there about 3.5, and stayed till a few minutes to 4, about the time the crowd departed—I thought it was a very lively crowd, about as lively a one as I had ever seen—I mean it was composed of a rough element, I should say it was the rough element of London—those who went to the West End were mainly the lowest class to be found in London; there were a few working men, as I found out by inquiry—when they left the Square I was on the pavement in Cockspur Street, on the other side of the Union Club, rather towards the end of the mob, then I pushed my way forward along Pall Mall—I did not see any damage done up to the Reform Club, the crowd stopped simultaneously between that and the Carlton—I observed some speaking going on at the Carlton, I did not see any stones thrown—I did not see anybody at the windows of the Carlton, I think I saw some female servants there—the windows were closed; I don't think anything could have come out of them from Trafalgar Square to the Carlton—I had not met a single policeman, I only saw one behind the War Office gates—I went with the crowd up St. James's Street, I saw stone-throwing there by the roughs; that was my impression—I reached the top of St. James's Street without seeing a policeman—I then went into the Green Park and along the north pathway; I saw no policeman in the route—a good portion of the crowd went to the statue, and another portion remained near the gates—when I got to the statue I found a good many people there already, I gave it as 400 or 500, but the number was</p>

"We have shown them what we can do to-day," or words to that effect—I was standing in front of the speakers—I have my original shorthand notes here (<hi rend="italic">reading them</hi>)—then Mr. Williams and Hyndman spoke, then Wil<lb/>liams spoke again—at the Achilles statue Burns advised the people to go home quietly—after the speaking the great majority of the crowd pro<lb/>ceeded to Stanhope Gate, others went in another direction—I did not see any policemen as I went towards Stanhope Gate; I saw one mounted policeman previously, he did not make any vigorous effort to disperse the crowd, I think he made a vigorous effort to get away from the crowd—I said at the police-court" I have been in crowds inclined to disorder, most crowds are inclined to disorder; I do not remember such an entire absence of constables as on this occasion"—I adhere to that.</p>

On 8th February I was at the head of the Metropolitan Police—I received information that a demon<lb/>stration of the unemployed was to be held in Trafalgar Square on that day in the early part of the previous week from the Secretary of the London United Workmen's Committee—I do not knew that they are known as the Fair Trade League—it came to my knowledge that it was the expressed intention of the Socialists to interfere with that meeting, and to take their platforms and use them—we made inquiries; ascertained a meeting of the Socialists was to be held on the evening previous, and means were taken to ascertain if any such threats were held out, but they were not; we were given to understand that the Socialists intended to be present, and there was reason to apprehend there might be collision between the two bodies—no intention of disorder on the following day was expressed at the meeting—I detailed double the number of constables I had before on each occasion, apprehending there might be a breach of the peace, and I also made arrangements along the lines of route people attending the meeting might take—I attended the meeting myself, and it was very similar to almost every other large meeting I have attended in the last 17 years—there was a certain disposition to horseplay that I have seen at every meeting; it did not seem much more <hi rend="italic">rowdy</hi>, but the opinion of other members of the force was that it was—I saw none of the defendants there, they are personally unknown to me—certain missiles that had been thrown at the Carlton Club and had fallen into the area were afterwards brought to Scotland Yard; they consisted of various objects, such as men generally carry in their pockets, old snuff-boxes, handles and blades of knives, and tobacco-boxes, and one very large stone, and it may be a few smaller ones—I did not observe the crowd going westwards; I observed it going down Whitehall and the Northumberland Avenue, and up the Strand—I took plenty of arrangements there, and, on the chance of some of them going down Pall Mall, I ordered the reserve in St. George's Barracks to go down Pall Mall, but the order was misunderstood, and they went down the Mall, and Pall Mall was left with only the police on ordinary duty—I had no reason whatever to expect an extra<lb/>ordinary disturbance on this occasion, except a collision between the unemployed and the Socialists in Trafalgar Square—it has always been usual for many years past for conveners of public meetings in Hyde Park and elsewhere to communicate with the police authorities, and arrange<lb/>ments are made—we have had no Socialists' riots or <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> for 17 years—a year previously a meeting of the Socialists was called on the Thames Embankment, and no disorder resulted—there have been communications between the police and the Socialists, they asking us to assist in pre<lb/>serving order; a friendly understanding subsisted between us.</p>

I am an artist, of 4, Langham Place—I am not a Socialist—I belong to no political organisation—I was at the meet<lb/>ing in Trafalgar Square on 8th February—I saw Burns there—I noticed him first at the foot of the pedestal of the Nelson Column and afterwards saw him mounted on the balustrade in front of the National Gallery—I was between 40 and 50 feet from him—I heard him speak; I can't say how long—his speech was much shorter on the balustrade than before—at the beginning he looked round at the crowd and said "I am speaking to 20,000 or 30,000 people; there are many contending elements present, and I hope you will go home to your homes quietly"—several voices said "We have got no home"—in the square, near where I was standing, there was a young man who was very demonstrative—he had got a loaf, I don't know whether it represented the big loaf or the little loaf, but he threw it at the crowd, and that kind of horseplay continued for some time—there seemed to be a man being jostled, and Burns leaned forward and said "Leave that man alone; don't be cowards;" and on the left of the speaker there was a waterproof or oilskin upon which men were pouring water, and he stopped it—I could hear Burns better than any<lb/>body else, his voice was stronger, but I could not catch all he said—I was listening very intently—I did not hear him say "We must have bread or they must have lead"—his oratory did not have an exciting effect on the crowd; it rather quieted them—they were rather more noisy before it—it seemed that the whole tenor of his speech was an endeavour to convey to the Government the need of the people, by causing a big meeting and impressing on the Government the wants of the people through the newspapers—that was the idea it gave me—I am quite an independent witness.</p>

               <p>heard it all—the general drift was to speak to the perple to organize themselves, so that they could have more power in bringing their wants before the Government—I cannot recall any particular passage, or the substance of any passage—I did not hear him say that a good rope would be thrown away, but I heard a man in the crowd repeating it—I heard something about hanging and something about the aristocracy—I heard the word "revolution" spoken once under the pedestal—there was a reference by Burns to the bakers' shops, but it was different to the way it was given in the newspapers—there were qualifications—I did not hear him say "bakers' shops," I heard him say "West-end," but I certainly did not hear what they put in the newspapers—he said something about if the Government did not act, the shops at the West-end might be sacked, giving the example of the French Government in the last century, when they did not listen; it was qualified in that way—he also said in that same sentence that people went to him to get bread, and he told them to eat grass, and three weeks afterwards his head was on the lamp-post, with grass in his mouth—Burns did not speak of the West-end, he said Hyde Park, and he asked the crowd who were in favour of going there to hold up their hands—he was acting as chairman and made a number of short speeches—he may have spoken three or four times—I have said that in my opinion no disturb<lb/>ance would have taken place if the crowd had remained in the square, and had not gone West—of course, they moved through the West-end streets to get to Hyde Park; and then he said if the Government resisted the demands, or did not yield to them, the shops might be or would be sacked; it was qualified in this way, that it would lead probably to trouble, unless the appeal of the people was listened to—that was received with great applause by a certain amount of the crowd—the proposition to go to Hyde Park was made later on—a good many speakers followed—my opinion is that Burns did not use the words "bread and lead"—I do not know the powers of my ears, but I think I heard everything; I could not lay my life upon it, but so far as my observation went, he did not use them at all—it was a natural platform on the wall, and on Burns's right was a youngish man with his legs astride on the balustrade—the four defendants followed one another speaking, but I won't say they had all arrived as early—when Burns was leaving the monument he held up a red flag or handkerchief sometimes.</p>

As far as I remember there was something said about a head on a lamp-post; it was when Governments do not listen to the people in the shape of a popular movement it will often lead to trouble, and then he gave an illustration from the French revolu<lb/>tion—I did not hear him give an illustration about a Cabinet Minister—it is not likely that such a strong phrase as "bread and lead" could have escaped my attention—I did not understand Burns to address the crowd in such a way as would lead them to march to the West End and sack the shops, or I should have followed them—Burns did refer to French history as an illustration of what came to the Government by not listening to the popular movement.</p>

               <p>saying that he and his friends would lead if they would follow, he and 500 men—I remembered many more sentences at the time than I do now—there was a very strong impression that it was a mistake about the bread and lead, and I volunteered my evidence—I heard some man in the crowd say something like it when Burns was speaking on the balustrade, and it struck me that they might possibly have been repeating words which they heard from the balustrade—there was a speaker on the balustrade who was not Mr. Burns.</p>

               <p>some members of the club at the window, looking out on the people, it seemed to me as if they were jeering at us, and the crowd said "They are only laughing and jeering at us"—I then noticed stones or some<lb/>thing slung at the windows—I think it was stones, some hard substance it must be, it broke the glass—I won't swear it was stones, I did not see it—in my opinion the throwing was caused by the jeering at the windows—I saw Burns in the crowd at this time, I did not notice Williams there—I heard Burns tell the people to stop throwing stones—he got on the railings of the club and spoke, and shouted out to stop throwing stones, and he caught hold of some of them—he did that at some risk to himself, I should not like to have tried it—I afterwards saw Williams in Picca<lb/>dilly—I saw him catch hold of people and tell them not to throw stones or damage property, or molest loot passengers that were coming in the opposite direction, he did that more than once, at different places down Pic<lb/>cadilly—when we got to Hyde Park gates about two-thirds of the people went towards Oxford Street, the rest stopped at the Achilles statue—I heard Burns speak there, I was about four or live feet from him—he said "We intend to submit to the Government the resolutions that were passed in Trafalgar Square," and he told the crowd to disperse and go home quietly—I did not hear him say" We have shown them what we have done with stones to-day, we will show them what we can do with powder and shot to-morrow"—I remember words to this effect, "We have shown them to-day by our march, our poverty and our determination"—I heard Williams speak, he counselled the people to go home peaceably and dis<lb/>perse, and he said he was surprised that working men should molest foot passengers and timid women, something to that effect—I was there at the break-up of the crowd; they went home, I believe, I know I did; some went one way and some another.</p>

               <p>the Carlton; it was the signs of contempt at the windows there that affected the crowd—I did not notice anything from the club but the jeering; if anything had been thrown from the club I might not have seen it—I saw things falling about, but I don't know where they came from—it could not have been gravel that the crowd threw, it was some<lb/>thing larger than gravel—I only saw one policeman, and that was in Pall Mall, at the bottom of St. James's Street—I saw some policemen in Hyde Park—I didn't see any along Piccadilly—I should judge it was about half-past 4 o'clock when we got to Hyde Park—I saw a body of men go up the right-hand side, away from the statue—I heard you speak there—I don't remember hearing any ejaculations in the crowd while Burns was speaking, the crowd was orderly; I went home—I am a Socialist—I am not employed now, I was at that time.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050123"/>
               <p>came before the Board that they did not consider the amount of distress exceptional, but on being pressed they said there was more illness in conse<lb/>quence of the low state to which the people were reduced, and one of the officers said he thought there was much distress—I think we called them up as the result of your deputation—we wrote to the Local Government Board as to relief works and outdoor relief—it might have been a week, a fortnight, or a month before we got an answer—I cannot say at all—I moved that a Committee of Guardians should be appointed to inquire into the distress, apart from the relieving officers, as the result of your deputation—we investigated not quite the Tory poorest streets, such as you had selected, and on working out the result I found about 20 per cent of able-bodied men were out of work—we opened a stone-yard, and the medical officers gave relieving orders to those whose debility was pro<lb/>duced by want of food—I don't think the deputation had much to do with that—we did not apply to the Local Government Board for leave to grant outdoor relief till the deputation came—you were the spokesman of that deputation—the impression left on my mind was that you had given a very careful study to this social question, and had a very clear grasp of the Poor Law, and you proposed that the Guardians and Government authorities should take steps to diminish the immediate distress as a ample method of philanthropy, without regard to Socialism or any measures of that sort—the Boards of Guardians are bound hand and foot by the regulations of the Local Government Board, but that has its inspectors—I know last year you were advising the Local Government Board to give to the Boards of Guardians leave to give relief, and you were referred to us, who had no power-of action—we made representa<lb/>tions after this deputation—I am a banker, not a Socialist—I have since discussed Socialism with you, and find it is a complicated subject, not very easy to understand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">By Champion</hi>). I am a member of the Holborn Board of Guardians—I remember the receipt by them, of a communica<lb/>tion from 39, Hatton Wall, the Social Democratic Federation, on Wed<lb/>nesday, 20th January, referring to the distress alleged to exist in that district—no steps had been taken before that time by our Board to meet any exceptional distress—that letter was referred, on my motion, to a Committee of the Board, and on the following Wednesday a deputation waited on the Board—you were among the four or five that entered the Board room, leaving a large number outside—after you had addressed the Board and withdrawn, the Board discussed the whole question and passed three resolutions, one which Mr. Hoare has referred to, asking the local Government Board to give exceptional power to deal with able-bodied men—the second was asking the Clerkenwell district of Holborn for work to men living in the Union, and the third was to write to the Local Government Board, asking them to commence the new offices about being built somewhere in Whitehall at once, for the purpose of making work, and also to complete the arrangements for clearing away the site of the House of Correction, that artisans' dwellings might be built in the neigh<lb/>bourhood—the Board acceded to your moderate requests—at your request I attended a meeting of the body, it was perfectly open—our resolutions wore forwarded to the Government—I cannot tell what the Government have done in reply to our resolutions—the power of the Boards of Guardians to give relief is strictly confined under the consolidated orders of the Local Government Board, and that power can only be increased by</p>

               <p>the Local Government Board—the only means the Local Government Board have of knowing whether exceptional distress exists are from Exports of the Boards and of their inspectors, and those have been met by the statistics of the relieving officers, showing no exceptional distress—our committee found a grave amount of distress among workmen from want of employment—I went to see many districts, and sent down many cases for relief, and had children sent to school that were in a wretched condition—we suggested that in the cases of a large number of able-bodied men who could not get relief, the doctor should give a certificate if any of the children were ill through debility, so that we could give the families coals and food—numbers of the working class were reduced to a state of no food, no coals, no blankets, and no sheets—nothing was done till the deputation came from Hatton Wall—finally the Local Government Board told us they could not grant us exceptional power of relief to able-bodied men, but that we could open a labour yard, and watchmakers, carpenters, and skilled labourers were sent to break stones at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra and bread for the married men—the Guardians were dealing with things in the ordinary way, and these things would not come to their notice—in one street I was in myself there were 35 men out of em<lb/>ployment—a large number of men out of employment were labourers, painters, and men of all trades in fact—you asked that houses should be built on the waste lands; that the Board had no power to do—there are waste places in Clerkenwell—the committee proved there was a large amount of overcrowding—the death-rate is bad there, owing to the physical condition of the people, so that they are suffering and dying owing to want, and are crowded together.</p>

I live at Foley Street, Marylebone, and am a tailor—I am in employment now, I was not on 8th February—I then attended the meeting in Trafalgar Square—I am not a Socialist—I arrived there between 20 minutes and a quarter to three—I saw Burns on the balustrade facing the National Gallery, and went up to hear him speak—I was 15 to 20 yards from him, he was nearly at the end of his speech when I arrived; I heard him denouncing the Fair Traders in general terms; I heard him use no words about bread and lead—I ran off to see them <hi rend="italic">duck</hi> a Fair Trader just as Williams began to speak, and when I came back I heard him quoting the words from Shelley—the crowd was full of mischievous fun—I left Trafalgar Square with the body that moved west—when I got opposite the Carlton there was a pause for about five or six minutes; I saw a great number of people in the windows; they were laughing at the crowd—I saw a gentleman in the window point to a man in a very ragged coat, and they all began to laugh—I saw some milk cans fall from what I took to be the Carlton, from a very great height—I was hit with some pieces of soap and boiled potatoes—I went on to Hyde Park, I was near Burns and Williams, the entire route—I saw some of the roughs in the crowd trying to loot Dare the hosier's shop; Williams pulled them</p>

               <p>away, and prevented them as much as was possible for one man—I saw a gentleman struck several times, and Williams ran after him, and called on some of us to protect the gentleman, and we did so—I saw men with stones in their hands in Piccadilly—in Stratton Place, at the Baroness Burdett Coutts's, I think, there was a cart filled with stones—William pulled the stones out of the men's hands repeatedly through the entire route—once when the men were attacking some ladies, he shouted out "You are cowards and not men to act in such a way"—he several times told them to stop stone throwing—it was a very dangerous thing for him to do, and I think he suffered by it—when the crowd neared the gates of Hyde Park, a portion detached itself from the main body, and went up Park Lane, and the remainder went in the park gate—the crowd kept breaking away towards Oxford Street and the Marble Arch—I came up to the Achilles Statue, and was near enough to hear Burns make a speech, I was only two or three feet from him—I was there before he began—the opening of his speech was "You have shown them to-day by your procession, your poverty and your misery"—I swear positively he did not say "We have shown them to-day what we can do with stones, and we will show them at our next meeting what we can do with powder and shot," nor did he use words to that effect—when they were dispersing he told them several times to go home quietly, he kept repeating that—Williams denounced the cowardly conduct of the men in the Park, who were breaking open carriages, and assaulting ladies and gentlemen—after the speeches, those round the statue at the time went away very quietly—there were small knots of people scattered all over the roadway, as far as I could see, and as far as I could see after the meeting broke up they dispersed and went away very quietly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By Champion.</hi> I did not hear you speak in Trafalgar Square—immedi<lb/>ately you started speaking in Hyde Park there was an interjection from the crowd, "The soldiers are coming," and another voice said "Shoot them down"—you said "It is all very well for you to say 'Shoot them down,' but they are organised, and you are unorganised"—there was great sense in that remark—I believe there was something said about shooting the aristocracy, I cannot swear to that—I heard you denounce the crowd for their cowardly conduct in attacking people in the park—you said it was a system you were attacking, not individuals—the meeting at the Achilles statue was over at 15 minutes to 5 by the Piccadilly gates clock, I swear that positively.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By Hyndman.</hi> The working-class portion of the crowd at Trafalgar Square and Pall Mall was very orderly—I did not hear you speak—it was my impression that the attitude of the people in the Carlton Club produced some effect—I saw a knife thrown at the Carlton, no large stones were thrown at it—the crowd round the Achilles statue was very quiet indeed—I heard a great many ejaculations and interruptions from the crowd while Burns was speaking—I did not hear the phrase at all to my recollection about powder and shot, and I heard also very repeatedly ejaculations in Trafalgar Square—I repeatedly heard the ejaculation "Hang them," I ejaculated it myself as a joke—I did not think there was any prospect of setting to work to hang them then and there. I wish here was—I was out of employment then, and felt and feel very bitterly its to my situation—I heard you speak from the Achilles statue—some remark was made from the crowd about shooting them, or something of</p>

               <p>the sort, and you said "It is no use you men talking like that; Mr. Champion, who is an artillery officer, will tell you it is no use unarmed men attacking armed men "—you said the men who looted shops and rioted were not the friends of Socialism, but their enemies—I saw several bodies go off towards Stanhope Gate before we arrived—I saw one body go towards Park Lane—I should think the speaking at the statue lasted for a quarter of an hour, and then the crowd peaceably dispersed.</p>

I heard Burns say at Trafalgar square that those men calling themselves Fair Traders were bogus labour representatives of the working classes; I only heard the concluding part of his first speech, I remember nothing more of it—I heard him make several remarks when he was introducing the different speakers, nothing more—if he had made anything of an inflammatory speech I should have noticed it—Burns made a speech opposite the Carlton—a stop was made there simply because of the laughing and jeering in the window—I did not hear Davey examined—the jeering was the cause of the stop-page—the crowd forced Burns to stop, to make him see they were laughing at our poverty; I was one of those that caused him to stop—some gentlemen were pointing to people and to one man with a ragged coat in the crowd—I believe the milk cans fell from the top of the club—I don't suggest the gentlemen threw them; they were not thrown back at the club—I saw a knife but no stones thrown—I did not hear Hynd-man or Champion speak in Trafalgar Square—in Hyde Park directly Champion started speaking the crowd interjected "Soldiers," and some one said "Shoot them/' and Champion said "It is very well to say shoot them, but they are organised and you are disorganised"—that is all I recollect of what he said—Hyndman denounced their conduct as being cowardly in the extreme in attacking individuals as they had done, and Williams said the same—the phrase powder and shot was not used by anybody when Burns was speaking, to my recollection—I did not hear anybody say it; if Burns had said it I should have remarked it—I believe I heard something like "We will Choose the time when we are strong enough to go, not before; it is not worth while losing one life for breaking a window"—I do not recollect his saying "When we lay down our lives it will be on behalf of the hungry," nor "I hope you will go away, and when we next meet we will tell you what to do"—I heard him tell them to disperse quietly—I heard him say "Probably all the speakers here to-day will be in prison to-morrow," and "I hope so"—I did not hear him say "The more they prosecute the greater the cause of the workers will become," &amp;c.; nor "The signal will be given if the Government will not move"—I heard something to the general effect of what has been given as Champion's speech—the words "Hang them" were ejaculated several times by a good many in Trafalgar Square—I was in rather an angry mood, and am in the same now—it was the Fair Traders I wished to hang; I called it out in a joke as much as anything else—I meant by what I said just now that I would like to hang the promoters of Fair Trade, Lord Dunraven and that gang of people, not the workmen.</p>

               <p>blackguards than usual; Mr. Bradlaugh's crowd was several shades more respectable; you ought to have taken care of your watch if you went into this crowd—among them were many whom I should have considered as the genuine unemployed—I saw no violence, except that one man was tipped over into one of the basins—I saw nothing approaching what Inspector Dunlop has spoken of, but I was where the meeting was, and he seems to have been near Northumberland Avenue, where the crowds converged—the fair traders came up later, and there was a good deal of squeezing there—I had no difficulty in circulation about the meeting—I arrived there about 2 o'clock, and was there for an hour—I heard all the speeches except Hyndman's, who was just beginning as I left to hear the fair traders—it was difficult to help hearing Burns speak, he has a voice like a bull; I heard every word of his first speech from the balustrade—I took no notes—he generally expressed utter lack of confidence in the governing classes, and declared that persons could not be trusted to legislate impartially if they were very deeply interested on one side of the question on which they had to legislate—I think it met with very general approval because it was obviously true, and then he went on to speak in a more warning tone, after the fashion of a man in earnest addressing a large mass of more or lees ignorant persons, and as it was his duty to do, because if you see there is great danger coming on the community unless a certain class stands out of the way, you are bound to use warning language to tell them the deluge is coming, as Noah did—he said it was the habit of the comfortable governing classes to turn a deaf ear to the cries and complaints of those oppressed all over the country, and that that was a dangerous thing, and he proceeded to illustrate that by referring to the fashion in which the starving lower classes of France had applied again and again for bread, and been met by jeers and taunts, until the heads of the jeerers were stuck on lamp-posts—that historical illustration was perfectly apposite and to the point; everybody would use it—then he referred to the political class at Westminster, and inquired how justice could be expected from them, and that they wanted charity, not justice—a small knot of believers in Hyndman as the high priest of the Social Democratic Federation called out, "Hang them," to encourage him; and then Mr. Burns said, "Hanging is too good for them, it would spoil the rope;" and then they all laughed, it was such a fantastical joke—it was only said as a relief to feeling—that was the substance of what Burns said—he never used the expression about bread and lead when I was there, and I heard the whole of his speech; it was used by none of the speakers I heard—I left about 3.10—I had heard him before near the Nelson Column—I heard no other speeches from him—I think Champion spoke next, and then Williams—I saw Hyndman get up and I left—the effect of Burns' speech on the crowd was varied according to the composition of the crowd—the believers in social democracy were before me, but those round were smoking and gossiping, and one man said to me, "We don't hold with them <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, they go too far, but I think some good will come out of this agitation;" and that I think was the general feeling round about—I have a distinct impression, after hearing the three speeches, that most if not all of them most strongly impressed on the crowd that they were not to be guilty of any violence whatever—that was the general purport of all the speeches I heard—one of the speakers asked</p>

               <p>all the unemployed to hold up their hands—the red flag wan a twopenny-halfpenny thing, not so good as a guard waves when he sends a train off—I think I heard everything Williams said—they all preached a sermon from the same text, and said pretty generally the same things, but the most striking thing Williams said was his quotation from Shelley—it struck me as rather a good remark, and certainly as nothing out of the way to tell the crowd they were many and the governing classes few—at the end he said the fear of God had ceased to be a power with the governing classes, and I think he specially mentioned Chamberlain, and that now he was President of the Local Government Board it was a chance to see whether he cared anything for the toiling poor; and that as the fear of God was not a power with the governing classes, the time had come to put the fear of man into their hearts—I think he meant that was the only fear they recognised—I certainly did not expect there would be any ri t after the speeches I heard, and none of my staff expected a riot as they came down at 3.30 to get an edition out—I should have been there myself if I had expected a riot—I was in<lb/>credulous when I was afterwards told about the riot.</p>

I took the precaution to go yesterday to Trafalgar Square and step the distance, and I stood sixteen paces from the balustrade and near one of the fountains—Burns was on the balustrade so high that if I had been on the same level I should have been 15 feet in the air—I could move about by a judicious moving of my elbows, I went in and out because I was there to talk to the people, I had no difficulty in circulating among them—I only heard one speaker, Mr. Buns, his voice was like a bull, I mean a roar, and by the time he got to the end of his first speech he had roared himself out—I had no difficulty in hearing him, nobody could make a mistake about it—the next speaker was Champion and then Williams—I went away as soon as Hyndman began to speak and went to the spot where the free trade meeting was, and heard the beginning of a speech, but they talked such nonsense that I went away—I made no notes, but when I went to the office I found that no one had reported it, and therefore I wrote out the same afternoon within a quarter of an hour what I had heard—my notes are published—here is a copy of them—I did not do Burns' speech, one of my reporters did that, I did Champion's and Williams's—you may take it that this is the substance of what Champion said, and then followed Williams—this is what I wrote out the same night from memory this is a correct account, but very much condensed.

               <p>of our proposal for establishing works on farms and factories—I did not bear him say "If we don't get bread they must have lead," and I heard all his speeches—I went with the crowd clown Pall Mall; they stopped opposite the Carlton Club, where the members at the window seemed to be laughing in a derisive and contemptuous manner, joking with one another as to their appearance and condition, which had a very exciting effect on the crowd—I saw something thrown at the windows, but I cannot say what—I want with the crowd to Hyde Park, and after they left the Carlton I harried to the front and passed by the side of Burns, and saw him take stones from the hands of several lads about 17 or 18—he said "Now lads, stop that stone-throwing, we shall be held responsible for it and not you," and just as we reached Hyde Park he noticed a pickpocket trying to carry on his operations, and he caught hold of him and almost strangled him, and Williams came to the front several times and inter<lb/>fered—I heard Burns make a speech at the Achilles statue very much to the same effect as at Trafalgar Square, that they would put the proposals before the Local Government Board next day—he never used the expres<lb/>sion "We have shown them to-day what we can do with stones," nor did I hear him say anything about powder and shot.</p>

               <p>which would discredit the whole thing; none of the other defendants were present at this meeting—this agitation began at oar branch on 17th January, that was the first conception of it, to collect statistics as to the number of the unemployed; I think the Walworth branch commenced a week or two after, and then the Marylebone branch—a great amount of distress existed, and still exists in my trade, more members are out of work than there have been for years past, and having a weekly allowance from the society—Socialism does not mean the division of property among the people, it means the holding of property in a collective sense, a holding by the nation on behalf of the people, and administered by the executive of the nation, that is what it means as far as I know—the division of property in the shop windows is opposed to the interests of the Socialist agitation—you and all the defendants have always advocated keeping from conflict with the armed forces of the country as long as possible—I live in a model lodging house for artizans—you proposed that such dwellings should be constructed by the local authorities.</p>

I live in Trinity Square, south-east of London, and am a wine cooper—I am not a Socialist—on 8th February I attended this meeting in Trafalgar Square; I had nothing to do, so I thought I would go and hear what went on—I was out of employ at the time—I arrived there, I should think, between half-past 2 and a quarter to 3—Mr. Burns was standing on the parapet on the north</p>

               <p>side of the Square when I got there; I got about 30 paces from him—I recollect him denouncing the Government for not opening up relief works and he also denounced the Fair Traders as shams—I didn't hear him say anything about bread and lead, I heard words similar to that used—the speaker that used them was referring to what impressed his memory as words used in the Irish agitation, and how they got what they wanted—I don't know exactly what he said, but I think it was, "If you ask for bread you will get lead"—I know the man who did use those words, it was a gentlemen named Sparling—I don't remember hearing the crowd repeat the words, neither of the prisoners used them—I have come here perfectly unsolicited—I read the account in the papers, and I thought some of the witnesses said things that were not true, and I thought it was not fair to the prisoners; that was mostly why I offered my services—I was in the park.</p>

I am secretary to the Socialist League, and am manager of their organ "The <hi rend="italic">Commonweal"</hi> that is quite a different organisation from the Social Democratic Federation—I attended the meeting on 8th February, and spoke there—I was standing beside Burns; it was some time between 2 and 3 o'clock, but I could not say exactly—I was within two yards of Burns at the very furthest end, till the end of the meeting; when I spoke I was beside him, touching him, almost arm-in-arm with him—the general impression of his speech was that he was trying to impress upon the people the absolute necessity of bringing their case before the Government, in such a way as to get relief works started, and that kind of thing—after Burns there were one or two other brief speeches, and then I spoke—I told the crowd that it was absolutely no use passing resolutions and having demonstrations, unless they really understood what they needed—I said the Irish people did not get what they wanted until they were strong enough to take it if necessary, and then they did take it—I used the old saying, that when you ask for bread you soon get lead—that was a popular adaption of the same saying current in Ireland—I heard Burns speech attentively—he did not use the phrase "bread and lead "in any of his speeches, save in one of them when he said both bread and clothes were scarce and expensive, because of the capitalists' monopoly; I am certain he did not use the word "lead "in one of his speeches, he used the word "bread "many times—"bread and lead "were shouted back by a great many of the crowd in numberless forms; it was taken up as a popular cry, it seemed to take their ear.</p>

I am a carpenter and builder of 44, Chaucer Road, Herne Hill—the deceased Thomas Edwin Bartlett was my son—he was 40 years of age on 8th October last—he was a grocer and provision dealer, and carried on business in partnership with Mr. Baxter—they had six shops, one in Barnsbury Road, Herne Hill; one "The Exchange" in Lordship Lane, Dulwich; "The Group Mart" in Lordship Lane; one at 33, Milk-wood Road, Loughboro'-Junction; and another at the corner of Chaucer</p>

               <p>Road, the "West Hill Park Supply Stores," and the other at 17a, Herne Hill—as far as I could judge he was in a prosperous way of business—the prisoner was his wife; this is the marriage certificate (<hi rend="italic">This certified the marriage of Thomas Edwin Bartlett and Adelaide de la Tremoille at the Parish Church of Croydon on</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1875)—my son was a batchelor when he married—the prisoner is described in the certificate as aged 19 and a spinster, she was about that age—I first knew her just before she was married, she came to my house with my son—I knew she had been staying with one of my sons for a short time at Kingston—the deceased first became acquainted with her there—when she was first introduced to me she was called Blanche—I was not present at the wedding—I know that she afterwards went to a school, Miss Dodd's, at Stoke Newington—she resided there and in the holidays she lived in furnished apartments with her husband—she afterwards went to a convent school in Belgium—my son used to go from time to time to see her—about the middle of 1877 she returned and resided with her husband at 2, Station Road, Herne Hill, that was one of my son's shops—on the death of my wife I went to live with them there, and I resided with them for five or six years—my son offered me a home for life on the death of my wife—all that time they lived there together as man and wife, occuping the same room and the same bed—I remember the birth of a child, I think it was two years after she came to reside there, I can't fix the date nearer than that, it was a still-born child I understood—Annie Walker attended her—Dr. Wooder was called in at last, he resided in Dulwich Road my son told me—I believe the prisoner suffered very much at the birth, she after<lb/>wards got over it and continued to live in the ordinary way with my son—they afterwards went to live at the "Exchange" in Lordship Lane, they were there about a month—I believe they lived in the same way there—I visited them once or twice—I ceased to live with them when they went there, there was no room in the house for me, so I went to live somewhere else—from there they went to live at "The Cottage," Merton Abbey, about two miles from Wimbledon—they were there about a year and nine months—I visited them there frequently and they were living together in the ordinary way as man and wife—they left there on the first of last September and went to Dover for a month, my son taking a season ticket—they returned from Dover the last day of September and I believe then went for a few days to an hotel in the Strand—in October they went to live at 85, Claverton Street, St. George's, I believe they lived there as man and wife for all I know—I believe, up to that period they lived together on affectionate terms, I know nothing to the contrary, and on the usual terms of man and wife—my son always enjoyed very strong health, he was a very hard working man—he had a doctor once, about thirteen years ago, for a slight bilious attack—Dr. Barraclough was called in, he was not laid up at all—I believe he insured his life, indeed I am sure he did—I knew what the policy was worth, I believe the date of it was in 1881—he once rather overworked himself in his business and he went a voyage—he did a little carpenter's work, he laid the floor in the house—he was away some week or a fortnight then—I used to visit at Claverton Street sometimes but I was only invited there once—up to the time of their going to Claverton Street I didn't know anything of the Reverend Mr. Dyson—I had never seen him—it was in the beginning of December last that I first heard of my son's illness—I went and</p>

               <p>saw him, that was about the third day after he was taken ill—he complained to me of mercurial poisoning in his mouth, and then after that I went to see him—he had a bad mouth; he spoke of it in the prisoner's presence—that was on the first occasion of my finding him ill—he said the doctor said that he was suffering under mercurial poisoning—he was then in the front drawing-room, the bed-room was the back room—he was lying on a sort of chair bed, one of those iron couches—he was partially undressed—he appeared to me as if he was labouring under a narcotic, he appeared dazed—he didn't appear so sharp and fresh as he used to be—I called to see him perhaps six or seven times during his illness, I saw him three times—I cannot give the date of my second visit, I know I called on the Wednesday—the third time I saw him was when I was invited—I saw the prisoner twice—I cannot remember the dates, I didn't put it down—it was about eight or nine days I believe after the first visit, I saw her in the downstairs back room, the smoking room, she said he was too ill to see me—something was then said about verdigris poisoning—I don't remember what it was—I understood her that the doctor said there were symptoms of verdigris—she did'nt tell me who the doctor was that was attending him, it was a doctor up the street, I asked particularly who the doctor was but I was not told—during the illness she wrote to me from time to time informing me how he was, this letter (produced) is her writing and the envelope also (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Father, the doctor was very angry that I had permitted Edwin to see visitors last night, as it caused his head to be so bad, and he says no one is to be admitted unless he gives permission, Edwin is slightly better this morning, I will write to you every day and let you see and know how Edwin is.

Postmark, December 24th, 1885."—After that letter I went on the Mon<lb/>day—that was on the Monday before my son's death—I went there at half-past six in the evening—I saw the prisoner there—my son was in the front drawing-room—he was lying on the couch when I first saw him, on the same little iron bed—he was in a dressing-grown—I was with him two hours and a half—the prisoner said he was better, and he said he</p>

               <p>was better—he said "I hope soon to be in business again and enjoy the evenings we have had before"—I used to go and see him every evening, always—I had been in the habit of seeing him at his place of business every evening with very few exceptions, I always called there, because I came down to the station, and then I called in before I went home—he seemed better and a deal stronger—he did not remain on the bed—he got up and walked about the room—I think something was said about his having worms; he said so and the prisoner did too—he said they were crawling all up him, and Mrs. Bartlett said "We call them snakes"—I believe that was the time the conversation took place—I said it was strange and my son said "a good job that she has doctored me to clear away the worms," because she knew he had worms—that was referring to his wife—nothing was said about the medicine he had been taking—there was something said about taking croton oil at one time, but whether that was the time the conversation took place I won't say—at one visit I remem<lb/>ber their saying they had called in a physician, because I wanted to send down a physician from London—I spoke to my son and Mrs. Bartlett as well; no, it was Mrs. Bartlett, not my son—I spoke to her about it some time previous—I said we had better have a physician, as Edwin did not get any better—I said "I will send you one down from London," and she said "No, we cannot afford it"—I said "Nonsense, Adelaide, not afford it indeed"—"Well," she said, "we cannot"—I said "You had better," and she said "We cannot afford it, and he is going on very well"—I said nothing more to her then—on the Monday she told me they had had a physician, she didn't say who it was; she said her husband had had some teeth drawn out, and he said that he had had some stumps out—I left about half-past 8, or it might be nearly 9, on that Monday night, he seemed better then; he spoke about going down to Poole or Bourne-mouth, or somewhere in Devonshire—I think on the following Tuesday, that was the last time I saw him alive—I said "Good night" to him and to his wife just the same as I always have—I parted from her on the best of terms; I always did—I kissed her and shook hands with her, and wished her "Good night" as I had always done—there is a passage in this letter which says "I cannot forget or forgive the past"—there had been an unpleasantness six years ago, my youngest son had to go to America—I next received this telegram informing me of my son's death; I knew he was dying before I received it. (<hi rend="italic">The telegram was:</hi> "Edwin is dead, come at once, Bartlett's. Postmark 1st January, 1886, handed in at 9.36 a.m.") I took it out of my letter box after Mr. Baxter called on me to say he was dead—I went to Claverton Street and got there I think something like half-past 12, but I cannot say, because I was dreadfully cut up at the time—I saw the prisoner in the drawing room where my son was lying dead; I hardly remember what she first said, she said "Edwin is dead"—Mr. Baxter was in the room at the time, he and I went there together—I don't think I saw Mrs. Matthews at that time—I saw my son lying on the couch, I went and kissed him and smelt his mouth; I thought he might have been poisoned with prussic acid, and I smelt it to find out, and I did not detect any smell of that kind—I did not kiss his mouth, I kissed his forehead—Dr. Leach was there, and I said "We must have a post-mortem, this cannot pass"—I believe I was admitted into the room at once when I went there—I don't think I saw anybody but Dr. Leach there; I fancy he came in afterwards, but I can't say, for</p>

               <p>I was dreadfully cut up, seeing my son lying dead in a manner so unex<lb/>pected—Dr. Leach mentioned Dr. Green and Dr. Dudley and himself for the post-mortem; Dr. Leach said there must be one and I said there must be one—Dr. Leach said "I cannot give a certificate without," and I said I must have another doctor; I did not suggest any name—Dr. Leach said "I will get you one," and I said "No, I will get one uncon<lb/>nected with the case or the neighbourhood"—I afterwards went with Dr. Leach and selected Dr. Cheyne, of Marylebone Place, to attend on my behalf—I went up that evening and said to the prisoner "You must have him put in the coffin"—she said "Dr. Leach has to see to that; it has nothing to do with me or you"—when I saw him in the coffin I said to the undertaker he had no business to be in that coffin, the post-mortem would have to be held first—the prisoner was saying what a generous man he was, but she said nothing more about the death—she said "What a kind-hearted man he was, he died with my arms round his feet, he always liked to hare my hand on his feet," and she showed me how she sat at the foot of the bed when he died—she said she was sitting with her arm round his feet, and she supposed she had been asleep, for she was awoke with a cramp in her arm, and she then went and called Mrs. Doggett. (<hi rend="italic">Describing the position of things on the model.</hi>) The post-mortem was on the following day, the 2nd—I went there a little after 2, but I waited outside on the pavement till I saw Dr. Green come out; I then went into the house and saw the prisoner—very little was said; I saw her in the back smoking room, on the ground floor, speaking to Mrs. Matthews—I do not remember any conversation with me—I had not heard the result of the post-mortem then; we went upstairs and heard it, the prisoner was with me—we were summoned upstairs into the front room; Dr. Dudley and Dr. Leach were there—I think Mr. Baxter went up with me—one of the doctors said that they could find no cause of death in him—Dr. Dudley put his hand on my shoulder and said "He has no business lying there, a strong man like that"—at that time the prisoner had her hat on to go out, and her dressing bag was standing on the table—I wished her good-bye and kissed her—some of the doctors said that she could not remain there, and she went away, leaving her bag on the table—she had her cloak on—Mr. Wood, the solicitor, was in the room; I have known him years before, and her husband knew him years ago—some one said that I had better take charge of the room—I said "No, Mr. Wood is a solicitor, he will be the bent man to take charge of it"—I then left—I think I left one or two in the room; I think I left Dr. Leach there.

               <p>wanted to prove it, they can be had even now—I lived with my son and the prisoner somewhere about five or six years—he promised to give me a home for life; but he did not keep that promise because they removed to Lordship Lane, and there was not room for me there—I had from him what money I wanted, he was the kindest of sons—I knew during his lifetime that he had insured his life, I have heard the prisoner and him talk about it—when the will was put before me just now I said to the best of my belief it was not my son's signature—I went to Somerset House with Mr. Hooper, a lawyer of Clifford's Inn, and examined the will, and I have entered a caveat against it—my son was always very strong from a child and never had an illness that I know of—some years ago he had a considerable number of teeth sawn off at the same time, he wanted a false set—I was in the house at the time it was done—I believe it was at Herne Hill they were done, I am not sure; Mr. Bullen, a dentist, did it—they were all stuck together and they could not put others in—to my knowledge no doctor had attended him up to this time in 1879—in 1881 he broke down through overwork, through laying a floor he exerted himself too much, and his doctor recommended a sea voyage, and he went to Balmoral for a holiday—when he returned he went to a physician in London, I don't know who it was—Dr. Barraclough attended him once about twelve years ago for a billious attack and gave him one bottle of medicine—I did not know of my son having excep<lb/>tional ideas on married life, he used to chaff and joke about such things, that was all—I never knew him have any solid ideas about anything different to other people; he said men ought to have two wives, one to take out and one to do the work—he said that when I was living with him—it was the first time I had heard him make the remark, he said it as I heard a man say last night he should like to have forty wives—he mentioned it before his wife, I only heard him make the remark once—he was a very merry man—I did not think it a curious observation, certainly nut, it was only a passing observation; I did not write it down but I have remembered it ever since—my son never to my knowledge had a book on that subject—I never heard of Dr. Nicholl's name till I was in court and I have never seen his book—my son was not a believer in mesmerism to my knowledge—he never spoke to me about it and I never heard from him of his mesmerising anybody else—he was nothing but business, he was wrapped up in his business—I visited them at Merton—I went and saw him at Dover and spent a very happy day there; I did not hear of Mr. Dyson then, nor that my son had offered him a season ticket to Dover; I only heard Mr. Dyson's name mentioned once before the death—I saw my son on the Wednesday, the 9th December, before I heard from Mr. Baxter of my son's illness—he complained of neuralgia in his mouth—in the nineteen days between that and the 28th December I went six or seven times to Claverton Street—I have produced all the letters in my possession, which I received during that time I believe; I tore none up and have no reason to keep any back; there might have been a post card as well—the first day I saw him he appeared suffering from some narcotic, and during the whole of his illness he did not appear as bright as he had formerly been, he did not appear inclined for talking much; the last time I saw him he talked more than he did before, he appeared stronger and better—the first day I went to see him it was in the evening I believe</p>

               <p>—he complained of his head rather then—said he had got headache but made no great comment about it—he said something about having mercurial poisoning; Mrs. Bartlett mentioned it then or on another occasion, it might be they mentioned it together then—I was first examined before the Coroner on 7th January, when all these matters were fresh in my recollection—I said I last saw him on the 28th, and that he said he was getting very much better and would be at business again—I might have said before the Coroner that December 28th was the day upon which the conversation about the mercurial poisoning took place, but it was mentioned before that—I went to see him on Saturday, I won't say I saw him—I could not give the date of every day I saw him, I did not put it down—I think I saw him on Wednesday first—Mrs. Bartlett told me she had called in a doctor up the street, but I did not ask her his name—she seemed reluctant to say much about him—on the Saturday, the second time I saw him, I had a conversation with him—he appeared worse then—I do not know whether I suggested to him or to the prisoners having another doctor; they wore both in the room at the time—he would have heard the conversation; he was half lying down on the iron bedstead with half-closed eyes; he appeared to shut up his eyes and then open them again directly, he appeared to be labouring under something—the matter about the mercury and the verdigris is the only thing I recollect being stated by him when I first saw him, I am not positive, in general conversation you do not recollect every word—I told the Coroner that he said he was suffering from dysentery—I did not mention this before because you did not ask it—I came here not to keep anything back, but to speak the truth—either the prisoner or my son mentioned about dysentery; they were both talking about it in general conversation—I do not remember that dysentery was mentioned when I first saw him—if that letter says "Dear father," I received that shortly after I saw him on the Wednesday; the letters dropped off afterwards to "Dear Mr. Bartlett"—the letters have very likely got into the wrong envelopes—I went to see him on Sunday, and was refused admission to him; I will not undertake to say I did not see him—I received this letter from Mrs. Bartlett, in which she says, "I am expecting another doctor, so you must excuse this note," after I suggested sending a physician—when I saw Mrs. Bartlett afterwards they told me the other doctor had been, but I did not ask her his name, and I do not think she told me—it was Dr. Dudley—I would not undertake to say whether I was not told—the deceased told me he suffered from sleeplessness, and that they were injecting morphia into him for it—he also told me that his teeth were troublesome and painful, and they told me he had had a number of slumps drawn—he did not tell me "he had taken gas; he complained of the pain—previous to his illness he was not subject to low spirits—I once saw him crying; that was not the last time I saw him—when I last saw him he was very much better—he did not tell me how often he had taken morphia injections, but from his conversation I thought he had taken it once before the time he was speaking of then—he said, "I have had morphia injected again"—I do not recollect his telling me that on two successive days he had had morphia injected, and that his condition was so bad that on the third day he had had it injected twice in one day—he told me he was taking sleeping draughts—he also told me he felt worms crawling</p>

I live at 34, Deronda Road, Herne Hill, and was a partner with Mr. Bartlett, the deceased, for thirteen years—I knew him for over twenty years—I never knew him to be laid up ill until his last illness, with the exception of one occasion, when he had been carpen<lb/>tering and went away for the benefit of his health—he did not keep his bed on that occasion at all—I was not at the marriage—they lived at Station Road about five years and at the Exchange about twelve months—I had frequent opportunities of seeing them when they lived over the shop, and the terms on which they lived—as far as I knew they lived as man and wife there—we had six shops at the time of his death and the business was a prosperous one—we had made the business—the Station Road shop had been in existence about three years when I went there, but all the other shops we opened—on 8th December was the last time he was at business; he went home on that clay—on the 10th I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This said that he little hoped to be at business the next day, but that he trusted to be better on Friday, so that he could mix the teas, and that if Mr. Baxter wished to see him he should call.</hi>) I am not certain if I called at Claverton Street that week, but I did the Sunday following—he appeared very ill indeed and was scarcely able to speak—he did not say what was the matter with him—he always mixed the teas with assistance—I did not do it—I and he did the tasting together—I have never found any ill-effects from tasting tea—perhaps I did not taste it to the extent he did—the following Sunday, the 20th, I called; he was better then—he said in Mrs. Bartlett's presence that he felt ill and hoped he would</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This requested him to send with other things, bottles of brandy, of mango chutnee, and of walnuts, and a fruit cake, and added, "I know these things are not fit for Edwin to eat, but he fancies them. You can see Edwin on Wednesday.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't know that Mr. Bartlett had worked particularly hard while staying at Dover—two or three times a week he would come by the boat express so as to get to Herne Hill as early as 6 o'clock in the morning, on the other days he would come by a train between 10 and 11 o'clock—he left business at that time, sometimes by the 4 o'clock and sometimes by the 8 o'clock train—he kept dogs at Herne Hill—on Friday, the 4th, previous to the 8th, he washed some of those dogs which were to be sent to a show—I did not connect that with his illness, for which I knew no cause—on the 8th he complained of feeling ill, and went away—Mrs. Bartlett wrote to me a short note nearly every morning during his illness—they were simply reports of how he was going on—I did not keep them—there was no special reason for my calling on the 13th—on the 13th I found him very ill, much depressed and low; he was scarcely able to speak—I believe they told me the doctor had been more than once a ay—he complained of sleeplessness—I understood that from Mrs. Bart<lb/>lett's notes—I was told on the 20th something to the effect that the doctor was giving him sleeping draughts—on the 27th he was very much better; be told me that he could feel worms wriggling up in his throat—I did not know anything of his ideas about mesmerism or marriage—he was drawing about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from the business—I am not aware that he had any other property.</p>

The bed was lengthwise, longitudinally with the front wall of the room—I presumed they were man and wife when I let the rooms—I had only seen Mr. Bartlett once to speak to him, and had never been in their rooms—I was examined before the Coroner on 4th February; I couldn't say whether I mentioned the fire that day—I was recalled after my wife, and a question was put to me about the tire, and nothing else—when I went into the room I smelt something like chloric ether; that was not the smell I traced to the glass at the end of the mantelpiece—that glass was three-quarters or two-thirds full of a liquid which I took to be brandy, and when I smelt it, it was hardly the same smell which I smelt on going into the room; I think I said before the Coroner that it smelt like paregoric, and before the Magistrate I said that the glass smelt very like the odour which pervaded the room—I took it up and smelt it, and replaced it on the mantelpiece, and it remained there till Dr. Leach came; it was there while he and I were looking about the room, and it was brought down by the servant on the tray in the same condition in the morning, and I saw it by accident, with the bottle sticking out of the liquid, and I took it out with my fingers, looked it up in a cupboard, and afterwards gave it to Ralph—I thought it right that the bottle should be taken care of, but it did not occur to me to do the same with regard to the wine-glass—when Dr. Leach came and looked about the room I saw no bottle on the mantelpiece, and I do not think there was one—the mantel board made the mantelpiece longer—I had been in the room before, but not while Mr. Bartlett was there—the looking-glass being stood on the mantel board, would constitute a shelf, and come a little farther out than the looking-glass—there was a clock in the middle of the mantel board, and there were photographs, and two small vases, one on each side of the clock, and at each end of the mantel board there was a large vase—the only bottle I saw was the one on the tray, which contained some white powder, but there was a wine bottle three parts full of Condy's fluid; that was the only bottle I examined with the doctor; it was on the floor—I think the prisoner said that she felt "cramped" in her hand—she said that her husband had breathed heavily in the evening.</p>

Her breakfast had not gone up when I asked her to have some, she had not arranged for any—I understood her that the money she had before she was married, was in the business, and unless there was a will she could not have her money, because it was under the Married Women's Property Act—she did not come down and have breakfast, I left her with Mrs. Matthews in the front drawing room—I have watched in a sick room at night, and know that the fire is made up for the night and packed, but the bed was so near the fire it would have been too hot for Mr. Bartlett, and the gas is alight—if you break up a fire several hours after it has been packed, it becomes a strong fire—the fire I saw had been attended to, it had not burnt hollow at all—either fresh coal had quite lately been put on, or a well packed fire had been disturbed with the poker, there was a bright light, the coals were quite lighted—Mrs. Bartlett was reading a book, while her husband and I were talking—he had been out that day to have his tooth operated upon about two hours before, he told me it was a sound one, (I heard nothing about his taking gas, I heard from Dr. Leach he had taken nitrous oxyde), he said the worst was over and he thought ho was getting better—at the other operation he had seven taken out one day, and he said they had frozen his gums and he did not feel much pain, and two days before that he had had 13 out—he did not say it was by ether spray: that was all he said—he began saying that it was very wonderful after going through the operation he could eat some of Mrs. Bartlett's hot buttered toast, he smelt it and asked for some, that was on the occasion he had the seven out—he said the result of freezing his gums was that he did not feel any pain—on the</p>

I am servant to Mr. and Mrs. Doggett, of 85, Claverton Street—I remember Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett coming to live here some time in October, I waited upon them—after they came there I saw Mr. Dyson, he came the first week—he used to come about once or twice a week, and about a fortnight or three weeks before Mr. Bartlett's illness three or four times—I have known him to be there as early as 9 or hall-past, sometimes later—at that time Mr. Bartlett had gone to business—he used to go to business about 8 or half past sometimes, and usually came home between 5 and 6 in the evening; sometimes he went out again—Mr. Dyson has been there during the time Mr. Bartlett has been there, and hat stayed sometimes and dined with Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett—the usual time for dinner was between 5 and 6 o'clock—Mr. Dyson had an old coat that he used to put on, it was kept in the back drawing room, also slippers—while Mr. Dyson and Mr. Bartlett have been in the room together I have sometimes gone in—when I have gone in I have seen the window curtains pulled together and pinned—I have seen Mr. Dyson and Mrs. Bartlett sitting on the sofa together, also sitting on the floor together, Mrs. Bartlett having her head on Mr. Dyson's knee—Mr. Dyson was sitting on a low chair—I do not recollect when that was; I cannot say how long it was before Mr. Bartlett's death—I do not know what I went into the room for on that occasion, I went in in the ordinary way as a servant; I did not find the door locked—they did not do anything at all when I went in the room, they did not say anything or get up or move at all, they still sat as they were—I think that was the only occasion that I noticed anything of that kind when I went into the room—when Mr. Dyson came he would sometimes stay and have lunch with Mrs. Bartlett, and leave before Mr. Bartlett came home—the luncheon was between 12 and 1—I do not think I noticed anything else—on the day of Mr. Bartlett's death I took up the dinner—I had seen him from time to time during his illness; he had been out on that day—I took the dinner up at half-past 2 or 3, I am not sure which; it was jugged hare—Mr. Bartlett had his dinner, and afterwards had tea—he had some oysters during that day, he had them at 12 o'clock for luncheon—he had supper, of bread and butter and tea and cake—he had half a dozen oysters for supper—while Mrs. Bartlett was with him, and I was in the room, I never heard him say anything about himself during the day—his appetite appeared to be pretty good—orders were given to me for breakfast next day—with the supper the plates had been used for chutnee both by Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett—Mr. Bartlett gave me the orders for breakfast—he asked me to get him a large haddock; that was when t cleared the things away—there was tea and supper both together—it was</p>

I cannot remember when it was that I saw the curtains pinned together—I cannot say whether it was a week or month or three months before Mr. Bartlett's death—they were long white curtains that came down to the ground—they generally hung close together from top to bottom; that was their usual condition, whether pinned or not—Mr. Bartlett slept on the iron bedstead in the front room from the beginning of his illness, and after that Mrs. Bartlett would sleep on the sofa, or on a chair in the same room—she did not use the bed in the back room—she attended to him, and made beef-tea for him—the head of the iron bedstead was near the fireplace—the piano was mostly at the foot of the bed—the drawing-room had two windows—Mrs. Bartlett moved the piano from the corner of the room, against the foot of the bed, along the side—I don't know when it was moved—there was a book-case between the windows, and Mrs. Bartlett moved that to the other side of the room—there were folding-doors between the two rooms—the sofa was a heavy one, and was against the folding-doors, and kept them closed—Mrs. Bartlett in going from one room to the other would have to go out on the staircase—she often used the washing-basin in the back room quite late before settling herself for the night—I don't remember whether it was used on the night of the death—I don't know what I went up for when I found Mr. Dyson sitting on a chair, and Mrs. Bartlett with her head on his knee—I don't know whether I went to take letters or not—I could not say whether I had been rung for, or not; I believe I was—there were books on the table—Mr. Dyson was sitting in front of the fire near the table—I usually took up a supply of coals in the evening, for the night—on this evening Mrs. Bartlett told me to bring up the coals, and at the same time to bring an empty basin—I think I went out for Mr. Bartlett's breakfast before I took the coals, up—I think I took up the coals and the basin together—I think I took the coals in and left the basin outside; she told me not to take it into the room—I took the coals up first, but not the basin; I went down again for it—when I took in the coals Mr. Bartlett was in bed—it was when I was clearing away the tea that he was walking about—when I took in the coals Mrs. Bartlett told me I might put the basin on the table, and not to come in again—I should pass the basin as I went up to bed—I did put it on the table, and I found it there untouched the next morning—Mrs. Bartlett generally went out in the day for a walk—I don't know whether she had been to the dentist's that day with her husband—she had a walking dress on that evening when they were having supper, a dress that she usually went out for a walk in—when she came to call me at four in the morning she had on a light and looser dress; it was a dress that she used to go out in for a walk sometimes; I am sure of that—I jumped up as quickly as I could when she called me, and went for Dr. Leach and brought him back as quickly as I could—I did not go to bed</p>

Would that I could find words to express my thankfulness to you for the very beautiful loving letter you sent Adelaide to-day; it would have done anyone good to see her overflowing with joy as the read it whilst walking along the street, and afterwards as she read it to me I felt my heart going out to you.

My dear Edwin,—Thank you very much for the brotherly letter you sent me yesterday. I'm sure I respond from my heart to your wish that our friendship may ripen with the lapse of time, and I do so with confidence, for I feel that our friendship is founded on a firm abiding basis, trust and esteem I have from a boy been ever longing for the confidence and trust of others. I have never been so perfectly happy as when in possession of this. It is in this respect, among many others, that you have shown yourself a true friend. You have thanked me, and now I thank you. Yet I ought to confess that I read your warm and generous letter with a kind of half fear, a fear lest you should ever be disappointed in me, and find me a far more prosy, matter-of-fact creature than you expect. Thank you, moreover, for the telegram; it was very considerate to send it. I am looking forward with much pleasure to next week. Thus far I have been able to stave oft my work, and trust to be able to keep it clear. Dear old Dover, it will ever possess a pleasant memory for me in my mind and a warm place in my heart.

I understood that I was to get the ordinary draught bottle—she said that it was volatile, quickly used, and that she would require about that amount—she did not state the size of the bottle, but I understood her to mean the ordinary draught bottle—I cannot recall anything further that she said about it—we returned to the house in about a quarter of an hour—she gave me money to buy the chloroform—I think it was a sovereign, but I will not be sure—I did not say any<lb/>thing to Mr. Bartlett about the intended purchase of chloroform—I first wrote to a medical student about the chloroform, named Theodore Styles, of Poole, and asked him if he would get me some—he lives at Bristol, at the Medical College—I got no answer and I telegraphed to him; I think he had returned to Poole, he was a friend of mine—I did not get it through him—on the Monday, the 28th, I purchased the chloroform—I first went into an oil and colour shop, mistaking it for a chemist's—then I went into Mr. Humble's, at 190, Upper Richmond Road, Putney, between nine and ten o'clock—my chapel was about 50 yards from the shop—I purchased an ounce bottle full, for which I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not sure which—I was asked whether I wanted camphorated chloroform, and I said "No—pure chloroform"—I asked for some chloroform—I did not say any particular quantity—he asked me whether I wanted campho<lb/>rated chloroform, at the same time touching his mouth as if to ask whether I wanted it for teeth—I did not answer that question, but asked another—I asked him whether it was good for taking out grease stains—he told me it was—there was a piece of leather tied over the stopper—it was labelled "Chloroform," and the bottle had the word "Poison" upon it, but I cannot say whether there was a leather tied over the stopper to keep it in, and it was labelled "Chloroform," but I can't say whether "Poison"—I think some bottles had "Poison" on, but I cannot say which—it had the chemist's usual label with his name and address on—the next shop I went to was Penrose's, at Wimbledon, that is the business of Cadman and Co., The Ridgeway, Wimbledon; Mr. Penrose is the manager; that is three miles from Mr. Humble's—I</p>

               <p>had known Mr. Penrose about twelve months before, I should think; he was an occasional hearer at a chapel where I officiated; I knew him well—I asked him for some chloroform for taking out grease stains which I had got down at Poole—I forget whether I asked for the quantity or not; he offered me an ounce bottle first, and then when he had made that up I asked for another one, and I bought the two—I don't remember the price of them—they were probably labelled "Chloroform" and "Poison"; the chemist's usual label with his name and address was on them—I next went to Mr. Bellens, a chemist, of 36, High Street, Wimbledon; I had known him personally for eighteen months, and I knew the other chemist eighteen months; I said twelve before—Mr. Bellens was a member of my congregation; I asked him for some chloroform and gave the same reason; I bought either two ounces or an ounce and half there, I don't know which, it was in one bottle—I don't remember what it was I paid him for it—it was in a bottle like that one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and had some letters sunk into the glass—the last purchase I made was about two in the middle of the day—I then took the four bottles to my house at Putney and poured all the chloroform from them into a white square medicine bottle similar to that one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I had got from my landlady—I don't remember whether I cleaned it out, probably I did—I then took the label with "chloroform" on it off the blue bottle and put it on this bottle—all the chloroform bottles were not blue, three were white ones—Mr. Bellens' bottle was blue and I took the label off that, on which was "Chloroform, Poison"; I won't be sure whether "Poison" was on it, but I think it was—I wetted the label and got it off—the four empty bottles were left at my lodgings—I then took the bottle containing the chloroform on the following Tuesday, between two and three as far as I remember, to Claverton Street, and there saw Mrs. Bartlett, and whilst we were out for a stroll on the Embankment I gave it to her, and asked her if that would do, and she said it would—I also think I told her some of it was methylated; either then or later, it must have been then I should think—she had not told me what sort to get—I gave her the change at some time, but I don't remember when—I then went back with her to Claverton Street and saw Mr. Bartlett, and remained with him until about six or seven, he was up and dressed—he seemed very weak, but seemed brightened by the fact that he had gone out for a drive, and he was still troubled with his sleeplessness—I called again on the Wednes<lb/>day and saw him in bed, he appeared to be the same, I don't recollect any difference—I also saw Mr. Bartlett, and apologised to her for something she was offended at which I had said on the previous day, the Tuesday—I had advised her to get a nurse to assist her, consequent upon her telling me that the friends were saying unkind things about her, that she was not giving him full nursing attention—I don't remember that she mentioned the names of the friends when she said that I told her it would be better in the eyes of the world if she were to have a nurse with her, meaning that that would stop them, and she was offended at that, she said that I suspected or did not trust her; I told her that I did thoroughly trust her, and Mr. Bartlett overheard it—this occurred in the room after the walk—Mr. Bartlett did not hear the whole of it, he heard that exclamation and saw I was distressed with it—he was walking at out the room and he said "Oh yes, you may trust her; if</p>

               <p>you had twelve years, experience of her as I have you would know you could trust her"—and it was in consequence of that I returned on the Wednesday, I was troubled about it—I don't think Mrs. Bartlett was in the room, Mr. Bartlett was in bed alone when I was shown into the front room, and I told him I wished to see Mrs. Bartlett, and I then apologised to her for what had taken place on the previous Tuesday—I saw her downstairs, and repudiated the idea—I told her I was distressed that she should think such a thing—that was between ten and eleven in the morning—I then left the house and did not return again that day—I went on the next day, Thursday, the 31st, in the afternoon, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett; he seemed nervous and was in great pain from his teeth and said he was expecting the doctor, and asked me to call and tell him to come, and I went to Dr. Leach but did not see him, and left a message with the servant—I returned directly to the house and saw the doctor at claverton Street, in the front room; after he was gone, Mrs. Bartlett said that the doctor said necrosis, mortification, of the jaw had set in—I left about half-past 4 to 5 o'clock, that was the last time I saw Mr. Bartlett, he was then up and getting ready to go to the dentist's, if I remember rightly—I did not go to the house on the Friday, but received a letter from Mrs. Bartlett, which I destroyed a few days after I had received it—in it I was addressed as Mr. Dyson, I think, and it said it was her grief to tell me that Mr. Bartlett had died somewhere about 2 o'clock as far as she could judge, and it requested me to call and see him on the Saturday, about the middle of the morning—I believe I was addressed inside the letter as "Dear Mr. Dyson," she used my Christian name in some letters, but I cannot swear to this particular one—I called on Saturday, the 2nd, about 11 or 12 o'clock, I think it was, and saw Mrs. Bartlett in the front room upstairs, Mr. Bartlett had then been moved into the back room—she asked me if I did not consider it was sudden, and I said it was very sudden—she then said "I was sitting; by the bedside reading, and I had my hand or arm round Edwin's foot, "and I think she said she dozed off to sleep, and woke and heard them wishing each other a Happy New Year downstairs, and then she heard her husband breathing heavily, and fell asleep again, and when she woke, through a feeling of pain in her arm, she found Mr. Bartlett turned over, and she expected that the turning over had caused this cramp in the arm; that she gave him brandy and then roused the household—she also said the doctor had ordered a post-mortem, and that it was to be held in the afternoon—I asked her what he had died from, and she said the doctor told her that he thought some small blood-vessel must have broken near the heart or on the heart, I cannot be sure which she said—I remained with her till the post-mortem in the afternoon—I, and she, and Mr. Wood the solicitor, and my executor, were downstairs during the post-mortem, and after it was over we went upstairs to hear the result; Mrs. Bartlett went up with us, and Mr. Bartlett senior was there at the latter part—we all went into the front room, and Dr. Leach communicated the result to us; he said they had conducted a very careful post-mortem examination, and had failed to discover the cause of death, and that the rooms were to be sealed and locked and handed over to the Coroner, and I heard the instructions given to seal the door—I then went between four and five o'clock with Mrs. Bartlett to Mrs. Matthews's, 98, Friern Road, East Dulwich, they are friends of Mrs. Bartlett—on the way there I asked</p>

               <p>her if she had used the chloroform, and she said "I have not used it, I have not had occasion to use it; the bottle lies there just as you gave it me; this is a very critical time with me"—she also told me to put away from my mind the fact that she had possessed this medicine chest, and that I had given her the chloroform, and I must not worry her about it; I cannot remember what answer I made, but I told her that I should see the doctor and ask him about the post-mortem—I went into Mrs. Matthews's house, and Mrs. Bartlett introduced me to her as Mr. Dyson, and then she told Mrs. Matthews of the post-mortem; and she told me to the effect that she had come to stay with her—I do not recollect anything else occurring there—I next saw Mrs. Bartlett on Monday, the 4th, at Mrs. Matthews's, she was alone—I had that day seen Dr. Leach, and he showed me before I went to the house some notes of the post-mortem, and read them to me—I then went direct from Dr. Leach to Mrs. Bartlett, at Mrs. Matthews's, and asked her what she had done with the chloroform, and she was very angry with me and said" Oh, d—the chloroform," and stamped her foot on the ground and rose from her chair—Mrs. Matthews then came in and then retired again, and I had a further conversation with Mrs. Bartlett—when Mrs. Matthews came in she asked her what she was troubled about, but I don't remember her reply—when she had gone I told Mrs. Bartlett I had been to see Dr. Leach, and that either chlorodyne or chloroform, some drops of it, had been found in the stomach of the deceased, Mr. Bartlett—then she asked me to tell her which it was, whether chlorodyne or chloroform, and I told her I was not quite sure, that I confused the two—then I spoke to her about her hus<lb/>band's sickness, of which she had told me, I forget at this time exactly what I said—I asked Mrs. Bartlett again whether she had not told me, or rather I emphasised the fact to her that she had told me her husband was suffering from this internal affliction, and probably then I spoke of the fact that nothing was said about this affliction in the post-mortem, and I asked her if she did not tell me that her husband's life would be a short one—I said "You did tell me that Edwin was going to die shortly"—she said she did not—I said that I was a ruined man—Mrs. Matthews had come into the room at that time—Mrs. Bartlett said I had better leave—I don't think I said anything more—I then left, but before doing so I asked her for a bit of poetry, and she said it was at Claverton Street—it was a piece of poetry I had written about her, and which I had given to her some weeks previously; her husband read it—I saw her again on the same night at Mrs. Matthews's, and spoke to her about the chloroform—I told her I was going to make a clean breast of the affair, that I should tell everything I knew about it; I cannot say if that was on that occasion or whether it was earlier in the day that I said it; when she referred to that fact I said I would do so—I cannot tell you what she said, but the substance of it was, she told me not to say any<lb/>thing about the chloroform—I repeated my intention and said I was very much perplexed and alarmed, and that the best thing I could do in this matter was to tell what I knew of the matter, and of my having bought the chloroform; I do not remember what she said to that—I also returned her a watch which she said had been left to me by her husband; it was his wish that I should have that watch in memory of him when he was gone—she had given it to me on the Saturday before the post-mortem; I cannot tell you the exact words I said when I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050165"/>
               <p>returned it, but the substance was that I should not keep it—I also gave her the money for a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she had asked me to change; I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was her husband's signature—I had received the cheque from her two or three weeks before for expenses which I had been put to when I was with them at Dover; she told me it was Mr. Bartlett's wish that I should not suffer any expenses owing to my con<lb/>nection with them—I cannot remember when I had given her the change for the sovereign to buy the chloroform—up to this time the four bottles were still at my lodgings—I thought you were speaking of Saturday—I had thrown them away on Wandsworth Common on the Sunday morning on my way to church at Tooting—I have pointed out to one of the officers in the case where I threw them—I threw them away as I walked along the path; I had them in my pocket, and I threw them at the side out from the road on to the Common at my left hand—with the exception of the one I took the label off, they would have labels on I presume—I threw them away just as I had taken the stuff out of them—on Tuesday the 5th I went and saw a solicitor, and he gave me some letters for Mrs. Bartlett, which I took to her at Mrs. Matthews's, but I did not see her—I did not leave the letters, I took them to her on Wednesday—they were some sorted letters, two or three dozen I should think, letters of Mr. Bartlett's which I had been sorting with Mr. Wood at his office, addressed from various people—the first time I saw the will it was in Mr. Wood's possession—when I gave her the letters Mrs. Matthews and she were going to Claverton Street; so I fetched a cab for them, and went with them to peckham Rye Station and to Claverton Street—there was sure to have been some conversation, probably about Mr. Bartlett's death, and the chloroform, I really cannot remember—I have a general impression of the different conversations I had with her, and in some cases I can give you the words—I came down to Victoria by train with them, and went to buy some cord for Mrs. Bartlett's boxes, and arranged to meet them at Dr. Leach's, and went there, and they had gone on to Claverton Street—I saw Dr. Leach, and inquired of him for Mrs. Bartlett, and Mrs. Matthews and he told me they had gone on to the house; and as I was leaving he gave me Mrs. Bartlett's keys, and told me that the Coroner had done with the rooms, and requested me to take the keys to her—I went to Claverton Street, and afterwards saw Mrs. Bartlett outside the door, and gave her the keys, and said that the doctor had asked for her, and then went with her and Mrs. Matthews to Dr. Leach—I saw Mrs. Matthews in the ante-room at Dr. Leach's—the inquest was fixed for January 7th, the following day, at Pimlico, near the Buckingham Palace Road—I attended, and Mrs. Bartlett—I was not represented then—I heard the witnesses examined, and then the inquest was adjourned to February 4th—after the inquest I went with Mrs. Bartlett to Mr. Stuart's, a confectioner's, and had some dinner—we were in a private room behind the shop, and were together there about an hour, and we talked together on the whole question—we discussed the recent events, the post-mortem, my having bought the chloroform, and so forth—she told me I was distressing myself unneces<lb/>sarily, and I gave her to understand that I thought I had reasons to be alarmed, and she said if I did not incriminate myself she would not incriminate me, and I told her I was aware of my perilous position, but was</p>

               <p>not afraid to stand by the truth as it affected me, and should persist in my intention of making a full and complete statement—I was aware that the contents of the stomach had been sent to be analysed—on Saturday the 9th I met her accidentally at Mr. Matthews's place of business, and returned with both of them to Mr. Matthews's home—we discussed the subject again—I was anxious to know what really had become of the chloroform—I told her that I was puzzled—she was indignant at me and asked me why I did not charge her outright with having given it to him—I can't tell you in a word what I said, but in effect I said I was not prepared to do such a thing as that—I believe it was on that occasion she told me she had poured the chloroform away and had thrown away the bottle out of the carriage window, as she was returning from London to Peckham Rye, on Wednesday the 6th, that is the station near the Matthews's—I made a communication to Mr. Matthews—after the 9th I saw no more of Mrs. Bartlett—I attended the adjourned inquest on February 4th, I was subpoenaed to attend, I presume I was cautioned by the Coroner; it was adjourned to the 11th—after I gave evidence that day Mrs. Bartlett was arrested, I believe—I was examined again on the 15th and for a third time on the 18th briefly, and then arrested on the charge of wilful murder, and afterwards taken before a Magistrate and com<lb/>mitted for trial—I am twenty-eight years of age now—I have kissed Mrs. Bartlett in her husband's presence—by the rules of the Wesleyan body there is a probation of from six to seven years after entering the ministry, before you can marry—I made a mistake and said that I had two years to wait, I find it is only one, that is to say I could have been married next October or thereabouts—I lived at Thornton Road, Wimbledon, the last three weeks, not in the High Street.</p>

The last day I had conversation with the prisoner was the 9th, she was indignant and asked me why I did not charge her outright with having given chloroform to her husband—it was from her lips that I first heard that suggestion, she was very indignant, I have had no communication with her since—I have kissed her in her husband's presence—there was no secret between us or any secret under<lb/>standing apart from her husband—I took the question to mean in regard to some secret understanding with reference to marriage and I answered it in that regard, as to marriage it was not a secret understanding—there was no impropriety of conduct between me and Mrs. Bartlett; that is to say, I kissed her, that was an impropriety, I don't defend that, it was both in and out of her husband's presence—whatever my relations with her were, they were known to her husband—I addressed him as Edwin and he spoke of her as Adelaide and of me as George—when I wrote the letter which you have, he had placed implicit trust and confidence in me, and he con<lb/>tinued to do so to the very last hour of his life—I say there "I respond from my heart to your wish that our friendship may ripen with the lapse of time;" that was my wish, and down to the last day of his life I endeavoured to reciprocate his friendship and deserve his confidence, and I was solicitous for his welfare—I believe that every day of his illness, his wife and I were both anxious for his welfare, and trying to serve him—down to the time when I was examined on January 11th I believed I could not in any case be allowed to marry until October, 1887; I did not inquire, but I had been told so by someone who I</p>

I understood him that a man should have two wives in that full and complete sense—it struck me as a very remarkable suggestion, I put it down to oddity—he never asked me as a Christian minister if he should be allowed to live in sexual connection with two wives, he simply asked me whether the Bible admits monogamy—he never sug<lb/>gested it for himself—coming from him it did not strike me as unwholesome sort of talk in the family, he was a man who had some strange ideas—he made no secret of them, and recurred to them once or twice, not frequently—I do not think his wife was present—I knew of no secret from her—what he said about two wives was said tentatively to me half playfully the first time, but I have a recollection of his speaking more seriously about it on some later occasion—all through the time I knew him he has put his hand to his side and complained of some convulsive pain—I think I noticed it at Merton Abbey—when he has taken wine I have seen him put his hand to his side in that way—he did not say what it was that affected him—it has happened when his wife was there; at dinner, for instance, and he would get up from his chair, or leave off taking wine and continue his dinner, and it would pass off apparently—he told me at Dover that he was not the man he was once, and he attributed it to overwork—he used to get up at three a.m. and go to business from Dover, by the tidal train, the boat express, and I have known him come back at 10 o'clock—I spent two or three days there twice, and it was between those two visits that I wrote the letter in which I say "I am looking forward with much pleasure to next week"—I was to visit them again the next week—he was more depressed and low-spirited the last month or two that I knew him, but I did not notice it at Dover—all I recollect him saying at Dover with regard to his health was that he was not the strong man he once was—I can swear to the prisoner saying that he was low-spirited, but not to his saying that he could not live long, that is, in his presence—I cannot say that that was said at Dover, but it was said when I first went to Claverton Street—I said that he was a man of strange ideas in connection with the married state, and the terms on which people should live in married life—I do not know of books which he used to read with regard to that matter—I was on the closest terms of intimacy with him as brother to brother—I do not know that blue-covered book by sight ("Esoteric Anthropology; or, the Mysteries</p>

               <p>Mrs. Bartlett telling me that he expressed a hope that I should be a friend to her when he was gone—it was at Claverton Street, when they first went there, and not in his presence—he said that if I had known her as he had, 11 or 12 years, and knew how affectionately she had nursed him, I should not have doubted her—that was in August; no, it was after my return from Dover—he came to hear me preach at Merton, and brought her with him, and it was after the service: I was troubled with indigestion, and he said that he had suffered from dyspepsia some years before, and she had nursed him during the illness—he did not say where they lived, that I remember, or what doctor attended him—he told me at Merton that his wife had one child, which died; he said nothing about it being the only time that she was pregnant—I knew from him that that was the only child she had; I only remember him mentioning it once, and that was not in her presence—I knew from Mrs. Matthews that Annie Walker attended Mrs. Bartlett in her confinement; that was said after Mr. Bartlett's death—Mrs. Bartlett did not say so to me, but she said that Annie Walker attended her husband in his sickness; I am positive about that—I cannot tell you when Annie Walker's name was first mentioned—before they went to Dover, when we were passing Merton Cemetery, Mrs. Bartlett spoke to me about this one child, but Annie Walker's name was not mentioned in reference to it—I think I may absolutely pledge myself to that, but she was very often spoken of, and Dr. Nichols was so often spoken of that I said I was interested in him—I never remember Dr. Nichols being mentioned before Mr. Bart<lb/>lett—I do not think I have stated that I had no secret with Mrs. Bartlett unknown to her husband; I had a secret with her about Dr. Nichols—after they went to Claverton Street I did not tell Mr. Bartlett about Dr. Nichols, because Mrs. Bartlett said he might not like my mentioning it to him, because of his internal affection—Dr. Nichols had never seen him, he advised Mrs. Bartlett when Mr. Bartlett was worse, without seeing him—I knew his address, but I considered it would have been impertinent to suggest to Dr. Leach that he should see Dr. Nicholas as to his previous treatment—Mr. Bartlett had told me he had suffered from dysentery; I knew that before he went to Dover, but I did not know of the internal disease then—no name of disease was mentioned, but only something as to which he was sensitive—Mrs. Bartlett put it that he was sensitive on the question of his sickness—I was with him at the very beginning of his illness—I went with him and his wife to the dog show on 9th December, and he was taken ill in the course of that evening; he seemed very much worn out when he returned—throughout his sickness he was very weary, very much depressed, and suffering from sleepness<lb/>ness and pain, but not before—he varied as to depression—I saw him crying, but only once that I remember—I think that was just before I went home for Christmas, on Monday, the 21st—I saw Dr. Leach in the first week of the illness; I had a conversation with him five or six days after Mr. Bartlett was taken ill—I do not know why Dr. Leach was selected—I cannot remember anything Mr. Bartlett said about being alarmed about himself; he spoke very little, and was very low-spirited—I have the impres<lb/>sion that he thought he should not recover—I did not find him worse when I came back on Saturday, the 26th, but he said he was glad I had returned, and he was afraid his wife was breaking down in nursing him—on the next day, Sunday, the 27th, he told me of me having had worms—I went there</p>

               <p>about 9, or 9.30 p.m., and thought he was better—it was on the Saturday that he was depressed, but it is difficult to tell you, because he con<lb/>tradicted himself—he asked me on Sunday whether any one could be lower than he was without passing away altogether, but he did not seem cast down in spirits, he seemed to be bearing up well against it, but thinking of himself as one actually on the edge between life and death—I did not see the doctor on Saturday, the 26th, or Sunday, the 27th—I called about 3 o'clock on the Saturday, and was there till about 5 or 6 p.m.—I spent the afternoon there—Mr. Bartlett told me on the Sunday that Dr. Leach had stayed with him several hours on the 26th, and he described to me that on that day his condition was such that he had taken two purgative draughts and a dose of croton oil, and also had been galvanised in the abdomen—he did not say he had taken santonine as well—he said they had all been of no use, and that the doctor had given it up in despair, but was going to try again in a day or two—he had been having frequent injections of morphia for his sleeplessness; he told me that even that had not given him sleep, and he has got up and walked about in he night—that was what he spoke of when he said that his wife was likely to break down under the strain of nursing him—it was quite an accident about Mrs. Bartlett and I going out together on the 27th; I came to the door and found her going out to the post, and I went there with her and then returned to the house—I understood from Mrs. Bartlett that Dr. Nichols was an American, and that was the way America was mentioned to me, but it was rather a jumble—I spoke to Mr. Bartlett about mes<lb/>merism at Merton, but I did not believe him to be a believer in it—I do not remember his telling me he did believe in it, he asked me if I did—I don't remember his suggesting to me that he had mesmerised anybody or that I had mesmerised him—I told him a story in connection with mesmerism on this occasion—I believe I introduced the subject—I did not ascertain it was a subject to which he had given attention—I never heard he believed in mesmeric influences—he did not tell me that on the 28th he stood for two hours waving his hand over his sleeping wife; I had never heard that till I heard it in evidence—my income was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett knew that, and that I was no, competent enough to bear the expenses of travelling, and Mr. Bartlett offered me the season ticket to Dover, which I declined, and he afterwards gave me one from Putney to Waterloo—I never did at any time during his life say anything to Mrs. Bartlett to suggest to her that I would marry her immediately n his death, if he should die—the understanding was known to him that at some time or other I and she might come together, but no more than that—the chloroform she spoke of to me was for the purpose of soothing her husband—she told me that in previous sicknesses Mr. Bartlett was violent, and she was in some apprehension of that state of things recurring, and it was by way of giving him sleep that she used it—at the time I got the chloroform, not the faintest idea was in my mind that it could be used for any dangerous or improper purpose—I had seen Mrs. Bartlett with Squires, medical book at Claverton Street—I have no know<lb/>ledge in medical sciences, and I know very little of chloroform; I have never seen it administered, what I know was that chloroform was used for soothing and sleeping purposes, nothing more, and as far as my know<lb/>ledge went I thought that a few drops on a handkerchief might be safely need—I understood that Mrs. Bartlett did not desire the chloroform to be</p>

               <p>specifically mentioned to Mr. Bartlett, but for the affliction for which she wanted—I understood from her the paroxysms arose from that—she never asked me not to mention I had got the chloroform; I think I ought to state in justice to myself, there was a visitor there, and I could not give it to her in his presence—I cannot say if the visitor had not been there that should have given it to her in Mr. Bartlett's presence, I might or might not, she had not asked me to keep it secret—it was on the very day on which I gave her the chloroform that there was this misunderstanding between us; I suggested that she might as well have a nurse, and I knew at that time from what I heard from Mr. Bartlett that for more than a fortnight she had never had a proper night's rest; he had spoken of the probability of her breaking down, and I could see my self from her appearance and manner that she was tired and strained with the work—besides that she had told me about the friends complaining that he was not properly nursed, and taking those two thing, together I suggested that she should obtain a nurse, and she was angry at the suggestion—I also said I did not trust her, or something of that kind, but at that time not the smallest distrust of Mrs. Bartlett was in my mind—every time I had been there during Mr. Bartlett's illness I had seen her giving diligent and affectionate attention to his wants—I cannot remember that he ever suggested that a nurse would have given him better attention and cure; he never suggested one being fetched—when he heard me apologizing to Mrs. Bartlett he said "You can trust her; if you had had 12 years of experience you would have known you can trust her," and the impression that that left on my mind was that he was not only satisfied with her, but praised and desired her to continue that attention which she was giving him—from September when this understanding was set up between us Mr. Bartlett was in the habit of calling me George, and when we three were together I was spoken of as George; I called her Adelaide in his presence—at the time she told me to put away from my mind the fact that she possessed a medicine chest—I was in possession of the bottles which I had bought, and I threw them away as I went to church on the Sunday morning—I did not tell her on the Monday that I had done so, I could not say at this time why, probably because it never occurred to me to tell her—at that time I was in great anxiety and distress about my position, I was afried the effect of my having bought the chloroform might get me into trouble, so I thought I had better get rid of the bottles—I threw them away because it was the horror that seized me when I thought what get me in to trouble, so I thought I had better get rid of the bottles—I threw them away because it was the horror that seized me when I thought what might have happened—when I said I was a ruined man, it was because of the thought of what might happen to myself, I was going to say the though was in my mind at the time, possibly it was the chloroform I had bought had been the cause of Mr. Bartlett's death—it would be difficult to say when that thought first came, I think on Saturday night it grew on me—the piece of poetry was torn up when I got it—I cannot swear whether I got it on the Saturday or the Wednesday; whatever was spoken of this paper was spoken in Mrs. Matthews's presence—Mrs. Bartlett was not the only person who had advised me not to say anything about the chloroform, Mrs. Mathews had—understand me, nothing about the chloroform, not altogether, nothing about it imediately, she recommended me to await the result of the analysis, and I took her advice and did not.</p>

               <p>I was walking with him between his house and Peckham Rye station—I told him briefly the facts of the case and I said that I had my fears and that my idea was to give the facts—my fears were as to what had become of it—what use had been made of it, or rather as to what its effects had been—and it was then that Mr. Matthews advised me to wait; and really to wait my being called by the Coroner and give my evidence in due order—I had previously mentioned the chloroform to Mrs. Matthews on Wednesday as we were waiting in the ante-room at Dr. Leach's, but not to any one else—I had mentioned it to the Wesleyan minister at Poole, before I was called by the Coroner on the 11th, I had been down there, and I had also mentioned it to another minister of my own body; and I mentioned the chloroform to the Coroner on the first oppor<lb/>tunity I had—Mr. Bartlett did not describe the particular way in which my preaching had affected Mrs. Bartlett, but thought it had benefited her.</p>

I went to three different shops to get the chloroform, because I could not get as much as I wanted at one shop—I did not say at the first shop "you have given me a little bottle, I want four or five times the quantity," because I thought he would want to know what I wanted it for, and I did not wish to enter into a long explanation because I thought he would not understand that Mrs. Bartlett was skilled in the use of medicines—I said it was for taking grease spots out of cloths, because he asked me what I wanted it for—I knew that chloroform was used by amateurs, I heard of its being used for the gums, toothache for instance, and I understood it would be sold to doctors or at least to people who understood the use of it, for the other purposes for which it was wanted—I thought it was used very quickly in the way Mrs. Bartlett mentioned—I knew it was volatile, I had an idea that a very few applications would exhaust the amount—I thought the whole hand<lb/>kerchief would be well moistened in it—I had never heard how it was done and knew nothing of how it was done—when I took the chloroform to Mrs. Bartlett a Mr. Hackett was visiting there; and I left him there with Mr. Bartlett.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. George Frederick Matthews, living at No. 90, Friern Road, East Dulwich—I have known the prisoner for some years, intimately about three and a half years, and altogether something like five years—I knew her late husband also—when I first knew them they were living at Herne Hill, and afterwards at Lordship Lane, East Dulwich—I was in the habit of going to visit them at Lordship Lane—they afterwards went to Morton cottage, and I continued to visit them there—on one occasion my husband and I stayed a week in their house in July, 1885—they were then living together on very affectionate terms, so far as I could see, apparently as man and wife—Mr. Bartlett suffered from neuralgia when he was at the Exchange about three years ago—I do not know how long he suffered; it may have been a day or two, of a longer time; he did not lay up—at other times his health was very good—I did not see them at all in Claverton Street until Mr. Bartlett's death—on the morning of the let of January I got a telegram from Mrs. Bartlett, and I went to their house about 12 o'clock—I went upstairs with Mrs. Bartlett to the room where the body was, and she gave me an account of how the death had taken place—it was in the front room—the told me that the night previously her husband was in bed, and she sat with her arm round his feet; that she was awakened by feeling a cramp in her arm; that she did not get to sleep till after 12 o'clock; it could not have been till after 12 o'clock, because she heard the people downstairs wishing each other a happy new year; that when she was awakened by feeling the cramp in her arm she found Edwin lying on his face, and she turned him over and tried to give him brandy—she did not say whether he swallowed any of the brandy—she then roused the house and sent for the doctor—I asked her what he died from—she replied that she did not know, and that there must be a post-mortem—I do not remember anything else that either of us said about the death at that time—that was about 12 o'clock; I stayed with her all the day—we went out together in the afternoon to get some mourning, and then returned to the house with her and stayed there till about nine o'clock at night—the next day, Saturday, the 2nd of January, Mrs. Bartlett and Mr. Dyson came together to my house at Dulwich, after tea—I had never seen Mr. Dyson before—she introduced him to me on that occasion—I had heard of him before, but I cannot remember who from—in all probability it would have been in connection with the Bartletts, but I cannot say for certain—Mrs. Bartlett told me why they had come</p>

               <p>to my house—she said the doctors were not agreed with regard to the cause of death, and that the rooms were to be sealed; and so she had come to me—she remained at my house—I do not remember anything of importance happening the next day, Sunday—Mr. Dyson did not come that day, but he came on Monday, the 4th—Mrs. Bartlett was out at the time of his arrival; it was after lunch—I do not know what o'clock it was—he stayed till she came in, and I left them alone for a few minutes—as I went back to where they were—I heard a noise in the room like someone stamping—I went in and saw Mrs. Bartlett stamping round the room—I asked what was the matter, and she did not answer for some minutes; then she said Mr. Dyson was bothering her about a piece of paper—I went out again for a few minutes, and then returned, and as I was entering the room I heard Mr. Dyson say "You did tell me that Edwin was going to die soon"—she replied "No, I did not"—then Mr. Dyson bowed his head on the piano and said "Oh! my God!"—after a bit I asked him whether he had not better go, and nothing more was said—he then went away, and as he went out said, "I am a ruined man"—I did not ask Mrs. Bartlett what he meant by that; I asked her what the paper was, and she said it was a piece of poetry—on Wednesday, the 6th, Mr. Dyson again came to my house, and he, Mrs. Bartlett and myself, went together to London—Mrs. Bartlett and I were going to London when he came, and he went with us—we left him at Victoria Station, and then went to Dr. Leach's—we found him not at home, and went on to Claverton Street—Mr. Dyson came there in the afternoon—we all three went to Dr. Leach's about three o'clock, and Mrs. Bartlett went in to Dr. Leach alone, into one room, whilst Mr. Dyson and I remained in another room—we were left alone together for over an hour, and during that hour Mr. Dyson and I had a conversation—on the Saturday in that week, the 9th, Mr. Dyson came to my house—Mrs. Bartlett had gone to town, and went to my husband's place of business to bring him home—Mr. Dyson went there also to see my husband, and they all came down together—I cannot say that Mrs. Bartlett told me what she had been seeing Dr. Leach about, but I understood she was to go and see the results of the post-mortem—there was a conversation about chloroform on Saturday, the 9th, at my house, in the evening—Mr. Dyson was in a great state, because he said he would be ruined, and he should have to leave his ministry, and so on—Mrs. Bartlett and my husband were there—I cannot remember all that was said—I know Mr. Dyson said "Sup<lb/>posing it should be proved"—and he hesitated and did not finish, and Mrs. Bartlett said "Do not mince matters; say I gave him chloroform, if you want to"—she said it very indignantly—Mr. Dyson made out that he would be ruined because of his position in the ministry—he said "Supposing it is proved that I bought"—or "Supposing it is proved that you gave him the chloroform and I bought it, or something like those words—on the Saturday or Monday I questioned Mrs. Bartlett with reference to what Mr. Dyson had told me whilst I had been waiting with him alone in Dr. Leach's surgery, and I asked her why she had told him all those lies—I did not tell her what Mr. Dyson had said to me, but I knew that she knew what he had told me—she replied that he had bothered her so, that he would not believe her when she told him the truth—she told me on one occasion that she had had chloroform to soothe Edwin, but that she had never used it—I cannot say she told me</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dental surgeon at 49, Charles Street, Pimlico—I was called to see Mr. Bartlett on 16th December; I went to 85, Claverton Street—I first saw Mrs. Bartlett on the landing outside the door—I asked her if her husband was in the habit of taking mercury in any form—I think she said "I don't know"—I saw the deceased and examined his mouth—I should say he was suffering from mercurial poisoning—his teeth were loose—I extracted the two upper central roots that day—I went and saw him again on the 17th with Dr. Leach, and I extracted about 11 more roots—I visited him again on the 21st, and extracted four lower incisors—I used a solution of cocaine on the gums—that is a new drug lately used; I can't say whether it is a mineral or vegetable drug—I painted his gums with it before the opera<lb/>tion, to produce local anaesthesia, to dull the sense of pain, to make the operation more easy—I saw him again on the 26th—I should say the signs of mercurial poisoning were then lessened—I saw him again on the 81st December, he and Dr. Leach came to my house, and I extracted a tooth then, that was between 5 and 6 o'clock—Dr. Leach administered nitrous oxide gas; he was under its influence about half a minute, I should think—that was the last time I saw him—I should say his condition was much better—I noticed the condition of the gum in the region of the lower incisors; the gum had separated and raised from the central ridge of the alveolus—that is the process of boning in which the teeth are inserted—I said to Dr. Leach "I think this looks very much like necrosis setting in"—necrosis is death of the bone—it had extended between the two lower caries about an inch and a quarter, it had gone into the whole of the socket of each of the four teeth that I had extracted</p>

On the last day he inhaled more of the nitrous oxide gas than patients would ordinarily do—we only applied it once, it took three or four minutes I should think before it went off—I did not take the time—as a rule two minutes is quite sufficient—I noticed a fungoid growth round the necks of the teeth—there were very few teeth remaining, there were only two stumps and teeth on each side—each stump did not represent a tooth; the upper molars have three Stumps, the lower molars have two—I extracted 11 teeth and stumps on my second visit, but I cannot say how many teeth or how many stumps—there were more than two left on each side, I can't say exactly how many; I know one was left on the lower left side, and one canine on the lower right—I can't say how many were left in the upper jaw—I believe the lower teeth at the back of the jaw had all gone—I did not notice his breath at the last visit, it was extremely foul at the first and second—I noticed the fungoid growth at each visit; it was not found in the hollow spots where the teeth had previously been, it was around the necks of the teeth that still remained, on the margin of the gum, it was principally tartar I should say—it was before the last operation was performed that I said to Dr. Leach that I thought necrosis was setting in—that was said in Mr. Bartlett's presence—necrosis goes on, that is the dead part of the bone separates entirely from the healthy part, and then you can take it away; now much of the structure of the bone may be involved in that, depends on the condition of the person, the circumstances of his life, and so on; it might go on in a way which might practically cause the destruc<lb/>tion of the jawbone, which would be a very terrible thing to contemplate.</p>

               <p>heard the medical men say anything about the brain before what I have said to-day—I don't remember I said anything before the Coroner about it—I have a very clear recollection of what I conceive to be the all<lb/>important facts of the case; of course I mean as to post-mortem appear<lb/>ances—the notion that there was chloroform in the system did impress me—I should not to my knowledge have expected to find something wrong in the brain in a case of poisoning by liquid chloroform—I believe the blood in chloroform poisoning is more or less altered, and does not coagulate properly, and stains the tissues, but I have no knowledge—I don't think I have spoken to Mr. Leach since the post-mortem—oh, yes, I did, when he asked me to come to the Coroner's inquiry—we certainly had no medical discussion. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first got a notion of chloroform as soon as we opened the stomach, after the thorax had been examined—before smelling the stomach no person had suggested to me there was chloroform—the notion came to me immediately I opened the stomach—there was no perforation of the stomach; in this case the ulceration was only superficial—the ulceration and the appearances surrounding the ulcerated parts were in my opinion due to the recent action of an irritant poison—chloroform is a very volatile liquid; it acts as a local irritant—it is used externally as a local irritant—I should not like to express any opinion as to whether any of the signs of inflammation of the stomach might have been due to an inflammation of the mucous membrane antecedent in causation to that caused by an irritant—what I mean to say is, that the signs of inflammation at the cardiac end of the stomach were to my mind so characteristic of the action of a local irritant that the slighter degrees of inflammation in other parts of the stomach might have been or not due to the irritant—I cannot distinguish, in the pyloric part, between inflammation due to the irritant and any irritation due to any preceding gastric disturbance—the inflammation was recent, certainly—the inflammation at the cardiac end was certainly recent. <hi rend="italic">By</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the Society of Apothecaries, and a Licentiate in Midwifery, and practise at 41, Charlwood Street, Pimlico—that is less than a quarter of a mile from Claverton Street—on 10th December last I was called in to attend the deceased; the prisoner called on me; I had not known them before—I was called in the morning between 9 and 10; I arrived at 85, Claverton Street, about 11—the deceased was sitting on the sofa in the drawing room in his dressing gown—I found he was suffering from diarrhoea, some pain in the left side, foetid breath, and from signs of indigestion, sub-acute gastritis one might call it, but of course it was masked by mercurialism—I will call it mercurialism or gastritis, they are convertible terms—it was the effects of a dose of mercury or of an ordinary dose of mercury by a person with an idiosyncrasy for that drug—he had taken too much blue pill or something containing mercury—it</p>

               <p>does not mean that he had taken mercury chronically; it means that for him he had taken too large a dose of mercury, to my mind—I cannot tell you what I prescribed for him, the character of the treatment was a curative one, it included chlorate of potash and bismuth—there are many treatments for such diseases—I have not got a copy of my prescriptions, I gave them to the Treasury, I think—the first prescription is bismuth, ammonia, and tincture of nux vomica; that may be correctly described as a stomach mixture, I can describe it in no other way—I see there is bismuth for the stomach, and nux vomica, and also sicona as a tonic—on the same day I also prescribed a lotion as a mouth wash; that was with reference to the state of the jaw; it was chlorate of potash, and lemon syrup to flavour it—I attended on the next day, the 11th, and directed that the bismuth should be suspended by a dilution of bicarbo<lb/>nate of soda and a mild sedative of bromide of ammonia, and also nux vomica and flavouring matter, and a compound tincture of chloroform at the end—that would contain two drops of pure chloroform; 40 minims of compound tincture would be two drops—that entire prescription would be described as a stomach and sedative prescription—I also gave him an opium pill, to procure sleep at night—on the 14th I repeated the mouth wash of chlorate of potash—I prescribed a tonic of gentian and nux vomica on the 15th—on the 18th I gave him a fairly strong purgative of Epsom salts (which was not taken), and a second prescription of bromide and bismuth, with half a drachm of chloral hydrate to two ounces of the mixture, about 15 grains a dose, to be taken at bedtime, a small quantity—on the 19th that was repeated, with morphia in it, and it was acid instead of alkaline, as his condition had improved—on the 20th the chloral hydrate was increased to 20 grains, the morphia and bromide and the rest of the prescription remaining unaltered—on the 22nd there was another mouth wash—on the 24th there was a mixture having no thera<lb/>peutic action, a <hi rend="italic">placebo</hi>, as he would not sleep, and I had tried fairly strong narcotics—I gave him this prescription for the imagination, telling him he was bound to sleep after taking it—on the 25th I prescribed a tonic, calculated to act as a slight stimulant to the digestive organs and to the nerves; it contained phosphate of strychnine—on the 26th began the vermifuges, the worm medicines, consisting of santonine made up with a little confection of senna, to be followed by a draught of sulphate of soda and Liebig's Extract—then on that day there was a strong purga<lb/>tive, which failed to act, and then at my suggestion he swallowed the draught I had prescribed for him on the 18th—he likewise had adminis<lb/>tered to him by himself for aperient purposes two small globules con<lb/>taining croton oil, each a fairly good dose—they were ineffectual, and I was afraid to give him any more—on the 28th the mouth wash was repeated, and an emulsified preparation of iodiform with bismuth, for the fungoid state of his jaw, was given him; that was a wash—this treat<lb/>ment was addressed to the soothing of the stomach, a sedative and aperient, an innocent and ordinary treatment, I hope—I found that treatment successful, and his health improved—some days after I was called in I sent Mr. Roberts, dental surgeon, to him—he only had nitrous oxide on 31st December, on previous occasions cocaine was relied on—the last prescription I gave him was that of the 28th—he was taking that of the 25th up to the time he died; I did not think it necessary to order anything but a repetition of that of the 25th—I last saw him alive about</p>

               <p>6 o'clock on 31st December, in front of Mr. Roberta's door, 49, Charlwood Street, he had just had a tooth out—previous to having the tooth out he seemed, I think I may say, better than I had ever seen him; I cannot say his spirits were better, but they were not bad—I chiefly formed the impression that he was better because he acknowledged it, a thing he was very loth to do; he said he felt he was better—his spirits were good, but on the 25th, the day before the worms, I had seen him in exceptionally good spirits—I had frequently threatened to dis<lb/>continue my attendance, and on the 30th I carried my threats into execution because the man had made up his mind to have continued medical attendance, and I was not inclined to continue—if the patient had needed it I would have attended to any amount—I did not think he continued to need it daily; to have seen him twice a week would have been enough—on the morning of 1st January, about four, Mr. Doggett's housemaid came for me—I went about half an hour later—I talked some time with the messenger to ask whether it was merely one of his notions or whether he was really ill—I asked what restoratives I could bring if he was really bad—she could only say "I know nothing about it; Mrs. Bartlett only told me he was dead"—I got alarmed, and we jumped into a Hansom's and went—when I went into the room I found Mr. Bartlett was dead—that was about 4.30 a.m.—I have here a few notes written at the moment—when I got there at 4.30 Mrs. Bartlett and Mr. Doggett were in the drawing room—I am not certain if Mrs. Doggett was there—the deceased was lying in his usual place on a camp-bedstead where I had always seen him, near the window—I made a formal exam<lb/>ination of the body to see whether he was dead, but I saw he was directly I entered the door—I made a complete examination a few minutes later—he had on a night dress and an undervest—he was lying on his back with his arms across the abdomen, the legs a little bent, the fingers naturally closed, the surface very pallid and very cold, the eyelids nearly closed, the pupils for him very much dilated, natural for death, the mouth partly open, the tongue very white—I estimated the tempera<lb/>ture of the body and roughly that of the room; and I tried, as accurately as I could, to estimate how long he had been dead, and I calculated he had been dead from two to three hours—after thinking it over a day or two I thought it possible he might have been dead longer, but I think now, after very careful consideration, three hours is as nearly accurate as I can give—at the time I expressed to Mr. Doggett the conclusion I had come to as to the length of time he had been dead, I am not sure if the prisoner was there—I found the chest smelt of brandy, I think it was moist, I am not sure of that—the mouth had no odour whatever, I smelt that first—the brandy was on the skin of the chest itself I am sure—I am not sure whether there was any moisture on the vest or night dress—the smell of brandy was slight; that was the only smell on the body—in the room there was that naturally close odour of a sleeping room, the odour of supper and condiments and brandy and gas—the face was pale with a natural expression; the fingers of the hands and the legs were slightly flexed—there was no appearance of any convulsive action or paroxsyms, I looked for that and saw nothing of the kind; and I looked for froth on the lips but saw none—the eyelids were nearly closed, and as the pupils were turned somewhat upwards I could not examine the pupils without drawing up the lids—I lifted the eyelids of both eyes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050186"/>
               <p>in order to see the pupils at all—the pupils were in the direction of the wall behind him; if he had been standing up the line of vision would have been distinctly above the horizontal—I can form no opinion as to whether his eyelids were in the state in which he died, or whether any<lb/>thing had been done to them—you can close them at any time before cadaveric rigidity sets in; that may happen at from a few minutes to six or eight hours, the time depending on the cause of death, the state of the body before death, and surrounding circumstances to some small extent; very slightly on the temperature of the room—I believe there is a differ<lb/>ence in bodies immersed in water—I only speak from my reading on the subject—there was no table near the bed, the table was in the middle of the room away from the bed—the head of the bed was towards the wall on which the mantelpiece was—the fireplace projected from a part of the wall which projected also, leaving a kind of shallow alcove, and the head of the bed was in that alcove as near the mantelpiece as the alcove would allow it to be—the bed in this model is made too narrow in proportion—on the mantelpiece I observed a looking glass, a clock, some vases and a small bottle of chlorodyne, that was all—the bottle of chlorodyne was either on the mantelpiece or on a small stand on the other side of the room away from the bed—it was about an ounce bottle, about half the size of the blue chloroform bottle—on the table there was the remains of supper and some brandy, and a bottle containing some white stuff, carbonate of soda I think, nothing else of importance—there was some brandy in the bottle, I don't know how much—I feel sure I examined it, I am satisfied it contained brandy—I uncorked and smelt it, it was partly full—there was also a wineglass with some brandy in it on the table, I smelt it carefully—I don't remember if there was a "Whatnot" at the end of the room facing the mantelpiece—I looked round the room for any<lb/>thing of importance that would throw light on the subject, I should call bottles things of importance—I remember nothing else than what I have stated—there was a lock-up place in the room next to the fire-place, I examined that with Mr. Doggett; if it was locked the key Was there, there was nothing locked from us, we had not to ask for the key, there were no bottles in it, nothing but what was of an ordinary nature—I smelt all the glasses in the room; brandy and the smell of supper and so forth were all the things noticeable by me—the bedroom opens off the drawing-room by folding doors, I don't think I entered it—I saw a tumbler of Condy's fluid either on the corner of the mantelpiece or on the floor just below it, another bottle was standing in it—the bottle of chlorodyne was labelled chlorodyne, there was very little in it—I searched carefully to see if there was anything suspicious in the room, for there had been nothing in the previous conduct of the deceased, or in my observations of him, to suggest to me the probability of death from natural causes—I asked Mrs. Bartlett to give me any explanation or any assistance in elucidating the mystery—she said she was unable to—we then discussed several things, and then I spoke to her in a low voice that Mr. Doggett might take the hint to leave the room, and when he was gone I thought perhaps some matters of delicacy, which she did not like to mention before him, might come out, but she was unable to give me any explanation, and then it was, I think, we discussed the subject of chlorodyne—while Mr. Doggett was there I said "I cannot give a certificate, there must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050187"/>
               <p>be a post-mortem"—Mrs. Bartlett replied, I think, "Must there be an inquest?"—I said "There must be a post-mortem"—a little later on I said "Really, this is a case that I ought to report to the Coroner, but I have no suspicion of foul play; I will have a post-mortem made and then, if the pathological cause of death is found, a certificate will be given in due course; I will not make the post-mortem myself, I will have a pathologist"—Mrs. Bartlett said "What is he dead of?"—I replied "I do not know, I find no cause of death, it is possibly due to the rupture of some small vessel, some aneurism, something that may have been possibly overlooked in my examination, I can hardly think that the death was from syncope"—the post-mortem examination would tell whether death had been from aneurism or the rupture of a blood vessel, that is why I said a pathologist and not a medical jurist—I sug<lb/>gested Dr. Green, who did assist at the post-mortem; he is a noted pathologist and a man of eminence in his profession, he is physician of the Charing Cross Hospital and at Brompton—when I was attending the deceased, Dr. Dalby attended him on the 19th or 20th—on the occa<lb/>sion of one of my visits after talking with the patient and saying he was doing well and so and so, some conversation ensued which I think was a reference to his business, about his partner wanting him back, and Mrs. Bartlett broke in with something flattering to myself and then said "Mr. Bartlett is very contented with his treatment, but his friends have on more than one occasion requested him to let them send him a physician of their own choosing," she added "Mr. Bartlett's friends are no friends to me"—Mr. Bartlett then said "We intend in future, Doctor, to manage our own affairs and not to be interfered with by my friends and relations, I am sorry to say they are not kind to my wife"—I said "By all means have a consultation, as many as you like"—he said "No, I will not have a consultation in the ordinary sense of the term, I will not see any one they send, I will see any gentleman you choose to bring to see me once; I am "getting better than I was, I will not submit to any other treatment, but I will see some gentleman once, I do this for the protection of my wife"—either before or after that she had said, "Doctor, Mr. Bartlett's friends will accuse me of poisoning him if he does not get out soon, if he gets worse, if he does not get better"—the conversation was a general one—I have tried to pick out who said the different things—it made little effect on me; I thought it referred to the mercurialism—I called in Dr. Dalby, who saw him once, and approved of my treatment—he prescribed a fresh tonic, and a combination of the drugs that hitherto I had given him separately—I asked Mrs. Bartlett whether any time elapsed between finding her husband dead and calling her servant and Mrs. Doggett—she said that as soon as she found she could not rouse him she ran up for the servant and sent her to me—she told me she was sitting beside her husband's feet in the easy-chair, which she usually, in fact where she always slept; she had her left arm round his feet—she said she woke and heard him snoring, but that it was a peculiar kind of snore; still, as it was not unusual with him to snore, she dropped asleep again—she evidently tried to describe to me the stertorous breathing—that later on she woke up with a cramp in her arm, and saw him lying on his face in an uncomfortable position—she described that her arm was round and resting on his feet—I concluded she meant outside the bedclothes—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050188"/>
               <p>that she rose from her chair and went towards his head to turn him into a better position—that she was alarmed at his condition and tried to rouse him; she found him cold; she applied brandy—I don't know whether she said she poured any down his throat; I understood she rubbed some on his chest (probably that was my inference), and went up to the servant's room and sent her for me—that the servant went into the kitchen, and Mrs. Bartlett chafed at the delay, and she called Mr. Doggett—I do not think she explained how she was able to turn him round—I did not understand that the whole body was turned round, but that his shoulders and head were twisted round, and the latter buried in the pillow—on that same day we discussed all the poisons I could think of that were rapid in their action—I asked her was it possible that he could have any digitalis or any of the alkaloids in his possession, I knew he was friendly with some wholesale chemists, and she said, "No, he could have had no poison without my knowing it, he could have got no poison without my knowledge"—I asked her, "What is that chlorodyne doing here?" for I had never seen it before—"Oh," she said, "Edwin used to rinse his mouth with it at night"—I said, "Rinse his mouth! then he must have swallowed some"—she said, "No, he only rubbed his gums"—I said, "Did he not go into the bedroom at all?"—she said, "No"—I said, "If he rinsed out his mouth and spat out the chlorodyne we must find some of it in the room"—I looked under the bed into the most natural receptacle—she said, "No, I think not, he never put much into his mouth, he only rubbed his gums"—chlorodyne smells strongly, I did not perceive any smell of it—the smell of chlorodyne that has stood for some time is extremely like that of pure chloroform—it contains 1 in 8 of pure chloroform—it would depend how much he swallowed for it to cause death—drugs had a peculiar action on the man—as little as a drachm of chlorodyne has killed—I thought it might possibly be so in this case—I have quite given up that idea now, because of the result of the analysis proving the absence of the other ingredients of chlorodyne, prussic acid, and the more stable alkaloids—I am sure it was not death from chlorodyne—on that morning of 1st January I was not aware that Mrs. Bartlett was in possession of chloroform—I knew nothing of it till 26 days afterwards—it then came upon me as a surprise—on the same occasion Mrs. Bartlett asked could he have died of chloroform—I cannot fix the date of the conversation—I don't know if anything was said about chloroform on the 1st of January; I think not; but there was nothing to make the mention of chloroform more remarkable to me than digitalis—the post-mortem examination was on the 2nd January—Dr. Green was the principal—Dr. Dudley was there as a looker on—Dr. Murray and Dr. Green were also there, and I took these notes—they were as accurately taken as I could do them. (<hi rend="italic">The notes of the post-mortem examination were here read.</hi>) Atheroma is the definition of one of the coats of the blood vessels; aorta is one of the large blood vessels; oesophagus is the stomach, and epithelium is its scaly lining—the hyperdenia is the end of the stomach nearest the spleen—the dura mater comes between the skull and the other membranes of the brain—that examination discloses a healthy state of all the vital organs—there is a reference here to something abnormal in the condition of the stomach—from these notes I gather that the only abnormal condition, except</p>

               <p>that of the stomach, are fluidity of the blood, with dissolving out of the colouring matter staining the tissues, and what I should scarcely, perhaps, allude to, a certain amount of adhesion present in the dura mater—excluding the stomach and blood, there was nothing suggestive of the cause of death—the blood was acted on through the contents of the stomach—the intestines were put into a bottle, but I did not see the sealing process—nothing was locked up then, but all the bottles which had belonged to the deceased, and all bottles and jars containing results of the post-mortem, were carried by my directions into the front room by the undertaker, I think, it being understood that the front room was going to be locked—I do not know if it was locked and the key handed to Mr. Wood—the post-mortem took place in the back room, the bedroom—I noticed a very white condition of the tongue of the dead man when I first saw the corpse on 1st January; that passed off before the post-mortem—it presented itself to me as something striking, but I only learned to interpret it some days afterwards by experiments made on myself of swallowing chloroform—I took 3 1/2 drachms into my mouth, and swallowed about 20 or 30 drops, ejecting the remainder, and when I looked in the glass found my tongue was very white—that was some days after the 26th—there then came to my mind the abnormal whiteness of the dead man's tongue—this condition of my own tongue passed off in a very few hours—I have had no previous experience of the effect of chloroform taken into the stomach—I do not remember to have seen Mrs. Matthews or Mr. Dyson on 1st January, I think not—my next recollection of Dyson was on the 2nd, the day of the post-mortem—Mrs. Bartlett called on me on the 6th at my request—I had before that told her the result of the post-mortem examination when I announced it to the assembled relatives on 2nd January—I acted as the doctors' spokesman—to the best of my recollection I said, "These gentlemen wish me to state that we have very carefully examined the body of the deceased, and we are unable to discover any pathological lethal cause, that is to say, any natural or obvious cause of death; the contents of the stomach are suspicious, and we have preserved them"—that was a correct statement of the result—I had gone before that downstairs to summon the relatives, who were in the smoking-room, and in the presence of Mrs. Bartlett and the others I said the contents of the stomach had a pungent, ethereal odour, and I probably said, "Dr. Greene, or one of the doctors, suggests the smell of chloroform, but if it is it is the chlorodyne"—I was under that delusion then; that delusion has disappeared entirely since—on the 2nd no search was made in the drawers in the back room; one of the drawers was brought into the front room in the presence of all the people—Mrs. Bartlett said nothing to me about possessing chloroform till 26th January—when I announced the result of the post-mortem on the 2nd, and that there was chloroform which I thought they had mistaken for chlorodyne, she made no answer—on the 6th she called on me—I informed her I wished to be put in possession of any facts surrounding the death of the deceased which would enable me on the following day to lay some clear statement before the Coroner—the inquest was then fixed for the next day—I likewise asked her to repeat the hurried account she had given on the morning of my visit to the corpse—I am not quite sure but what she brought to me on that occasion notes of how the time had elapsed between his</p>

               <p>return from the dentist and my appearance there at 4 o'clock—I asked her to make memoranda while the events were still fresh in her memory of how the time had passed—I think it was on this occasion she read it to me—I said I thought that they were satisfactory, but I did not take a note of them, for I did not wish to burden my mind with things that had been observed by another person, and which I thought she would like to give in evidence herself—I requested her to keep them herself; I thought she would give the evidence herself—she was not examined before the Coroner—I have some brief notes of her visits—I do not know when they were made, but they were made on the police-court paper—on 6th January I had no note of importance—I think all the conversation about the impossibility of swallowing chloro<lb/>form had taken place much earlier—chloroform was mentioned on that occasion, for unfortunately I continued to harp on that subject—she reiterated the same statement that he could not have swallowed it—I saw Mrs. Bartlett several times between January 6th and 26th, on 14th and 18th twice—I had heard of the result of the analysis—on 26th I opened the conversation thus: "Mrs. Bartlett, I have some good news for you"—I knew she was much worried—"the report now is that the Government analyst is going to give in acetute of lead as the cause of death, which is nonsense, for there was no lead in the stomach; likewise the report says that he is going to return a verdict of chloroform as the cause of death, which is very improbable," I said "at any rate, either one or the other, that should set your mind at rest, but had it been one of the secret poisons given in small amounts, and which could be admin<lb/>istered without the patient knowing it, you would have most certainly been very seriously accused of having poisoned him, by some people;" she then very much surprised me by saying, "I am afraid, doctor, it is too true; I wish anything but chloroform had been found"—naturally that led me to ask question, "Why?" "What do you mean?" or some<lb/>thing of that sort, and she proceeded to make a long statement—I have a note of it made on 6th February—the matter is fairly clear in my recollection—she began her story with a preface containing a sketch of her married life, that being married young she had been induced to enter into a marriage compact, scarcely understanding the meaning of its terms; that the marital relations of the pair were, in deference to certain peculiar views held by her husband, to be entirely of a Platonic nature, sexual intercourse was not to occur—those terms were adhered to with one solitary exception in consequence of her fondness for children and her anxiety to become a mother; and after her confinement the former terms of a Platonic nature were resumed, she being indifferent on the matter—her husband was kind to her; they were affectionate, although on one occasion she objected to the use of the term "affectionate"—that is only a quibble in words—they each strove in every way to fulfil each other's wishes and succeeded in living upon most amicable terms—that happiness was on one occasion disturbed by her husband's father; she then entered into some family details which have slipped my memory, I mean about the conduct of her husband's father—she had consented to his living with them—the brother was not referred to—she said the father made her life miserable by his constant insults, and when she appealed to her husband to resent those insults he, in his mild way, did not act upon her suggestion with the zeal that she thought the occasion</p>

               <p>demanded; she consequently left her husband's house and hid herself from him, I think in the house of an aunt, and only consented to return upon an ample apology being made—that was the end of it—I cannot fix when this occurred—it was the only break in their conjugal happiness—she then said, her position had not been an easy one, and might be almost called cruel, for her husband, though meaning no cruelty, put her in a difficult position—no female friends were invited to the house, or relations, but he had always liked to surround her with male acquaint<lb/>ances—she said "He thought me clever; he wished to make me more clever, and the more attention and admiration I gained from these male acquaintances the more delighted did he appear; their attention to me seemed to give him pleasure"—the last few months of his life his nature teemed changed—"we became acquainted with Mr. Dyson—my husband threw us together—he requested us in his presence to kiss, and he seemed to enjoy it—he had given me to Mr. Dyson"—her hus<lb/>band having fully effected the transfer to Mr. Dyson, I mean still in a Platonic sense, her husband suddenly developed symptoms of wishing to assume his marital rights, which he had never before claimed—she put it in as delicate a manner as she could, but the meaning was he showed a desire to have sexual intercourse—she resented this—she said "Edwin, you know you have given me to Mr. Dyson, it is not right that you should do now what during all the married years of our life you have not done," and he agreed that it was so—she said that it was a duty to her womanhood and to the man to whom she was practically affianced at his wish—as he got, better, and while I was treating him, these manifestations became very urgent, and she sought for means the more thoroughly to emphasise her appeal to him or to prevent his putting his impulses into effect—one of those means, she said, was the possessing herself of a quantity of chloroform—I had no idea till I heard it in Court how long she had had it, but she said, "the presence of chloroform in my drawer troubled my mind"—she said her object was to sprinkle some upon a handkerchief and wave it in his face every time it was necessary; thinking that thereby he would go peacefully to sleep—I told her the danger, she would run if she had put that into practice, of their both being chloroformed by the bottle spilling, and that her plan would be ineffectual—I explained "Trying to put chloro<lb/>form upon your handkerchief and waving it in the face of your husband, he would have resisted, a struggle would have ensued, the bottle would have capsized and chloroformed the pair of you"—it is not the first time that chloroform has been upset in a bed, and the stopper come out—she said "I never kept a secret from Edwin, and the presence of chloroform in my drawer troubled my mind"—I put the word "my" in because I have since learned it was there, it was "In my possession," or "in my drawer," and "I was also troubled with some scruples as to whether putting my plan into practice would have been right, and on the last day of the old year, when all was quiet and the servant had left" (I am putting that in because the servant had left) "on the last night of year when he was in bed I brought the chloroform to him and gave the the bottle to him," and informed him of her intention, but she gave no details of the conversation—I asked "Was not your husband very cross with you, or alarmed, or what was his demeanour?"—she said "No, he was not cross; we talked amicably and seriously, and he turned round</p>

               <p>on his side and pretended to go to sleep," or to sulk, or something of that kind—in answer to a question from me she told me that he had looked at the chloroform, in was in a large round bottle I believe she told me, or it was in a large bottle, labelled "Chloroform," and corked, not tied down with leather or anything of that sort, and not full; he put it up the side where he was sitting or lying, on the mantelpiece at the corner—the next thing was that she fell asleep sitting in the chair where she always slept—I may add that she had slept there ever since I had attended the patient, notwithstanding my remonstrance; she went to sleep with her arm round his foot, then woke and found him snoring, then woke again and found him dead—she had given me the same story on the morning of the death—I said "Did you look at the bottle of chloro<lb/>form, was there much gone from it?"—she said "I don't know whether much was gone from it or not"—I did not ask her when she possessed herself of it—I asked her who got it for her—she did not answer, and I saw it was a question to which no answer would be given—I asked her how she got it; she said "Some one got it for me," and I asked no more questions; but later on there was no secret about it—the mantelpiece was not far from the head of the bed—I described the situation of every<lb/>thing I found on the mantelpiece on January 1st—there was no chloro<lb/>form bottle on the mantelpiece that morning—I have described all I saw—I asked her on 26th January what she had done with the bottle on 1st January; she said that she took it from the mantelpiece and put it away in her drawer about breakfast time—that is how the word "drawer" got into my mind—I asked her where it was when I was examining the room on January 1st, concerning that I am very much confused, but she said "It was there when I was there" or "It was there when I was sent for"—I am quite clear that it was not there when I was there, because both Mr. Doggett and I searched in her presence—she could see us searching, she never left the room—I do not think I asked her on the 26th where she had left the bottle of chloroform on the 1st, for it seemed obvious to me—she volunteered no explanation, but she wanted to know what he was dead of—she told me that the bottle remained in her drawer till the Wednesday that she took her things away, the 6th; that was the day before the first inquest, when she was allowed to remove her things, and she said that she took the bottle of chloroform with her, emptied it out at the carriage window, I think she said from the train, and threw the bottle away into some water—she told me that she did that on January 6th, the day she took her things away—I did not ask why she did it, nor did she tell me—she told me when she first suspected the real cause of her husband's death, and probably she told me that day, but I quite forget what she said.</p>

I had no knowledge of Mr. or Mrs. Bartlett's existence before December 10—as far as I know I was called in because the place where I practise faces their street—I had 20 or 21 oppor<lb/>tunities of seeing them together—on some days I visited them twice or even thrice, and at one visit I spent several hours there, and so far as I could see and judge she was attending him with anxious affection—I could not have wished for a more devoted nurse for him; I say that emphatically—I could have wished for one with a little better memory, but that defect was supplied by her keeping a written record, which she used to pin to the mantelpiece—she tended him night and day most</p>

               <p>affectionately—I do not remember her speaking of breaking down and being tired, but I noticed it and commented upon it in his presence—I was told that night after night during his illness she had slept sitting at the foot of his bed—she said that she slept comfortably in the chair and never went to bed—very soon after my first visit I noticed that it was telling on her and asked her on several occasions to go to bed, and she refused each time—it was obvious to me that she needed rest and was suffering in strength, and about the beginning of December I said "Now, Mrs. Bartlett, there is no excuse for your not going to bed;" she said "What is the use of my going to bed, doctor? he will walk about the room like a ghost; he will not sleep unless I sit and hold his toe"—the drollness of the expression fixed itself on my mind—when she first called me in she gave me a sketch of the case I was going to visit—I cannot remember what she said, but I said "This promises to be a a very peculiar case, I will come as soon as I can"—she did not give me a false account of his condition, or I should remember it—when I first went to see him she had preserved his motions and she continued to do so regularly, and his vomit also—his urine was sent to me to analyse more than once, but I only analysed it once, because I knew that his kidneys were sound—I paid him two visits on 10th December—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of my visits, but I paid some which I never entered—on the day that I saw him twice I found great nervous prostration; his muscular system was good enough; his physical state was not seriously impaired; he suffered from something more than diarrhoea, it was <hi rend="italic">menina</hi>, diarrhoea with black motions which contained indications of haemorrhage from the bowels—he complained of pain in his left side just about here (<hi rend="italic">The hip</hi>), and there was a peculiar dulness on percussion which puzzled me and I could find nothing to account for it on the post-mortem—it passed off in three or four days of treatment—he told me he had been overworked in business, and I advised him to see nobody connected with business—he complained of sickness and vomited, and on the day I first saw him he had vomited and continued to vomit for about a couple of days, I think—he was in a very bad state; his condition was that of nervous exhaustion and depression, and he was evidently hypo<lb/>chondriacal—his breath was very foetid and his pulse poor, small, and slight—he had a blue line round the edges of his gums, which were red and spongy, and there was some small amount of salivation, an extra large now of saliva (which at once suggested to me that he had taken mercury), and I examined him carefully for signs of syphilis, but found none—I don't think I waited on that occasion till Mrs. Bartlett left the room—I think it was on the second visit I asked him the question privately—after a quarter of an hour he or Mrs. Bartlett said "Well, doctor, what is the matter with me?" and I said "Mercurial poisoning"—I said it sharply, thinking to take him unawares and make him admit it; not then, but to show him that there was no hiding any secrets from me—he said "How can that be?" I said "From taking mercury"—he said "I have not taken away"—I said "Think it over"—I did not quite accept the answer—my experience is that the answer is sometimes not to be relied on, especially when a third party is present, and when Mrs. Bartlett had left the room I asked him whether he had been taking medi<lb/>cines—he said "No"—it flashed through my mind that he had been in the hands of some quack or practitioner who had given him mercury for</p>

               <p>real or supposed syphilis; but I did not distrust him after his answer—he had not had syphilis, but he had spyhiliphobia—I have made notes; this is my account—"When Mrs. Bartlett was out of the room I asked him if he could account for it, if he had not been taking medicine—he assured me that he had not, and I did not press the question, because I thought he had been in the hands of quacks for a real or supposed secret disease, and was ashamed to own it"—I said that perhaps that was so—that was the account I set down on paper—I would stand by that more than what I say <hi rend="italic">vivd voce</hi>, for when I have a pen in my hand I do not make mistakes—I upon that told him to be careful not to take anything I did not prescribe while I was attending him—I was anxious that he should not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. This is an accurate report: "December 11th.—This morning, or the evening of yesterday, he told me he had found a clue to the mercury. A few days previously he had taken a pill which, in a moment of abstraction, he picked out of a drawer," <hi rend="italic">&amp;c., reading the witness previous statement.</hi> The bowel and the physical symptoms began to improve from the very first, but his spirits did not improve—he continued to complain of sleeplessness—on the 12th I saw him twice—I think after my second visit I let his messenger come home with me, as the chemist's shop was closed, and I made a bromide draught for him—on Sunday, the 13th, I visited him three times, and for the first time found it necessary to inject morphia. (<hi rend="italic">Referring to his notes.</hi>) I was doubtful whether it was given him for dental purposes, but evidently it was given him to procure some sleep—I had already, I have no doubt, given him some few doses of nux vomica and bromide, or I should not have resorted to morphia—it was a peculiarity in him that it made him very restless; large doses of bromide he declared were stimulants, but they are the very reverse—about the 14th the blue line round the teeth began to give way to a grey sloughing margin, and I brought in a surgeon-dentist in con<lb/>sultation, and his view favoured mercury and not tartar—on the 15th I visited him twice, and again in a night visit I injected morphia—at that time his sleeplessness was getting worse, not from the former cause, but I have no doubt his teeth were then getting painful—on the 16th there were two visits, and he complained of pain in his lower lip, I think—I gave him a tonic, nux vomica, gentian, and peppermint, to produce appetite, and to allay the pain and the flatulence—I do not remember pain in the tongue—the pain in the lips was caused by his teeth, and in the under surface of the tongue—on the 16th he had two teeth extracted; two central incisor groups—it was determined to extract the loose roots, and they were extracted—they were very much decayed and horrible, and loose—there was no fungoid growth at the roots on the 17th—by "horrible" I mean they were in such a bad state of decay, and the gums were still bad, and in front, near the incisor teeth, the grey slough which succeeded the blue line had sloughed off, leaving a jagged margin—as early as the 19th, when he got rid of those teeth, or roots, I began to talk to him about getting out of doors—he refused; he said it would kill him—he really was so obstinate about going out of doors, that he almost at one time made me believe that I had overlooked something serious in</p>

               <p>him—he was so reasonable on some points that I could scarcely put it down to sheer folly—Dr. Dudley's chief advice was for him to get out—it was of no use, as he passively resisted—he told me he liked to he still and feel happy—he told me on the 18th that the family wanted to send down another doctor, and Dr. Dudley came on the 19th—Mr. Bartlett said that he was content to get an independent opinion at one visit, and left me to choose somebody to come—I chose Dr. Dudley because he lived near, and he was a hospital physician, and he seemed a most appro<lb/>priate witness to call in—I have said, "During my visit Mrs. Bartlett laid 'Doctor, I have something very unpleasant to say, his relations who are never content with anything I do, want to send him a physician of their own choosing.' I answered at once, 'Well, let them send him one, I have almost done with him; he only requires an outing to be quite well, and then he ought to go to the South Coast.'" That is quite correct—it is not in my entry that I "turned to Mr. Bartlett for an explanation of that statement. He sat up in bed, and said, 'Yes, that is all true; I am sorry to say that my friends are not friends to my wife '"—it is not in my notes, but certainly he said, "My wife and I will manage our own affairs, and not trouble other people"—on the 19th I supplied a sleeping draught, chloral hydrate and hydrochlorate of morphia and syrup of red poppy; he was then pretty much as usual—I agreed with Dr. Dudley that he was suffering from sub-acute gastritis—we attributed his mental condition to his account that he had been suffering from great sleeplessness for a considerable time—on the 20th I increased the dose of chloral hydrate—on the 21st the lower incisors were removed, and the teeth were prin<lb/>cipally at fault, so that we had little left to complain of—the gums were getting sloughy round the teeth—about that time probably (I am not sure but that she said it more than once), Mrs. Bartlett told me before to husband that he would still talk about dying—I told him I would accompany him to Torquay after Christmas, and I mentioned Dr. Dalby there, because I thought it would give him confidence that he would be looked after, although he required no looking after, practically—I wanted to get him away from his wife, and send him to Torquay alone, and that was one reason why I offered to accompany him—he was practically a hysterical patient about this time, and his wife petted him too much, and what would have done him good would have been a sea trip with no one to nurse him and hold his toe, and that sort of nonsense—if he had been abandoned to take care of himself he would have been all right—he wanted dental care, but from a medical point of view he was out of hand—on the 24th I prescribed the placebo, which would do not harm nor good, except as far as he imaged it was going to and I did not tell his wife the secret of it—ten drops were to be given in wine and repeated if necessary an hour later if the pain was severe, and I think I said he must be careful not to take a third dose—up to that time he had been getting better physically—on the 23d he passed the worm, and that threw everything back again, and he was in such a condition about it that threw I put off the treatment for two days, partly to see if any more passed, and partly to let him gather up pluck and strength—he was much depressed about it, and thought certainly he had proved there was something wrong with him then—the vermifuge came two days than I had found out—the next day, I think, he told me he felt worms</p>

               <p>wriggling up his throat, and he kept to it; I don't know if it was delusion—two or three days ago I saw a worm that did wriggle up a patient's throat, and was vomited—Mr. Bartlett may have felt it, but I think in his case it was a mistake, because I asked the doctor to search for a lumbricoid in the post-mortem, and his motions were watched from that day to the day of his death—he always described them in my presence as in his throat, not as wriggling up him—that would be the imagination of a very nervous man, upset by this having happened, but I should not be inclined to set down every man as nervous who said that, because worms might be there—I have no basis to form an opinion as to whether they could be there—his nervous and depressed condition at this time was not neces<lb/>sarily connected with this imagination about worms—he was in a more depressed and troubled condition after that time for a day or two—he told me an extraordinary rigmarole about his being on the night of the 26th under somebody's influence; he thought he and his wife had both been mesmerised by a friend—on going in on the next morning I said "Well, Mr. Bartlett, how have you slept?"—he said "I could not sleep; I was nervous and restless when I saw my wife asleep in the easy chair, so I got up and went and stood over her like this" (holding up his hands, he was in an excited state) "for two hours, and I felt the vital force being drawn from her to me; I felt it going into me through my finger tips, and after that I lay down and slept"—his wife said "That is a nice story, doctor, imagine him standing for two hours and doing anything"—Mrs. Bartlett ridiculed it as mere delusion on his part—I did not imagine he would stand for two hours doing anything; I was of Mrs. Bartlett's opinion on that matter.</p>

I did not find that the sedatives produced their expected effect on him—the same thing happened with respect to the purgatives—on the 26th I sub<lb/>jected him to a very severe treatment in order to open the bowels—there were two draughts and then two globules containing croton oil; those he called stimulants—the croton oil pills ought to have been very effectual and very rapid for their purpose, but he attributed to them precisely an opposite effect, he said he felt stimulated by them, that they were warm and pleasant to his stomach—I then got him hot tea and coffee to induce these remedies to act, but it did not have the desired effect, nothing had—I then applied galvanism to the abdomen, and that failed, and I prac<lb/>tically gave it up in despair—I may mention that he was not suffering from constipation previously, it was not constipation that I was treating him for, but the vermifuge worm powder that had to be driven out of the digestive organs—he had swallowed the worm powder and I naturally had to give purgatives to clear that out—if it had remained there it would have made him very miserable, he would have seen everything green and have suffered from buzzing in the ears and all sorts of troubles which I didn't wish to subject him to—he did not have these troubles, he would have had them—I have tried the same drug upon myself, and always try to avoid letting any patient experience what I experienced on that occasion—it was carried off his bowels after two or three days, he did not suffer from constipation afterwards—I saw a motion the next morning when I called, a small one I grant, it was not satisfactory—I told him on Tuesday, the 29th, that I should not come on the Wednesday, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050197"/>
               <p>was apparently distressed at that—I don't remember what he said; it was not the first time I had threatened—the idea had always disturbed him of my not continuing to attend him, and Mrs. Bartlett said on pre<lb/>vious occasions "You had better come, doctor, he will be anxious," or something of that sort—that was why I visited him so often as I did during some portion of the time—I heard that he had crying fits about this time, and spoke to him about them; I saw none myself—I don't remember his saying he couldn't help it when I spoke to him about it, he made some reply of a queer nature I know; it was a reply quite fitting the case—I said before the Coroner "I was told by Mrs. Bartlett on several occasions that the deceased had had one of his crying fits, and on speaking to him he said that was so; Mrs. Bartlett said 'Edwin sits in his armchair and cries an hour at a time, and when I ask him about it he says it was because he was so happy;'" if that was true I should have put it down to male hysteria; when I asked him why he cried he said he could not help it—that is most probably true, because the facts were better in my mind then; Mrs. Bartlett's reply I remember distinctly now, she said "He cries because he says he is so happy," that couldn't fail to strike me as being odd—that was said in his presence—he was not a man to discuss medical matters; he was not a talkative man—the only time that I saw him what might be called talkative was the time that he told me about his being mesmerised; then he fired up with quite unwonted eloquence—during the last two or three days of his life, on the 29th, 30th and 31st I think it was, his jaw symptoms became alarming, that pointed to necrosis of a superficial kind—I do not use the word "alarming" in its worse sense, necrosis may often be a very terrible matter indeed—there was necrosis there that might have led to considerable inconvenience as regards mastication, it might have pro<lb/>longed the time during which he would have to go without false teeth, and it was the absence of teeth that led to many of his other troubles; it was a necrosis that might have caused considerable sloughing of the gums, which he then had slightly; a necrosis that might ultimately have resulted in an albuta process, that is a part of the socket, and which might be more difficult for a dentist to place a set of false teeth upon; a necrosis that might have considerably upset him—I had no great fear as to the ultimate result of this necrosis at affecting his life, but I was alarmed as to the consequences that might follow—the most common cause of necrosis is injury to the bone or periosteum, by traumatic or chemical causes—necrosis may follow traumatically from a blow, and indirectly on a fever—in a particular form it may follow on phosphorus poisoning, caries begins the process then—syphilis is the most common cause of necrosis—I have no doubt there have been a good many cases where necrosis has followed upon taking mercury even in small doses where syphilis has not been present at all—when I saw Mr. Bartlett first I told him he was suffering from mercurial poisoning; there was no necrosis then, it appeared indirectly—I take it to be that mercury is one of the causes in the chain of events that leads up to necrosis—an extra dose of some pill which contained mercury would have caused the necrosis of the jaw, or have had a serious operation in producing it—on the afternoon of the 31st I privately arranged with Mrs. Bartlett about his going to the dentist's, in order to spare him the dread of looking forward to that visit—after he left me that evening he understood that I would</p>

               <p>come and see him on the following morning, and in the ordinary course I should have gone there on 1st January—he and his wife left me at the dentist's door and went back to Claverton Street in a Hansom—I was present when the deceased referred to the very happy life he had led, and saying that he should like to be married again—it was on the way to the dentist's—as we were approaching the corner of Denbigh Street and Charlwood Street the conversation ran upon the subject of recent marriages in the locality—Mrs. Bartlett said to me, "This morning Edwin and I, doctor, were talking about the number of our friends who are getting married, and we were saying we wished almost that we were unmarried that we might have the pleasure of marrying each other again"—I turned to the deceased and said, "That is very flattering to you, Mr. Bartlett, after so many years experience of you," and his reply was not quite clear for he was muffled up, his mouth was covered with wraps on the way to the dentist's, but he said, "Yes, we suit one another very well in our views," or "ways," I am not sure which he said, and then the conversation dropped before we arrived at the dentist's—he knew he was on the way to the dentist's to have the operation per<lb/>formed; I went to Claverton Street to take him to the dentist's myself, and I found that he was already dressed—the prisoner was lively and cheerful on the way, trying to keep his spirits up; she always did that—when I went there after the death Mrs. Bartlett was apparently very much distressed—directly I entered the room she said, coming up to me, "Is he really dead?" and then it was that I made the formal examination, really thinking in my mind at the time, "How can I best put it to this poor woman? how can I best really break the news to her?" and I turned round and said, "Yes, Mrs. Bartlett, I am afraid he is," or something to that effect, and then she burst out crying bitterly—when that was over we began to talk about the possible cause of death, and she said "What is he dead of, doctor?" or "What can he be dead of?" I am not sure of the words, and my answer was "I don't know"—I then asked if he could get prussic acid, that was the most rapid poison that suggested itself to my mind, and she said, "Oh no, he could have got at no poison without my knowledge"—after that I suggested digitalis and other alkaloids that he had got, anything which his friend Squires had had, or anything that he had had by him, and she negatived everything—she appeared anxious, as far as I could judge, to get at any suggestion as to the death, she seemed not only grieved but very much alarmed, very much scared, that is the impression on my mind now, of course I didn't think it then—when speaking of poisons I mentioned morphia and opium among others, and she said "There are the two opium pills even which he had had by him some time, he asked me to give him some last night, but I am very glad I did not"—I went over to the cupboard and saw the pills there—she certainly wished to have the post-mortem as quickly as possible; she chafed at the delay till next day—when I told her that Dr. Green could not come that afternoon she said "Can't he be persuaded to come, in order that he might make the post-mortem on that day?" she said "Spare no expense, get any assistance you want, we are all interested in knowing the cause of death," and it was on the strength of that permission that I telegraphed to Dr. Green to bring an assistant, any gentleman he chose—the prisoner spoke of the death as a mystery that she wanted to have cleared up; if Dr. Green had been able to come that afternoon, the post-mortem</p>

               <p>would have taken place then—I wanted to employ Dr. Green, for I thought there might be some peculiar pathological questions involved; he is an eminent pathologist—the communication she made to me on 26th January I considered was made to me in confidence—I went before the Coroner, not thinking I should have to give that evidence, thinking the would go into the box and give it herself, and that I should never be called upon to give it; I felt utterly incompetent to give the narrative straight off without thinking it over, and I said I was so confused I did not know what to answer, but as I got out of the Court I wrote it—her words were that she gave the bottle into his hand, they talked affection<lb/>ately about their relations to one another for a short time, and he seemed grieved, and turned over—I have not read my evidence before the Coroner since I gave it—my statement was written a little rapidly, if I had to write it now I should say that the prisoner said that the idea of chloroform scarcely entered into her head—I do not mean that she did not say that the idea did not flash across her mind, but that she had failed to entertain it—that evidence was given at a time much nearer the conversation than the time of which we are now speaking; that is the part of the deposition which I wrote and gave to the Coroner—the conversation took place on 26th January, and I wrote it out on 4th February, but too much stress must not be put upon any word or sentence—I ran home and wrote it out very rapidly, and did not weigh accurately every word I used—when I suggested that the deceased had swallowed chlorodyne and not chloroform the prisoner combated the idea, and pointed out that the chlorodyne he used was simply to rub the gums—she would not accept the suggestion that it was chlorodyne; she refuted it—I do not remember any one telling her after the post-mortem examination that she must not remain in the rooms—I think she said she would not remain; at all events, it was understood that she was going—she handed me her keys, and asked me to go to a drawer in the room where the corpse was lying and get her hat out—I took the key and fetched the whole drawer—she took her hat from it, and I put the drawer with its contents back in its place, looked it, and took the key back to her—she asked me to keep the keys, but I suggested that Mr. Wood, her solicitor, should take them—I afterwards accepted them and took them home—there has been some slight misunderstanding about those keys, and I wish plainly understood the circumstances under which I took them.

               <p>strange ideas," that goes without saying; one or two of his strange ideas were those relating to matrimony—I have not heard him say anything about matrimony, but he had very strange ideas about mesmerism and vital force, and things too insignificant to make a note of, which conveyed to my mind the impression that my patient was one of the most extra<lb/>ordinary men I ever had to deal with, though a very pleasant and nice man—his communications about mesmerism were such that at the time I actually suspected him of insanity, and I tried to find a key to it—I never heard him allude to two wives, one for use and one for companion<lb/>ship; that came from her—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the written statement I gave to the Coroner—it says, "Mr. Bartlett, the deceased, was a man of very strange ideas, which I can corroborate," but the words "which I can corroborate" were struck through with a pencil by me at the Coroner's table—their marriage relationship was not mentioned in Mr. Bartlett's presence at any time—when Mrs. Bartlett was breaking, or suffering from the strain of watching, or her husband thought so, I suggested that they should both go to bed in the back room; I don't remember Mr. Bartlett's answer, but he did not do so—he gave me no reason—the fact that he did not do so, although I suggested it, is one of the things in my mind which supported that statement—I know that he had always slept in a camp bedstead, and I have a strong impression of having heard it mentioned that they did not occupy the same bed, even before they came to Claverton Street, but the impression is so vague that I cannot say more—I have the impression that I have heard it before, and I think in his presence; it seems mixed up with him somehow—I I have no doubt the recollection of these things came to my mind as supporting the statement Mrs. Bartlett was making to me—all that I knew about the deceased and his wife passed in review before my mind at the time and enabled me to accept that statement—then follows: "Among them was that a man should have two wives, one for companion<lb/>ship and the other for use"—I think I should have remembered that certainly if it had been in those words—"At the age of sixteen she was selected by him in the former capacity"—I knew that she had been married very young, "as a life companion, for whom no carnal feeling should be entertained"—I observed his manner to other people and to his wife, and while she was telling me this the picture of it came back into my mind, and although I remembered signs of affection, kindness, and interest, I can say there was nothing in his demeanour to her to make me doubt that—I can believe that what I witnessed was the affection of brother and sister; I don't say it was—my mind received that impression, which to that extent supported her statement that the marriage contract was that they should live assexually as loving friends—as to that rule being observed for six years, I had heard a child was born and that her first pregnancy was after six years—while he was alive I had heard a child was born, and the first professional consultation I had with Mrs. Bartlett led to questions that certainly support this statement that her first and only pregnancy occurred about six years ago—what she communicated to me was consistent with that—in the course of consultation with her, on January 14, I learnt that she had been pregnant once, and that some years previously—that was said inde<lb/>pendently of this case or anything with regard to her husband's death—I fancy little was said on that day about her husband; it was a purely</p>

               <p>medical consultation—"To earnest entreaties that she should become a mother," I knew she was fond of children—I had heard before how fond she was of children and dogs, she told me that in her husband's presence—"child born died at its birth," that was new—"their relations were not those of matrimony," I have explained in what sense that was new to me—"the deceased made no secret of his views on marriage," that was new to me—she told me something about the trouble he had with his aunt for having mentioned his views on matrimony in her house—"and the doctor who delivered Mrs. Bartlett was given to understand that the child was the result of a single coitus;" I did not hear the name of Dr. Woodward as that of the doctor who was called in, to my recollection; I thought it was Dr. Barraclough, that may be the name which Mr. Bartlett senior mentioned to me once—"and with few exceptions had no differences," that I am quite prepared to acknowledge—"this she did to please him," that I am quite prepared to accept, I had seen how she tried in every way to please him—some facts which I do not remember came before me of her studies—very probably I heard of her going in for examination, I do not remember certainly—"for he desired her to be very learned on all subjects;" I remember words less than looks when reading this—I remember once, the first time I saw Dyson there I think, he and she were discussing some rather remote subject, and I was interested in watching my patient, who sat and never uttered a word, but watched his wife talking with a look of admiration that fitted in with this sentence—"affected to admire her physically," that I don't know—"surrounded her with male acquaintances," that explained a good deal that had puzzled me with regard to Dyson, whom I had seen there from time to time, and who was there a good deal it occurred to me—the husband seemed quite to take it as a matter of course; he was as welcome to one as the other as far as I saw, and he spoke to me of Dyson in terms of the highest admiration and affection, so far as he would be likely to touch on the subject of affection—Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett were very proud of Dyson I knew—they had his photograph in the room—I think he remarked how very highly educated Dyson was, and they spoke in terms of great affection too—the sentence "I was cognisant" was put in to mark the beginning of absolutely new facts—from the bed on which Mr. Bartlett lay one could reach the mantelpiece or something on it without getting up, not lying down flat, but by rising on the left arm it would be easy to reach—as a rule medicine bottles were not kept on the mantelpiece, but in the bedroom—I mentioned to Mrs. Bartlett, "Why don't you keep his medicine near him?" and she said, "I like to make this room as little like an invalid's room as possible," so that there were rarely bottles on the mantelpiece—in my experience I have at no time seen a case of death by poisoning with liquid chloroform; it certainly is among the rare causes of death from poison, it has occurred—I have seen a case of what was supposed to be death by inhalation—I have administered chloroform about 200 times—it is an anxious operation—of late years the use of chloroform as an agent for producing anaesthesia has been lessened, and ether has been used instead, because it is less dangerous in most conditions, and some things incidental to chloroform are not so often found with ether, vomiting for instance—the patient usually vomits after inhaling chloro<lb/>form, or even during the administration; it depends very much on the</p>

               <p>condition of the stomach, whether food has been given previously—If I were going to administer chloroform I should give my patient no food for at least four hours before, and then only beef-tea or some liquid easily digested—if he had any indigestible substance in the stomach, such as a substantial quantity of mango chutnee, it might produce vomiting; I should not like to say it would, it is a very likely suggestion—I have never administered chloroform to an adult in sleep; and have only heard of its being done in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, which I do not accept as medical authority; I am not saying it could not be done—as a matter of personal experience I am not familiar with the post-mortem indications of death from inhalation of chloroform, but as a matter of general knowledge I am—it would depend on the quantity what the post-mortem appearances would be—in that case where 15 drops has killed by inhalation you would find on post-mortem examination no signs whatever to eyes or nose, because it is sudden inanition of the functions and immediate death—that would be rather from a too strong percentage of chloroform into the larynx and a disturbance of the heart's functions than the entrance of chloroform into the system—in administering chloroform you have to be very careful as to the proportion of the mixture of chloroform vapour with the air, you must not go above 4 per cent if you can help it, and if you do it is dangerous—in case of death from such a small quantity of chloroform there is no indication of it whatever, because the death is sudden—in cases where the patient has died after chloroform narcosis has been thoroughly produced, you will find the smell of chloroform in the lungs in all probability—it would depend of course on the length of time—we are dealing with a case of real inhalation of chloroform, chloroform narcosis, or in popular language, until the man is chloroformed; there would also be probably, but not necessarily, some amount of congestion of the lungs; the same as regards the brain, and in a case of death from an excessive amount of chloroform there would be fluidity of the blood and staining of the brain, and the brain itself smelling of chloroform—in fact in the three instances I have noticed you will find very nearly the same effects as you would find in a case of poisoning by liquid chloroform, except that there would be more to be seen about the lungs—the effect on the brain would be the same in death by swallowing or inhalation, but there might be more congestion, but there would not be the same effect on the lungs—I think the smell of the brain would be the same—there need not necessarily be anything peculiar about the heart when a man has died from inhaling or swallowing chloroform, but as a matter of fact you generally find those who have died from inhalation have died from fatty degeneration of the heart—if he had died from asphyxia through an overdose of chloroform by inhala<lb/>tion you would find the right side of the heart engorged with blood and the lungs too—suppose a person to have been chloroformed, and shortly after, without recovering, to die, you would find the same post-mortem indications—there would not necessarily be engorgement, unless the death were from asphyxia—I don't know about the urine—I did not make the post-mortem, I was taking my observations from the skilled pathologist.</p>

               <p>suggestive of it—the smell in the stomach was suggestive of it—the post-mortem appearances of the different parts of the body would be of small importance, except as regards the smell—the fluidity of the blood, the staining of the tissues, all agree with chloroform poisoning, as with many other poisonings—I exclude the stomach—the appearance of the brain was so slight it is waste of time to allude to it—it is my own opinion that the effect on the brain would be the same from swallowing or inhaling chloroform—I have had no personal experience of death from swallowing liquid chloroform—I have made no actual experiments with animals or persons to ascertain whether my opinion is correct or not—until this case I had read of death from liquid chloroform, but it is rare—I have since studied the subject, and read up cases from back numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>—vomiting, if chloroform is inhaled, is a very common thing, and generally arises from its being administered too soon after a meal, but that is not the only cause—four hours after will do if the meal consists of a chloroform breakfast, beef-tea or a light breakfast—in cases of an ordinary meal it would depend on what the meal was, and on the digestion of the patient—beef-tea, and then the administration four hours afterwards, would be the right way, and that would be calculated to avoid vomiting—as a rule, where large quantities of liquid chloroform are taken, it seems to produce vomiting—I remember a case where a lady walked down Sloane Street swallowing four ounces, and she vomited afterwards—I cannot call to mind reading any other oases—I should think two ounces would be enough to cause vomiting, but I am only guessing now—I should say the smallest fatal dose for an adult would be six drachms—I have heard Dr. Stevenson in evidence say that chloroform could be given by inhalation to a person asleep, and I accept fully any<lb/>thing he says—I see no difficulty as to that being done with skill—my own opinion is that it is difficult, but that it could be done; it would require skill—it would be inhaled in the ordinary way—the prisoner first con<lb/>sulted me as a medical man on 14th January, and it was then, I think, she told me she had only been pregnant once—it was on a previous occasion she said she was very fond of children—when she consulted me on 14th January she alluded incidentally to her sexual relations as a wife with her husband—it was on the general subject of sexual intercourse and her internal conditions that she consulted me, and then I learnt she had been pregnant once—I presume she said she had not been pregnant since—I don't remember anything more—on the 26th she said what I have already told you—I have certainly put all that is important before the Court—I heard nothing about his married life from Mr. Bartlett—I cannot describe what I mean by saying they were like brother and sister—their conversation going to the dentist's on the 31st of their happy married life and about being married again, was in no way inconsistent with it—I observed the affectionate terms they were on—I am prepared to say I had observed there was nothing sexual—there is more than their not going to bed in the back room when I suggested it; there was the general bearing of the parties—I am unable to express more than I have said; I have seen no other people of whom I have fancied the same thing—I should say it is a very unusual thing in married life, and I don't "say it struck me at the time it was so—I have merely admitted that from what I remember of their relations one to another, it is quite possible there may have been nothing sexual in the relations I witnessed—I have</p>

Memo of conversation with Mr. Bartlett deceased, and Mrs. Bartlett, held about 10 p.m., most probably on the 26th December, 1885. Having occasion to sit some hours with my patient we conversed, and by accident the word 'mes<lb/>merism' was mentioned. Deceased became all alert at once and asked me if I could mesmerise. I told him I had never tried, and did not mean to, giving as my reason my opinion that no medical man should seek to become a mesmerise. But he again asked me to make the experiment on him, and I declined. He said 'Do you understand much about 'mesmerism'? I told him that I had frequently watched the effects of skilled mesmerists, and had applied scientific tests, and was interested enough in it to give some study to the psychological problems involved. He said 'Can you tell me whether I am under mesmeric control' (I think he used some such word) 'at the present moment?' Smiling, I said 'Do you think you are?' He answered 'Yes, I do,' and proceeded to explain: 'Last summer a friend who could mesmerize visited us, and I asked him on several occasions to mesmerise me, but he always refused. Now, why do you think he refused?' I told Mr. Bartlett I could not guess. 'Well,' said Mr. Bartlett, 'I think he must have done it then or on some subsequent occasion.' Then Mrs. Bartlett broke in, 'Oh Edwin, how absurd you are. He does get such strange ideas into his head nowadays, doctor.' He continued without interrogation, 'I think he mesmerised me through my wife, is that a possibility?' I said I did not know, but that the subject was very amusing, would he tell me some more about it, especially the symptons that led him to a so extraordinary belief? With some pressing I got this reply, 'Well, I am doing such absurd things, things against my common sense, in fact both my wife and I are doing so.' 'What kind of absurd things are you both doing?' I asked. His only reply was that they were doing things that were unusual and contrary to common sense. During this conversation he had emerged from his usual reserve and was speaking with an unaccustomed vigour and excitement and I was growing anxious about his night's rest, but thinking I had perhaps to do with one of the phases of insanity, and was on the point of getting a key to his peculiar nervous temperament, I decided to push my enquiry.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050205"/>
               <p>'Mr. Bartlett,' I said, 'if my brother medicos were to hear us they would think Mrs. Bartlett the only sane person among us three; but I do not depise ideas because they are contrary to my everyday experience. Pray tell me more about yours, especially about the nature of the things your mysterious friend makes you do.' Here Mrs. Bartlett interposed remarks calculated to turn the conversation. She said it was all ridiculous nonsense he was talking. But persisting in trying to find my key, I obtained her permission to continue the conversation 'au grand serieux'! 'Do you ever hear voices telling you to do this or that, Mr. Bartlett?' 'Oh no,' he said, and I regarded his reply as one of considerable importance. 'Do you ever con<lb/>verse with your magician when he is not near you?' Again he said decidedly 'No,' giving his reply in a manner to relieve my mind, in a medical sense, of some anxiety. But he persisted that he was under a mesmeric influence and asked if I knew of no method for dis<lb/>covering the truth of the matter, and I promised him that if he would fully describe to me his feelings and the grounds for his suppositions I, in return, would consult a very high authority in mesmeric phenomena concerning the case. I said 'How long did the influence last, I mean how long did you continue to do strange things?' He replied' I am still doing them.' I said' But what are they?' He answered, hesitating. 'Well, perhaps I should not be here if it were not for the influence' (I think he used the word). 'Where would you be?' He said, 'Elsewhere, perhaps at the sea-side, perhaps abroad.' Then a suspicion flashed across my mind, and I said, 'Does your mesmeric friend control you in your city purchases? Make you spend your money differently to your ordinary notions? Has he ever implanted you with a fixed idea to sign any cheque, or draft, or endorse anything?' To all these questions he replied in a manner to indicate that I was very wide of the mark, and persisted that he only felt impelled to do 'queer things,' saying 'I am acting in a way different to what I should do if I were not mesmerised, and that is all.' Then the idea struck me that he might really be in terror of somebody who had acquired ascendency over him, so I asked, 'Do you feel a sinking or depression when you hear him coming, or do you shudder when he approaches?' 'No, not at all, I like him.' Then, despairing of making head or tail out of my patient's mental con<lb/>dition, I put my last query. 'Do you feel positive that your supposed friend is really a friend and not trying to work out his own ends through hit influence with you—mesmeric or otherwise?' He said he was sure this was not the case. I appealed to Mrs. Bartlett for her opinion and she said: 'Edwin and he are the best of friends and he is a true friend to both of us.' I repeated the question to her in private and received the same reply. As a sequel to keep faith with my patient I put the case at his request to a distinguished student of things mystical and asked the latter if he believed it to be within the bounds of infinite possibility that any dominant idea could be made obscess a man in Mr. Bartlett's state, and if not, how could I best conjure him into his right senses again. At a subsequent visit I assured Mr. Bartlett that his delusions had been very carefully thought over, and that they were delusions I proved to him in argument. He was convinced then, and a few days later assured me that he was thoroughly of my opinion. I may add that I remember these events so accurately by reason of my being permitted to discuss them</p>

               <p>at the time with my occult acquaintance."—I know some people out of the asylums think they are very much under the influence of others—some mesmerists claim to be able to influence people, although they are miles away, that is a common belief among them—when I was first called in to Claverton Street I thought Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett had been recently married—all this petting, &amp;c., would lead to that conclusion—I did not at that time suppose there was anything like brother and sister in their acquaintance, but going back now in my recollection to that day on which I thought they were recently married, I still do not hesitate to say that after all it is quite possible that was an assexual relation—I saw them remain on the same terms the whole time I visited them—besides the mesmerism Mr. Bartlett had the delusion of a worm in his throat, I can call no other to mind—he had no hallucinations—hallu<lb/>cination is a deception of the senses and delusion, one of the intellect—hallucination is the case of a man seeing a ghost or a man that has delirium tremens—there was no danger from the necrosis that I could see—I did not alarm my patient in any way about that necrosis.</p>

                  </hi>. My address is 71, Belgrave Road—I am a registered medical practioner—I am a Doctor of Medicine of the University of Cambridge, and Member of the College of Physicians, London—I was called in to see Mr. Bartlett at Claverton Street on 19th December; Mr. Leach called me in, and in conjunction with him I examined Mr. Bartlett—I was there with him about 25 or 30 minutes—Dr. Leach communicated to me what Mr. Bartlett was suffering from, and then I found out for myself what his ailments were—I saw the con<lb/>dition of the gums, they were spongy and inflamed—I did not notice any line on the gums or on the margin—he had a very depressed appearance, he seemed wanting in energy—he was lying in an easy posture, appa<lb/>rently free from pain—he told me he required rest; he had been over<lb/>worked mentally and bodily—that he was very sleepless, and had not slept well for a considerable time, and scarcely at all the last few nights—I examined him to find out whether he was suffering from any disease—I could find no sign of disease whatever, the organs all seemed quite healthy—I told him my opinion that he was a sound man; he made no reply—I told him he ought to sit up and go out for a walk or a drive daily—I prescribed for him a sedative and a tonic—there if nothing else that I think it necessary to say with regard to my examination of him—I only saw him on that one occasion—Mrs. Bartlett was present throughout the interview, and replied to several questions I put to her; she took part in the conversation—I asked her some questions; they were, I think, with regard to his previous health and his habits—the answers were all favourable; the habits were temperate, and the general health had been previously good—I heard afterwards of his death, and on 2nd January I attended the post-mortem—there was no natural cause, from the appear<lb/>ance of the various organs, to account for death—in the stomach there was an erosion, a part where the mucous membrane was destroyed, in the most dependent part of the stomach; the portion that was lowest near the spinal column, the lowest part when a person is lying down—that would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050208"/>
               <p>be occasioned by some noxious agent remaining in contact with it, an irritant; liquid chloroform would very likely account for it—the blood was very fluid; if death had been caused by chloroform that would cause the blood to be fluid—I smelt the stomach itself when it was opened; it smelt very strongly of chloroform, or a combination of chloroform and garlic—the whole contents of the stomach were placed in a clean glass-stoppered bottle in my presence, and sealed with my seal—I smelt the intestines; they had the same smell, but in a less degree—the contents of the intestines were pat into another jar and sealed; the stomach itself was put into another jar and sealed up—both were put into separate bottles—there was a fourth bottle with some chutnee; the chutnee was found in the room; some was placed in a bottle which was found at the post-mortem—that was put into a bottle and sealed, so that it might be examined as well—I do not believe the jars were numbered, I have no recollection that they were—after they had been sealed up these four were put in the front room; the post-mortem was made in the back room—after the post-mortem it was arranged that Dr. Leach should announce the result of it to Mrs. Bartlett; we deputed that he should do so, as he was present—Mr. Bartlett senior, the father, was present at the time, and Mr. Wood, the solicitor, and Mr. Dyson—the announcement was made in the front room—it was to the effect that we found no natural cause of death, but that there were suspicious appearances in the stomach, and with regard to the appearance of the stomach itself, and that it would be necessary to make the Coroner acquainted with the fact—I do not remember that there was anything said to that by any one.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold the degree of M D. of London; I am also assistant physician at Charing Cross Hospital—on the 2nd of January last I attended at the post-mortem examination at 85, Claverton Street, with Dr. Green, on the body of Mr. Bartlett—Mr. Leach, Mr. Cheyne, and Dr. Dudley were also present—we began about half-past two—I did the operative part—Dr. Green watched the operations and dictated the notes, and Dr. Leach took them down—I checked to some extent the operations as they were described; if there was any doubt we discussed it as we went on—the general condition of the body was exceedingly well nourished—the heart was the first thing we came to; the size was normal, and was healthy; the muscular tissue was perhaps a trifle flabby; the lining membrane was deeply stained, and the blood in the heart was fluid; those conditions were abnormal, considering the length of time which had elapsed since the death—the fluid condition of the blood, and the excessive staining of the lining membrane, were not quite what one would have expected from health—I did not discover anything in the condition of the organs of the body to account for the death, except so far as the contents of the stomach were concerned—apart from the contents and the condition of the stomach there was nothing whatever in the state of the organs to account for death—I took out the stomach and the intestines</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050209"/>
               <p>—I heard Dr. Dudley's evidence just now; I concur in his account of the way in which the proceedings took place—I noticed with regard to the contents of the stomach that there was a small amount, about an ounce, of a dark brown fluid, with a few small lumps of solid matter in it, and it smelt very strongly of chloroform—the intestines also slightly smelt of chloroform; the smell was much more disguised because other things were mixed with it—I noticed what has been described as the dependent part of the stomach; there was an inflammatory blush over the whole of the cardiac end of the stomach, in the end described as the most dependent part, in area about an inch and a half in diameter—the mucous membrane was rather softer than the other parts, and a little roughened and irregular—it is difficult to give the exact size of the patch because it had faded off, it had no exact margin—the inch and a half in diameter was in the dependent part of the stomach, the part lowest down when a person is lying on his back—the appearance there showed that there was an inflammatory blush, and the mucous membrane was roughened, slightly softened, land a little worn away, thinned—that condition of things suggested the action of a mild irritant poison—where death results from causes other than poison that would not be a natural place to expect ulceration or inflammatory condition of that kind—when ulcera<lb/>tion occurs it usually occurs near the other end of the stomach, and at the upper rather than at the lower part, but not invariably so—probably that would be the part of the stomach through which its fluid contents would naturally gravitate if a person were tying on his back—if a man were lying on his face I should not expect it would gravitate to the same part—that kind of inflammation of the tissues could not take place after death had occurred; the inflammatory blush must have taken place while life continued—I should not be certain about the thinning of the portion of the tissue—the other must have been produced while in life I think—at the place I have mentioned, at the most dependent part, the mucous membrane was a little softer than natural; it could have been stripped off with the finger more easily—I think those signs taken together must have happened before death, but I am not prepared to say that any one of the others could not have been—leaving out the inflammatory blush, the softening and slight thinning, I do not think they were post-mortem, but I do not feel quite sure—I think they were more likely ante-mortem than post-mortem—supposing the appearances I saw were the result of swallowing chloroform, I am not able to form any opinion what period of time must have elapsed between the swallowing and the death, and to give time for these appearances to be caused—an hour certainly would be time enough; I could not give the limit of the smallest time—I mean an hour between the swallowing and the death would be sufficient to pro<lb/>duce the condition of the stomach—I mean an hour of life after swallow<lb/>ing—I cannot tell how much less it would be—I saw the stomach as late as last night; Dr. Stevenson showed it to me—I think I have nothing to add as the result of what I saw last night—I examined the gullet last night; the lower part of the gullet was in the same condition as the neigh<lb/>bouring part of the stomach; the part of the gullet next the stomach—that had an inflammatory blush just in the same way, and was a little roughened, I suppose the lower three inches or so of the gullet—that portion which comes nearer to the stomach, it adjoins on to it, opens into it—at the post-mortem I examined the lower jaw and found a patch</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050210"/>
               <p>where it was becoming necrosed—there was not anything serious or dan<lb/>gerous about that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I made the examination of the gullet and jaw at the post-mortem, and I saw them together again last night—all that indicated was that the irritant, whatever it was, had been taken through the gullet—speaking of the redness, that would show that at the time the liquid passed down the throat the body might have been erect—I should say it would show after it was taken for the greater portion of the time that life lasted, it was in that position—there are, I believe, extra<lb/>ordinary varieties with regard to the cause of death by liquid chloroform, both as to the quantity producing death, and also as to the survival after the dose, but I have no special knowledge myself upon that subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. Supposing the deceased was insensible, the administra<lb/>tion of chloroform would have to be done very gradually to pour it down the throat—it would take some little time to do it—you could not do it suddenly if the person was insensible—different methods might be employed; there might be a tube employed, but I could not say the time it would take—if the person was insensible a portion might be poured down gradually—it would necessarily leave some mark on the tongue; it need not last so long as 2 or 3 minutes—I do not think it would leave more marks in that way than if a person took it up and drank it up quickly—it must depend in some degree on the insensibility as to how long the operation must necessarily take of pouring down anything which would be a fatal dose of chloroform—I could not say definitely how long it would take—it would not be more than two or three minutes.</p>

If the insensibility was profound there would be no difficulty, that I can see, in pouring it down the throat—I know of no physical difficulty in doing it if the person down whose throat it was sought to pour it was in a state of insensibility.</p>

Swallowing is rather a muscular action; they would have to take some mechanical means to get it down, because the parts would collapse—there would have to be a tube—supposing there was a tube, the greater part would remain in the mouth, and some might trickle down inside the gullet—insensibility would prevent the swallowing—there might be an insensibility so profound that the person operated upon might swallow without resistance, and yet so little profound that the muscular action would not be paralysed—the touch of the liquid would excite the involuntary act of swallowing; it would apply to such a case as that, and to such a condition as that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. The test by which a medical man would be able to ascertain that the particular stage had been reached where reflex action of the muscles continued, but yet that there was insensibility which would prevent the burning, and so on, would be by the presence of reflex in other parts—he would test it by touching the eye, and there would be a closure of the eyelid; that would show that reflexes were present—he would separate the eyelids, and just touch the conjunctiva, the white membrane of the eye; then the lids would immediately contract, sup<lb/>posing reflex was not carried any further—if, on touching, the eyelids contracted, he would then know that there was some reflex action</p>

               <p>existing which might render the act of swallowing instinctive—he would know there was insensibility to pain by the reflex of the muscles, and by the abolition of the reflex—I mean sufficient abolition to perform an operation—the medical man would judge there was insensibility to pain from the laxity of the limbs, also from the relaxation of the muscles, and from the abolition of the reflex action—it would depend to some extent upon the nature of the operation whether the physician intending to do anything to the patient which would involve pain, and with the view to which the insensibility was to be produced, he would not do it until he found the reflex action had stopped—in some operations more profound insensibility has to be produced than in others—there are some cases in which chloroform is used in which it is not desired to produce complete anesthesia—there are some cases where it is desired to use it to deaden the pain; it is not desired to obtain a condition of absolute insensibility—in the class of cases in which it is not desired to produce complete anesthesia, only to deaden the pain, the physician has to exercise his own judgment as to whether the moment has come in which there is sufficient insensibility to produce anesthesia, yet not the entire abolition of the reflex action—some reflexes disappear before others; they do not all disappear at the same time—supposing anesthesia to be carried to the extent of destroying the sense of pain, the reflex action may then entirely disappear—it is a question one is familiar with, the loss of certain reflexes—one judges practically by this conjunctive reflex—one knows practically if that is gone the patient will not feel pain, and you judge also by the muscular relaxation—the physician judges by that test—I am not pre<lb/>pared to say that at that moment there is no reflex which can be obtained, I am not prepared to give an opinion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the Metropolitan Police Force—I am the Coroner's officer—on the 4th January the Coroner who held the inquest was Mr. Braxton Hicks, and in consequence of what he told me I went to No. 85, Claverton Street—I went there about half-past 9 at night—I went into the front room and found there four glass vessels—they were covered over with brown paper and string tied round them, and they were sealed—the seals were the initials of Dr. Dudley: J. G. D.—I took possession, at the same time, of 36 medicine bottles—some of them were in the front room; they were not corked—I corked them and sealed them up—I then placed the four glass vessels and the medicine bottles in two separate hampers and took them to the mortuary, that is, 20, Millbank Street—I there placed them in a large safe under cover in the back yard—there was no lock to the place—I put a tape across it and sealed it up—I sealed up the place where I had put these hampers—on the 9th January I went there and found the tape in the same condition—on the 11th I took the things away—on the 9th I had been to Claverton Street—I took with me a glass jar into the ante-room—Mr. Doggett, jun., who has been examined, gave me a tumbler—it appeared to contain Condy's Fluid—there was a small glass bottle; it was inverted in the tumbler, open, without any cork in it, with the mouth downwards—as I was moving it into the glass jar I took with</p>

               <p>detached and softened, giving a certain amount of roughness to the inner surface of the stomach—that appearance of inflammation extended to the gullet; round the patch of inflammation of which I have spoken the redness extended to a patch almost as large as my two hands, and so reached about three inches into the gullet—the inflammation was acute and recent, that is to say, it had commenced to run its course within a few hours of death—the position of the patch in the stomach was about the part to which liquid would flow when a person was lying on his back—it was the usual spot at which it is found after a person has swallowed irritant poison; that might have been occasioned by swallowing chloroform; I found no other probable cause for it—the presence of chloroform was an adequate cause, and no other cause existed so far as I could ascertain—I tested the contents of the stomach for the purpose of tracing every poison that could suggest itself to me, and found none—I found some trace of copper and lead in the gums—the gum was in No. 1—I found a small piece of necrosis—it is usual to find traces of copper in a healthy subject—there was not much copper and lead found—from one half of the gum and the whole of the son parts approximately the amount of copper and lead together was not more than one-eighth of a grain, which I do not think is a matter of any consequence worth dwelling upon—the presence of traces of lead and copper in the system is accounted for by the fact that breads and a vast number of vegetables, contain traces of copper, and through the using of copper utensils, and having articles of copper about the person—a piece of brass, the handling of brass or metals of various metallic alloys, these would find their way into the system so as to show traces; but the traces of lead and copper are, I think, mostly through the small quantity thereof taken in the food occasionally—lead is less commonly found than copper—it is a well-known substance, from leaden pipes containing drinking water, and things of that kind—they were only minute traces that I found, and I attribute no importance to them—they would not account for the death of a person—No. 6 was Condy's fluid—I found nothing in that—No. 7 was a broken tumbler and a jar—I found in the tumbler a little sulphate of magnesia, Epsom salts—the hamper contained 36 bottles—there were poisons, but only in medicinal doses—chloroform is not cumulative—in ordinary doses it will disappear from the system very quickly—the result of the analysis was the presence of chloroform in the contents of the stomach and the intestines—I did not analyze the stomach itself for chloroform, nor the blood, I had none—the deceased must have swallowed a large dose of chloroform, enough to produce serious inflammation of the stomach; and such a quantity would, I believe, be sufficient to cause death—I found nothing to suggest any other cause of death than chloroform—if chloroform is swallowed it sometimes produces a state of intoxication, but not always—it then pro<lb/>duces insensibility, stertorous breathing, or loud snoring breathing, muscular relaxation, paralysis, and death—the immediate effect is paralysis of the heart—it passes into the blood, and thence into every organ of the system—it produces fluidity of the blood after death, which remains fluid for a long time—if the contents of the stomach were put into an open jar, and remained some time before being put into a stoppered bottle, the chloroform would evaporate, but some would remain—the quantity would be diminished, but some might settle down</p>

               <p>to the bottom and be unobserved—I tested that, and found that they lost their smell very greatly in an hour, by exposure—the deceased died on January 1st, and the post-mortem was on the 2nd at 2 p.m., and my analysis began on the 13th—there would not have been an evapora<lb/>tion from the bottle in the interim, but there might be a dis<lb/>appearance of chloroform from the stomach while the body was lying before the post-mortem, what we call diffusion, but none from the closely stoppered bottle; I mean wherever the air was kept out—I do not think there would be any indication in the brain of chloroform swallowed, there might or might not be—I have frequently examined bodies where there has been no obvious smell of chloroform in the brain and no unusual appearance in the heart, and found nothing to indicate that death had occurred from chloroform, but these were cases of death from inhalation, not taken internally—even if from inhalation I should not necessarily expect to find it in the brain; my observation is that oftener than not you find nothing in the brain to indicate the cause of death, I mean short of analysis of the brain—I have analyzed and found traces, in cases of inhalation—it is difficult to say whether it passes more rapidly into the blood by inhalation than by swallowing; inhalation is the most rapid means of introducing gaseous poisons into the blood, but it would get there by other means—if swallowed I should expect to find it in the brain by analysis, but no obvious odor, there might or might not be—if a person accidentally took a dose of chloroform sufficient to cause death, being at the time in the possession of sensibility and faculties, he would at once perceive the peculiar character of the liquid he had swallowed; it would produce pain and a hot fiery taste—I do not think he could take a fatal dose of chloroform and suppose he was taking some innocent thing, it has not the taste of any article of food or drink—I have swallowed it, and I have had it in my mouth several times; it is very hot and very sweet and burning—you can put liquids down the throat of a person who is moderately under the influence of inhaled chloroform—assuming the liquid is in some such ordinary medicine bottle as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there would be no insuperable difficulty in putting it down the throat of a person in a state of insensibility—I have put liquid down the throat of a person while I have been chloroforming them by passing it to the back of their throat with a tea spoon—there would be no difficulty if a man was lying on his back with his mouth open—assuming that it could be put into his mouth, its presence there would occasion the act of swallowing, up to a certain point of insensibility—what we understand by reflexes would not be swallowing; that means that such a stimulant as chloroform at the back part would not excite muscular action, because the nervous centers which are concerned in swallowing would be paralyzed beyond a certain point; in other words, swallowing might be effected up to the point of paralysis—I tried the effect of chloroform in my mouth; it had a hot, burning, sweet sensation, quite transient, and after I ejected it it passed away, leaving a little numbness on my tongue, but not sufficient to prevent my going about my usual avocations, and there was a blush, a little redness, which passed off quickly—since the hearing before the Magistrate I have repeated an experiment which I had made before on a rabbit, to see whether chloroform passed into the Wood from the stomach—I introduced into its stomach by means of a</p>

               <p>tube, a quarter of a fluid ounce, or two teaspoonfuls of chloroform; the animal was upwards of two hours in a dying condition, and at the end of three hours it was nearly dead, but the blood was still circulating; I cut its throat, collected the blood which flowed, analysed it, and found that it contained traces of chloroform; you never get more than traces in the blood, but it was quite obvious—I also extracted the stomach, upon which the effect was acute inflammation, the mucous membrane softened and partly removed, so as to give it a roughened appearance, and blood was effused into its coats, and chloroform was obviously present in the stomach also—the animal rolled about at first as if intoxicated—I have seen one person under the influence of chloroform swallowed—the effect is chiefly sickness, pain, and the patient is very much alarmed—the case was many years ago, and I do not remember that it produced absolute insensibility; that was not a fatal dose—when swallowed, vomiting is a frequent accompaniment, but not always—I have seen a great number of persons under the influence of chloroform through inhalation—it is possible to produce insensibility by inhalation during sleep—I have never done it, but I know many instances in which it has been done, and I have no doubt whatever that it can be done if a person is soundly asleep, giving it with a bottle or handkerchief—the appearances in the stomach which I attribute to the action of chloroform must have been produced before death, the action is a vital action—these appearances might be produced in an hour or longer—I showed the bottle containing contents of the stomach to Dr. Tidy, and a small quantity which remained, and I showed Dr. Murray the stomach—if in the attempt to put chloro<lb/>form down the throat of a person in a state of insensibility or partial torpor, any of it fell on the chin, breast, or throat, there might be indica<lb/>tions of it, but it is unusual for momentary contact to produce any visible effect; there might be a temporary redness, which would pass away, as in the case which I was illustrating on myself.</p>

I have for many years given my atten<lb/>tion to subjects of this class, and have had large experience in the adminis<lb/>tration of chloroform at Guy's Hospital; I have also studied the results of the experience of other doctors—I have edited "The Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, by Dr. Alfred Swain Taylor," who is well known as one of the greatest authorities in that branch of medical science—I edited, reproduced, and corrected it, and I believe I called it the leading journal on the subject—it is fairly complete, I think—the last edition under my editorship appeared in 1883—chloroform has possibly been used in this country as an anesthetics for almost 40 years—Dr. Morphy used it in 1847, and from the very first its characteristics have been the subject of great interest to the medical profession; and as to inhalation, its effects have been carefully studied and recorded, but as to swallowing it, I don't think attention has been drawn to it much till last July—it is recognized as an important agent in medical science, and there is a good deal of literature about its application, but chiefly by inhalation—I cannot refer you to any recorded case of murder by the administra<lb/>tion of liquid chloroform, and I know of none—I am aware that there have been many murders by prussic acid, strychnine, and poisons of that class—the use of chloroform has been somewhat given up of late years, ether being substituted for it—chloroform will produce insensibility, but the time of insensibility and the amount, vary a good deal, but they have</p>

               <p>some relation to each other—we sometimes find that a very small dose inhaled proves suddenly fatal, while a very large dose taken into the stomach does not produce death—I think this book is taken almost entirely, textually, from previous editions of Dr. Taylor's book—I don't think I added any fresh question—though published in 1883 I cannot say whether any case since 1870 is quoted—I think there has been only one fatal case of swallowing chloroform in this country recorded within the last twenty years, but I know of one not recorded which happened in the practice of a gentleman in this Court; that was a case of accident—I know of one death besides that in this country from swallowing chloro<lb/>form by accident within the last twenty years; I cannot call to mind any others—there is in this <hi rend="italic">Medical Record</hi> of July 11, an American publica<lb/>tion, a table giving a record of known cases of swallowing chloroform up to July, 1885; I have since added some half-dozen—I think about 17 out of the 56 given in that list were fatal; about 31 per cent, of all the cases blown to me were fatal, 20 cases out of 65—this list is a collection of the cases occurring in different countries reported in books—I have verified some of them, and found them very fairly correct—in case 3 two mouthfuls were taken, death in 36 hours; case 4, a child of four years of age took from 1 to 2 dr., dead in three hours; case 7, 6 oz., dead in four hours; case 10, 1 1/2 oz., dead in 20 hours; case 13, a wine<lb/>glassful, that would be about 2 1/2 oz., dead in eight days; case 15, a man of 20, who tried to disembowel himself and shot himself in the chest, and so on; case 16, 1 1/2 oz., dead in 23 1/2 hours; case 23, 1 oz., dead in 12 hours, and that has a note that that was a case of supposed chloroform poisoning, where the Coroner's Jury were unable to come to a decision as to the immediate cause of death; case 24, 5 to 9 dr., dead in eight days; case 25, 2 oz., "Seen in one hour; a few minutes before his death in three minutes estimated time he could with difficulty be roused from stupor into which he was sinking, he indicated severe pain in his stomach, in five minutes lying still breath<lb/>ing stertorously"—case 27,2 oz., dead in 9 hours; case 29, 90 grammes, that is rather over 2 oz., dead in 29 1/2 hours; case 39, 1 oz., 60 hours; case 43, 1 1/2 oz., 26 1/2 hours; case 48, 50 to 60 grammes, a little over 1 1/2 oz., 31 hours; "Seen in 4 hours, artificial respiration"—that indicates that there is a very great uncertainty as to what the action will be when chloroform is swallowed—it would make a great difference in the length of life in these cases, whether means of restoration were attempted, many of them were treated unsuccessfully; the treatment although unsuccessful would prolong life—some of the cases lived a long time and died from acute inflammation of the stomach and not by the direct effect of chloroform by producing paralysis of the heart—I have only had experience of one case of chloroform swallowing, that was probably 25 years ago—that was not a fatal case—swallowing brings a local irritant to act on the stomach—after inhalation you will not always observe the great fluidity of the blood, and one thing that follows that, and that is the post-mortem staining of the lining membrane of the heart—I don't think the condition of the internal coats of the stomach which I saw would be dependent on his condition previous to death, I mean the post-morten or pathological appearances—I don't think those appearances would be more obvious following on the taking of liquid chloroform by a man who had been recently suffering from acute or</p>

(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here read a passage from "Taylor on Poisons," page</hi> 649)—during the first stage, when the patient becomes excited, the passing of a quantity of chloroform over the lips and tongue and down the throat would cause severe pain and would be resented and would rouse the patient to resistance—I don't agree that that state of excite<lb/>ment would be necessary if a person were asleep—Dolbo, from his experience, says that three out of four persons awoke—the American autherity attempted it with six persons, who all awoke. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I have taken the case given by Dr. Tidy of the children being dealt with while asleep in the hospital, and I have read you the letter in which Dr. Dobson practically agrees with Dolbo? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He says he avoided excitement by giving it during sleep—supposing the first stage of excitement to occur, if you put the liquid in the mouth the pain of administering the poison would be felt, and would be resented, and that would awake a person up—in the second stage he talks incoherently and sensibility is diminished, he is intoxicated but still capable of feeling pain, though to a less extent—in the third stage he is unconscious, but the muscles are rigid; in administering chloroform by inhalation at that third stage there is very often a good dual of rigidity in the limbs generally, so that at that stage it would probably require force to open the mouth; and in the fourth stage, when that rigidity passes away, the muscles become completely relaxed and the patient is perfectly insensible, ready for operation, and at that stage there is no capacity for swallowing at all—a patient on the operating table will con<lb/>tinue to swallow when completely anesthetized—it is altogether a question of degree when the patient will cease to swallow—any liquid put at the back of the throat the patient will continue to swallow, he will swallow his own saliva for some time, by muscular action—when blood flows into the back of the throat it is swallowed, unless he is under chloroform very profoundly, when he ceases to swallow and becomes suffocated—there are cases of inhalation where the patient ceases to swallow—one of the dangers where an operation is performed and blood gets to the back of the throat is that blood will get into the air passages—he may get into such a state that he cannot swallow—there is a particular point in the process of chloroforming at which the patient will be able to swallow, although he is sufficiently under the influence of chloroform not to suffer from the pain. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me how you yourself ascertained when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050221"/>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Chloroform is very volatile—assuming it to have been taken into the mouth, and so to have gone down into the stomach, I would not expect to find necessarily any smell of it in the mouth—if the mouth were open the smell might disappear even within half an hour—I should expect that the effect of a dose of chloroform swallowed and taken into the stomach would be greater upon a person taking it if that person were rendered insensible or partially insensible by inhalation first, in the direction of causing paralysis of the action of the heart for instance—it would be a very delicate operation setting chloroform into the stomach of a person who was lying back and insensible or partially insensible; it would require to be delicately done in order to prevent its getting into the windpipe instead of the throat; with a person unskilled in the anatomy of the part some would be very likely to get down the windpipe instead of down the gullet—as a consequence of having taken chloroform the post-mortem appearances are sometimes these of asphyxia—chloroform would cause death in one way by producing asphyxia, and thus paralyzing the muscles of respiration, or else by paralyzing the muscles of the heart—the post-mortem symptoms are not quite the same in the two cases, but one thing with asphyxia need not be necessary, that there should be paralysis of the muscles of respiration; it really is suffocation—if the particular form which the mischief takes is suffocation.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050222"/>
               <p>I would expect to see on the post-mortem the signs of suffocation, and if the mischief results from paralysis of the heart I would not expect to see signs of suffocation—it sometimes happens that when persons are voluntarily drinking any liquid some of it may get down the windpipe or approach the windpipe, but that is a rare incident—I admit that, as Mr. Dolbean says, it is possible to render a person who sleeps sufficiently insensible by chloroform for that person to become the subject of a criminal attempt, and in certain cases the production of insensibility would be comparatively easily effected—there may be found traces of chloroform in the urine of a person who has died from an overdose; it would not be visible to the eye, and it is a little undetermined whether it is due to the presence of chloroform itself or to the chloroform producing some other substance in the urine—I had no portion of the urine furnished to me for analysis—the appearance of the urine would not suggest any change.</p>

In one stage of chloroformism the jaws are rigid, or partially so, but the stages are purely arbitrary—an unskilled person must, generally speaking, take some little time to administer a sufficient quantity of chloroform down the throat to cause death; he must do it gradually for fear of choking, but in some cases I do not think it would be very difficult to do it quickly, it simply depends upon the act of swallowing—the chances are that some portion of the chloroform would remain in the mouth for a short time if the person were unable to swallow; it would be likely to remain at the back of the throat—it would then show some signs of its having been there in the gums or throat, in the (same way as it would if it lay in the intestines—if he were able to swallow easily it would be effected almost momentarily, in the same way as water—if a person could not swallow quickly it would remain at the upper part of the windpipe, and upon the post-mortem I should expect to find the effects of contact there, irritation or inflam<lb/>mation, but if taken suddenly I should not expect to find such traces.</p>

In giving chloroform by inhalation, at a certain period and before the patient is altogether unconscious, there is often consider<lb/>able general muscular rigidity; the arms would In rigid, and the patient would grind the teeth or clench the jaw—I have never seen chloroform administered during sleep; I should not expect the result to be the same—the period of rigidity may be a few seconds or a minute; if the patient is insensible it speedily passes off—I should think that in a case where there is unusual difficulty in putting a patient under the influence of nitrous oxide there would be the same difficulty in effectually administering chloroform; the difficulty in the one case would lead me to expect a difficulty in the other, but that is a pure matter of inference, I cannot say much about it, but generally speaking if a person is insensible to one anesthetic he would be likely to be less sensible to another.</p>

I am Master in Surgery, Professor of Chemistry and Forensic Medicine at the London Hospital, and one of the official analysts to the Home Office—I am one of the authors of "Woodman and Tidy's Forensic Medicine and Toxicology," quoted yesterday by Mr. Clarke—I have had considerable experience in matters of this description, and have of my own knowledge known of a death from taking liquid chloroform—that was in 1863—it was referred to me by</p>

               <p>Dr. Lancaster, who was Coroner at the time—so far as we could judge, the fatal dose was 1 1/2 ounces, but I am bound to say that the details are not very clear, for the case was one of suicide, but the fact of chloro<lb/>form being taken was beyond all question—an ordinary sherry glass will hold 2 or 2 1/2 ounces—measured by the tablespoon marked on a drop-glass a table-spoon is half an ounce—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a one ounce bottle—in death from taking chloroform I should expect to find traces of it in the stomach, and some of the actual chloroform, and in that case it was obtained with great ease, but the total quantity was not determined; there was no necessity to do so—I am referring to the case in 1863, which I saw with Dr. Woodman, but that was a case of recovery—there were considerable inflammatory symptoms in the stomach at the part which the chloroform would come in contact with—I have no note, but no doubt if the chloroform was sufficiently long in contact with the esophagus or gullet it would affect it, but if the contact with the tissues was of very short duration, I am of opinion that no abnormal appearances would be apparent—I put a teaspoonful of pure chloroform in my mouth, and held it there for five or six seconds, and then spat it out, and simply washed my mouth out with a little water, and there was a slight redness pro<lb/>duced, but it certainly did not last longer than a few minutes, although a certain numbness continued for nearly an hour, and therefore the effect of chloroform upon animal tissues I am dear will be greatly dependent on the length of contact—when liquid chloroform is taken into the stomach it passes into the blood; its diffusibility is very great, and if taken in sufficient quantity to cause death I should expect to find traces of it in the intestines, if a sufficient period had elapsed between taking it and the death, but not so much as of its passage through the membranes—in a death so caused I should expect to find on a post-mortem examination fluidity of the blood—on Saturday, the 20th March, Dr. Stephenson showed me some of the contents of the stomach, bottle No. 5—his description of the smell as overpoweringly strong of chloroform is exactly as I should describe it myself on that date—there can be no shadow of a doubt about it—if chloroform was inhaled and then taken in a liquid state I think it would have greater effect than if taken by a person who had not previously inhaled it, but that is matter of opinion; I have no experiment to show, and I cannot put it much higher than speculation—I think it is quite consistent with facts that there should be no smell of chloroform in the mouth two or three hours after taking liquid chloro<lb/>form—it is very volatile indeed, and if the mouth was open after death that would sufficiently account for it—as to the skin, if chloroform was spilt on the face and not covered, I should not expect to find any marks left—I dropped some on my hand last night, and there is no sign left—there was a slight redness produced at the time, but it was very transient, and I cannot now determine where it was, though I found the spot half an hour afterwards; but it may leave very definite marks—if you drop chloroform on your skin, and place a pad over it, it will produce a burn—in giving chloro<lb/>form by inhalation I have noticed a rigidity of the jaw, and I have heard of and seen cases where there has been none, but it usually occurs, and it is for a very variable period—partial insensibility can be produced by the inhala<lb/>tion of chloroform during sleep, and then at a certain stage liquid chloro<lb/>form could be administered—I should like to state what I have done in the case of a boy between 15 and 16, who had dislocation of his arm; it</p>

               <p>was necessary to give him chloroform in order to reduce it; he went to sleep; we administered chloroform to him while he was asleep with great ease, and it is right that I should say that I have tried it in two cases since—one was I think a satisfactory case; the person was fairly well asleep, and in the other case the man was not very well asleep, dozing, and it is right to say I failed in both cases—in the case I had in my own experience it was an adult man—I have got a note in 1867, but there is a difficulty between 1863 and 1869—the 1863 case was Dr. Lancaster's; an adult.</p>

I succeeded in the case of the boy, and failed in the other, as the person was not in a good sleep—these are the only experiments I have had the opportunity of making—in the case of the boy, where chloroform was administered, the surgeon was there who was going to reduce it, and I administered it—I have had very long experience of chloroform—the 1863 case was a suicide, and so it was not necessary to make detailed notes; the Jury wanted the analysis to be made to detect the chloroform, and I did not go very fully into it—the great majority of cases reported are cases of suicide—two were by swallowing chloroform—the majority of cases of inhalation are ex<lb/>ceptional—of course there might be positive evidence in a case, but apart from the evidence of facts, the enormous probability of evidence would be in favour of suicide, I should say—with regard to rigidity, it may last only for a very short time, a few seconds; and it may last longer—I should not like to say it would last four or five minutes—the symptoms from the inhalation of chloroform are very variable indeed—a person may be chloroformed in two minutes, or it may take a considerable time, while the quantity required to induce the effects varies also—it is not a ques<lb/>tion of time only, but of quantity—in administering chloroform we are guided by the appearance of the patient with regard to the quantity to be administered—it is the real difficulty in administering chloroform that you cannot lay down any law which applies to everybody; and therefore in all the stages we must exercise a careful judgment; and that is the reason that there are professors of chloroform who devote themselves to the practice.</p>

Nothing is said in it about the capital to be provided by each—I bought the stock with my own money, because the defendant was sole manager—I will swear that every penny piece that was put into that business was put in by me—I put in over 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the shape of fixtures and stock—I got the money from Mr. Cunha and Mr. Hartop—I have not got the bankers' book here, but I have produced it before and can again, if you wish it—I have receipts to show that I purchased the stock of the Old Yorkshire—I have been subpoenaed here, but not to produce any books—I sent to the Ben Jonson for the wine, which I handed to the official of the Bankruptcy Court in the beginning of September, not later—I gave it up because I was told by my solicitor that according to the new Bankruptcy Act it was an undue preference to give it to one creditor—Mr. Cunha was a creditor—I never took it to the Yorkshire, I removed it direct to my establishment in Winchester Buildings—I do not owe rent there—the landlord had asked me for the rent and I had not paid it—600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to the defendant when we dissolved partnership on 8th September—I was manager to Cunha and Nephew—he has gone to Madeira because one of his partners died—they are general wine merchants—some of the stock belonged to them and some to the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All the wines which I read out, the defendant gave his acceptance to Cunha and Nephew for—I was then manager—since then Mr. Cunha has gone to Madeira and I have taken the business—I pressed the defendant to pay, and when my solicitor said it was an undue preference I volunteered to give them up to the Receiver in Bankruptcy—the defendant has not paid one penny in the Yorkshire—I was not supposed to produce documents—I have got documents to prove what I say—I have seen in the Ben Jonson and the Falcon—I have heard Mr. Solomon's evidence as to the value of the stock; it is a downright false<lb/>hood.</p>

I am a carman to my father—he has a wharf at Dock Street, Deptford, called Fitzgerald's Yard—I saw Cantlin the morning of the day he was locked up, about 6 o'clock, in the yard—he came for work—he had worked for us before—he had been in the yard since 4 o'clock—the morning after his mother came to me and spoke to me—then I went to the solicitor, and afterwards to the police-court.</p>

I am a collector of gas accounts for the Richmond Gas Company—I was collecting accounts on 22nd February at Ham—I had called at the Vicarage about 10 minutes to 5—I went towards Mr. Fields by the side of the Common—I walked across the grass that borders the road—I heard footsteps, and then a remark, "Governor, give me some money"—I replied, "I have no money to give you, my man; if I had I would do so"—I received a blow on my right cheek, and was thrown—as I fell I received a kick or hit straight in the nape of my neck—I became unconscious—when I recovered I found myself in a ditch about 3 1/2 yards off—I made the best of my way to the New Inn public-house—I missed 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold from my right-hand trousers pocket—I kept gold in one pocket, silver in another, and coppers in another—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 5 cheques, silver and coppers, which were not taken—I found my trousers slit down and the pocket cut right out—the pocket was made of a sort of chamois leather—those are the trousers produced—I observed the man for a very short time—it was daylight—I gave a description to the police—on 6th March I was with Sergeant Bush—we went into the Crooked Billet about 2 p.m.—we played at bagatelle together—I went in the bar for drink—I saw Police-constable Fry and the prisoner—directly the prisoner saw me he walked out quickly to the back yard—I made a communication to Fry—I believe he was the man who knocked me down—the prisoner was taken into custody—I went back to the spot where the assault took place—Mr. Hill, a baker, drove me to it, and Fry walked across the Common—the man who attacked me had two or three days' growth of beard—it was a little grizzly—he was dressed as the prisoner was when arrested at the Crooked Billet—I did not notice his trowsers—I only recognised him by his face—I saw these other trousers produced at the Kingston Police-court—I could not say whether the prisoner wore them.</p>

               <p>and on the left—the prisoner changed his trousers after my seeing Him at the Crooked Billet—I was perfectly sober when I was with Bush and Fry—we went to the spot the same night—it was getting dusk—I pointed out the place where I had been robbed as near as possible—the prisoner came back into the Crooked Billet after going out at the back—he had not got outside the door before I said he was the man who knocked me down—I did not say I believed it was a man named Howell who robbed me—the chairman of the Gas Company told me, as my wife was ill, I had better have a holiday; therefore I had been suspended by the Gas Company—I do not know whether that is pending this inquiry.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 302). I am stationed at West Ham—on 22nd February, about 5.30, the prosecutor made a communication to me—he was rather excited—his trousers were cut at the top—I went to the spot the prosecutor indicated, and observed the ground—he made a statement to me there—on 6th March I was drinking with the prisoner in the Crooked Billet—the prosecutor came in the bar—he asked me if I would have anything to drink—I said, "No, thank you, I have got some"—the prisoner walked past the prosecutor into the back yard, when Sullivan made a communication to me—the prisoner paid for a portion of the drink—I have known him seven years—I spoke to the prosecutor when the prisoner was gone out—I went into the room where Bush and Sullivan were—Sullivan still insisted that that was the man—the prisoner had gone out—I went to the Ham Brewery, and told the prisoner that Sullivan accused him of knocking him down and robbing him—the prisoner had changed his clothes—directly after he was accused he went home—I waited for him, and he "went to Richmond Police-station with me after he had changed his clothes—these are the trowsers he had on before he changed his clothes—he had them on at the Crooked Billet—he said his clothes were dirty, and he did not want to go to Richmond Police-station in them—the prosecutor appeared at the police-station, and formally charged the prisoner with having robbed him—the prisoner had an opportunity of reply—he did not reply—the prosecutor was sober when he made the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say the prosecutor's excitement was due to drink—at the Brewery the prisoner, when told he was accused of the robbery, said "Never"—after he was charged he said, "I shall be able to show I was at Claridge's on that evening"—I have known him seven years as a blacksmith; I know nothing against him—he was in his working dress at the Crooked Billet—the prosecutor gave a rather rambling description, which I could not make anything of—he said the prisoner had brown trousers; these produced are not brown—I did not see the slightest sign of a scuffle on 22nd February at the spot where the robbery is said to have occurred; it was an open space on the grass; the ground was soft, and you would expect to find marks—there is a urinal in the yard at the Crooked Billet—the prisoner was outside the first door leading to the passage when the prosecutor spoke to me about him—the prisoner could have gained the road and got away from the back yard—he came back and finished his beer on the counter.</p>

On Saturday, 6th March, I was at the Crooked Billet about 2 p.m. with the prosecutor—the prisoner came into the parlour after a conversation had passed between myself and the prosecutor—the prisoner said, "Good afternoon, Mr. Bush"—he went out, then the prosecutor spoke to me—I went outside and saw the prisoner with Fry—I said to the prisoner, "Fry has told you what Sullivan said?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, we shall be able to clear that up, Mr. Bush"—I said, "The best thing is to go with us to Richmond Police-station, and perhaps the matter can be cleared up there"—he said, "I should like to have a wash before going up, I do not know what people will think"—I said "Very good," and he went and washed, and walked with us to Richmond Police-station—he was there charged by Sullivan—when the prosecutor complained of being robbed he gave me a description of the man who robbed him; I took it down in writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The description was, "A man, age about 26, height 5 feet 3 or 4 inches, beard and whiskers sandy, of recent growth, dirty face, dressed in dark brown trousers, black morning coat, hard felt hat, blocked; can be identified"—when he gave me that description he was a little confused—this was about 6.30, the evening of the occurrence—at Richmond Police-station he seemed very much upset—I did not go to the spot that night; it was three and a half miles off, and it was dark when I saw him at the station—on the morning we went to Ham the prosecutor said he had an idea it was a man named Holmes—the prisoner is some-what of the description given—it did not occur to me to apply to him till the prosecutor spoke to me about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, and practise at Lee, in Kent—I saw the body of a female child on Sunday, 24th January, at the Railway Hotel at Penshurst, and found that it was a fully-developed child and well nourished—externally it was very dirty, it had not been attended to since its birth—the umbilical cord had been severed about an inch and a half from the child by a clean cut—I also observed externally, about an inch above the right eyebrow, a slight bruise, which was filled with a clot, and the rim of the right ear was lacerated, but very slightly—beneath the left ear there were, two parallel wounds, the upper one an inch and a quarter beneath the ear, and one inch from it; that was superficial, simply cutting through the skin, it was a cut—the wound beneath that was of a severe nature, one inch and a quarter in length, and forked in appearance; it branched, and the fork looked outwards, away from the chin—that wound cut through the skin and muscles and chief blood-vessels, down to the bone, it divided the carotid artery, and caused the child's death—in my opinion that was the cause of death—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050255"/>
               <p>there was evidence of it having bled considerably, the wound itself was full of blood, and there was blood outside the wound, which was slightly gaping—on examination internally I found that the lungs had been breathed through—the rest of the organs were healthy as far as I could see—I cannot say from looking at the blood that I found in the wound and outside, whether the-wound had been inflicted after the child had breathed or before, probably after—looking at the condition of the lungs I can only say that the child had breathed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The child would begin to breathe as soon as the head appeared—I do not think the wound could have been inflicted before, but the child may not have breathed for a minute after it was born—I cannot say when the child commenced to breathe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. The lungs were fully inflated—I think the wound must have been inflicted with a sharp-cutting instrument, a table knife would do it—some degree of violence would be necessary to inflict it—as to the power required, an effort of 12 would be necessary, I think, and the point of the knife would have to be sharp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The child might live half a minute after the wound in the neck, which severed the carotid, not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my experience there are often cases of violence being inflicted on a child before it is fully born, and therefore it comes into the world dead; it may be born dead from violence, accidental or in<lb/>tentional—the lungs being what is called crepitant simply shows that the child has breathed, but not that it has had an independent circulation—I put the lungs in water—I admit that that is no certain sign of itself—I know no cause but disease for the lungs of children who have not breathed floating on water; I mean what is called putrefaction—the fact of the child having the power of breathing before it is entirely born does not render these tests certain—I believe it is not very common for a child to breathe and yet never to live in the sense of that term—it does happen that a child breathes and yet does not get an independent circulation—the mere act of gasping in the act of being born would help to inflate the lungs—there was blood in the <hi rend="italic">conium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">venix casieva</hi>; that does not necessarily prove that the child was born alive—I do not know that in cases where a woman delivers herself, the chances of a child coming into the world alive are not so great as when a medical man attends her; the operation is nature's own effort, but there might be a slight difference in cutting the umbilical cord, which in this instance was severed an inch and a half from the child; that would be the place where a medical man would sever it—it was not tied at all, and death might possibly have been caused by bleeding from it—I considered the severance properly near to the abdomen—by what is known as an independent circulation I wish the Jury to understand that that means when no blood is flowing from the mother to the child—I cannot positively state, as a medical man, that this child ever had a separate existence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> here was no evidence, on my examination of the child, of its having bled to death from the umbilical cord—there was no disease or putrefaction of the lungs to account for crepitation; there was nothing but the child having breathed to account for it—the child contained very little blood, but I never saw what quantity of blood came from it—of course I cannot say where the blood which was upon the body came from,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188604050256"/>
               <p>but I can say that a large quantity of blood had flowed from the wound—I am not enabled to form an opinion that because a large quantity of blood had flowed from the wound, the child had had an independent cir<lb/>culation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The independent circulation begins directly the cord is tied, when the blood does not flow from the mother to the child—if the child's throat was cut before the cord was tied the mother might bleed to death as well as the child, that is to say if the connection remained.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. An independent circulation is generally set up in the child in consequence of its breathing, before it is severed from the mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. When the cord is tied it sets up the action of making the child breathe; it breathes of itself, but it does not necessarily follow that the child has breathed of itself when the cord is tied, it may never breathe at all—the independent circulation becomes established at the birth—the fact of breathing generally speaking, establishes the circula<lb/>tion—supposing a wound to be inflicted on a child in the act of being born, I should expect about the same flow of blood from the wound as if it had been done after it had breathed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WARBURTON</hi>. With regard to the question of independent circulation, the blood would cease to flow either from the tying of the cord or from its being cut; there could be no independent, circulation till one of those things was done; the cord might not be cut for two or three hours—the breathing and the independent circulation generally act together—it is almost impossible to define when the breathing would commence.</p>

I live at 25, Commercial Street, Commercial Road, E.—on Saturday night, about 20 minutes to 7, I was walking along Lancaster Street, and as I was crossing from Southwood Street, the taller prisoner gave me two blows in the neck and knocked me down, and as I was getting up, Frederick Price took my watch and chain from me—I drew this rule out of my pocket to strike him, and he gave them to me back, and they both made off—I went up the street and saw two friends home with whom I was with, and then saw two little boys, and in consequence of what they said, I went to 4, St. George's Court, London Market—I took a constable with me—he knocked a <hi rend="italic">rat-tat</hi> at the door—one of the prisoners came up and then went back again—the constable then walked upstairs—I went with him—he knocked at the front-room door, but no one answered, and we walked in and saw the two prisoners there—the constable asked me whether I recognised anyone there, and I turned to the small one and said, "Put on your clothes"—he was in his shirt-sleeves—he didn't do so, and I called on the policeman to make him, which he did, and I then said, "I shall charge him with stealing my watch and knocking me down," and gave them in charge—I have had abscesses in my throat ever since the blow, and have had to attend St. Thomas's Hospital—there is a hoarseness in the throat now—the value of my watch was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
