On the 7th of December last, the prisoner was brought to our workhouse from Shadwell police office; he remained with us until the night of the 10th, and on the night of the 10th he was locked up in a room adjoining the oakum room. On that night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, after I was gone to bed, I heard a noise; it continued louder and louder. I was alarmed. I got up, fearing for the safety of the people in the house. I called up Burn; Burn and me went to the door of the oakum room. I then found the prisoner in the oakum room, and the door was fastened on the inside. When I went to bed it was fastened on the outside. We called to the prisoner; he never spoke. We broke the door open; I saw the prisoner; he was standing forward, with an axe lifted up. Burn attempted to lay hold of the prisoner by the collar; in the mean time I rushed forward to catch the axe. He shifted the axe; he struck me a blow with the back of the axe; it stunned me completely. I was so stunned I do not know how I got the other blow.</p>
               <p>Q. When you recovered yourself in what state did you find your face - A. I had a deep cut at the side of my nose; my nostril was cut quite round, and my lip was cut at the bottom; I believe it was done with the front of the axe. One of my teeth was knocked out, and there is another tooth coming out now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known this man - A. About a fortnight before that he was brought to us from the police office; he was with us three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of your observations upon him do you believe him to be a man in his senses, or not - A. I now believe him to be an insane man.</p>

When I went from home at four o'clock in the afternoon I left my wife at home, and when I came home the two officers shewed me the knife taken from out of my window; it had the appearance of being mine. I do not know what number of knives I had in my window, and they shewed me another knife that they had broke the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the window been broken - A. Yes; the pane of glass had been broken at the bottom by a knife.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 31st of January last, I was on duty, in company with Gleed, another officer. In going down Shoreditch we observed three boys standing at Mr. Stotter's window. We heard something crack, and the three boys ran away. This was about half after six; it was dark; the snow was on the ground. We observed a lady come from another room into the shop, and take the light out of the shop window, and put it in again; she then went back into the back room again. We waited about three minutes, and the boys returned. Fowler put his fingers into the inside of the window, and laid hold of something; I do not know exactly what it was; he dropped what he had in his fingers as soon as we laid hold of him; he dropped something by the window that he had got in his hand. Woolfe was then standing close to him as possible. We took the two prisoners into Mr. Stotter's shop; the other boy ran away. Mr. Andrade brought me this knife, saying, it was given to him by a gentleman at the next door, at his house, by Mr. Knighton. On searching the prisoner Fowler we found another knife; we compared this knife to the frame of the window where the glass had been broken; it fitted the marks in the frame where the glass had been broken, and the mark in the putty. The glass was broken in four or five pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he get his hand in - A. I do not think the hole in the glass was big enough to admit his hand; his fingers were in. I produce some of the pieces of glass, with the putty sticking to it. I asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing; she said she could not tell, but such knives as that were in the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Armstrong. I saw Fowler with his fingers in the window. I catched hold of Fowler, and then something dropped. I did not see what it was, Armstrong catched hold of the other. We took them into Mr. Stotter's shop. They were both close together. We asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing. She said she did not know exactly what was in the window. After that, Mr. Andrade came in with this knife. This is the knife that was in Fowler's possession; it fitted the marks in the putty and in the wood. Mrs. Stotter saw us fit the knife to the place. We took the two prisoners into Mr. Stotter's shop. I catched hold of Fowler, and something dropped; I could not see what it was Armstrong catched hold of the other. We asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing; she said she did not exactly know what was in the window. After that, Mr. Andrade came in with this knife, and this is the knife that was in Fowler's pocket; it fitted the place between the putty and the wood. Mr. Stotter saw us fit the knife to it. The little boy ran away. The two prisoners were standing as close together as possibly they could.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that knife - A. I cannot swear to it. I had a number of knives like this laying at the bottom of the window close to the glass where it was broken.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is Elbow-place from Aylesbury-street - A. About half a mile; he had the appearance as if coming from some place at a distance; he was walking quickly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAYHEW. I am a conductor of patrols. I was present when the prisoner was stopped; it being dark I took him into a public-house. Before I opened the bundle the prisoner had, I said, what does this bundle consist of; he said, my own wearing apparel; it consisted of shirts, stockings, and handkerchiefs. I asked him where he lodged; he said just by. It was a remarkable cold night; he was all in perspiration. I produce the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Hartley Smith - A. Yes, he lived in our house four days. I took him in, and gave him some employment. He came to live with me on the 14th of August; he left me on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any watches from your shop - A. I went out of town on the 17th of August; I returned in about a week; the prisoner was gone then. I had a letter sent me that he absconded on the 19th with four watches, and when I returned I missed four watches that I had left in my shop when I went away. They were silver watches, worth about three guineas each.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your family consist of - A. A housekeeper I left behind me and a son; he is gone to sea now; he was at home then. The housekeeper is here. The watches were pledged, and the tickets sent home in a letter on the 19th. The officer has the watches; he happened to be in the shop at the time the letter came in. The officer has got the property. I took the prisoner in out of charity. I did not expect he would have robbed me. I had no suspicion of the man. I had seen him twice before I employed him.</p>
               <p>SARAH UNDERHILL. I am housekeeper to Mr. Winter. On the 14th of August, the prisoner came to our shop to work; he continued to work there until the 19th. Between the hours of seven and eight he came to work on the 19th. I gave the prisoner the watches to hang up. I had the care of the watches, and took them down and hung them up, but being busy I gave them to the prisoner on the 19th to hang them up, about eight o'clock in the morning. There were a great many more watches. Them four were taken down of a night and put into a glass case. I took them into my bed-room of a night. I gave them to him about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw him hang them up. I was in a room adjoining. After he had hung the watches up he went out to breakfast; about ten o'clock he came back; he said he had heard of a situation for

He stopped at work until one o'clock, and then he went out to dinner. He never returned. On the Saturday week I saw him at the police office. About two o'clock Mr. Winter's son came home; I said to him, William is not come back yet. The prisoner had hung up watch-cases in the places where the watches had been. I did not miss the watches until Robert came home; he missed the watches, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160006"/>then I missed them. He said he had robbed him; I went to see, and I saw the watches were gone.</p>

               <p>JOHN BUTLER. I am an officer of Shadwell office. The prisoner was given into my charge on the 5th of this month, at New Prison. He was first taken to Hatton Garden office.

             I believe this to be the watch; it has been out of my possession ten days. I cannot possibly swear to it. It is remarkable in the dial plate. I believe it to be the same watch; it has the same name as is upon the ticket. It was pledged for thirty shillings; the value of the watch is about three guineas. I believe the prisoner pledged it. He had the appearance of a gentleman; he was dressed very different to what he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these four watches - A. They are all my property; three of them I made myself. I left them in my shop when I left town. My son took an inventory of all that was in my shop in my presence. I was close by him at the time; the prisoner was close by also.</p>

            . Do you know the watches - A. Yes, two of them; they are Mr. Winter's property. I saw the watches when I gave them the prisoner to hang up in the morning; they were missed about half past two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the absence of Mr. Winter, my master, before I left him I heard of a situation at Uxbridge that would suit me a great deal better than his, accordingly, as I had a few shillings in my pocket I went, and when I went I had come too soon by a fortnight, and as I had left my master without any warning I did not return. I went to my father. I came up to town about a fortnight since, when I was taken into custody. I never pawned any of these watches.</p>

I had shut the front door before I sat down. I happened to turn my head over my shoulder; I perceived my shop door open, and the candles flaring. I proceeded to the parlour door; I saw a man laying down upon his hands and knees. I did not hurry; I thought it was one of my own men getting bread for his tea. The person run out, and I after him. I caught him. When I brought the prisoner in I looked how the till was. When I went in the parlour I left the till close shut. I had just served a customer before I sat down to tea. I caught the prisoner about two doors off.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him was he near the till - A. He was laying on his hands and knees; he was taking the till. I heard the till rattle when he went out. When I came in the till was hanging by the two bind quarters. My man was at the door; he heard me run out of the shop; he came up out of the kitchen, and stood at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the till - A. Yes, two pounds fifteen shillings in penny pieces and halfpence, and a good many farthings. They are here. I have had the custody of them ever since. When I went to the office I could not say what precise sum was in the till. My wife had taken some halfpence out and put some more in. That is the precise sum when I came back. When I took the prisoner he asked me what I wanted of him; I said, if you come in the shop I will tell you. He said, you are mistaken, I am not the man. I am sure I am not mistaken; I never lost sight of him. He tried to get away; I tore his shirt and waistcoat; I took him to Worship-street office.</p>

            . I live within four or five doors of the prosecutor. The prosecutor sent his man to me to know where to get a constable. I went to see what was the matter. When I got there he had just got the prisoner into the shop. I asked the prisoner what was the matter; he said, Mr. Shands had dragged him into the shop; he did not know for why. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160007"/>asked him, what he was, and who he was. He said, he was a calenderer. he worked for Mr. Fisher, in Hill-street. I told him I knew Mr. Fisher, and if he was an honest man Mr. Fisher would come and give that character. Before I went out, one of Mr. Fisher's young men came in; he said, he does not work at our house, nor had not for two years past. He said nothing to that, but declared his innocence, and that he never was taken before a magistrate, and when he was taken to the office the officers knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Hill-street, and passing by the prosecutor's shop I saw a young man outside of the door; he looked like a butcher. The prosecutor told a gentleman he saw a young man run out of the shop and go across the road; I said if I knew where the young man was I would find him. I did not know where he was.</p>

On Saturday the 29th of January, about three in the afternoon, I perceived these two pieces of print taken down from where I put them in the morning. I perceived the two prisoners walking up and down before the house, and I saw these two pieces of print taken off the line where they were put in the morning by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the linen - A. Inside of the shop. They were hanging up inside of the shop. I cannot say who took them down. When I perceived them taken down I went into one corner of the shop and watched, having suspicion. I watched the prisoners walking up and down at one corner of the shop; after the prints were taken down I watched there for a quarter of an hour, and when they had an opportunity the prisoner Roke came in and put one of them on the top of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Roke entered the shop, did he - A. Yes, and put one of the prints on the other; he clapped his apron over them.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an apron on then - A. Yes, he was in the act of taking them away; somebody came past at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he moved them from where they were - A. Yes; he had taken them down from where I put them. Somebody coming past at the time, Thatcher gave him a signal to be off. Thatcher was waiting outside at the door at the time; somebody came by; he gave him a signal to run off. I pursued him; both run off contrary ways. I pursued, and took the prisoner Roke;

            . I was in the shop; as soon as I was disengaged the other witness came up, and told me that the prints were not in the same state as he put them in the morning; that he had seen the prisoners walk by the shop several times. I then went and watched as well as him. I observed the prisoners walk by the shop twice; the third time the prisoner Roke stepped into the shop; he took one piece of print up from a box; he put it on the other; he put his apron over it, and as he was going to take it away the other prisoner gave him a signal that somebody was coming.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the signal - A. He touched him, which I understood to be a signal; then he dropped the print out of his apron, and run away. One of the pieces of print cost Mr. Hughes two shillings and four pence a yard, and the other one shilling and ten pence. They are forty-eight yards; twenty-four yards each. That was the prime cost.</p>

               <p>Taunton. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of February last, at the Three Jolly Butchers, Clare-market, in the parish of St. Clement's Danes. Nothing particular passed. I went in with a few other officers; I told him the charge against him, and took him to the office in Bow-street. He did not deny it, or his name; he declined saying any thing, even at the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you say for fifteen years you recollect his person - A. Certainly. I have no doubt of his being the person; I knew him a long while before he was tried for that offence.</p>

            . My shop is next door to Mr. Batley's shop; there is a glass door to each shop; one looks into the other. On the 8th of February, I saw the prisoner open the door and go into Mr. Batley's shop. There is a small bell to the door; she opened the door cautiously; it did not ring the bell. I saw her lift her arm across the counter, and take the outside box. There were two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what she took - A. Yes, the shaving box; she then went out with it under her arm uncovered; I gave notice to Mr. Batley; he went after her directly.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop on the 21st of January, between five and six in the evening; she asked for a ball of cotton and a halfpenny worth of needles; she paid for them. She then asked to look at some blue ribbon. I took out the ribbon drawer, and shewed it her; she fixed upon one; I measured it for her; she said that was not enough, and when I shewed her another she objected to its colour; she asked me if I would change it if it was not the right colour. I said I could not change it after I had cut it off the piece. She then asked me to give her a pattern, which I did, and then she went out.</p>

I unfortunately saw this watch lay down; I took the watch into my hand; I said to Mr. Wiatt, I have got a watch, what am I to do with it; he said, put the watch in pawn, if it is advertised I will take it out. I pawned the watch for two pounds five shillings in Covent Garden.</p>

On Monday the 31st of January, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop; she had been standing in the shop some time. I believe she had been asking the price of a shawl; I came and told her the price of the shawl was four shillings; she bid me two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then hear any thing - A. There was then an alarm given of the flannel being stolen. I then went into the street; I saw the flannel under the prisoner's petticoats, sticking out. I brought the prisoner back to the shop; she dropped the flannel as soon as I took hold of her. I picked the flannel up, and took the flannel and the prisoner back to the shop. I had seen the flannel in the shop before the prisoner came in. This is the flannel; there is about twenty yards of it; it is worth two shillings and sixpence a yard. The flannel has Mr. Riches own private mark upon it. I can swear to its being Mr. Riches and Foreman's property.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW HOLMES. I am in the employ of Messrs. North and Simpson. In consequence of what had passed on the 12th of February, I watched the prisoner; he left the warehouse at ten o'clock; that was sooner than usual of a Saturday night; I followed him; he turned up Little Bridge-street; it is a bye way, very private. I observed him to stoop near a dunghill; he took something out of his pockets, and put there: he returned to the warehouse; in less than half an hour he left the premises again, at eleven o'clock. I then followed him again; I saw him stoop at the same place where he had stooped before. He then appeared to take up something, and put it into his pockets: he went on towards his home, as I presume; I followed him, and stopped him on Ludgate-hill; I felt in his pocket, and found some soap there. I told him he must return again to his masters. He went with me. I found his pockets to contain three pounds weight of soap. Upon the soap being produced, the prisoner said, in the presence of Mr. Graham, it was the first time he had taken any thing, went down on his knees, and hoped he would forgive him. The other soap is here. This soap I found in the prisoners pockets is both yellow and mottled; it is worth three shillings; it is three pounds in the whole. I cannot swear to soap.</p>

            , myself; these are the names of all the partners. When Holmes brought back the prisoner to our warehouse, I told the prisoner we had suspected him of robbing us a considerable time. He said, it was the first time, fell on his knees, and begged we would forgive him of that offence. We sent for Harper, the constable.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I went with Harper to search the prisoner's lodgings; we found about forty or fifty pounds weight of soap, cut up in pieces.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper to Mr. Bennett. On the 10th of February, about a quarter before four in the afternoon, I went into the privy; I had not been there above two minutes before this man came in, he went into the factory; he looked in, and went out again; he looked in the yard, and went into the tripe-shop. I heard the water rattle in the water tub, where the goods lay; he came out of the tripe-house. He went across the yards, he saw a blue apron hanging on a brick wall, drying, he took it, and tied it round him. I stepped out of the privy, and said, halloo, my friend, what are you going to do with that; he looked over his left shoulder, saw me, he flung the apron down, and directly he ran out of the yard, and I after him; I collared him, and took him to Mr. Bennett. He had got the tripe wrapped up in his jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner - A. I saw him once before, he came to see one of the men that worked there; he said he was an Irishman. The tripe that he had in his jacket was nine pounds and a half; he took it out of the backs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took it, and he took it from me again; I am a poor cracked brain fellow. I did not know what I was about; the devil was tempting me to take it. I have been in his Majesty's service ever since the day I was born, and now next May I am going to serve my king and country until I die in glory.</p>

He went to the back counter; I then could not see him where he stood; he continued taking the goods out. The witness came and said to me, I have found these goods in this man's bag.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Gregory. I missed the shawls after the prisoner went out of the shop; I had placed them on the counter just before she came in. I told Mr. Gregory; he sent me after her. I went, and found her at the corner of Long-alley, just going into a gin shop with the shawls; I brought her back and the shawls into my master's shop. These are the shawls; I can swear to their being my master's property. The value of them is half-a-guinea. I brought back the prisoner with the shawls upon her.</p>

On the 9th of February, I received information that there was a heavy load going into a house in Wentworth-street, and three men with it; I took Freeman and Griffiths with me, suspecting the load was stolen. We searched the house and the house adjoining; in the house adjoining we found this empty box. We then went to the prisoner Davis's house in Petticoat-lane; I left Griffiths below stairs while I went up stairs. In the one pair of stairs room I found a bag containing the contents of this box; I put them in the box since. I them came down stairs with the property; I asked Davis where this property came from; he said, he hoped I would not hurt him, and he would tell me; he said, the three prisoners had just brought it in, that he had given two pounds for it. I asked him how he paid them; he said, a one-pound note, nineteen shillings in silver, and a shilling in copper, which he had paid to Walker. We took them in custody; then Freeman searched the prisoners.</p>

I saw him pull my watch from me; he had got hold of the ribbon; the watch he had not got hold of. I tried to catch hold of it; I could not. I saw it in his hand. I called out to my brother that was with me, to assist me; he could not; there were so many about me. When he got hold of me they took Levy from me. I was surrounded by twenty I dare say of them. After I found my watch was gone, about a minute, I found another hand come out of my breeches pocket, which hand took my note out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand was that - A. The prisoner Harding's hand that was in my breeches pocket. As soon as I had lost the note I went and informed the inward keeper; he asked me what reward I would give; I told him I would give a pound for my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said what reward would you give - A. One of the turnkeys; I said, I would give a one-pound note reward. I came again on the next day, Sunday, the 27th, to see whether my watch was come forward; the turnkey said, he could restore the watch to me, but he must have a pound first; I gave a pound in silver into his hands, and I received my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160012"/>Q. Are you clear that Levy was the man that took your watch - A.Yes, I am positive to that, and I am sure that Harding took the note. After I found the situation I was in, I remarked the people that I catched in the fact.</p>
               <p>Q.Who gave you the watch - A. The inner locksmans, I believe they call him; he unlocked the gate.</p>
               <p>- EVERETT. I am a shoemaker; I am brother-in-law to Woodhouse; I married his sister. On the 26th of December, I went to see a friend of mine that is confined in Newgate for a small misdemeanour, and just as we entered into the middle yard my mother called out he had lost his watch. I was about a yard and a half behind. I saw the watch in Levy's hands. I catched hold of Levy, and was trying to get the watch; the others came round, and put me away. I could not see what became of the watch at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more - A. No; the others all rushed up stairs; my brother came to me, and said he had lost the five-pound note out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Woodhouse. Did you ever recover your watch - A. Yes, here it is; my five-pound note I never recovered. I offered fifty shillings reward for it. I understood the five-pound note was taken from the prisoner by the wardsman.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a push was it when your watch was taken from you - A. It was a squeezing up against me; there were a dozen or twenty round me; no violence; I think they call it a hustling; it was only pressing against me. I had a good deal of showing about; no blows was struck, it was done in so short a time, and when they had got their prey, there was a signal, a whistle; they then all flew up stairs directly.</p>

               <p>Levy's Defence. I was in the yard; I saw a row in the yard. He did not see the watch in my hand; I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence. He was two or three times in the yard; he never said any thing about me till last Wednesday. He told Mr. Davis, the turnkey, it was a man in a velveteen jacket. I never wore a velveteen jacket.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. On Monday the 7th of February, I saw the three prisoners in Holborn, at the shop window of Mr. Grosvenor, and while they were there, the prisoner Burrell put his hand into his right hand pocket and pulled out a knife from that pocket; at Mr. Grosvenor's window he opened the knife and put it to the putty of the window, and as soon as he put it to the putty of the window I saw the glass fly across. Mr. Grosvenor came up to the door, and spoke to the lads, and they ran away. I followed them, and Mr. Grosvenor followed me to inform me that the window was broken. I then followed the boys down Holborn, until they came to Fleet-market, to a linen-draper's shop on the right hand side of the market. I followed them down Watling-street, where they cracked another window, and after they had done so a person disturbed them; they crept into an orange shop and stole some oranges and nuts. I pursued them to Mr. Atkinson's shop in Lombard-street. At this time it was about seven o'clock. Burrell placed himself at Mr. Atkinson's shop window; Solomon and Morris were at the door watching the motions of the persons in the shop. Burrell pulled out a knife and put it to the putty of the window; it gave a crack, and a piece of glass came out. I heard the crack. At the moment the knife was applied to the putty a piece of glass came out; then he left the window, and joined Morris and Solomon. Burrell left the window again, and Solomon and Morris left the door and went to the door adjoining the shop, in Lombard-street. Burrell put his hand into the window, and pulled out a shoe, which shoe he gave to Solomon, and Solomon gave it to Morris. Burrell then returned, and took the second shoe; he gave it to Solomon, and Solomon gave it to Morris as he had done before. He was then returning to the window again, and at that time a person was coming out with the shutters to shut up the shop. I then laid hold of Solomon and Morris, and on

             I found these shoes; I asked a person to lay hold of Burrell, and I took all three into Mr. Atkinson's shop. I searched Burrell; on Burrell I found a penknife, and the point of the knife appears to have been used.</p>

I sent John Evans after him to call him back. Instead of his coming back he turned into a court which is next door but one to us, and when he came in I challenged him with having the tobacco in his hat; he said, it was no such thing. I then told him he had emptied it in the court; he said he had done no such thing; I sent Evans back to the court, and there he found it.</p>
               <p>JOHN EVANS. I am a servant to Mr. Lloyd. After the prisoner went out of the shop I followed him, and told him to come back; instead of following me back to the shop he turned into the court. I saw him come out of the court; he came to the shop afterwards. I was sent back to the court afterwards for the tobacco, which I found, and brought to the shop. It was covered over with paper, and the lining of his hat was on it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WORRALL. I produce the tobacco. This tobacco was delivered to me by Mr. Roberts; after that, I searched the prisoner's lodgings; his wife delivered this tobacco to me; she said it was what he had brought in in the morning.</p>

On Thursday I met the prisoner and let him pass me some way, and seeing him walk rather awkward I followed him and stopped him; I asked him what he had about him; he said, nothing but broken victuals which the cook had given him by the order of Mr. Wood. I searched him; in his breeches I found three quarters of a pound of butter. I took him back to Mr. Wood; he then said he had the butter given to him in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been trusted with various sums of money, I never made any mistake with the money; and on last Saturday night Mr. Wood's cook gave me some soup, and when I turned it into a dish I saw a silver spoon; I took it back on Monday morning. I throw myself on your lordship's mercy, and beg Mr. Wood's pardon.</p>

             was clearing the forecastle, I saw the two pieces of Russia duck in the shot locker; this bag was underneath the two pieces of Russia linen in the shot locker. About eleven o'clock in the forenoon I saw it again in the same place in the shot locker.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw it first - A. A little after breakfast, and I saw it again between three and four in the afternoon in the same place. I saw part of it in the same place; part was gone; about half a piece apparently was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it you saw a half piece - A. On the 19th, the next day. I perceived a piece and a half was left, and that half a piece was gone. On Wednesday I saw the other half piece underneath the bed cabin. It was about one o'clock I saw it underneath the bed cabin. I first saw a piece and a half, the next day I saw the half piece.</p>
               <p>Q.About what o'clock did you see the half piece - A. About one o'clock I saw the half piece underneath the bed cabin in the forecastle; that was a few yards from the shot locker. On Wednesday I mentioned it to Blanch; the other prisoner was on shore. I told him on Tuesday I saw the two pieces underneath the shot locker, that it had been removed. Blanch said Brennan was on shore; we should tell him of it; he added that it would be better to tell the captain, and we should not be blamed, and then they would make a seizure of it. He said there were two boys who had run away, it might be imputed to them, and they would be transported for it. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160014"/>waited till Brennan came on board; Brennan came about twelve o'clock; then Brennan sent a man to call me in the cabin; I went into the cabin; I found the two prisoners in the cabin. Brennan said they would take the two pieces of Russia linen; they would give me a few shillings out of it, and they would do the best they could with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss the Russia duck out of the place where you saw it - A. Directly after this conversation I went to the place where I had seen it, and found it was missing.</p>

            . I am mate of the Lord Harlington. I was informed where the Russia duck was; I was directed by the Captain to watch who should take it away from that place; for the purpose of seeing that, I placed myself close to the bulk head, forward; I then commanded a view of the sleeping place of the two prisoners; they were in bed at the time I was stationed there. I saw Brennan get out bed. I saw one of the prisoners take the Russia duck from under the bed cabin; he placed it in the clew of his hammock. The other was by at the time. Then Brennan got on his back; he was partly dressed. I cannot say which of them laid it on his back; they were both together. Blanch tied his breeches with rope yarn; the waistband would not meet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Russia duck was in the waistband of his breeches - A. Yes. I then went on deck, and sent for a police officer; the officer came, and found the duck on his person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Smuggling is done as secret as possible - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I am a Thames police constable. The captain came for me. I took this piece of Russia duck from Brannan's back; it was fastened round his waistband with rope yarn. This is the half piece I took from his back; the other has not been found. When I found it upon Brennan he said it was the first thing he had done ever since he had been in the employ.</p>
               <p>Q. to Captain Hall. Was that the Russia duck that was on board your vessel - A. Yes; it is ten yards.</p>

               <p>Brennan said nothing in his defence.</p>

I went out in a few minutes after; I saw the shop window which had a fastening; there is a brass catch to the window; I saw the window lifted up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of January, in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch. She lodged with another woman. I told her I came from Mrs. Louch, of Pentonville; she seemed very much embarassed. I asked her what she had done with her mistress's watch; she said she had pawned it at Brentford. She gave me this ticket for two gowns and a shift; the two gowns in the duplicate belong to another case; the shift to this case. I went to Brentford and stopped the watch. Mrs. Louch has claimed the shift at the office. I asked her what she had done with the three table-spoons and the five dessert-spoons; she said she had pawned them at different pawnbrokers, and she sold two of the small spoons to a Jew in Whitechapel for four shillings.</p>

            . I lodge and board with Mrs. Louch. I know the spoons were there on Sunday morning, the 9th of January, and the watch; they were gone before night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the watch - A. This is my watch; it is the watch I lost out of my house. I have never got my spoons again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thisselton. Produce the shift and two gowns - A. These two gowns I found in the prisoner's bundle in the room when I apprehended her. She said she had cut the bodies off to make petticoats of them, and this shift was sent to me by Mr. Nicolls, pawnbroker, of Brentford; he is at Union-hall today. He gave the shift to Mr. Mitchell, who gave it to me to-day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The gowns and the shift are mine.</p>

On his being informed he was not at home he went into the back parlour; he staid there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then said he could stay no longer. He told me he had made an appointment with Mr. Benham. After he had sat there some time he went out. In about half an hour after he was gone I missed my husband's gold watch. I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

I offered him six; he said he had been offered six in pledge. He agreed to take six pounds fifteen shillings for the watch; I gave him that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. No, never; he is the same man. When I gave him the six pounds fifteen shillings for the watch, he took out of his pocket three gold seals and a key. I gave him fifteen shillings for them. I asked him where he got the watch; he said he bought it of the maker, Mr. Watford, in Ryder-street, St. James's. He said he was going to Gibralter the next week, it was of no use his pledging it, he might not be back in time to redeem it, but if I had it when he came back he would purchase it again of me.

            , he lived at 54, in East Smithfield. On the Monday following, a hand bill came from Bow-street office, describing such a watch to have been stolen. I set out immediately to go to Bow-street; in my way there I learned that Mr. Essex of the Strand had been making enquiry about the watch. I went to Mr. Essex; he said it was his daughter's watch. I delivered the watch to Mr. Essex; he desired me to stop the man if ever I saw him. On the 22nd of January the same man came -</p>
               <p>Q. That is the prisoner - A. Yes; and offered me another watch to pledge. I looked steadfastly at him; he said, I sold you a gold watch a few months ago, have you parted with that. I told him I had, and I immediately sent for an officer; the officer came; I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY ESSEX. I received the watch; I gave my daughter the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Can you swear to the watch - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Essex. I gave the watch to my daughter; I can swear to it; the number of it was entered in my book, and this watch answers to that number. I know the watch from the general appearance of it; the maker's name on it is W. Watford, Ryder-street, St. James's. I gave it to my daughter a long time ago; it is near three years ago.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 4th of February, I lost two pair of stockings, an apron, a mug, and a chamber-pot; I lost them out of my yard at the back of my house; I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before I missed them. I know Bunney. I saw my things the next morning at Bunney's house, the mug and chamber-pot were standing on a table outside of the house, exposed for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bunney - A. He is a broker, and keeps an old iron shop. I went into the house; I saw the stockings; Bunney was not at home. I saw a woman and a little girl. I claimed the stockings, the mug, and a chamber-pot. I did not see the apron. I afterwards saw Bunney, I told him the things were mine; he said, he gave fifteen pence for the stockings, and sixpence for the crockeryware. I have never seen the stockings since; the crockery I have got. It was Friday when I lost the things. On Monday afterwards, about six o'clock in the evening, I passed the woman prisoner in the passage, I asked her what she wanted, it was dark; she said, she wanted to go into the privy. I said, I think you are the woman that robbed me last week; I had her taken into custody. My wife told me she had confessed taking the things, and selling them to Bunney.</p>

On the 2nd of February, about six at night, being out on duty in company with Barnard Gleed and other officers in Wentworth-street, in the County of Middlesex, I saw the prisoner carrying a hamper, in company with three others behind him; I stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying; he said, he did not know what it was, he was going to carry it somewhere in Petticoat-lane, he did not know where. I asked him how he came by it; he said, a gentleman gave it him to carry in Somerset-street, Whitechapel; he did not know the man nor where he was to carry it to. As soon as we laid hold of him the others ran away. This is the hamper; I took the prisoner to the office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the hamper that was in my care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of work; in Somerset-street this gentleman asked me to carry it; I said, I would if he would pay me; he carried my hat. He was walking by me when I was taken in custody.</p>

            . I live at Paddington. I know the prisoner Hill; he has often told me that he had bristles to sell cheap. On the 28th of December, I met the prisoner as I was crossing Blenherm-mews, he had some bristles tied up in an handkerchief, he asked me if I would buy them; I said, I would; I gave him ten shillings for them. I could not tell what the bristles were worth; they were not weighed. On the 10th of January Mr. Kent came, and found the bristles at my house.</p>

About the latter end of October, he sold me about thirty pounds of bristles; he told me the person that had them to sell had told him to ask three pounds ten shillings for them. I gave him three pounds for them; I fetched them from his lodgings in a hamper. I had them in my lodgings at the time the prisoner was taken up; I went and told Mr. Kent that I had bought bristles of the prisoner.

               <p>Q. Did you see these two boxes and two bundles put in the coach - A. Yes, and I saw a tea-chest put in also, and I saw the tea-chest on the front seat at the end of one of the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive sure that upon your arriving in Tudor-street that this tea-chest was never taken out by the prisoner - A. Yes, I am. The coachman was paid his fare, two shillings, and then he drove away. The coachman got on the steps of the coach, felt about, and then he said, every thing was out. In about three minutes after the coach went away, my mother missed her tea-chest; my mother went after the coach, she could not find it. I took no notice of the number at that time; I have since learned the number of the coach was 955. I observed the countenance of the prisoner at Tudor-street when I was talking to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did that tea-chest contain - A. A two-pound note, seven one-pound notes, and three pounds in silver money; the tea-chest was locked.

I took particular notice of the lining of the coach, there were three stars on each side of the door of the coach, and a ragged hammercloth.

On the 15th I was talking to him, a man called coach; he said, where; the man said, to go and take up in Nelson-square. The prisoner said, where is it going; the man said, only to take a servant from her place. The prisoner grumbled; I said, if you do not like to go I will. The prisoner said, he would go; he went off in that direction to take up there, as I supposed. I am positive that he drove No. 955. I saw no more of the coach at that time. I accompanied Mrs. Williams and Ruthwin, the officer, to Savage's house. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160019"/>saw

I went over my stable, and when I came down I saw this man in the stable. I thought it was the young man in the stable that assisted me; I said, you have soon got home. Directly the prisoner throwed the coat off his arm. I had hung it up about three stalls from the horse. The prisoner asked for work; I told him I did not know any person in the neighbourhood that wanted a helper. I walked towards the door; then I asked him what parcel that was. I did not know it was my coat. I thought it had been his own; he said it was a coat. Then it struck me that it was my coat.

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that these men were preparing for a fight - A. Yes, they were preparing for a fight between eight or nine o'clock.</p>

             in Bembridge-street - A. Yes. I saw him at the Hare and Hounds before that; he was drinking a pot of beer with my husband; he was sober; he had no weapons with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next - A. I heard a great alarm; I went as far as Church-street, then I went to Bembridge-street. I heard a great row at the Ship.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the assembly that you first mentioned - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Gallagher do any thing to White - A. No, I did not; Ragan did strike him; I could almost swear I saw him strike him a blow across the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see White picked up - A. I waited a good bit, and then I went away for fear I should be served the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was White from the Ship when he was knocked down - A. Not two yards. He was on the pavement. I went and leaned over White; I asked him to come home; he was not able to make me any answer. The crowd returned. Ragan said he was not dead. The deceased said in Irish, do not strike, and then they struck him with scaffolding poles. A man took him away.</p>

There were a good many people beating him as he was down.

The prisoner Gallagher was about five yards distance; he was standing upon the step of the Ship public-house door without a hat. I applied to him to assist me in preventing a party beating the deceased. Gallagher immediately assisted me to prevent the party from beating the deceased. When I applied to Gallagher, some of the mob were crying out in Irish to beat him; Gallagher cried out in Irish not to beat him, and immediately Gallagher and I shoved ourselves between the party that were beating the deceased, and after our interference the deceased did not receive any blow except from some person who kicked him on his legs. I know nothing more of White. I spoke to the party of the impropriety of their assembling in this way.</p>

One of them broke the bar window; then the word was, the first man that comes out of the Ship let him he knocked down.

               <p>Q. What did his family consist of - A. He had a wife and one child, and me and him. The wife and child and me were all the persons in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived with him previous to the 11th of January - A. I lived there eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this model, is the house like this - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this to be the street door, is this the passage - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you go on you come to a small hall - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that hall there is a stair-case, one that goes up stairs, and one that goes down stairs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the partition between that front parlour and the small hall - A. A partition of wood, and behind the back parlour there is the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of January do you remember any thing being said to you about going out - A. At nine o'clock on the 11th of January, in the morning, my mistress said, Mary, your master and me are going out to dinner, and after you have shut up the house you may go out for a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you applied for leave to go out - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Mr. Sturman go out - A. He went out about half past twelve o'clock. The prisoner told me to go and fetch some seed to feed the canary bird. I went and fetched the bird seed. Mr. Sturman fed the bird himself. The bird was in a bird-cage; it hung up by the side of the room, between the window and the fire-place, in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized cage was it - A. It was a large breeding-cage; it might be the size of that model.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had fetched the bird-seed what did your master say to you - A. He gave me a key, and asked me if I knew how to unlock the door; I said, no. I had never seen such a key before. I tried to unlock the door; he shewed me, and then I could do it after he shewed me, not before he shewed me. He told me to leave the house perfectly secure, to be at home at half after eight o'clock, and not later, and to get the fire and lamps ready by nine o'clock. I went out about four o'clock. He told me to be sure to be at home at half after eight o'clock, and before I went out to leave a lamp alight, that nobody might distinguish whether there were any persons in the house or not. I left the lamp burning on the board in the hall, and the tinder-box, for fear it should go out. I went into the front parlour before I went out. I raked the fire almost out; I barred the shutters up, but I did not draw the curtains. I left every thing perfectly safe, to the best of my knowledge, up stairs. I fastened the doors and the windows; I left the windows shut and the shutters open.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was that room - A. Three pair of stairs. All the fastenings were very secure when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you went out - A. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And what time did you return - A. I returned about twenty minutes before eight. I unlocked the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to return before the time your master gave you leave - A. I was at a friend's house; I did not exactly know the hour; I mistook the hour. I let myself in with the key my master gave me. When I came in the passage I saw the house was in flames. The back dining room door post I saw in flames.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the door post - A. The inside of the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there against the door post - A. On the inside there were paper, wood, and boards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boards - A. I believe there were one or two; they were thin boards, usually kept by Mr. Sturman that he had in the wine cellar; the boards laid against the door post.</p>
               <p>Q. Between them and the door post what was there - A. A wooden partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing put between the boards and the door post - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there of the other side - A. Bundles of fire wood with the strings cut, and paper, and on the outside of the front parlour was steps, wood, and hand boxes brought out of Mrs. Sturman's room, filled full of combustlbles, and a bunch of matches also.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the combustibles - A. A band box, wood, and paper, and on the inside of the front parlour there was more wood and paper also on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these on each side of the partition - A. There were steps on the outside, and wood and paper within. They were as close to the partition as possibly they could be laid to the partition of the front parlour. The clothes-horses used to be kept down stairs in the washhouse. Stocking and rags were scattered about the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What stockings - A. Some silk and some cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose stockings were they - A. Mr. Sturman's. The stocking were kept in the front parlour, in the bottom drawer. The pinafores I washed myself; they were in the front parlour; they were usually kept in a drawer in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pinafores - A. I cannot say how many, not less than six or seven. They were in the back parlour hanging on the back of a chair when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you came home -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160023"/>- A. When I found them they were upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any rags about - A. Yes, there were rags which I had dusted the tables with on the stairs; the rags smelled very strong of turpentine indeed, some of them, and some of the stockings I believe smelled very strong of turpentine. There were some matches laying on the clothes-horse, and on the steps, and I had left some on the side-board; when I came home there was a considerable fire in the front parlour, and two pokers red hot.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the lamp - A. The lamp was removed from the place I left; it was carried into the back-pantry. The lamp I left in the passage burning was carried into the back-pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the curtains of the front parlour - A. When I went out I left the curtains undrawed; when I returned they were drawed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the windows of the prisoner's bedroom - A. I left the windows shut, and the shutters open; when I came home the windows were throwed open, and the shutters open.</p>
               <p>Q. That would make a draft down the stair-case - A. Yes. My window was open at the same time; it was shut when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the snow upon the house at this time - A. Yes, a great deal. My room was at the top of the house, next to Mr. Sturman's room. The snow was upon the the top of the house, very deep indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. On your seeing things in this state what did you do - A. As soon as I went in the house and saw it in flames I immediately called out for assistance; Mr. Levoigne was the first that came to my assistance. Captain 
               <persName id="t18140216-43-person449">Kempster</persName>
            's servant, who lived at the next door of one side, and Dr. Lockley on the other side. The Captain's servant came, and Mrs. Lockley's also came, and we extinguished the flames as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. How where the drawers in the front parlour - A. The book-case and the drawers in the front parlour were all apparently shut when I went out; when I returned I found them all open, and stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the key was in the book-case when you went out - A. No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home was the bird-cage there - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did your master come home - A. At half after nine o'clock; I was in the front parlour when I saw my master first. My mistress spoke to me, said, Mary, what is the matter; I said ma'm, the house is stripped and robbed. He immediately cried out his desk was lost, and that he was a ruined man. Master asked me what time I went out; I said, four o'clock. He asked me how long I had been home; I said, ever since twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day after, Mr. Denham coming to your master - A. Yes, very well; they had some conversation together. Master told me then to fetch some turpentine bottles; I asked Mr. Sturman where they were, whether they were in the cupboard up stairs or down stairs; the prisoner told me in the cupboard in the back pantry. I knew nothing where they were; I never had seen any turpentine bottles there before hand; I used to go to that cupboard very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Must you have seen them if they had been there - A. Yes, I think I must have seen them if they had been there before, but I never had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were stone bottles I suppose - A. Yes; they hold about half a gallon. (The two stone bottles produced.) One of them is common oil, the other is turpentine. I brought them both up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how much there were in each - A. No, I did not look particularly; I smelled them, one appeared to have the same smell as the rags, and the stockings also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master use more than one sitting-room - A. No, only one when I was with him, that was the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire in the kitchen, or any where - A. No, none all the time I was in the house. No fire except in the front parlour; I had my meals there; I dined after them in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people frequently come to ask for payment - A. Very often indeed, for payment of money during the eight days I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever get it - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had been there only eight days - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no great opportunity of examining the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the jars might be there for what you know - A. They might; they were not in that cupboard, nor any where else that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them contained oil that might be used in paint, and the other oil that might be burned in a lamp - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master kept a lodging-house - A. Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Q. The other rooms were usually kept for lodgers, so not used in common - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of some boards brought out of the wine cellar, you do not mean they were brought out that day - A. Yes, they must; I had never seen them before. Mr. Sturman used always to go to the cellar himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the key in the door - A. Not in common, it was not; Mr. Sturman took the key with him; the door was generally kept locked. The first night I was there Mrs. Sturman sent me down to get a bottle of beer; I went and got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any wine there - A. I did not look.</p>
               <p>JURY. When you returned were you alarmed - A. Yes, I was quite alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your recollection leave you. If you were alarmed it is somewhat astonishing that you should be correct to give a detail in this kind of way, and not under any embarrassment - A. I found myself confused to see the house in that state.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160024"/>Q. You were only eight days in the house; how could you be acquainted with the house - A. Because I went into every room in the house, and cleaned every room.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed and confused, and yet can be correct in stating all this - A. Why I saw the things there every day; they remained there several days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you get the light - A. Out of the front parlour.</p>

            . I am a bookseller in Portman-street. On the night of the 11th of January, I was in Half-moon-street; I heard a cry of fire; the cry proceed from some woman, I think, at No. 9. That young woman, the last witness, was at the door of her master's house. I went to the door directly. Upon entering the house I observed a light in the back parlour, and also on the stairs. I was the first person that went into the house. I immediately went into the back parlour, and extinguished the flame by the assistance of a board. I believe after two or three minutes, two other persons came in, and assisted. In about four or five minutes the fire was extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did you find to have been on fire - A. Upon examining it afterwards the door post and part of the flooring, sir, and the stairs. Against the back parlour door post there were two pieces of boards piled up; these pieces of boards would serve as conductors to the fire. On the outside I found rags, and up the stairs them rags appeared to have been sleeped in some preparation that smelled like turpentine. The smell principally appeared like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Underneath the stairs, against the other door, did you find the clothes-horse - A. I did, and paper, and other things; they were placed against the door post, only more erect.</p>
               <p>Q. On the inside of that parlour did you find other paper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Underneath the side board there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be placed so as most effectually to burn the house - 
               <persName id="t18140216-43-person453">A. Mary Wright</persName>
             went to the stair-case and saw the wooden steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Levoigne, I believe after putting out the fire you went away; you had a friend to conduct home you went away and came back again - A. I did. I came back sooner than half past eight, and then I made more particular examination of the combustibles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that these combustibles were placed at these different places to set the house on fire - A. At first it did not; afterwards they did. I was in the house when the prisoner and his wife returned. I did not see him when he first came in; in about a minute after I did. He was in the passage when I first saw him. Some person told him, after a few minutes, that his writing-desk was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Writing-desk or book case was it - A. I am not certain which; he appeared very much distressed. and said he was a ruined man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there the first time did you observe whether there was a fire in the front parlour grate - A. I do not recollect. I do not think the door was open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Tell us as near as you can the precise time when you called at this house - A. It might be between twenty and twenty-five minutes to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore past the half hour - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. By your extingishing it so easy, the flames must have been recent - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you that told Mr. Sturman that his writing-desk was broken open - A. It was not. He gave the child to his wife, and went as far as the door; then he returned into the back parlour, threw himself upon two chairs, exclaiming he was a ruined man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt that his distress was real - A. I did not attempt to form an opinion.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday the 11th of January, do you remember the alarm being given - A. I do. I went into the house about twenty minutes before eight. When I first went in I saw a great light in the back parlour; it proceeded from the back parlour. I saw the fire burning very fierce. I called out to the maid servant to get me a light, which she did in the front parlour, and got a lighted candle. From thence we proceeded into the back kitchen. I got a pail, and some water; I throwed a pail of water upon the back parlour; and nearly extinguished it. I went down again, got another pail of water, and throwed after that. Mr. Levoigne was treading out the fire on the stairs on the outside of the parlour, that which had been on fire he had not extinguished. I saw the rags laying about. I saw the clothes-horse, the steps, and wood resting against the inside of the partition. I did not go into the front parlour until after the fire was extinguished. I found a very large fire there, and one poker in the fire red hot; the other poker standing up by the fire, I do not recollect whether that was hot or not. A quantity of fire wood untied was laid along from the door to the side-board close to the wainscot in the parlour.</p>

            . I am a police office of Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 11th of January, were you sent for to this house on the alarm of fire - A. I was. I got there about half past eight; I examined all over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any fastenings of the house broken - A. None at all. I examined every part; I could find no where whatever that any person had got into the house excepting with a key. When the prisoner and his wife returned I was up stairs; I came down; the prisoner was in the back parlour; he threw himself upon two chairs, exclaiming, he was a ruined man. While he was in this apparent distress, I took the candle and looked in his face; there did not appear any real distress; no tears at all. It struck me so forcibly that there was no real distress I told Mr. Reeves that if he would give the charge I would take him into custody. I saw the key in the door of the book-case; I took the candle, and looked at the locks of the doors; I could see no force at all. I cannot say I examined them very strictly, because I saw the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any part of the combustibles - A. Yes. I picked this up at the first step of the stairs, and partly on the floor; it was then as wet as if it had been dipped in a turpentine tub; it smells now strong of it, nothing like so strong as then. It is now quite dry. There were a vast many more tags on the stairs; that being the wettest I did not trouble myself with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. The fireman were left in possession of the house after that - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you take the lock off and examine it - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was picked or not - A. They said it was a patent lock. Mr. Bremmer I believe has offered an hundred guineas for any person that will pick any of his locks.</p>
               <p>MR. DENHAM. I am secretary of the Globe Insurance office. About three o'clock, the day after the fire, I went to this house. When I got there the firemen pointed out the different parts of the house that had been on fire. I asked the prisoner if he could account in any way for the accident of the fire being in his house, and whether he thought anybody had been wicked enough to do him a spite. He said, no, not any. I then asked him what time he went out on the preceding day; he said, about one o'clock and when he returned he found fire had taken place in his house; he could not explain that, nor give any other account. The next day I went into further particulars. I asked him whether he knew how the paper and hand-boxes came there. After some difficulty he said they came from his wife's bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where the steps and the clothes-horse came from - A. He said they were usually kept below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the keys of the door - A. He said he supposed the thieves must have entered by false keys. I asked him what keys he had; he said he had originally three; one he had lost in the month of August last by the servant or one of his lodgers, and that he had given his own servant a key to let herself in. I then said I supposed he kept the third himself. He did not give a positive answer. He said he did not know where it was. I then asked him whether there was any turpentine mixture in the house. He said, after some recollection, he believed there was some in the house. I asked him whether there were any remaining; he said he thought there might; I begged to see it; he said he had it to paint the house. He rang the bell;

               <p>Q. Did she know where to go for it - A. No. He had some difficulty in making her understand where she was to go for the stone bottles; he said out of the cupboard. She then asked, what cupboard; the cupboard down stairs? he said, no, in the pantry; and was going to shew her himself. She then appeared to understand, and went and brought a bottle in each hand. Upon her bringing the bottles he took the cork out, smelled it, and gave it me to smell, which smelled the same as the clothes were wetted with. He then examined the nose of the bottle, and said he did not think it had been recently opened, and asked me if I thought it had been recently opened; he thought not. I assented to it. I then asked him about his bank notes; he said he had lost about six hundred pounds, which he always kept in the book case. I said, you keep the key of the book case. He said, yes. I asked him if it was a key separate from the bunch of keys; he said, yes; the bunch of keys were kept by his wife, the key of the book case was kept by him. He shewed me a bundle of clothes that lay in the chair; he said he supposed they were intended to be taken also; they were two or three coats and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any children's clothes - A. Not on the chair. He said nothing more that day, I believe. On the Friday I went again and repeated my question with respect to the bank notes in particular. I asked him if he could give any account of the notes. He said, no, none; there was an account of them, but it was kept in the book with them. I asked him what the notes consisted of. He said they were of various amounts, in particular two or three of an hundred pounds each. I then said you can account, and say where you had all these notes. He said he had one or two or three of his lodgers; that he had them by him, some of them for two years. On my saying how extraordinary the robbery was he seemed much agitated.</p>

               <p>Q. Mrs. Martin, did not you observe upon your oath, whether he was cool or warm - A. Upon my oath I did not observe whether he was warm or cool; I made no observation upon it, that I swear. He staid about half an hour, and then he and his wife went out to go home; I suppose so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You had not seen the prisoner before he came into your house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it wanted more than five minutes to eight - A. I cannot say; I am sure it was not eight.</p>

               <p>JAMES RILEY. I am in the employ of Butler and Watson; they are carpet manufacturers, in Bond-street. The prisoner came in the early part of October, and purchased some carpetting; he purchased some for a drawing-room; they were sold for a ready money price. He came on the 15th, he ought to have paid ready money for them. The balance remaining was thirty-seven pounds twelve shillings and five-pence.</p>
               <p>JURY. What was the amount of the bill - A. Sixty-seven pounds twelve shillings and five-pence. On the 2nd of November, 1812, I received a bill for the balance for two months credit; that bill was not paid when due; it was put into the hands of an attorney.</p>

               <p>Q. Was china and glass in your valuation - A. There is not. I saw no china or glass in the house. I valued the things that I understood to be insured. Covington, the fireman, was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Covington. Did you remain in the house until Mr. Raner valued the furniture - A. Yes. Nothing was removed out; I was there at the fire, and I was there then.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you take them away from the printer, saying, you wanted them, your brother was under examination at Bow-street - A. No, I swear I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the hand-bill - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive them for the prisoner - A. On Saturday, a little after two o'clock, from there I went to the printer; the printer told me I should have them at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your brother in custody on Saturday - A. I did not know that he was in custody until I took the hundred and fifty bills from his house in Half Moon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I give you notice, now I have a person here who was at the printing-office; on Friday morning was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160029"/>the first time that you or he went to the printing-office about it - A. Yes; I had one hundred and fifty bills at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no evidence about the bird-cage being lost in the hand-bill - A. No; I did not know that was lost.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Griffiths Foulkes. On the 14th of February, the prisoner and another woman came in to look at some shawls; they bought as much as came to seven shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they buy - A. Shawls. I suspected as she was going out of the shop that she had got something else about her, she looked so bulky. After she had got about a yard from the shop I laid hold of her, asked her what she had got; I put my hand under her shawl, and found this shawl and a yard and half of linen-cloth. She said that she picked it up coming in I took her up stairs, and sent for an officer. He searched her; I did not find no more upon her than the shawl and the yard and a half of linen-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. Just upon her breast; it is my master's shawl; it has the shop mark. It was on the counter; the prisoner was near it; the value of the shawl is eleven shillings and sixpence, and one shilling and sixpence the linen, prime cost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this shop to buy some neck handkerchiefs, coming out of the shop I trod on this parcel, who it belonged to I did not know. The young man came after me, he asked me what I had got; I went back into the shop. He said the shawl and piece of cloth belonged to his master; who it belonged to I did not know when I picked it up in the shop.</p>

He told me he received only two shillings of her, and that is all he put down in this paper; it is his own hand writing. I had information that he had received more.

On the 2nd of February, I locked my shop up at half after ten o'clock at night; I was called up on the morning of the 3rd of February, at four o'clock, by the patrol. I went to my shop; I saw the tiles had been taken off; there was a hole big enough for a man to get in, and four shutters were taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken out of your shop - A. A haunch of mutton, two shoulders, one quarter, and seven smaller pieces; they were hung up in the shop upon hooks, and two iron hooks were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the shop - A. There were six or seven pennyworth of halfpence; they were gone; they were in the drawer. On the 3rd I saw my mutton again at Shadwell office; I knew it to be my mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the mutton - A. About thirty shillings.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 2nd of February, I met the prisoner; he asked me the way to Bishopsgate-street, he had a bag with him. I asked him what was in the bag; he said, beef; he said a woman employed him to carry it. I took him across the way to a watch-box where there was a light; I told the watchman; he said, he must go to the watchhouse. He threw down the bag and the meat; I pursued him, and took him to the watchhouse. The watchman brought the bag and the meat to the watchhouse. When I brought the prisoner to the watchhouse I saw the bag contained mutton; there was a hind quarter, a haunch, two shoulders, and several small bits, and two hooks also.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure the mutton was mine; there is no doubt of the books being mine, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been nineteen years serving his Majesty; I get my living by portering, or any thing of this kind. I was employed to carry the meat to the Green Dragon, Bishopsgate-street.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Adam and Eve-court, in the parish of St. Luke's. I was in the public-house in the court a little before one o'clock in the morning, a row ensured in the public-house passage between two girls of the town. I was in the bar at the time, and in consequence of the girls fighting one of them laid in the passage for dead. There were several more people there in the passage. It was a passage leading into the street. The door was shut, and no one assisted the girl that was laying on the floor. I went to assist her up. After I lifted her up the prisoner was on the left hand side of me; he was the only man that was on that side of the passage. I felt my watch go from me; I found it was gone. I looked, and I saw it in the prisoner's hand. I told him to give me the watch, or I would charge the watchman with him. He gave the watch to a female that came up to the door to him; the watchman came in; I gave him charge of the prisoner; the watchman found the watch behind the door where the female put it. The constable has the watch.</p>

We missed a large quantity of shirts on the 3d. of January. I spoke to Burton on the subject of our less; he said he knew nothing of our loss. On the Saturday before the 19th; I had our porter taken up, and when I had the porter apprehended then Burton acknowledged he had taken them. He said he was very sorry; he had stolen about fourteen dozen; that Lucas brought him into it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these shirts worth a piece - A.Seven shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lucas present when he said this - A. Yes. He said Lucas had given him three pounds for them. Lucas said he had given nine pounds for them. Amsden then took the prisoners into custody. He was there when this was said.</p>

I took it about nine o'clock on Sunday morning, or five minutes earlier. I took it out of the safe, and took it to the coach. It is called the Union coach, or Buckingham coach; it inns at the King's Arms, Snow-hill. I took it myself to the coach; I delivered it personally to the coachman. I saw the coachman deposit it in the locker of the seat, and lock it. The coachman's name is Parker.</p>

There is a small locker underneath where the coachman sits; I saw the coachman put the parcel in, and lock it, and then he strapped the cushion on the lid.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you come to London safe with all the property - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you supposed - A. I did. I did not unlock the box until I returned to London. I came to the Green Man and Still. I had occasion to take out a parcel there. I unlocked the locker there, and took out a parcel for Ransom and Morley; the parcel was safe then; I had it in my hand; the Aylesbury parcel was safe then; I only pushed it on one side to take Ransom and Morley's. I locked the locker, and left it safe in. Then I came to the King's Arms inn.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the King's Arms inn, did you find any thing had been done to your locker - A. Not immediately I did not. About ten minutes after I went to the locker to get the parcel; the staple of the locker was wrenched off, and the parcel was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to the King's Arms - A. About half past five in the afternoon. It was dark then.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 10th of January, were you desired at Esdaile's house to accompany the prisoner to some place - A. Yes, I was desired to accompany him to Mr. Praed's in Fleet-street. I left the house to go there. The prisoner said he would go to the person from whom he had received the note, and take the person with him to Mr. Praed's. I went with him towards Smithfield. He first stepped into two public-houses in Long-lane; he went in, but did not make any stay. He turned round into Smithfield, and went into a public-house in Smithfield, the sign of the Lock and Key, or the Key. It is the second public-house on the left hand in Smithfield from Long-lane. He sat down there, and called for a glass of rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name any person that he was in search of - A. Yes; that was before. I asked him if he knew of whom he received the note; he said he did, his name was Jenkins, a salesman. I asked him if he knew what bankers he used, that he might readily find him. He said he did not. After we went into the public-house he called for a glass of rum and water; he told them to make it good. He pulled out a shilling before the rum and water came. He laid this umbrella on the table. When the rum and water came he paid for it; he drank, and handed it to me; he pulled off his hat, and wiped his face. The next thing, he said I will just step over to Sharp's, the banker, and see if he is there; he is not here; he will be here before the market is over, if he is not there. When he had spoken these words he left his umbrella on the table, and went out. He had not been gone long before I suspected all was not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again that day - A. No. I waited till between five and six, then I went over to Sharp's with the umbrella in my hand. I did not see him there. I went back to see, that I might not miss him if he did come back. He never did come back that day. This was on the 10th I was sent on the 13th with the officers to a small street in the City-road, to his house I believe. I knew him directly I saw him. I went to apprehend him. The officer was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say anything to you when you came to his house - A. I told him what had past at Smithfield; he said he knew nothing of it. I told him that he had left the umbrella and the rum and water, and had not come back. He denied ever being with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fell. Have you got the note - A. Yes. This is the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Steers. Had you the note - A. Yes. I had it of Mr. Esdaile or of Mr. Scott. I delivered the note at Praed's. I was directed by Mr. Scott not to deliver it up. I took it to Praed's, and brought it back to Esdaile's. At Praed's they sent me for the prisoner's writing. Mr. Nelson was the gentleman in Mr. Praed's office. I put my initials on the note before I parted with it to Mr. Nelson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, to Mr. Scott. Did you deliver the note which you stopped from the prisoner, to the porter - A. I am not confident whether I did or not; either I or Mr. Esdaile did. It was delivered in my presence.</p>

            , he is a stable-keeper in the City-road. On Sunday the 9th of January, the prisoner, Leroyd, came to our house about one o'clock, in the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from his - A. About three quarters of a mile. He came about one o'clock, we were just going to dinner. We had a goose that was sent me from Birmingham. I asked him if he would dine off that goose; he said, no, he was going home to dinner; he was very poorly. I asked him how his wife did; he said she was very poorly; she was just put to bed, would I come and see her. I said I would. He went home by himself, and between three and four I went to his house. The nurse let me into his house; she asked me to walk up stairs. He was up stairs with his wife; she on one side of the fire and he on the other. I stopped to tea; as they asked me. We had tea about five o'clock. I stopped there until he went to bed; he went to bed between seven and eight o'clock; he said he could sit up no longer. He appeared to have a cold, and was very hoarse. I am sure from four o'clock until eight he was in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160034"/>Q. This was Sunday - A. Yes. In three or four days afterwards I heard he was taken up. His wife sent for me; she asked me whether I recollected Mr. Laroyd was at home the Sunday I was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. Yes, and there were three other persons that have been tried; they were charged with stealing sealing wax and pencils. I desired my fellow officer to secure the prisoners while I ran up stairs. I went up stairs; I found this compass up two pair of stairs. I took the prisoner up with me; I asked him how he came by it; he said he bought it the night before of a man for one pound. This is the compass.</p>

I slept in the same room the sailor did. I laid hold of one handle of the compass box, and the sailor the other, I helped him up stairs with it.

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 21st of January last, Freeman and I were in company together in Bromley between seven and eight o'clock; I saw the two prisoners; they were walking towards Poplar from Bromley in company together; each of them had a bundle. I asked them what they had got there. At first they seemed surprized at my stopping them, but upon my pressing them again they said they had some sacks. I asked Harvey where he got them; he said he bought them at a marine store shop in the Borough, he gave four shillings and sixpence a piece for them, he said, four months ago. I asked Frip where he got his; he said the other prisoner was to give him a glass for carrying them. We took them to Bow watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there examine them - A. Yes; I found eleven; there are only four here; the others are not marked; only these four were marked I called at Mr. Hills's; he said he had lost a great many sacks. When I stopped the prisoners they were about an hundred yards from the mills, going towards Poplar. These are the sacks.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There are three of the sacks marked with an S; this sack is marked with a V; I can swear to that positively. I hold in my hand the stamp by which the mark is impressed. I have lost a great many sacks of that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these sacks - A. Two shillings and nine-pence each. They are new. I gave five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Frip called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <persName id="t18140216-60-person601">A. William Slatford</persName>
             was the tenent; it was his goods that were seized for distress of rent. I paid Mr. Ing three pounds two shillings and sixpence, and then I gave the prisoner twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dispute this - A. Not to me. I settled with Mr. Ing in his presence; the prisoner made no objection. I agreed to let the prisoner have the horse and cart again for the same money; provided he would refund me the money, I would let him have it back again at any time. The horse and cart was delivered to my servant. I told the prisoner he might work for me at three shillings per day, until he could raise the money for the horse and cart. He continued to work for me until the 25th of December, in carting of bricks. He took the horse and cart away an the 25th of December, and sold it. I had overpaid him for his labour according to my books; I desired my man not to advance him no more money for his labour, and then he took the horse and cart away on Christmas day morning. I sent for the prisoner to come to me at the King's Head public-house; he came. I asked him the reason he took the horse and cart away; he said, Mr. Collins would not advance him any more money. I told him to bring the horse and cart back, and if there was any money due to him I would pay him; he said, he would see me b - r first.</p>

Yes, on the 31st of January, she wanted she said, some ribbon; I asked her what sort of ribbon, was it shoe ribbon; she said, yes. I shewed her the shoe ribbon; she said, that was not what she wanted; she wanted something wider; she bought two yards and a half at eight pence a yard. I suspected her when she bought the ribbon. I said, I missed a piece. She paid me for the ribbon she bought, and then insisted on my returning her the money. She said, she would not have what she bought as I suspected her guilty of a theft. I told her I was certain she had it; she then produced it, and put it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the ribbon - A. Seven shillings and sixpence, prime cost.</p>

               <p>Miller. I searched Jonas's premises on the 26th. The prisoner is a baker; he lives in Charlotte-street, Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Abrahams. How far from Hoxton was it when you lost this parcel - A. About a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dukeworth. On the 14th of January had you a supper with the prisoner - A. I had, with a few friends, at the White Hart, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane. The prisoner was one of the party. When the prisoner has not work enough to do he goes out to work. He is a baker. I have paid him eleven shillings for jobbing for me. I know of my own knowledge that he was at work for Mr. Gregory on the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th of January. The prisoner came to the White Hart, and staid there until half after ten o'clock, and on the 14th of January I saw him about three o'clock working in Mr. Gregory's bakehouse. I went there to invite him to the supper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hancock. Look at the books and see whether they are the same that you packed up - A. Yes, these are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 14th of January, a woman came into my shop, she said she was very poor; her husband was in trouble for debt. She said she had been taking in these numbers of the bible; she could not afford to keep them by her, if I could purchase them of her it would be of great service to her. I offered her four pounds for them. She said she kept a chandler's shop, she would take part in bread. I gave her three pounds fifteen shillings in money, and five quartern loaves. I have some knowledge of the woman, although I cannot say who she is.</p>

I did, two coats, value one pound; two waistcoats, value five shillings; a hat, value seven shillings; a neck handkerchief, value three shillings; and a silk handkerchief, value seven shillings. There was a one pound note in the pantaloons pocket. A pair of pantaloons, value four shillings, and seven shillings in silver, I saw the note in the pantaloons pocket on the Sunday evening. I saw my things when I went to bed last. They were the things I had on the Monday. I saw my things again on the Tuesday at Mr. Brooks's, the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I live in High-street. On the morning of the 8th, about nine o'clock, the prisoner pledged a hat, two coats, and two waistcoats, for eight shillings. The prosecutor came in an hour after, and claimed them. The prisoner came the next morning, and offered me a handkerchief to pledge. I sent for a constable, and had him taken in custody. The snuff-box was found on the prisoner, and two duplicates in the snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day stated in the indictment, as I was going up Oxford-street I was accosted by a man that appeared as a man that dealt in clothes; he shewed me the things in the indictment. I gave him twelve shillings for them, and being in want of money I pledged them for eight shillings, and the next morning going to the same place to pledge a handkerchief I was apprehended. Is it likely that I knew the things had been stolen? No. if I had I should not have gone there again in the course of a few hours. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

On the 21st I saw them first in Cheapside about an hour before this matter happened. There is a picture shop at the corner of Honey-lane-market; I saw the three prisoners there. I followed them from there to London-bridge; on London-bridge they came near Mr. Goodhall; he was looking through the ballustrades. I kept out of their sight as much as I could. I saw Matthews and Lyons go close up to the prosecutor. Nightingale stood and leaned on the shoulders of Matthews and Lyons.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation he stood he covered the other prisoners - A. Yes, so as we should not see their hands; it is what we call cloaking them. I saw Matthews and Lyons draw from the gentleman's pocket a handkerchief, which appeared to me to be a yellow one. I then requested Mr. Hawkins and Matthews to come over with me; I told them they had got it. We immediately went over. I saw the gentleman feel in his pocket after I said they had got it. Matthews took hold of one, Hawkins took hold of another, and I took the third. We seized one each of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the handkerchief - A. We did; the prisoner Lyons dropped it. I saw the handkerchief in Lyons's hand, and Hawkins seized it when he dropped it. Upon our seizing them I told them I had been watching them some time, and they must come with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them before magistrate - A. We did; it was just before two o'clock in the day time; we took them before the Lord Mayor. I called to the prosecutor; he went with us to the Mansion House. Hawkins has kept the handkerchief ever since.</p>

            . Q. On the 21st of January what did you observe - A. I first saw the three prisoners on London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners before - A. Not at that time, only two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mr. Goodhall first - A. Not till he extricated himself out of the crowd. I saw Nightingale between the other two prisoners as Johnson has described, leaning upon their shoulders, covering them. Lyons was in the act of going away. Lyons singled himself from the persons that were there. Lyons got out of the crowd the moment Mr. Goodhall put his hand to his pocket. I saw Lyons confused; I catched hold of him from that circumstance. I looked round on my right side; I saw Lyons throw the handkerchief from his right side. I saw him move his arm from his pocket, and I saw him throw the handkerchief on the ground; I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever escape from you - A. No. I am as clear as possibly I can be that the handkerchief fell from Lyons. He singled himself out from the other people that were there. They were taken to the Mansion House, and committed. I have kept the handkerchief ever since. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Which of the men did you know - A. Matthews and Nightingale.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I saw two of the prisoners first in Gracechurch-street; I cannot say I saw the third until Hawkins laid hold of him. The third passed me on Fish-street-hill. I saw Mr. Goodhall after the handkerchief had been taken from him. I apprehended Nightingale. I saw Hawkins pick up the handkerchief. He picked up the handkerchief close to the right side of the man whom he had seized.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that the handkerchief that was taken from your pocket on the 21st - A. It is. I have had it a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Lyons' Defence. I am innocent of it. I was going over the bridge.</p>
               <p>Nightingale's Defence. I was not near the other prisoners at the time.</p>
               <p>Matthews's Defence. I never knew of the transaction until I saw the handkerchief produced by one of the constables.</p>
               <p>Lyons called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you heard this crush was there any shoes near enough that by breaking that pane of glass any person might draw them out - A. Oh, yes. There was one pair taken away, and the second pair I found on the pavement opposite of where the glass was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then one pair had been carried away, and the other pair had dropped on the pavement - A. Yes, close under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person near when you came out - A. I did not see them that did it.</p>

               <p>HUGH MAUD. I am a servant to Messrs. Ayres. On last Wednesday evening, between six and seven o'clock, I was in the shop secreted behind a pile of carpets. The door was put to, but not fastened. I was watching, expecting something would be done amiss. The prisoner came in and took a piece of print from the window, close to the door. He turned round, and was in the act of decamping with it; I rushed upon him, and laid hold of him by the collar. He said he tumbled into the shop. A constable was sent for; he was secured. This is the printed calico; there is ten yards of it; it cost two shillings a yard; it is Messrs. Ayres property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I slipped down against the door; he put this piece of goods into my hand as I came up against the door; he put a pistol to my head and swore he would blow my brains out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday the 16th of January, I was sent for to apprehend Scarlett. I searched him; he had no money whatever. He told me he took the three three-shilling tokens of a Jew near the India house selling oranges; he said he should know the Jew was he to see him. I and Scarlett went to Leadenhall-street, and at the place he described we did not find him. We went nearer Aldgate. I told him when he saw the man to give me a signal; he gave me a signal, and I took the prisoner into custody. We took the prisoner into the Mitre public-house, Aldgate. The basket the prisoner then had answered the description Scarlett had before given me; it was an oval basket. I searched him and found on him silver that was all good. I then took him towards the Compter; in Leadenhall-street he struggled, and tried to get away from me.</p>
               <p>MR. HOMERSHAM. These three-shilling tokens are counterfeit and bad; they all came from the same die; they do not appear to have been in circulation. They are made to resemble the genuine three-shilling bank tokens.</p>

On the day stated in the indictment I saw Timms and Blackwell go to the stable; Blackwell opened the door. Timms had a large stick in his hand; he laid it against the door. Timms then took up a basket, and Blackwell filled it out of master's corn bin. Timms laid a large handkerchief on the top of the basket, and put corn into the handkerchief, and tied the corn up. The handkerchief was inclosed in the basket between the handles. He came out of the stable after he had got the corn, the oats. He put the stick through the handles, and put the basket and handkerchief on his shoulder. I came up to them; I asked them what they had got there; they said they had got anything what they could catch. I said, that is my master's property, you had better take it back again. I took a sample of it; they were black and white oats. I said, no wonder my master's horses die on the road, and that they deserved hanging.</p>

At Kensington I had occasion to speak to the coachman about some tolls, I got on the roof of the coach; I was alarmed by some boys. I got down; I saw a parcel and a box was gone. They throwed the box into a ditch; I recovered the box, but not the parcel.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty this evening at Kensington; I met the prisoner and two more men about two hundred yards this side of Kensington turnpike; the three men passed me. I thought I knew the prisoner; I said to my brother officer that was with me, there are three thieves going along the road; and before we crossed the road we saw a small cart walking by the side of a waggon. We followed the waggon. We saw the guard of the waggon; he said he had some suspicion they were going to rob the waggon. Just before they got into Kensington the cart stopped, and the waggon went on. I directly saw two of the men cross out of the foot-path; they went towards the cart; they had some little conversation. I said to Mills, there is something coming. I heard something coming through Kensington. He said he did; and as soon as ever the coach came by (it turned out to be the Exeter coach) the prisoner and the other man jumped from the cart when the coach past. The prisoner and the other man followed the coach as fast as they could run. They had not run far before one of the three men was up on the coach, in the boot; the other men were following. I heard something fall from the coach, where the men in the bottle-green coat was. I said to Miles, stop; he did. We board the parcel drop close to the wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it - A. About ten minutes before seven o'clock. It was a wet night, dark, and not many people on the road. Directly I saw the prisoner pick up the parcel I jumped from the footpath and took him into custody. I said to him, I know you, none of your tricks, if you do I will cut your ear off. I directly drawed my cutlass. I took the prisoner into the Adam and Eve public-house; I searched him; he had a knife, one shilling, and a watch upon him. I left the prisoner in Miles's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What cart was it - A. A light jockey cart, with a very good horse indeed to it. I think we had some moon at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you saw somebody following the coach had you seen these three men together - A. Not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they get into the cart - A. No, they went and talked to the men in the cart. This is the parcel I took from the prisoner's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Rees. Look at the parcel - A. This is the parcel I sent to Mr. Curtis, of Plymouth; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Brentford; that gentleman took me into custody. I was not in the coach, nor in the middle of the road, nor had I the parcel on my shoulder.</p>

             covered the ribbons over in the ribbon drawer with a bonnet; seeing that, I suspected they were going to take ribbon; one of their hands was under her bonnet, and with the other hand drawing the ribbon over the bonnet, seeing how the ribbon would look upon the bonnet, and in about a quarter of an hour they fixed on a ribbon. I cut the ribbon off, and gave it her, and they offered me a dollar; I refused the dollar, not thinking it good.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ribbon to come to - A. About ten-pence halfpenny. Then Hannah Brown went out of the shop, and said she would get change. She returned, and gave me a shilling. I took for the ribbon, and they went out of the shop; and after folding up the ribbon and placing the drawer, then appeared two vacancies in the drawer, as if two pieces of ribbon had been taken out. It struck me that they had taken them. The two prisoners came about one o'clock again, and asked to look at some ribbons again. I asked them, what sort; they said, it is not material. I shewed them a different drawer to what they had out the first time. They covered the second drawer with the bonnet, the same as they did the first. I cut them off the quantity they wished; they paid for it, and left the shop. I told Elizabeth Dimes if they came the third time to keep a sharp look out, and if she saw them take any ribbon to give me a nod, and say, yes, as I had suspected them twice; then between four and five o'clock, just at dusk, the two prisoners came again; then after they had been looking at the ribbons a quarter of an hour,

I moved her a little further, and picked up on the shop floor one piece of ribbon, and suspecting they had more about them I sent the boy to Hatton Garden office for an officer. Wood came; he searched them, and, I believe, did not find any thing on them. I gave him the ribbon, and he took them into custody.</p>

After having missed three three-shilling tokens I marked five three-shilling bank tokens, and put them in the till. That was on a Tuesday afternoon; and on Saturday the 29th of January I missed one of the marked three-shilling pieces out of the till. I then sent for an officer. I charged the prisoner with having taken it. The prisoner then took the three-shilling piece out of his breeches, and gave it me; he then said he had never taken any other. This is the three-shilling piece; it has a F marked on it; that is my mark.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 17th of February, about eleven o'clock, I went into Houndsditch, to Mr. Davis; I got twelve pair of stuff for twelve pair of shoes; going home with them (it was a cold morning) I went into a public-house, and called for half a pint of beer, and while I was taking my half pint of beer and warming myself, the prisoner came and took the bag and the leather off the table. I did not take any notice of the man when he came in, only I saw him brush off with it. I pursued him, and took him at the end of Colchester-street, by Church-lane. I took hold of the man and the property. I brought him back to the house. He was very unwilling to give it up. I got it from him, and gave him in charge of an officer.</p>

            . Q. You have the care of the cash I find - A. Yes, I have. I kept it in my own bed-room, in a drawer, which I always kept locked. On Saturday, the 12th of this month, Mr. Fincham requested me to give change of a ten-pound note; I immediately went up stairs for the change, and took the ten-pound note up with me, which I placed in the drawer with the other money; there were twenty-two two-pound bank notes, two ten-pound notes, and fifteen one's, making in the whole seventy-five pounds; they were all safe. I then locked my drawer before I came down to dinner; at which time the prisoner acknowledged to his master in the presence of the officer, he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q.You were not present to hear him - A. No; there is a witness that did hear it. About seven o'clock in the evening, I went up stairs for change of a ten-pound check, to my great surprize, I found my drawer unlocked, and the money gone. I immediately came down, and told Mr. Fincham. I was certain it could be no other person than the prisoner, nobody else had been up stairs during that time.</p>

               <p>Q. You could not tell that - A. I could. The bed-room stairs adjoins the bar; nobody could go up stairs, except a little girl that had the care of my child, and the prisoner. The prisoner was not seen after, not till Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Saturday evening, about ten o'clock. I went to the prisoner's master's house, in Great Coram-street, Brunswick-square. I told him the circumstance, and how my house was situated; he said, he thought I had great grounds of suspicion. His master requested that we should be there on Monday morning with an officer, and take him in custody; which was done.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Sunday, the 13th, Mr. Fincham applied to me to apprehend the prisoner; I went in company with Mr. Fincham to his master's house on Monday morning; I saw the prisoner; I charged him with the robbery; he at first strongly denied it. I searched the prisoner; I found thirty-six shillings in silver upon him. I bid him to lock up his room; I took him to his master. When he was there he acknowledged in the presence of Mr. Fincham, he said, he did do it, he was six days in breaking open the drawer, and getting the money. He said, he had left twenty-five pounds in a young woman's hands in Harford-street, Fitzroy-square. I went with him to the house No. 2, Harford-street, Fitzroy-square; when we went into the house, he said to the young woman, my dear, where is that money; she took this pocket-book which I produce now, out of her ridicule; she gave this book into my hand. He said, take this Mr. Brown, it is part of Mr. Fincham's money. I examined the book, and found ten two-pound notes, and nine one's in it. The five-pound note he said belonged to the young woman; the young woman is in court. He had a great many clothes that he had taken out of pawn, and new ones, which he said, he had bought with the part of the money; ten pounds he said he had paid for taking them out. I brought the pocket-book away with me. I found in a tea-caddy five pounds one shilling in silver; part of that he said belonged to the young woman; he said, the other part was to buy some linen for him. That is all I know. There was a new hat, a brooch, and a ring, that he said were bought with the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I acknowledge in the presence of my master that I had committed the fact - A. Yes; I heard you acknowledge that you had committed the fact to your master. You said ten pounds you gave to a girl, three pounds you paid to a man in Newgate, you paid six pounds for a pocket-compass, five pounds six shillings you gave for a chain, seal, and a ring, and two pounds you gave to a young woman in Hart-street, Covent Garden. That is all I can recollect. There was some more things that amounted to sixty-four pounds in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. When I gave you that money, did I say that was part of Mr. Fincham's money - A. Yes, you did.</p>

            . Q. Where do you live - A.At<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160045"/>No. 2, Harford-street, Fitzroy-square. Mr. Butcher always represented himself as a gentleman to me, and he always behaved as such to me. He came to me last Saturday night, between seven and eight o'clock, and stopped with me until Monday morning. He asked me on Sunday evening to purchase him some linen; he told me he would leave his pocketbook with me, and the things I bought for him I was to have made for him, and to have the bills in his own name, and he should call on Monday night. The officer came with Mr. Butcher on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered to the officer a pocket-book - A. Yes; that was Mr. Butcher's pocket-book; Mr. Butcher delivered it me; it was the same as he left with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing of his besides - A. There was some of his wearing apparel, which the officer took away; the wearing apparel belonged to him. The officer took likewise a five-pound note of mine, and two one's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Can you speak to any of the notes - A. I cannot identify the notes. I lost upwards of sixty pounds out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday previous to my being apprehended, I was in and out of the Union, West Indiaman, which lay off Mr. Fincham's house; when I was on board a young man gave me five-and-twenty pounds to purchase six dozen of wine, which I was to send down to Bristol to his father, and part of that money was his money; the notes now in possession of the officer are part of them notes. The time has been so short since I have been in prison, I have not had time to collect my friends to speak in my behalf.</p>

When I went to the prisoner's house I told her I had come for the six counterfeit shillings that she had promised; she put her hand to the table drawer, took out a bag, and out of that bag she gave me five counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences; I gave her for them the three indentical shillings that Armstrong had furnished me with, and as soon as this transaction happened I took the counterfeit money out in my hand, and Bishop, the officer, took it out of my hand.</p>

I marked the three good shillings in a way that I should know them again, with an A very small; I gave them to Gobey in the presence of Bishop, and my son. I and the other two officers accompanied Gobey to the prisoner's house, No. 11, Thomas's-place. In my going along I bethought myself that I had not searched Gobey's mouth, I put my fingers in his mouth; he had no money in his mouth. We went to the house No. 11, Thomas's-place, Crabtree-row, Bethnal-green; I saw him go into the door, and waited until he came out.</p>

He had no counterfeit money about him when he went into the prisoner's house, and the instant he came out of the house he was seized by Bishop. We took Gobey then into the house with us. When I came into the kitchen the prisoner was sitting by the fireside; she turned her eyes when I went in. I heard something chink upon the hearth like a shilling; my son stooped, and picked up a shilling; he said, it is a good shilling.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160046"/>He catched hold of her right hand. I heard him say here is the other two. When I came to see the three shillings I saw they were the three shillings that I had given to Gobey. Bishop searched the prisoner. I found this counterfeit money in this bag, as it is now, which is forty-three shillings and thirty-six sixpences in a cupboard; they are all counterfeits; some are fit for circulation, and some are not. I then asked her who lived there; she said, herself; her husband was at sea. She said, the goods were hers; she said, that Gobey had given her three good shillings for a debt that he had owed her some time.</p>

            . Q You were with Armstrong - A. I was; I was present also when Gobey was searched. I am quite certain he had no money whatever when he went away from the public-house, except the three good shillings given him by Armstrong. When Gobey came out of the prisoner's house I immediately took hold of his right hand, and took from his hand five shillings and two sixpences. These are them; they have been in my possession ever since. The moment Gobey came out of the house to the door I seized him, and pushed him into the room. I searched the prisoner; in her pocket I found twelve counterfeit shillings wrapped up in this dirty rag; they are fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any implements there for the purpose of making money - A. None. I found a box and a bag containing upwards of two pounds in silver. I asked Gobey in the presence of the prisoner, where he got the five bad shillings and the two bad sixpences; he said he bought them of the prisoner, he gave her three shillings for them. The prisoner made no reply to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you hear her say these things were left at her house by Gobey some time time before - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the five shillings - A. They are counterfeit, and all manufactured in the same way; they are merely coloured; and the sixpences are washed in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the forty-three shillings and thirty-six sixpences found in that bag in the cupboard - A. These are all counterfeit; some of them want colouring; some have been coloured, and are fit for circulation.</p>

            . I am a stay-maker in St. Clement's church-yard. On the 20th of January, Mr. Gibbons offered me some stays. After I had got them home my foreman informed me they were Mr. Marsden's property. I sent to Mr. Marsden; he owned the whole of the property. I bought sixty-eight pair of stays of Mr. Gibbons; I gave him five shillings a pair for them. Mr. Gibbons is an actioneer. I saw the goods before I bought them.</p>
               <p>MR. GIBBONS. I am an auctioneer. I bought some stays of the female prisoner, and some I redeemed. She told me she manufactured them. She told me to go to Mr. Grover, the pawnbroker, for the stays. I enquired her character of Mr. Grover; he told me she was a good character. I gave my porter the money to redeem the stays.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know, certain stays were brought to you by your porter, you gave him the money to redeem them - A. Yes, and I sent a sample of them stays to Mr. Mills. Mr. Mills gave me five shillings a pair for them. I went to the prisoner's apartment; they were then working at a late hour in the night. I told them there was a charge against them that these stays had been improperly obtained; that it was necessary they should accompany me to Mr. Marsden. I told them Mr. Marsden said they were his patterns. The prisoners said they had the same patterns in paper as Mr. Marsden, and the same scoreing-boards. The female said, I have bought stays of Mr. Marsden for the purpose of taking the patterns off. I did not deliver the stays to Mr. Mills in the first instance; they were left at a private-house in Windmill-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of your own knowledge these stays ever reached Mr. Mills - A. No.</p>

On the 14th of February, I was coming out of place; I took another woman to assist me in carrying my box. We went into the Three Crowns to get some refreshment. We came out of the Three Crowns, and came to a place called North-street, Whitechapel-road. I sat down the box to rest myself upon; the prisoner came up, and said he would carry it for me. I sent the woman home; I told him I was a stranger in London, and knew nobody. I gave him the box.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it - A. Between five and six. I gave him the box to carry to Edward's-place, Kensington-road; I followed him; he ran off with the box. I not knowing the place, I returned home, and gave up my box for lost. Not knowing any where about there, I did not know how to turn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was your home - A.Edward's-place, Kensington-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards - A. The next day, at the office in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. did you ever see your box again - A. I did.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer and plaister; I live in Gossip's-buildings, Whitechapel-road. My son came in; he said, father, there are two men fighting at the bottom of the court; I went out, and said, what is the matter; why, said one of the men, this man has robbed the woman of her box, I want him to go with me, he will not go. I said, he must go. The other man had got hold of the prisoner by the collar; he asked me to take the box; I did. We took the prisoner to the Three Crowns, to enquire if he had been drinking with a girl. We found he had been there with a girl. We could not find the girl. The man that had hold of the prisoner by his collar went away; a constable came, and took the prisoner to the office, and I took the box. This is the box that laid down by the prisoner.</p>

            . I am the pot-boy. I was in the tap-room; the other man asked the way into the yard. The prisoner went out into the yard. I went in the yard, and missed the pots. The prisoner, after he had taken the pots, he went up to the bar to pay for what he had had. I ran and knocked my elbow against him; I felt the pots.</p>

            . I was sitting in Mr. Poundfoot's tap-room on the 1st. The prisoner and another man came in together, and they went out together. Mr. Poundfoot hallooed out, stop thief. I went out, and brought the prisoner back again; he had one pot in his pocket, three in his breeches, and one in his jacket pocket. These are the pots.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this public-house with a man, and had part of a pint of porter with him. He persuaded me to go down the yard and take some pewter pots, which I denied. He took five pint pots and one quart pot; he told me to put them in my pockets; he gave me eighteen pence, and when the boy missed the pots he ran away. I humbly beg your lordship to shew as much mercy as you think proper.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City. On the 3d of February last, about seven in the evening, I saw the three prisoners going through Cranbourne-alley into St. Martin's-court; knowing them, I followed them. I saw Smith and Williams following Mr. Garthwaite. I followed them through the court, until they came to the end of Newport-market. The prisoner, Williams, walked sharply up to the gentleman, laid hold of the bottom of his coat, and drawed the handkerchief out of his pocket. The prisoners not being close together, I let them cross over towards Long Acre, and directly they crossed over towards Long Acre the prisoner, Williams, gave the handkerchief to Smith. I saw which way they were going, and suspecting they were going into Cranbourne-alley again, I ran and apprised the prosecutor that he had lost his handkerchief; he came back with me. I told him that I knew the lads that had taken his handkerchief; if he would come back with me I would pick them out. We met with the prisoners again in St. Martin's-court; they were about two or three yards from each other. The prisoner, Williams, was following another gentleman. I told the prosecutor they had just passed us; I would let them go further on before I took them. I followed them into New-street. I saw Williams and Smith follow a gentleman close there. Brown was some distance behind. I let them go into the piazzas, and there I took Smith and Williams, and Mr. Garthwaite took John Brown. I searched the prisoners; on the prisoner, Smith, I found this handkerchief; this handkerchief belongs to the prosecutor; it was in Smith's hat. I saw Williams take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Smith, and on Smith I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at your handkerchief - A.It is my handkerchief; it has my initials on it.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I am innocent of the charge alleged against me.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I met the prisoner, Williams, in Covent Garden; he told me he had a handkerchief he would sell me for half-a-crown. How he came possessed of it I know not. I said I would get the money for it of my mother.</p>

On the 27th of January, the prisoner was detected in a petty theft. He was my errand-boy. He was detected of taking something out of the cupboard in the kitchen, which was found upon him. It was about eight o'clock in the morning, and when the meat and butter was found in his possession I was called down. I accused him of taking these things; he acknowledged it. I went to Marlborough-street office; I then went with the officer to his mother's apartment; we there found the spoons, the coat, and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is he - A. Eighteen or nineteen. He has been with me six years. Until we discovered this robbery he behaved with the greatest propriety; he was a very industrious, civil, quiet, lad. I would not have prosecuted him if I had not been bound over. I would take him again now; I know he would not be guilty of the like offence.</p>

Whittaker came near the counter, and took some things off. I ran after him; he lot the things fall at the door. I picked them up and brought them in the shop. It was a coat and a pelisse.

I went out after Whittaker; I found him at the bottom of Church-lane; I brought him back. I asked the prosecutor if that was the man; he said, yes.

When I came to Smithfield I was unacquainted with the ways of Smithfield, or else I should have had the horse booked. I saw the horse at the top of Hosier-lane. It was a bay gelding; it was tied to the rails in the market. I looked at the horse, and Clark run it down the lane immediately. I spoke to Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Giles - A. No, not then. I asked Edwards whether the horse was free from all vice; he said, yes. I then went down Hosier-lane, to the Fox and Knot public-house. I agreed with Edwards for the sum of eight pounds. If the horse was not approved of the money was to be returned, and I was to return the horse in two or three days. When I paid for the horse Giles was not in the room.</p>

             and me. Roberts asked me if I would prove a bill under Kinghorn's commission. In half an hour afterwards I went with Roberts to Kinghorn in the Fleet prison. I found Kinghorn, Roberts, and Forest, together, and several more. I cannot say whether Kinghorn was in the coffee-room or the tap, in the Fleet. Roberts said I would prove a bill under his commission. Kinghorn pulled out several bills from his pocket; he asked me if I would prove a bill of two hundred pounds; I said, no. He agreed that the last bill for sixty-seven pounds four shillings. He himself took that bill out of his pocket; he agreed that should be the bill I was to prove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the bill - A. Yes, this is the bill; it was endorsed by Forest at that time, and I have since put my initials upon it to know it again; here is I T G upon the back of it, drawn by James Ferrest. I have seen Forrest write; it is his hand-writing. This bill was given to me by Kinghorn. Roberts requested me to attend the next day at Guildhall to prove the bill. Kinghorn and Roberts promised me one pound for the job. I attended the next day at Guildhall, and something that Swancot said induced the commissioners to adjourn the meeting. The meeting was adjourned to the 30th of November; between that time and the 30th of November I saw Kinghorn two or three times in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Kinghorn any part of the one pound - A. He sent me down ten shillings by Mr. Sanderson on the 11th of January. In the Fleet, Kinghorn stated to me that I had received ten shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160050"/>part of the one pound, he sent it by Sanderson. I afterwards disclosed the whole of the transaction to Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>KENNEDY SWANCOT. I formerly was a housekeeper in Foster-lane; I now live in Duke-street, Lambeth; I carry on business in the jobbing way I am now a prisoner in the Fleet Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the Fleet Prison - A. I did, on the 15th of November, I saw him in the Fleet. I was in the Ship public-house, Little Bridge-street; there were Gregory,

            , Sanderson, Wheatley, and two or three more, whose names I do not know; Roberts called me out, and said something about Kinghorn; I said, I would see Mr. Kinghorn, he owed me some money. I went to Kinghorn; he was then in the Fleet. I told Kinghorn, Roberts had desired me to prove a small bill for him. Kinghorn begged very hard for me to do it. I said, I would prove no bill. I said, Mr. Kinghorn do away your friendly commission, and let your creditors have the just property that is left; he said, it is gone too far, how can I recall it back. He asked me if I had seen Edwards; I said, yes, I had seen him that morning. He asked me if he would come forward and prove two bills of two hundred pounds as he had promised; he left the two bills at my house. I took the bills to Edwards; Edwards said he would prove one, and his friend was to prove the other. Kinghorn said, if Edwards proved them it would be ten pounds in his way. The majority would be in his favour for the choice of assigness. I went to Guildhall the next morning; I called in at the Castle, going; Gregory was there. I told him if he had come to prove a fictitious bill I would stop him. I stopped them from choosing assignees; I told the commissioners what I knew. In consequence of that they adjourned the meeting. I saw Mr. Kinghorn after that, be gave me five pounds; he said he was very sorry for what was past, you will hold your tongue for the future; I hope you will say no more, and I will pay you the the other five in a few days; he was really my debtor. I attended the choice of assignees, and then I was arrested by a friend of Mr. Kinghorn's for an unlawful debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the plantiff in that arrest - 
               <persName id="t18140216-97-person908">A. John Richard Pim</persName>
            , of Marsh-gate, Lambeth; I owed him nothing, not an halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Kinghorn after that - A. I saw him on Monday after Christmas day; I told him I had been arrested for a false debt; he said, he was sorry, he had nothing to do with the arrest; he hoped I would not impute it to him. He wanted to see Mr. Davis, who was his principal creditor; he wanted to arrange matters, as he had been misled by the other party.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIS. I am a corn-chandler, I live in Warren-street, Fitzroy-square. I am a creditor of the prisoner's under the commission; I was a creditor to about seven hundred pounds; I have proved under the commission one hundred and fifty pounds; I had parted with the books to my brother. I could only prove one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any disclosure made to you by Swancot and Gregory - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of November do you remember by something that Swancot stated to the commissioners, the commissioners postponed the meeting - A. I do; the meeting was adjourned. On the 27th of December, Swancot brought the prisoner to me in Mark-lane. Swancot brought Kinghorn to me at my house in Warren-street on the next night; Kinghorn then told me he had something to say to me; I said, what have you to say; I have nothing to say to you. He said, he wished to make some arrangement to prevent me from going to Guildhall. I asked him what he had got me; he told me he had his country-house, that was made over to his friend, it was worth an hundred and fifty pounds; I should have that, and also some money that he had got, and some money that a friend had, which I should have in preference to any other creditor. I told him I would have nothing to do with the lease of his house, to put away the swindlers he had about him. If he had any money to let the just creditors have the property; he replied, I might well say that, for he had got a set of great villians about him; he had expended five hundred pounds within a few months. I told him that I had got the false bill in the hands of my attorney for sixty-seven pounds; he admitted I had, and he was sorry for it. I told him I should prosecute him; he said, he was sorry for it. He wished to make an arrangement with me, he did not mind any other creditor as he did me. I am the greatest loser by him. Kinghorn admitted to me he had given the bill of sixty-seven pounds to Gregery.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the amount of debts proved under the commission including all these bills - A. Foar thousand three hundred pounds. Only eleven pounds have been realized, and only seventy pounds the amount of the whole of the real debts.</p>

             is indebted to him in the sum of twenty-seven pounds, for money that the said John Kelly had and received for the use of the deponent, and this deponent maketh oath that it has not yet been paid to him.</p>
               <p>MR. COOK. Q. What public-house did M'Laghan keep at the time of the appraisement - A. The Black Horse in Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed on his part to survey the furniture - A. I was employed by Mr. Nicolls, the comer-in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was employed by Mr. Laghan - A. Mr. Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you an inventory of the goods - A. I have, and the receipt of the sum total. The sum total was fifty-six pounds ten shillings. This valuation was made on the 27th of December, 1810. The account was settled between M'Laghan and Kelly.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the settlement did any person attend - A. Yes, the brewer's clerk and the distiller's clerk. The brewer was the landlord; he received the rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money paid by Kelly to him - A. Yes, by M'Laghan's request. Mr. Kelly asked M'Laghan if he should pay the creditors: M'Laghan said, yes. The money was paid to the creditors. There was some money left: I saw that handed over to M'Laghan. I cannot speak to the actual sum. The money paid over to the defendant he received as all that was coming to him without any objection, and he seemed very well satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the total charge of Mr. Kelly for his trouble on that occasion - A. Six guineas; that is a fair sum for the trouble he had with it, and whatever was the remaining sum was paid over to M'Laghan.</p>

            . Were you employed by M'Laghan at the Black Horse in Barbican - A. Yes. One hundred and ninety-six pound was the appraisement. This appraisement was made in the book at the time; one hundred and thirty-six pound five shillings and five-pence was the balance after deducting the taxes and rent from one hundred and ninety-six pound five shillings and five-pence. One hundred and thirty-six pound five shillings and five pence was the sum the defendant had to receive. My clerk made this accompt in my presence; that money was in my possession. On the 26th, me and Cook settled the business. It is usual to have all the tradesmen who have demands on the public-house; they were present. There was Mr. Dellafere for a book debt; the landford for a years rent had forty-five pound; the book debt, I think, was fifty-three pound two shillings and five pence; Mr. Maxwell, the cooper, for guaging, one pound six shillings and six pence. Mr. Windus, the distiller's account, was fifteen pound fifteen shillings and eight pence; then there is six guineas added to it, my charge, that was deducted that made one hundred and twenty-seven ten shillings and seven pence, leaving in my hands a balance of sixty-eight pounds fourteen shillings and ten pence. I paid him the balance before all the gentlemen present. My clerk put all the notes down. I paid him either with my own hands or by my clerk, and he was very well satisfied. This was on the 27th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. From that 27th of December until May, 1812, was there any money transaction between him and you - A. None, whatever. When the agreement was first entered into he received the deposit himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterward arrested at his suit - A. Yes, on or somewhere about the 5th of November, 1812, in Castle-street, Leicester-square. I advertised his house; that money was to be paid me again. I had two pounds of him for advertising the house. I think that was the sum itself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in custody - A. Not long. The gentlemen of the office took my word to find bail. I was not in custody a great while.</p>
