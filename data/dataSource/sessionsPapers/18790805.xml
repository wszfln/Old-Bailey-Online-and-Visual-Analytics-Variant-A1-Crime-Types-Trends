Alexander, of Hare Court, Temple, to engross a deed and assignment of a lease by endorsement; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lease—he pro<lb/>duced a draft from which I was to prepare the assignment—I gave the draft and the lease to my clerk, Beckham, telling him to make it so that the last part of it should be on the back of the lease, because there was no room to engross the whole of it on the original lease; after he had done it I ex<lb/>amined it—blanks were left for the name of the assignor; the name of the assignee, John Litton, was in the draft—the date was left blank—he said he required it to be ready next morning—the charge was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was out when he called; I left directions to ask for the money, and on my return I heard he had been—he came on the 30th and paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at that time it was engrossed—at the time it left me it had not the Inland Revenue stamp on it—I never saw the prisoner again until he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Furnival's Inn; I and my wife are interested in the premises of 17, Upper Montague Street—the late Mrs. Elizabeth Whitfield Alexander was the tenant under a lease from 1873 up to September 1878—she bought the lease about that time and remained so; the old lease was surrendered, and the lease of September 27th, 1878, was granted by me and my wife, and Mrs. Alexander signed a counterpart, I have it here—I delivered the lease personally to her—it was a lease for 17 years to Michaelmas, 1895, at a rent of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—at the Christmas quarter 1878 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due for rent; that was brought into my office in my absence—on 13th January I received this letter from the prisoner. "Sir,—Please send receipt to me as executor of the late Mrs. Alexander, and ask Mr. Sampson to pay enclosed, and make allowance. Mrs. Alex<lb/>ander on 14th November assigned to me by deed of assignment the lease of this house to save further trouble of rent, so I must pay you in future." On 17th January some correspondence occurred with regard to the fire insurance not being made by Mrs. Alexander according to covenant—on 20th January, 1873, I received this letter from him: "Mrs. Alexander being in want of money, executed to me the assignment for valuable consideration; the money was borrowed and secured by a bill of sale on the furniture, and was raised for the repairs of the house; it is being rapidly cleared off by me. I am willing to surrender the lease upon your granting a new one." I wrote to him on the 23rd January requesting him to furnish me with a verbatim copy of the assignment by Mrs. Alexander to him, and to produce the original for inspection; in answer to that I received this letter of the 24th: "The verbatim copy of the assignment will be in your hands on Monday, and I hope the original." I afterwards received this copy of the assignment, it was left at my chambers by some one; I don't know by whom. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Taylor</hi>: "This copy was made in my establishment, for Mr. Kershaw, a solicitor in Gray's Inn.") This letter of 8th February I received from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that a copy of the assignment had been duly sent, and as soon as he could put his hand on the original he would send it; it also stated that the Sheriff had put a man in possession, and proposed, as suggested by Mr. Furber his solicitor, that the prisoner should lodge with the witness the Christmas rent which he had received, and put a man in possession to oust the Sheriff.</hi>) I replied to that letter on 10th February, expressing my sur<lb/>prise that such a dishonest and unprofessional proposition should come from a barrister or solicitor, and that I should consider whether it was not my duty to bring it before the Incorporated Law Society—I received this reply of 11th February. (<hi rend="italic">This denied the imputation of anything dishonourable in the proposition, and explained that Mr. Furber's suggestion was merely made in a jocular conversation.</hi>) Since the prisoner's committal I have had to pay 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for repairing the house; the prisoner may have done some re<lb/>pairs, but they must have been very trifling—the last letters were his on 10th and mine on 11th March—in all the letters he refers to an assignment of 23rd October—I first saw the alleged forged assignment of 3rd December at the Clerkenwell Police-court, when I attended as a witness, after he had been tried at the Middlesex Sessions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not present at that trial, I was present when he was brought up for judgment—I heard Mr. Barker give evidence as to the prisoner's position—something was said about his being interested in a sum of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had recently received a legacy of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his sister-in-law—I have known the prisoner about two years—I do not know what the relations were between him and Mrs. Alexander—he did not call on me in her company, except when she signed the new lease—he wrote and asked me to grant a renewal of the lease—I offered a renewal of it to him or Mrs. Alexander; he did not to my knowledge pay the rent of the house during Mrs. Alexander's lifetime—I did not enter into negotiation with him as to his paying the rent—I will explain how it arose: when the proposed surrender of the old lease was made I told him and Mrs. Alexander that as to the rent due at Michaelmas, I had no power to distrain under the new lease, and therefore, as I had no desire to be paid beforehand, he and she must sign a promissory note for thai quarter's rent—I believed that the prisoner was the assignee of this lease after Mrs. Alexander's death—he wrote and told me so; I had no other reason for believing it—I do not not know Mr. Benham, I have heard of him—in one of the prisoner's letters he gives the name of Mr. Benham, as one of the witnesses to the assignment—I received that letter after Mrs. Alexander's death—I never saw the mutilated assignment, exeept at the Clerkenwell Police-court; I never heard a word about it till after Mrs. Alexander's death—I sent a clerk to Mr. Benham after receiving the draft assignment—I have never seen Mr. Benham—I believe he is a solicitor of Furnival's Inn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I received a letter on 11th September from the prisoner, asking me to renew the lease to him or Mrs. Alexander for 7, 14, or 21 years—that was the only way in which his name was proposed; in 1878 the lease had about four years to run—it was afterwards arranged with Mrs. Alexander that the new lease was to be in her name, and not in his; and it was so executed—I wrote this letter to him on 25th September, enclosing draft surrender of the old lease for perusal and approval, and on that he and Mrs. Alexander became jointly liable for a quarter's rent—the property referred to by Mr. Barker was his wife's trust money, and was nearly entirely encumbered.</p>

I am a member of the firm of White and Druce, house agents, 20, Brook Street—about November, 1878, Mrs. Alexander called on me—Mr. Litton called first to ask us to make an inventory and valuation of the furniture at 17, Upper Montague Street—one of our firm asked for what purpose it was, and he said he wanted to have some idea what the value of the things was—we said we would see Mrs. Alexander upon it—I called on her at 17, Upper Montague Street, and got her permission to make the inven<lb/>tory—on 7th February I received this letter from the prisoner, it was. im<lb/>pounded at the trial (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—In reply to your letter I beg to say that, being sole owner of this house, I still wish you to keep it on your books for letting," &amp;c.)

I live at 71, Drury Lane; that is a hosier's shop—about a week or ten days before July 8, I think it was on a Friday, I sold the prisoner a pair of socks, price 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he tendered a half-crown; I put it in the till where there were no other half-crowns, and gave him the change and he left—Mr. Jackson went to the till a few minutes afterwards, took it, out and said that it was bad; it sounded very dull; I did not see him destroy it—the prisoner came again a week or ten days afterwards for a pair of socks, it was on a Tuesday; I recognised him before he tendered any money; he gave me a half-crown—I gave it to Mr. Jackson, who gave him in custody as it was bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this shop in Drury Lane—I came in on the first occasion shortly after the prisoner left, and found a half-crown in the till, it was the only one there—it was, as near as I can tell, Friday, 27th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050011"/>
               <p>June—I tried the half-crown with my teeth, they sank in it, and I hammered it in two; it was rather brittle and it had a white look—I was rather annoyed and vented my rage on it—I flattened it together and destroyed it—I was in the shop on the 8th when the prisoner came in; the last witness spoke to me and handed me a half-crown like the first—I said to the prisoner. "This is the second time you have tried this on, young man; have you any more about you?"—he said "No," and that he did not know it was bad or he would not have given it—I gave him in custody—I doubled it in two, but did not break it—I was so satisfied that it was bad that I threw it away.</p>

I am a clerk, at 2, Picton Villas, Dart<lb/>mouth Park Hill, N.W.—about 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9th July, I was near the Reservoir, Pentonville Road, and saw the prisoner and another man and woman standing near an archway—as I passed them the prisoner asked me the time—I took out my watch, which he immediately seized with one hand, and seized me by the throat with the other, and the other man also took hold of me—I struggled and called out, "Police!" and they pulled me down 4 or 5 yards to the archway, and a policeman came—this is my silver watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I saw it at the police-court, and it has part of the chain attached, which was broken at the bar—I also lost a bunch of keys, a knife, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money out of my trousers pocket—I felt a hand in the pocket while on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, at St. Paul's Lodge, St. Paul's Road, Camden Town—on 19th July, about 1.30 am., while going up High Street, Bloomsbury, near St. Giles's Church, I felt something like the report of a pistol in my right ear, but I do not know what it was, and I fell to the ground—I saw no one—I then saw two men unbuttoning my coat—I have a slight recollection of Riley, but cannot swear to him—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my trousers pocket, but missed nothing but an ivory two foot rule—was five or six minutes on the ground—a cabman came up and called "Stop thief!"—I think the cab had a grey horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Beaton, of 35, Church Street—the prisoner came with a child to lodge there on 19th May in the second-room back—she told me that she went out charing, but I did not know when she was in or when she was out—she had a latch-key—I saw the child a fortnight before its death, she was taking it out in the daytime in her arms, and it seemed to be all right—during the week before its death I noticed that the prisoner was drinking—I first noticed that on 2nd July, when she was coming into the passage, and asked her if she had any milk for the child, she said "Yes"—I said, "If you have not I will get you some"—she said, "I never neglect the child"—next day, Thursday, I called her downstairs about 10 a.m., and gave her advice; I told her that she must not drink, and if anything happened to the child while she was drunk she would get herself into trouble—she said that she had met a friend and had a glass, but it should not occur again—she was quite sober then—I saw her next on Saturday morning about 9 o'clock in the passage, she had been out for some milk and eggs—I said, "I thought you were out, for the baby 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. crying"—she said, "I have been to get its breakfast," but she never gave it its breakfast because it is in the room now—she went upstairs with the milk and eggs—I saw her again that afternoon in the street standing against an oil-shop very drunk—I did not see her again till between 7 and 8 o'clock, when I opened the door to her and the doctor—she was then drunk—we all three went upstairs and found her room locked; she had not got the key, but I had one with which I opened the door—we had no light—we went into the room—the child was lying on the couch all of a heap, not dressed, and the doctor said that it was dead—I said that the prisoner ought to be charged with causing its death by negligence—she made no answer—the doctor said that there was quite sufficient, and that was why he took it up—there was only the egg and a spoonful of sour milk in a jug in the room, not more than a wineglassful—when I saw her in the morning she had a small teacupful of milk—I noticed a feeding-bottle on the mantelshelf—the Coroner's officer fetched the body—after the doctor left, the prisoner went</p>

               <p>out again, and came in quite drunk and incapable—she was locked up, the detectives searched her room next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner fetched the doctor and walked upstairs with him, she had got sober then—I think half the milk was still in the room in the evening and half of it had been used—the child was lying on its side with its head on a pillow, and its limbs drawn up—it had its ordi<lb/>nary clothes on—I had seen it about four times in six weeks, but it always had a veil over its face which I saw through—it looked very thin—I never heard it cough—when I asked her if she had enough to keep her, she said that she had this money and whatever else she could do—she paid me to 30th June—I had no reason to think that the child was not properly treated—I never saw it dirty.</p>

I am married and live at 13, Lumber Court—I have known the prisoner about three months—I met her on Friday, the day before the child died, and went with her to her room; the child was lying on a sofa—I went to take it up, but she said "Don't take him up," and I left him—he moved one arm—the prisoner was intoxicated—we went out for half an hour and came back, but did not go inside again—I left her at the street door about 7 o'clock—she had a glass of ale while she was out, that was while she was in an intoxicated state—I went there next day, Saturday, about 1 o'clock, but the prisoner was out—I went again about 5 o'clock and found the prisoner's door locked, I shook it and heard the baby cry—I did not see her that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Coroner's officer—on Saturday evening, July 5th, I went to the prisoner's room and saw a dead child there—it was dressed—Mrs. Beaton undressed it and I had it taken to the Mortuary—I had not seen the prisoner before that, but I saw her afterwards about 8 o'clock very drunk—that was before the child was taken away—I asked her if she had had any medical attendance for the child—she said "I took it to the dispensary last week"—I said "Why did not you take it again, have you had anybody since then?"—she said "No"—I said When did the child die?"—she said the night before, in the night—she was then locked up for being drunk and incapable—I searched the room and found six pawn tickets, one dated July 1, for a shawl, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; another July 3, for two child's gowns, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; another July 4, for a frock and cape, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; another July 5, for a child's gown and frock, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; there was also a quilt on 2nd July, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and a petticoat on 3rd July for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw about a wine glass of milk in a jug on the window ledge; it smelt very sour and it had a thick coat on the top—it may have been fetched the first thing that morning;</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister and live at 28, Dean Street—she is single, but being middle aged she was called Mrs. Jordan—she formerly lived with me and went out charing and washing when she could get it—I always gave her eighteenpence for doing my washing, and sometimes she got eighteenpence from a lady living in my house—I sent my daughter to get this letter from the Westminster General Dispensary, Gerard Street, Soho, and gave it to the prisoner, who had asked me to get it, but they have put George Ellen instead of George Allan Partridge—medicine is perfectly free there when you get the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I used to see the child frequently after it went to Church Street, quite two days a week—it was brought to my house while she was at work—it was well fed there, when I gave my baby the bottle I gave this child the same—my child is a year old—the prisoner was kind to the child, she could not have been kinder had it been her own; it was well attended to and clean—it had bronchitis a fortnight after it came, and I sent her to fetch its mother, as I thought it might die—the mother came and it was taken once to a doctor in Brewer Street, who gave it medicine; it took it and seemed better—I gave it cod-liver oil, that was before it went to Church Street, which was on 19th May; it began to fall off before it left my place, and after it got thinner and thinner, and I begged her to give it up—she said he was a little companion and she could not part with him—it took an hour to feed him, as he was always choking—I saw him on the Monday before his death—my sister brought him to my place, he was then awfully thin, his skin was like bags, but he was clean.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., M.R.C.S. I live at 33, Dean Street, Soho—on Saturday, 5th July, at 8.30 p.m., the prisoner came to me very drunk; she was a strangerto me—she said, "Will you come and see a baby who is ill?" and at that moment reeled into my chest—I declined to go as I did not like her looks—I said, "Where do you come from?"—she said some name at 28, Dean Street—she understood questions, but she could not stand—she muttered, "I don't think you can do any good, for I think the child is dead"—I said, "Has any one attended the child?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Walk on, and I will follow you"—she went on and reeled from side to side; on reaching her lodgings she was so drunk she could not open the door; the landlady opened it and charged her with neglecting the child—an altercation took place between them—I went to the second floor and found the door locked; the landlady unlocked it—I went in and saw a dead child on a couch—it was dressed—I lifted it up and found it cold and rigid—I concluded it had been dead 12 hours at least—I left, and on Sunday saw the child again at the mortuary—it was very emaciated and dirty, its back was covered with excrement up to the shoulders, which had dried on hard—I had difficulty in getting it off—it might have been there four days—the verge of the anus was raw and dirty, which might be from internal causes—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050019"/>
               <p>the foreskin was very much swollen, so that the orifice of the urethra was completely blocked up—it was phymosis—that might have arisen from in<lb/>ternal causes and from secretion and want of washing; it ought to have been fomented and kept down—decomposition had very much advanced on the Sunday, which indicated either a very low power of life, or that the child had been dead a long time—the skin of the right elbow was knocked off about the size of a shilling, as if the child had fallen out of bed—it weighed 9 1/4 lb., and the average weight of a child of that age is 18 or 201b.—he was 24 inches long, which is above the average, and he must have been a very fine child—I afterwards made a post mortem, and found the brain very soft with a small quantity of fluid in the ventricles—there were no signs of teeth, there were miliary tubercles in the upper part of both lungs, but no suppuration; it had suffered from bronchitis which had filled the trachea to its lower part—the heart was ill-nourished and the walls flabby, it fell down when I took it out, and could not retain its shape—the stomach was smaller than usual and contained about a tea-spoonful of what appeared to be milk, the gall bladder was much distended—the omentum was devoid of fat—the intestines were generally empty; the large bowel contained a small quantity of faeces; the bladder was dis<lb/>tended with urine to the utmost limit; the mesenteric glands were enlarged—the immediate cause of death was bronchitis—the child had required medical care for a long time—the prescription on this dispensary letter of May 13th is for bronchitis—the state of the child a week before its death must unquestionably have shown that it required care and attention and very careful feeding—I came to the conclusion from the distended state of the stomach and the gall bladder, that it had not been fed for a long time—I have a very large experience, and it is quite exceptional when children do not take food—there was mesenteric disease and that would account for the emaciation combined with miliary tubercles and bronchitis, but I do not think it would account for all I saw—there was tubercular deposit which would account for a great deal of the emaciation—the distention of the bladder would not have any bad effect, that might be temporary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bronchitis under favourable circumstances is often fatal to children and old people, more so than to people in middle life—it would be objectionable to give heavy food to a child 11 months old suffering from bronchitis; it is objectionable at all times to an infant, but I say it should have beef-tea—the emaciation of the child was not traceable to bronchitis per se; tubercles had appeared on the lungs, which were the cause of the bronchitis; the enlargement of the mesenteric glands was the cause of the bronchitis, and that arises frequently when children are brought up by hand—tubercular disease, mesenteric disease, and bronchitis may all exist in a child carefully tended—I should not expect the child to be emaciated to the extent this child was, although it had bronchitis on May 18th, extending to July 5th.

I am the prisoner's daughter, and am 11 years old—I lived with my father and mother at 13, Eton Street—on 10th July, from 3 to half-past, my father was cutting bread and butter for me in a washhouse near the kitchen; my brother came in, and my father said "Have you been looking after work?"—he said "No, you are better able to work than I am"—father said "I am not; will you have some bread-and-butter?"—he said "I want something better than bread-and-butter"—father said "I have nothing else"—then my brother used bad language to my father, and struck him in the chest, and I ran to the washhouse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My brother lived at home; he was often out of work, and was ill-tempered and quarrelsome—my mother supports the family—my brother threatened to murder my father a year ago, and he struck my mother and knocked her teeth out—he was violent and threatening to his father on the day in question—his father is so ill that he cannot earn his living, and cannot walk any distance without help—he had the knife in his hand when the threatening took place, he did not take it up after—my brother struck him an angry hard blow which frightened me, and I ran away to get protec<lb/>tion for my father—he had cut some bread-and-butter, and was cutting more, and was standing up—I did not see what took place after my brother struck him.</p>

I also live at 13, Eton Street—the washhouse is at the back of the kitchen occupied by the prisoner—on 10th July, about 3 o'clock, I was in the washhouse, and heard quarrelling in the kitchen—the last witness ran in to me, and said "Oh, Miss Ellis, my father and George are quarrelling!"—George was the prisoner's son—while she was speaking George ran upstairs—I ran after him soon afterwards, and saw him in the street lying on the ground—he was brought into the passage by the police, and some brandy was given to him—the prisoner came into the passage, but they did not speak to each other—a doctor came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 43, Livingstone Road, Clapham—on 26th September last I was living at 15, Regent Square, and the prisoner was lodging there, he sold me 15 yards of velveteen, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me later in the day whether I would like to buy some more, and produced this pawn-ticket ("26th Sept., 1878, for velveteen, 10a"), and said "Will you buy this ticket?"—I said "I do not wish for any more of it;" but after a time I agreed to buy it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I paid him—in March last I went to Mr. Cloud, pawnbroker, 14 and 16, Kenton Street, Brunswick Square, and learned that the velveteen had already been redeemed—I have never received the velveteen or the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in his handwriting, and to the best of my belief the signature, "John Sutton, M.D.," to this declaration is his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He sold me the ticket for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the evening of the day I bought the 15 yards, 26th September—I took the house at 15, Regent Square from the prisoner, who had been then living there two years—soon after I took the house he went to 64, Guildford Street—he had bought that house for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800Z.—I knew he had a large account'at the Birkbeck Bank—I know Mr. Weston and have seen him here to-day—I have heard there was a Dr. Miller at Regent Square, but I never saw him or knew him—there were two plates on the door, one Mr. Sutton, the other Dr. Miller<lb/>Sutton had an American diploma—he gave me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not as a present, but money I had lent him—he has had money from me for years past—I lent him money for law costs—I have been in Dublin a long time ago with Sutton, but do not know whether it was the Clarence Hotel—I may have pawned articles in his name—I have never passed as Mrs. Sutton—I do not think I ever pawned goods at Mr. Cloud's in the name of Sutton—I might have done so at Ebsley's years ago—I have seen Miss Glover or Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Mazoni here to-day—I have never passed in the name of Mrs. Sutton—I never saw an announcement in a Dublin paper that Dr. Sutton and his wife were staying at the Clarence Hotel—I have never lived with him as his wife, I decline to answer the question—I swore at the police-court that I never did—I decline to say whether I slept in the same room with him—I have not lived with him as his wife or mistress—I have been in Ireland with him and Mrs. Blodd, and have stayed at a hotel with him, but not as Mrs. Sutton—I never was at Manchester—there was an action pending between Sutton and myself, but not when I went to redeem</p>

               <p>the velveteen in March—it was a ridiculous action, there was nothing in it—I never threatened to ruin him; I have been the saving of him—he has threatened to be the ruin of me—in my evidence before Mr. Flowers on a charge against Sutton by a woman named Baines I said "The prisoner came to my house and asked me to buy the pair of earnings produced, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them. He said 'Unless you buy them of me poor Mrs. Baines will have to sleep in the workhouse'"—Sutton was acquitted—I was the landlady of 15, Regent Square—there was an interpleader summons before Mr. Justice Field at chambers, and he made an order against me, and I appealed at chambers before the Judge by counsel, and the decision was against me—Sutton was not then practising as a doctor at 15, Regent Square—I know nothing about his practising at Guildford Street—the medicine patent is mine—he did not discover the medicine, or register it in my name, because he was the proprietor of another patent—Dr. Barringer, a friend of mine, discovered it, and gave me the receipt four or five years ago, for nothing—he has often spoken to Sutton about it—I have not complained of Sutton breaking his promise to marry me, or threatened to ruin him in con<lb/>sequence—he bought me a dress in Ireland and two cameo brooches—I do not know where the velveteen came from—he did not order it for me—he, never gave me any, I bought it from him—I went into Marchmont Street and he asked me to go into a shop with him, and I saw him measured for a suit of clothes—he never had any interest in my patent, but used to write letters for me sometimes and advise me how to advertise it—he was not the inventor, and no agreement was filed between us in reference to it—he tried to get a divorce from his wife, I was not cited as co-respondent—he lived at my house after the velveteen was pawned, but not with me—he slept in a room at the top of the house by himself—I was never in his room after the pawning of the velveteen—I do not think he slept there—he used to sleep in Guildford Street, at Mrs. Mazoni's, and other places in the same neigh<lb/>bourhood—I never asked Dr. Barringer to swear that he had invented the medicine—I went to Mrs. Mazoni in April, after the brokers were in pos<lb/>session of my mother's furniture, but did not tell her I had forgotten that the pawn-ticket related to something else, and that if Sutton would not prosecute me I would unsay in cross-examination all that I had already said—there are no proceedings pending between us—Sutton has never had a sealskin jacket from Mr. Ashburn, pawnbroker, to be sent to me to try on for approval—Mr. Ashburn sent it for me of his own accord, and I was to pay for it—I have been in the habit of buying jewellery from him—it would be untrue to say that I ever pawned anything in. the name of Sutton—Sutton knew nothing about the jacket until I told him—he was not going to pay for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not buy my house from Sutton—he took it on a three years' agreement, and it had one year to run when he left, and I took it from him at 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there was no furniture—that which has been seized was the property of my mother and myself—Sutton signed this agreement with reference to the furniture in dispute after I had been cross-examined at the police-court.

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I told him to take his coat off, and I found these salt cellars and cruet and silver articles in the coat pockets—this drab dress was underneath his coat, and this piece of silk was inside his trousers below the waistband, and other articles were in his trousers pockets and in various parts of his dress—I asked him his name and address, and he refused to. give it—I said, "You will save a good deal of trouble if you will tell us where you got the things"—he said, "I was lying on some grass and two men came along and threw them down, and I picked them up"—and he said three or four hours afterwards in the cell, "I should have taken them to Hackney Police-station"—I went at about 10.30 to 4, Sandford Place, and found all the rooms in confusion, the catch of the kitchen window had been put back, and the bottom of the window raised and the shutters forced—this knife, or any knife, would force back the catch—there were marks as if something had been passed—I found this knife in the prisoner's pocket—Sanford Place is about 70 yards from where he was found.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was living at 5, Brook Street, Ratcliff, with Afow, as his wife, and keeping a Chinese boarding-house—Assam came there on 5ft or 8ft July, and stayed 12 or 13 days—he did not pay for his board and lodging—on 17th July I was sweeping one of the back rooms upstaus which is used by black people who come to smoke—Assam came into the room and said "Kiss me'-ll said "If Afow comes he will puneh you"—he put his arm round my waist and said "Let me have a short time"—I said "No"—I spoke loudly, waist and Afow came in andspoke in Chinese in a tone of remonstrance-Afow struck Assam twice in the face with his open hand, and then struck him on the head with a</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 6, Retreat Cottages, Pine<lb/>hill, Upper Clapton—on Monday, 12th May, I was engaged in repairing a wall in the Green Lanes opposite the Manor House about 7.40 a.m.—while I was taking some bricks off the wall I saw a brown paper parcel laid up against the wall, about 40 or 45 yards away from the road—there is a little roadway leading from the main road up to the wall—I went down to the parcel—the paper was lying open—I looked Under the paper and saw the dead body of a little child—a little flannel was wrapped over its feet—I had some mates working at a little distance from me—I went up to them and called them, and one of them came back with me—we did not move the parcel—my mate put his trowel and just pulled the paper on one side, and saw the child lying with its hand on the chest—I looked at the child and saw a bit of yellow stuff coming out of its mouth on to its chin—I put a mortar-board in front of the child and went for a policeman, and the constable Boittault came up, and he in my presence picked the child up and turned it over—I noticed a little hole on the head where it bad been dropped on a bit of brick—when I first saw it its head was lying on a bit of brick—I picked up the piece of brick and gave it to the constable—this is it (produced)—it has been burnt since—Finsbury Park is the nearest railway-station to the place where I found the child; that is about a mile—the wall was about 4 or 5 feet high before I commenced to take the bricks off—the parcel was lying close to the wall, leaning against it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 276). On Monday morning, 12th May, about 8 o'clock, I was on duty in the Green Lanes, Hornsey Stocks came and spoke to me, and in consequence of what he said I went from the Green Lanes across a field, or piece of waste ground—there are some gates at the end—this rough plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly represents the place—the Green Lane is the main road—I went through a gap across the field—the gap was about 100 yards down the Green Lanes from the Seven Sisters Road—the gap is marked on the plan—it leads to a brick wall at the end of the field—the brick wall goes along by the side of a private road—the gates at the end of the private road are boarded gates, what are called matchboard gates or frame gates—they were shut and locked at that time—I got from the gap into the field—I did not see the body of the child till I got to the wall—I found the body about 10 yards from the Green Lanes, on the private road aide of the wall—you would have to get over the wall from the field to get to where the body was lying—the wall was about 2ft. 6in. high when I saw it; that was where the men were at work pulling it down—the child was lying on some brown paper close to the wall—I picked it of and found it was quite dead—I noticed that there was some blood and stuff running from its nose and mouth—there was a small wound on the crown of the head—I noticed a lot of blood on a piece of brick that the head was lying on—this is the piece of brick—the child was lying on this flannel; it was round the bottom part of the body—the top part of the body was naked—this flannel was under its arms and round the back, and met in front, covering the legs—I think it was sewn on, but I am not certain about that—this linen swathe was rolled round the stomach—this apron was round the bottom part of the body, under the flannel, and fastened in the same way as the flannel—this was outside—this little shirt was on the body under the flannel—it seemed as if the flannel had slipped from the upper part of the body—there were some napkins under the whole of this clothing, and this was on the outside of one or two more—they were round its legs and the lower part of the body under the flannel—the child was cold—I took it to the station, and took charge of all these things—I sent for Mr. Berry the surgeon, and he came and examined the child—an inquest was held on Wednesday, the 14th—I gave evidence, also Mr. Berry and Stocks—the Coroner took possession of the brick—it was produced at the inquest; I saw it again at Clerkenwell Police-court.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, and live at Woodbine House, Hornsey Road—on Monday morning, 12th May, I was sent for to the Hornsey Road Police-station between 8 and 10 o'clock—I was there shown the body of a female child—it was partly dressed, well nourished, about a month or six weeks old; it was not vaccinated—the</p>

               <p>pupils were contracted—I did not notice the head of the child at the station—I made a post-mortem examination the next evening—there were several contused wounds, two being lacerated and contused, at the back of the head, over the parietal bone—one was on the posterior portion of the parietal bone, about three-quarters of an inch long—there was a contused fracture—on removing the integuments of the posterior portion of the cranium a great deal of coagulated blood was found between the integu<lb/>ments and the brain, opposite the external seat of the wound—a quantity of blood was found extravasated between the arachnoid membranes and the brain—in the abdomen the peritoneum was healthy, the liver healthy, the kidneys healthy, the spleen healthy, the pan<lb/>creas healthy, the bladder healthy, containing no urine—the lungs and small intestines were healthy, full of flatus; the heart healthy; the lungs healthy, pale pink in colour—I removed the stomach for analysis, and found that it contained milk, having a perceptible odour of opium, that is laudanum—in my opinion the cause of death was injury to the brain whilst under the action of a narcotic—the skull was fractured right over this one particular wound—there were two wounds, one much smaller than the other—I believe the smaller wound was produced by the brick—I saw the brick at the inquest; there is a small drop of coagulated blood on it now—I saw several drops of blood on it at the inquest, just where it had percolated from the small wound, and also a few hairs just similar to those in the child's head—I believe the large wound was produced by something similar to this piece of brick where the notch is—I believe that the wound on the anterior superior portion of the parietal bone, not the small one that the brick was resting on, but I believe by the contusion of the parts and the amount of blood extravasated between the arachnoid membranes and the brain, that the child was stricken by something blunt; a piece of brick or something similar; that is my opinion—I believe the child was stricken on the head during the time it was alive and under the influence of the laudanum—the smaller wound, the lower wound, may have been produced by dropping the child on to the brick, but the upper one was in a position that could not have been so produced—I believe that the child was struck by something that produced the larger wound—I do not believe that would be done by falling on the brick; I believe it must have been done by some person taking something in the hand and striking the child on the head—I could not estimate the amount of laudanum that was given, but I believe the amount the child had got was sufficient to produce a soporific effect and cause death if they had waited a proper time—any preparation of laudanum is a very dangerous thing to give to a baby—I could not tell how recently before death the milk had been swallowed—all the organs were healthy; it was a very fine child; it had the appearance of about six or seven weeks old instead of three—it was consistent with what I saw that it may have been only three weeks old—I took off the clothes to perform the post<lb/>mortem, and there being nothing convenient at the mortuary to wipe my hands and instruments upon I used those, and some of the blood and mess upon the clothes have been so caused—I put the clothes under the child after performing the post-mortem.</p>

               <p>case—I examined the veins—I did not find them gorged with blood; one vein between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, right opposite the larger wound, had been ruptured by the wound, and there was a great deal of blood extravasated—none of the veins were gorged with blood that I saw—I examined them minutely—I looked over the whole of the veins and they were just in a normal state, except in the place I speak of—there was sufficient opium in the stomach to have caused death if time had been given; I don't say that it did cause death—sometimes death from laudanum is very quick, according to the dose, but very quick in a child—contraction of the pupils is indicative of the influence of laudanum, it may also be of concussion of the brain, of fracture at the base of the skull—a serous effusion in the ventricles is a cardinal point to ascertain in poisoning by laudanum—I did not examine the ventricles, because there was sufficient cause of death from the fracture of the skull from the lacerated wound, without the laudanum—I will take on myself to state that it was the superior wound that destroyed the child's life—I cannot say that if the wounds had not been there the child might have died from poisoning by laudanum—if there had been no wounds, I should have gone more par<lb/>ticularly into the minutiae and traced it from the mouth right down—I believe that the child had taken sufficient laudanum to produce death, but I believe it died from the effects of the large wound—I could not under<lb/>take to say that death was not caused by the laudanum—the second wound might have been caused by falling on the brick; I believe the larger wound was inflicted by somebody taking something in their hand—I notice the edges of the wound, they were not close, the wound was inverted and drawn in; there was a small coagula of blood right in between the lower and upper portions of the lip of the wound, and just round it there was a laceration somewhat similar in shape to the matrix in my nail—it is diffi<lb/>cult to say from the appearance of a wound whether it has been inflicted before or after death; it may be improbable, but not impossible; I only give my opinion, and I believe I am right—laudanum in cordials is a very wrong thing to give to any child; it is a very common thing.</p>

There. was enough laudanum in the body to account for death, if it had not been caused by violence—I went through the regular routine to test for laudanum—I removed the stomach and examined it in my surgery—I think the laudanum was given in the milk—it is possible that it might be given in a simple form, the milk might be given on one occasion and the laudanum on another—I did not examine to see whether the milk was the mother's, or the milk of an animal—I have heard that the woman suckled the child and that her breast became injured—I could not undertake to say that the milk I found mixed with the laudanum was not the mother's milk—I believe the laudanum was laudanum pure and simple, not in the shape of a cordial, but such as you would buy at a chemist's, tincture of opium—I could not tell how long it had been administered—I believe it had been given some short time prior to death, within 8 hours of my seeing the body, and within about 42 hours of my examination—I believe it was given before the infliction of the wound, I could not say how short a time before; it might be within half or quarter of an hour, it is possible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have made a post-mortem examination before and found laudanum in the stomach, in the case of a man, a miner—I have had several cases of it—I believe from the appearances that the child's death took place some time between 10 and 11 that night, before the morning—it is difficult to tell the exact time of death within several hours, it might have taken place at any time between 9 or 10 it night, and the small hours of the morning—the larger wound was consistent with having been pro<lb/>duced by a blow from a piece of brick like this.</p>

There were other female lodgers in the house—there was no servant—I don't think the other lodgers were in the habit of going into the room, only a woman in the front room went in, but I don't think more than once—no friends came to see Mrs. Hull—I saw the male prisoner on the Sunday morning, and he went out with my brothers—I saw him in the presence of the child on the Saturday night—he did not seem pleased with it; he never took any notice of it whatever—I first saw him between 8.30 and 9 in the morning; he had slept there the previous night—he was indoors all the afternoon till he went away and in a public-house close by—the child was not asleep in the afternoon—Mrs. Hull washed it about 3.30, and after that it went to sleep till about half an hour before they went away—it was during that time that I saw him with the child—he came very late on Sunday night—I was not in the room then—I</p>

I am a bricklayer, living at Telegraph Terrace, Hitchin—at 7 o'clock in the morning of 17th May I was at work near Bedstow Hill—Turner called my attention to a parcel in the hedge; I cut the string, and opened it, and the first thing I found was a baby's bedgown—there was another parcel inside that tied up with a string—I cut the string of that—I did not thoroughly examine it at the time—I took it to the station the same evening; it was then thoroughly examined in presence of the police inspector—when I cut the other string I found more clothes; it contained three bedgowns, two little shirts made, one little shirt cut out and not made, and other articles of children's clothing which are now produced—I know a place called Staunton—Henlow is the nearest station to Staunton—if a person was going to Staunton by the Great Northern Railway their proper course would be to get out at Hitchin, and not leave the platform—the parcel might have laid there several days without being seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the South London District Post-office, Blackman Street, Borough—Buckworth became the receiver at Lower Road, Rotherhithe, on 30th April, 1873, and was before that in the Dockhead office—Nash was Buckworth's assistant at Lower Road Post-office—they both made the usual statutory declarations (produced) when they were employed—it was part of Buckworth's duty to issue and pay money orders at Lower Road, and he was supplied from the General Pos-Office with blank forms of money orders and advices—they are numbered con<lb/>secutively, and bear the printed name of Buckworth's office—persons pay<lb/>ing for money orders fill up a printed requisition (<hi rend="italic">Form produced</hi>), stating amount, where payable, name of payee, and name and address of emitter: on receipt of which it was the duty of either of the prisoners to fill up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050056"/>
               <p>sign the money order, fill up the advice, and enter it in the daily money order account, and give the money order (<hi rend="italic">Form produced</hi>) to the applicant, and the advice would be forwarded to the paying office by the next dispatch—the names of payee and remitter are given in the advice, and on the order being presented at the paying office the postmaster would refer to the advice, and pay the money, on the payee signing the receipt and giving the name of the remitter—the name of remitter is always required—Buckworth should give the payee's, and his own name in orders drawn on his own account, he has no duty beyond a member of the public—postmasters occasionally issue post-office orders on their own account—money orders ought to bear the date-stamp of the issuing-office—it is the duty of the person issuing the orders to so stamp them, and he must receive the money from the remitter—it was the duty of Buckworth or Nash to forward direct to the General Post-office at the close of each day's business a daily summary and money<lb/>order account giving a detailed account of the money-order business—when his credit reserve exceeded 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was his duty to remit the surplus.</p>

The yellow bundle shows the orders issued by Duckworth, and contains names and amounts other than those which have been read out—the particular names were not pointed out to me till the commencement of this case—the documents were received from the office, and come from the proper custody—that is all I know—they were all issued at the Lower Road, Rotherhithe office, and drawn on different offices and paid, some of them at the chief office, and others at the office on which they were drawn—I only know what appears on the papers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in charge of the department for paying orders at the money order office, and the whole of this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), except the first two, were paid through the London agent of the London and Joint Stock Rank, and transferred to the credit of the Joint Stock Rank at the Bank of England from the Postmaster-General's account, in accordance with the usual practice—the dates of issue are all illegible, the figures in the date stamp having been apparently left out—the letters "J N" and "J Y" are given with the month and the year, but the day is illegible in all—the perforated date of payment has been put on since by one of my clerks at the office, and the amounts would be transferred to the Joint Stock Bank on the date of the perforated stamp—when orders are paid through a bank they are all paid at the chief office, and the advice note is recalled from the original office—if an order reached me before 12 o'clock a transfer would be made out the same day—they would be credited to the bank any time before 12, and a transfer made out at the Bank of England the same day—as a matter of fact, the bank presents them before 11—none of these orders are signed; coming through a bank they require no signature; the bank stamp is the receipt—if I had known that Buckworth was issuing orders and paying them into his bank for the purpose of being sent on to us, to keep up his credit at the bank, I should have inquired into it and raised the question—I did report it.</p>

Mr. Buckworth is now out collecting money which he intended paying into the bank to-day to meet it; we did not think it would be presented until to-morrow"—I produced the money orders to her, those paid through the bank, and those paid through the respective offices, and said "There is a strong suspicion that the money order business transacted here recently is of a fictitious character in great part, and I have ascertained that over 100 of them representing just under 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to various persons on different offices in London, have been paid into the receiver's private account at the Southwark branch of the London and Joint Stock Bank"—she said "Yes, we did issue these, and pay them in, but we did not know it was wrong, as we debited ourselves with the com<lb/>mission"—I said "These money orders, 87 of them, have been paid at the offices on which they were drawn in 41 different names, it appears to me that the signature in the majority of instances to the receipt is that of the issuing clerk, S. Nash"—she said "Yes, I signed most of them; Mr. Buck<lb/>worth signed a few"—I said "Then you must have disguised your hand<lb/>writing"—she said "Yes, I did, as I was afraid it would be found out if I did not"—I then turned over some of the money orders; those not paid through the bank, and I came to six of them in different places in the bundle, and said "These, I believe, are in the handwriting of the receiver, Mr. Buckworth"—she said "Yes, I am very sorry I have done such a thing; I did not know it was wrong; I cashed most of the orders myself, and Mr. Buckworth would have got out of his difficulty in a short time, and stopped issuing the orders"—I think I then gave instructions for the office to be closed, and when Miss Nash knew it was going she said she was very glad, as it had worried her to death for the last two months—the orders had been issued to make up short cash—I said "It is absurd for you to say you have lost 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two months"—she said "The post-office money and the business money has got mixed up together"—I asked for the requisition forms, and she said she had not kept any for a very long time—Buckworth came to the general office next day, and said "I have come to see you about that money order affair"—I said "It is a very serious matter"—he said "Yes, I see it is now, but I did not know there was anything criminal in it before"—I showed him the six money orders, and said "Your sister-in-law told me that you had signed them"—he said "Yes, they are all in different names"—he pointed to two, and said "These were paid to my brother at Croydon"—they passed through the bank at Croydon, and were not signed—he said "These two are genuine, and so are two or three others," and I said "The manager of the Joint Stock Bank was suspicious of the genuineness of the large money order deposits you were making, and he tried to verify them by ascertaining the date of issue; it appears to me that the date has been designedly omitted in order to facilitate the cashing"—he said "Yes, it has;</p>

               <p>I am very sorry I allowed it to be done; I cashed none of them myself"—he went away then, and left the office—I saw him again on the 29th at the receiving house—I said "You will be charged with issuing fictitious money orders"—he said "I am very sorry," and I Raid to Nash "You will be charged with issuing fictitious money orders also"—she said "I never benefited one farthing by any of those transactions, and I am very sorry that I did it"—Buckworth said "No, she has not benefited a single farthing; what she has done has been done under my direction; I have nothing to conceal, and I will make a clean breast of it—I then gave them in custody of the police-officer.</p>

That was on the 29th, about 7 p.m., at his shop—the shop was open, and he was attending to his business—I went to him first on Monday, 21st, about 11 a.m., and he was not there—I had been to his bank, but knew nothing then of the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—I made no communication about that cheque till a few day afterwards—the 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque had arrived that morning—I went to the bank specially to obtain this cheque—it was crossed "Bank of England;" it was subsequently presented through the Bank of England—I do not know of my own knowledge—I took the cheque, and so far as I know it was dishonoured by my presenting it—the dishonouring did not actually take place—I presented it, and asked "Is the balance standing to the account with Mr. Buckworth sufficient to meet this cheque, if it is presented to-day?" and they told me it was not sufficient—I had got the cheque there.</p>

On 4th June I received a communication from a man named Matthews employed in rebuilding Anderton's Hotel, in consequence of which I followed Matthews next morning at 8.25 down Fleet Street, and saw Miles just turn from Barclay's door dressed like a porter, with a canvas apron and a skull cap—he turned into Farringdon Street as Matthews approached, stood on the other side, and I saw Matthews turn up Fleet Street—on 10th June, about 8 am, I watched again, and saw Miles standing at the end of Fleet Lane and the Old Bailey, and looking down Fleet Lane—I left Detective Parsons there, and went to the other end of the lane in Ludgate Hill, which took me about three minutes, and then I saw Miles come out with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he came towards me and I., said, "Where are you going to take that I am a police-officer"—he said, "To my master at 18a, Giltspur Street"—I said, "Who gave it to you?"—he said, "A man"—I said, "Who?"—he made no reply—I said, "Where did you see the man?"—he said, "About here"—I took him to the station, and found in the parcel 2 dozen bottles of Eno's fruit salt—I then went to the prosecutor's office, Anderson was called in, and I told him he would be charged with stealing a parcel containing 2 dozen of Eno's fruit salt, the property of his masters—he said, "There is another one a-doing of it. at the back"—I said, "Who is it I There is your master, you had better tell</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artificial flower manufacturer, of 19, Bridge water Square, Barbican—Harris was in my employ about two years as a maker of flowers—I had been losing things for a long while, and on 18th July I caused my manager, Leatham, to watch Harris after she left off work, and on 19th July, in consequence of something he told me, I caused Harris to be searched by Mrs. Castell in my warehouse—I was then almost immediately called into the room, and Mrs. Castell gave me some artificial flowers—I had a conversation with Harris, who mentioned a name, an address, and a sum of money in Sergeant Fluister's presence, in con<lb/>sequence of which I took out a warrant to search Rarp's premises, 191, Hoxton Street—I went there on the 19th with Fluister, Leatham, and the warrant officer at 6 p.m.—there are two doors to the shop; it is at the corner of a street; the front entrance is in one street and the private entrance at the side—the officer read the warrant to Mrs. Rarp, and Sergeant Fluister asked her whether Lizzie Harris had been in the habit of coming there—I did not enter at the first moment—the premises were searched, and a quantity of leaves and flower materials were shown to us, the major portion of which are mine—they are technically known as unmounted goods, but there are some here which I can identify more fully, as they have my private mark on them in Mr. Leathcam's writing—I bought them in Paris—I have the same patterns on my premises—I have never sold this leaf in this form, and I never knew Rarp—here are some leaves of a peculiar character which I gave special orders for to Mr. Dean—I also buy leaves of Gatti and Co., of Farringdon Street, and I find some leaves here which came from their premises, but I cannot swear to them with certainty, as other people can buy them also—Harris dusted the warehouse in the mornings, and had an opportunity of taking goods, as she would be by herself.</p>

On 14th July, from infor<lb/>mation I received, I went to Mr. Marshall's, and Harris was given into my custody—Mrs. Castell gave me these flowers, and I put them in this bag—I took her to the station, and she gave me a name and address—I then obtained a search warrant, and between 5 and 6 that evening went to Rarp's shop with Mr. Marshall, Mr. Leatham, and the warrant officer—I said, "Are you Mrs. Rarp?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "I am an officer of the City of London Police, and this officer, 78 G, holds a warrant for searching your premises. Do you know a person named Harris?"—she said "No"—I gave her Harris's description, and then she said, "I had a woman of the name of Harris working for me some time ago"—I said, "Would you give me the description of her?"—she described a tall woman—I said, "That will not answer the description of Lizzy Harris"—we then searched the place, and found in the shop 52 gross of leaves and eight sprays of flowers, and on the stall outside 44 sprays, and in the workroom and stall 55 sprays and three gross of leaves; on the first-floor 67 gross of leaves in one box and 77 gross in another, which the prosecutor identified in her presence—here are five boxes of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to her, "Have you got any receipts?"—she said "Yes," and produced two files—I have been over them, and found one receipt in 1879 for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some in 1878—I took Rarp in custody—her shopwoman, Flora Kemp, was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a flower shop—a portion of the property which Mr. Marshall identified was exposed to view on a stall outside the shop—Rarp is, I believe, married; her husband is a watchmaker, and works at the West End.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Her shop is a mile or a little more from Mr. Marshall's—goods were exposed outside and inside—the private entrance is in Turner Square, and the shop is in Hoxton Street.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 7, Bradmore Park Terrace, Hammersmith, and am the owner of 3, Belgrave Road, which was let to Joseph Hicks, senior, who owes me two quarters' rent—I took proceedings in the Marylebone County Court—there were three or four adjournments—at the hearing on 21st May the prisoner was examined as a witness and I heard his evidence; he said, "While I was removing my goods from 3, Belgrave Road, by a van, Mr. Faulkner came to the house and said, 'As you have got your goods away the keys will be of no use to you, so you may as well give them up to me,' and I then and there gave them to Mr. Faulkner"—I was not at Bel<lb/>grave Road on the day mentioned; I was at Hammersmith all day, and therefore any conversation of the kind could not possibly have taken place—I have an entry on that date in my diary, "At Hammersmith all day and wrote to Mr. Hicks"—I wrote down his statement directly I got home from the Court, and as near as I could recollect they are the words he used—I have not received any letters from the prisoner—I have received letters from his father, the tenant, and have seen him twice with reference to this matter—the prisoner conducted his father's business when he first took the shop, and I have seen him there often—the key has never to this day been given up to me as alleged, and no meeting of the kind to which the prisoner referred took place—he came on or about the 25th January, with Mr. Child's son, to negotiate with me for the purpose of giving up, and they offered me then 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—they had entered a second quarter—that was on the part of the father; he said he had given up possession on the 17th, but on the 25th January he was there' negotiating to give it up then and offering 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound of the rent—he came again on 26th March, 1878, with his father to negotiate giving up the house—that was after the prisoner had sworn that he had given up the keys and given up possession.</p>

I live at 125, Canterbury Road, Kilburn—I was present in the County Court, Marylebone, and heard the prisoner's evidence on 21st December, 1877—while he was removing his goods in a furniture van Mr. Faulkner came up and said to him, "Well, the keys are of no use to you new, and you may as well give them to me," and that he there and then handed to Mr. Faulkner the keys—I made no memorandum, but am prepared to swear that is what was said.</p>

I live at 18, Sharland Road, Paddington—I remember being in Mr. Faulkner's shop at the latter end of March, 1878, when Hicks, senior and junior came in and asked the prosecutor, my brother-in-law, to write out a document, which he did and gave it to the prisoner, who said, "What do you mean by dilapidations, there are none?"—Mr. Faulkner said, "You must be a fool to say there are none"—the prisoner's father said, "I will not have my son called a fool, you shall neither have the keys nor money," and with that they left the shop immediately.</p>

Will you advise us what to do? Are we to pay any more rent to Mr. Hicks? We have paid our rent up to the present time, and you can see our books"—they brought the books down to me; then I said, "I would advise you to see Mr. Hicks's receipt before paying any more rent"—he brought an action against me in the County Count—I did not hear any claim for specific damages—I heard that he said I had interfered with his lodgers, and they had not paid him his rent—I did not go into the house from 5th December till 25th January, when I met Mr. Hicks—I was not there on any occasion when goods were being removed, and cannot tell when he went away—he swore it was on the 17th—Miller is a tradesman who does my work—I have nobody to swear to the exact words he used—I claimed 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the County Court for dilapidations, but that was not the principal cause of dispute with Hicks senior—the prisoner denied that there were any dilapidations—no amount was mentioned in conversation—I said, "There is the rent due, and there will be dilapidations; you send a surveyor to meet my surveyor, and whatever they assess, that will be the amount"—we were discussing the point, and the prisoner kepi saying, "There ain't no dilapidations," and at last I said, "You are a fool to talk like that"—I saw the papers torn off the wall on 25th January, when I found the prisoner and the solicitor's son in the house—they had let themselves in with the keys that he had—I had not a key—I gave the key originally to the father, and they never gave it up—I did not go to the house between December 5th and January 25th—it was closed and they had the keys on 25th January, and the prisoner was in the house—his agreement specified that he was not to let the house to lodgers.</p>

You had better come down and advise what to do, &amp;c.") I wrote this reply, dated June 4th, "I am very surprised at your bad seamanship. I thought you were capable of managing a barge in rough weather. You knew that it was stormy on Sunday. Why did you not go in the bay and lay till the wind had abated and make for the beach on Monday or Tuesday, instead of placing the barge in immediate danger. However, you keep in harbour till 1 come down or send." I went down to Southend and instructed the shipwright to repair her—she was finished on 25th June—the prisoner had my instructions to come to London again for a freight—I did not see the barge again till July 26th—he was using her for his own profit after 25th June.</p>

               <p>pointed towards Young, and said either "my brothe" or "brother-in-law"—the name of Smith was over the door, and I said "What is the reason you have not your name over the door?"—he said "No one has interferred with me, and Smith's name is so well known I have not altered it"—I then left—Young could not help hearing what Goddard said; he was only seven or eight feet off—Phillips called on me on the 26th, but I did not engage him.</p>

Bridget Woods and a man named Bradshaw were together between Stamford Bridge and Cremorne on this Saturday night, and he said good night to me—she and the prisoner and the children live in the Grove Road—she was there on this night in her room with Bradshaw—I went there and Bradshaw came to the door and said "Is that you, Mrs. Nolan?"—I said "Yes"—he said "You can't come in to-night, then," and I said "Very well"—I have seen them together three times—I do not know that she was neglecting her home and going about the streets and drinking in public-houses—I have seen her in public-houses when she ought to be at home attending to her children—the prisoner was not near when Bradshaw said good-night to me.</p>

I examined Mrs. Woods on the 13th—there was an incised wound about 1/8 inch in depth and 1 inch long behind and below the ear—it was very near a dangerous part, and if deeper would have severed the jugular vein and the carotid artery, which would have been almost fatal—the wound was not bleeding and I do not think she had lost much blood—I dressed it and have no doubt it was well in a few days—I have not examined it since—a small knife would have caused it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nurse at the receiving ward at the Greenwich Union—I have been there for about 10 years—I knew a girl named Kate Smith, a sister of Ellen Smith—I knew her before she went to the home, the prisoner's place—she was a very nice child, and as far as I knew she was healthy, not suffering from any disease—we supplied her with clothes before she went to the home—she was an inmate of the Union for a short time—her mother came and took her out about the end of the summer of 1878—she came to us from the Sutton School—when she left with her mother she was properly clad, healthy, and clean—on 22nd April this year six children were brought to the Union by Mr. Pilcher, the relieving officer, and Inspector Phillips—they were Eliza and Annie Crabbe, Elizabeth Goodland, Alice Rixon, two little Edgars, and Ellen Smith—Alice Rixon was claimed two days afterwards by her grandmother—the other six were very dirty, and had the itch from the head down to their toes, all over their bodies—they had several sores and their heads were full of lice—I gave them food—I did not think they were so badly nourished at the time, for I did not take much notice of them; I only judged from their ap<lb/>pearance—I had known the two Crabbes before they went to the home; they had also come from the Sutton School—their mother came and fetched them from the Union; they were then properly clothed, in a clean state, and apparently free from disease—since they have returned to the Union they have wonderfully improved; they have been well taken care of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell you the average cost of keeping a child in the Union—I said before the Magistrate that when the children were admitted into the Union from the home they had not the appearance of having been starved, and I say so now—I have had considerable experience of children—I formed that judgment from their appearance—I also said that they appeared to have been fairly fed, and that their clothes were not parti<lb/>cularly dirty—I have had a great many children in the Union who when first admitted suffered from vermin in the head—it is a very poor neighbour<lb/>hood round Deptford and Greenwich—it is not uncommon for children of the poorer classes to be suffering from vermin in the head—it is not a very difficult thing to eradicate them; I very soon get rid of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am relieving officer of the South Deptford district—on 14th April my attention was directed to the Home for Friendless Girls at Deptford, kept by Miss Addiscott, and on that day I went there with Dr. Ring, Inspector Phillips, and Sergeant Francis, and saw the prisoner—we said we came in consequence of communications received to visit the home and inspect the children; I told her that the gentleman who accompanied me was the medical officer—she refused to allow us to see the home or to examine the children unless in the. presence of her medical man, Dr. Ayres—we went away—I called next day in company with my col<lb/>league, Mr. Patty, and she again refused to allow us to see the home except</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050103"/>
               <p>in the presence of Dr. Ayres—on the 21st I went again with Mr. Carter, the Coroner, Mr. Phillips, and Francis, but did not see the prisoner; she was away—we saw her mother, and we examined the house—there were eight rooms in the house, including the basement, two on each floor—two rooms on the first floor were occupied by the post-office—there are two bedrooms at the top—in the back room there was one iron bedstead—it is not exactly a back room; a portion of the front room is partitioned off—there was no carpet or any furniture whatever, or any fireplace—I examined the bedding—I cannot exactly tell what the bedding in the back room consisted of, but the general bedding consisted of packing cloth filled with straw, an under sheet, a dark brown blanket and a sheet over that, with a pillow, and either a counterpane or sheet over that—there were three bedsteads in the front room with similar bedding, but no other furniture whatever—I examined the two living rooms on the ground floor—there was no carpet or any furniture in the back sitting-room; there was a pail, a washing basin, and a paraffin lamp—in the front room there was a table; I cannot tell the number of chairs; I think there were only two; and a kind of side<lb/>board, or I do not know whether it was a bedstead—there were two dwarf cupboards—I partially examined one of them—I found but very little appearance of food there, a crust or two; there may have been part of a loaf; there was the appearance of treacle, the appearance of butter; there may have been a little sugar in a basin; I did not see anything else—there was a coal fire burning in that room—the washhouse had a stone floor, the front kitchen was boarded—there was a deal table and two forms in the washhouse, and there may have been a cup and saucer on the dresser; that was all; there was no fire there then; the grate was very rusty, and there was a great quantity of soot on the hobs—there was a copper—there were two doors or French windows in the back kitchen, opening up Steps into the yard, and there was not a whole pane of glass in them; the glass was all broken—there was no closet in the place fit for use; there were two; one in the yard had the appearance of being a privy; it was a heap of ruins; the one upstairs was a water-closet; the seat was all to pieces; it was impossible to use either—at the bottom of the garden there was a large hole dug which had the appearance of having been used for sanitary arrange<lb/>ments—I saw some clothing in an anteroom past one of the closets; the whole of the clothing that I saw there was hardly fit for use; it was ragged; I won't say it was dirty, but it certainly did not appear fit for the use of children, not to keep them warm—I can't tell the exact quantity there was; it was not a very great quantity—I saw the children to examine them on 22nd; Dr. Long was with me, and Inspector Phillips and Sergeant Francis* and in consequence of the state they were in I conveyed seven to the Union—outside the house there was a board, and on it "Miss Addiscott's Home for Friendless Children."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a carpet in my own kitchen—I find several carpeted; it is very seldom I have occasion to go into kitchens—this is not a very small house; the rooms were a good size; it has an ordinary wash-house or back kitchen—there was not a sound pane of glass in the doors; there may have been broken pieces—there was no bed in either of the living rooms—I don't know that Miss Addiscott slept there—I could not ascertain where she did sleep—I have to go about a great deal among the homes in the district—I have not seen the children of respectable poor working men</p>

               <p>in that neighbourhood sleeping three and four under a sack—it is a poor neighbourhood; there is frequently great distress there—I don't think there are places in which the furniture would be much the same as in this home, certainly not inferior; if you speak of respectable working men there is not a house in the Deptford district that is not fully furnished—I will undertake to swear that there are not houses in Deptford where respectable classes are living in far inferior places to those I saw in the Girls Home—I only find that when they are drunken, worthless people neglecting their duty—there is no respectable home so bad as this was—from my experience I say that every respectable working man there with a family is able to have a blanket, a straw palliasse, and two sheets, and a bedstead to put them on—I should not, as a rule, expect to find the kitchen carpeted, but a mat or a sack—it is very rare indeed to find glass broken in the back kitchen of respectable working men, unless accidentally; I have seen it, and paper and rags put in, but I am now speaking of the worthless poor in and out of the parish—we have respectable working poor, and their very respectability keeps them in that state that they would be ashamed to see a broken pane of glass—I say that the closet in the house could not be used; it was not blocked up; the seat was all to pieces; it would not be safe for any one to sit on; there did not appear to be a pan there—there was no water; I tried to see if there was any connected with the closet—nothing would go down if any water was thrown in I believe it would run all over the place, and through the floor—I did not try it; there was no water there to try it with—there was ground at the back, but it had not been cultivated for a long time—there was only weeds and grass—the father of the Crabbes and the mother of the Smiths were in the Union with them, and when they left they took the children away—they were destitute at that time; I cannot tell why they left the Union—there is a home for boys, consisting of three houses in the same row as this home; it is kept by a person who I have heard was formerly a clerk in the City—before this charge was made there was in the first place a charge of assault—I made a report to the guardians of the Greenwich Union on 2nd May—I did not hear Ellen Smith make a statement to the guardians. Ellen Smith. I went with my sister Kate to Miss Addiscott's home I think in August last year—Kate was younger than me, her birthday was 23rd March, mine is the 7th September; and I shall be 13 next September—I lost my father, who was an engineer—I had been to the Sutton Schools belonging to the Union, and I came up from there to Miss Addiscott—Miss Addiscott did not allow me to go to school when I was at the home—she said I was 15 and too old to go to school, and besides she said she wanted me to stop at home and clean her place—I told her that I was 12 years of age—I did clean the place—my sister went to the Board School with some of the other girls—whilst I was at the home Miss Addiscott sent out me out with collecting cards—we were sent out in parties of two each; four in a day sometimes—I went with Esther Edgar and sometimes with Elizabeth Goodland and Eliza Crabbe—we went out at 9 in the morning and came home at 8 or 9 in the evening—we were out the whole of that time without returning at all—Miss Addiscott did not give us any food to take with us while we were out—the collecting cards she gave us were similar to these produeed—we went to people's houses and got money, and they wrote down on the back the names and amounts—I had a purse which Miss Addiscott gave me, and at the end of the day I brought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050105"/>
               <p>home the purse and the money and the card—sometimes the card was too full and the money could not be put down, and we used to put the money in the purse—the smallest amount we have taken home has been 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the largest 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—sometimes when we were out collecting, food was given us by the ladies—we went out every day when it was fine, not on Sundays—we got enough food from one person and another while we were out—we did not spend any of the money—my sister Kate did not go out collecting—Miss Addiscott told me that if the ladies asked whether we liked to be in the home we should say "Yes;" and if they asked me how old I was, I was to say 15—she told me if they asked what we had for dinner we were to say meat and potatoes—we used to have something to eat in the morning at 9 o'clock—sometimes Miss Addiscott used to serve it in the front parlour and send it in by one of the children—sometimes it was later, 11 or 12 o'clock before we got anything to eat—she used to cut some bread up in a basin and put some hot water in it, and drain off the water and put a bit of treacle on it and send it in to us—at that time there were Eliza Crabbe, Elizabeth Goodland, Esther Edgar, my sister, Annie Crabbe, Florrie Edgar, and myself—that was not the greatest number I have known there—sometimes there have been 13 there—those I have mentioned were always there while I was there—when I first went there we used to have oatmeal—the water was boiled, then it was mixed with cold water, put into a spoon and stirred round till it was boiled; some salt was put in it and it was then poured out into a basin for us to eat—there was 1/2 lb. of oatmeal between all of us—no milk was put in it—there was only a half-penny worth of milk bought of a day, and that was for Miss Addiscott for her breakfast and tea—when we did not have oatmeal for breakfast we had the sop—there was not much bread given to us—we had one basinful each; not quite a basinful—it was larger than a breakfast cup; not quite so large as a pudding basin—sometimes we used to have a bit of bread and treacle at 10 o'clock at night—we had no dinner—Miss Addiscott used to be out—my sister came back from school at 12 o'clock and 4—we waited from 9 in the morning till sometimes 10 at night without anything to eat until Miss Addiscott came in—sometimes we used to have a half-penny worth of cabbage before tea, those that went to school—I did not have anything then—Miss Addiscott used to say we would have something, and then she would go out to her mother's and we should have to wait until she came home, and then some<lb/>times we should have a bit of oatmeal—the girls came home from school again at 4 in the afternoon, and they used to have to wait until Miss Addiscott came home, sometimes at 8 o'clock, and she would say, "Have not you given the children any tea?" when there was not anything in the house to give them tea with—we got no meat at all except on Sundays; we then had pieces of meat, small bits that were bought at the shop, like what you have to make broth with—I have been with Miss Addiscott on a Saturday night to buy it—we did not have the meat every Sunday; sometimes we had rice for dinner, and when we had rice we did not have meat—I do not know how often we had meat; we very often had rice—I was there on the 12th November, when Alice Maud Edgar died—she was at the home before me—she was not ill when I first went there; she got ill a week or two after—she slept in the back parlour on two chairs when she was ill—Miss Addiscott slept in the front parlour on the floor on a flock bed—the other girls slept up in the back room—I used to sleep downstairs in the back</p>

               <p>parlour, and sometimes Alice Crabbe used to sleep with me to keep me company—there was no bed there; we had to sleep on the floor, and put some clothes under us and lay on them, and we had to cover ourselves the best way we could with some grey bodies out of the clothes-room—up to the time that Alice Maud Edgar died there was only one blanket—sometimes Miss Addiscott used to have that to cover over herself—the children used to cover themselves over with their petticoats and that, there was no blanket—the others slept on mattresses and beds on bedsteads—there was nothing but straw in a canvas covering that had not got any sheets, or counterpanes, or anything of the kind—when I slept upstairs with the other girls some used to lay at the side, some at the foot, and some at the head—there was never any fire there—I suffered from cold there because the windows were broken—Alice Edgar was 4 years old when she died—before she died she had a few lice on her in her head—Kate Verch was a baby; she could not walk or talk—she slept along with us sometimes—I was there when she died, and when all the three died—my sister was taken ill on Shrove Tuesday; that was when she first took to her bed—she had not been well enough to go to the Board School from December—she could hardly walk; she had some of those insects upon her—she had no different food from what I have described up to Shrove Tuesday—she slept upstairs in the bedroom with the other children when she was first taken bad on Shrove Tuesday—Miss Addiscott made her up a bed in the back parlour, and she told me to take off the mattress and put it on the floor to lay her on, and ever since that night she slept in the back parlour—I used to sleep against her, not on the same mattress but on the floor; she used to sleep on the mattress—when we went to the home we only had the clothing that we had on us—they were old clothes—my sister went to school in them—there was no fire in the winter in the back parlour, only when they burnt the vermin off my sister—she kept to her bed from Shrove Tuesday to the 6th April—I knew she was ill for about two weeks before that; she could hardly eat anything and wanted drink every minute; she was thinner than when she first went into the home, and when she was ill her bones were almost through her skin—I could hardly take her out of bed because she cried about the pain in her bones; she said her bones hurt her—Miss Addiscott sometimes came home at 1 or 2 in the morning—my sister died on Saturday, 6th April—Miss Addiscott was home about 12 that night—she slept in the front parlour, and I and my sister in the back—there were folding doors between the two rooms, and she told me to shut them because she could not bear the groans of my sister; she did groan because of the pain—I attended on my sister entirely—at 12 o'clock I went to bed, and Miss Addiscott offered me a bit of meat because I did not have my tea; I gave my sister a bit and she eat it, and afterwards went to sleep—she kissed me and said "Good night," and I said, "Katie, be a good girl to-night," and she said "Yes," and she laid down and went off, and did not call me any more that night—I covered her over with a sheet, and a white blanket and a counterpane—I had not had that long to cover her over with; I believe it belonged to Mrs. Addiscott; I had never seen it before—I woke at 7 in the morning—my sister did not call me—I had to get up and light the fire, and get Miss Addiscott's breakfast—I did not go for the milk before she was up—I was afraid if there was any money gone she would blame it to me—about 10 o'clock we had our breakfast—she told me to take some to my sister and I found she</p>

Crabbe helped me to pull off my sister's chemise and that, and she had vermin all crawling over her face, and her head was nearly out of bed and her legs drawn up, I got a pail of water and washed her—Miss Addiscott did not come back before 1 o'clock—Mrs. Addiscott, her mother, came with her; she cut off my sister's hair and Miss Addiscott told me to pick off the vermin with my fingers one by one and put them in the fire—there had not been any fire before, it was lighted on purpose to burn the vermin in her hair—Miss Addiscott was obliged to go into the other room because she could not bear the smell of my sister's head—there were vermin all on the bed too—Miss Addiscott told me to go and put the sheet on the line and shake it so that they would be able to fall off—I was occupied every two minutes in taking off the vermin, and as I was having my meals she kept telling me to do it—when I washed my sister I noticed that she had the itch all over her, between her fingers, and scratches, so that I could not wash it, and when she was dead the prisoner said to me "How dirty your hands are"—I said "They are not dirty, it is the itch," and she said "Oh, whatever shall I do?"—I did not know Mr. John Smith, who married my mother; I know him now, he came to the home on the Monday night, but I did not see him because I was upstairs taking off the counter<lb/>panes—Miss Addiscott did not tell me that my stepfather had been—when my sister's hair was cut by Mrs. Addiscott I saw a few sores on her head where the vermin had been biting her—my sister had complained about her bones hurting her, and when she was dead I could see that they were nearly all through—when she was put in her coffin Miss Addiscott said "Nelly, look sharp and pick off the vermin before the undertaker comes"—they were not quite all picked off when he came, they kept coming on in the night—I was not picking them off all day on the Monday because I had to do my parlour—I had been doing it all day on Sunday and I did it Monday also—I saw Miss Addiscott strike my sister not more than two weeks before she died; my sister was undressed and in bed, she only had on her chemise—she was hungry, and told me to ask Miss Addiscott whether I should give her a bit of bread-and-butter—I went and asked her, and she refused, and came in with a cane, and pulled down the clothes and beat her—she gave her a good many stripes—I crawled out of bed, and saw the marks all down her arm where she had been beaten—I noticed the marks for about a day afterwards; there was no other reason for the beating than what I have said—Miss Addiscott gave no other reason—she said "You have had quite enough to-night, and you are not going to have any more"—she beat me with the poker on Sunday morning before Shrove Tuesday because I upset a cup of coffee; she hit me on the shoulder saying "Take that, and if any of you keep me from church this morning you will never see another Sunday"—the blows with the poker hurt me; the mark was there for two or three days; I showed it to the children—I saw Miss Addiscott strike Alice Maud Edgar on Sunday morning before this at the end of the washhouse; Alice happened to dirt the bed, and Miss Addiscott undressed her, and beat her with the clothes line six or seven times double, and two or three days after that she was taken bad, and took to her bed, and she died very soon after—she</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S I live at the Evalina Hospital Southwark Bridge Road—on 13th February I admitted Eleanor mobbs as a patiant—she was weighed on the 17th, and weighed 3st 5lb. 8oz.—she was weighed again on 21st March, and then weighed 3 stone 12lb. 4oz., and on 7th Mareh 3 stone 81bs,—she was much below the normal weight when admitted; she was coimderably emaciated; there was no fat which I should expect to find—she came to us to be treated for itch—she was extremely laguid and exhausted—it was with some difficulty that we could get her to take some food, she was so weak—I could trace no organic disease—we examined her very carefully on several occasions—I consider want of proper food would account for the state she was in—when she got proper food she immediately increased in weight—she was covered from head to foot with skin disease—it was certainly of long standing—her head was smothered with lice—her hair had to be cut quite short at once; it was in a filthy state—on the right great toe there was a patch of inflamed skin, with matter underneath; that was probably due to an inflamed chilblain—on the other foot there was an open sore, probably from chilblain—picked up very fairly in a fortnight or so—in my opinion, if insufficient food had been given to her for any particular period, it world bring on consumption, and I consider she would have died.</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I am a widow, and live at 4, "Varnford Court, City—I am caretaker of that house—the little girl Eleanor Mobbs is my daughter—she was 12 last April—she went into the home on 14th October, 1878—before that she Was in very good condition—she had no lice, not was she suffering from itch or anything of the kind—I went to see her at the home fortnightly, with one exception when I left it for three weeks—I saw her with the other children—sometimes Miss Addiscott was with them, sometimes not—I noticed a change in her appearance after about two months; she seemed to have lost all her spirits in life, and was very dull and very thin, and she got thinner every time I saw her afterwards—her uncle, Mr. Heather, removed her on 12th February to the Evalina Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The reason I sent her to the home was because I could not afford to keep her—I was not to pay anything—she had previously been with an aunt, and she could not afford to keep her any longer—for the first two months she appeared healthy—the first Monday in November I noticed her looking very bad, or December; it was before Christmas—I did not speak to Miss Addiscott because the child never made any complaint to me—I saw several of the children together when Miss Addiscott was not there—they were generally in the front parlour—they had a fire there—the door was always open when I went there—I never saw Mrs. Addiscott there, or the sister—my child suffered from her birth from some defect in the roof of her mouth, a cleft palate—she is an only child—I believe at one time, when she was at her aunt's, she did have lice; she caught them at school; that was. about two months before she went to the home—she had long hair, plaited and tied up.</p>

               <p>own experience in the matter, and that is that the disease known as tabes mesenterial, pathologically and correctly known as such, is very uncommon—the deaths of three children in the same house, from the same cause within six months, taken from different families is very extraordinary, unless it were a place for the collection of scrofulous subjects—I have never known such an occurrence—in a hospital undoubtedly it may be so—it has never come to my knowledge—a scrofulous tendency would pre<lb/>dipose to the deposition of tubercle, so that in any collection of scrofulous children there would be nothing extraordinary in three of them getting tabes mesenterica—if there is no scrofula it is not correctly tabes mesenterica; it is really a scrofulous disease—from the appearance of the children who have been in the box there is no indication of scrofula—I would make one exception, I noticed that the child with defective speech (Mobbs) had rather an enlarge<lb/>ment about the glands, that may be scrofulous—I have not examined bar—from the evidence I should say that the food supplied at this home was quite, insufficient; and even if it were sufficient in quantity it would be quite inadequate to support a proper condition of health, and would in many cases lead to a fatal result—I say that from my own experience—it is a food that contains an inadequate supply of nitrogen—the population of Ireland before the famine had a certain amount of fatty substance, which these children did not get at all—the potato is an insupportable diet—potatoes only must lead to disease and death; with milk you get the fat and the nitrogen: I am able to swear that potato diet only would kill anybody—with children of tender age the presence of food giving nitrogen is absolutely necessary—there was some nitrogen of course in their food, but not nearly sufficient; not sufficient to sustain life for any lengthened period—bread is one of the elements of diet as far as it goes; that is correct—the pickled cabbage could be very little good—I would not find fault with it as doing any harm; it is simply a little vegetable acid which would be rather good than otherwise—it would be no good as a nutritious diet—in this diet, as described, there was nothing else which supplied vegetable acid; therefore the cabbage would be rather good than otherwise, but it would not supply any nutrition to the tissues—as to the case of Kate Smith, after hearing the evidence of the sister and the other evidence, I believe that her illness was caused entirely by improper diet, and perhaps insufficient quantity—the evidence is not so clear as to the insufficient quantity as it is to the quality; that is undoubted—I am perfectly clear about it—in food of that quality a very much larger quantity is required to keep body and soul together than if you gave food of a proper quality—I attribute her illness entirely to the diet—from the evidence I have heard I consider the clothing and bedding quite inadequate; that would" increase the tendency to disease—warmth is a correlative; the less warmth the more food would be required—I have formed the opinion that Kate Smith died from starvation—the condition of the body after death, as spoken to by her sister, indicates gross neglect; I am speaking of the lice, the con<lb/>dition of the head, the sores in the head, and the itch—the complaint that her bones hurt her, indicates that she was exceedingly emaciated; there was no cushion for the bones, no muscle—the drawing-up of the knees is a usual condition in death from exhaustion—being beaten with a rope would be calculated to prejudice her health; it would produce shock to the system, and I think accelerate death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw any of these children; I am simply giving my evidence upon the statements of the witnesses in Court, on the assump<lb/>tion that what they have stated is absolutely correct—I found my opinion that Kate Smith died from starvation, first upon the evidence of the sister, but I have taken the conjoint statements, as they all left an impression on my mind, as they would properly do—I have weighed the evidence in my mind to the best of my ability, and have formed my deductions from the whole, not from any special answer, and from the quantity and quality of food which the children had—I do not assume that they only had their own clothes as a covering; I will assume the utmost quantity of blankets that has been spoken of as true, and that they always had that quantity, then I am able to give evidence that the warmth was quite insufficient—there should be a blanket underneath as well as over in every case; it is not that it is required to keep the cold out, but to keep the heat in the body by pre<lb/>venting evaporation—I think if a child of a respectable working man, earning say 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, has not a blanket underneath, a sheet underneath, a blanket above, and a sheet and counterpane, I might fairly say that the parent has neglected the warmth of that child—I am not able to answer how working men manage; I am not an economist—in the weather we had last winter, if any working man did not supply a straw mattress, with a packing cloth, a blanket and sheet, I say he was neglecting his children, and I am ready to swear it—it is not for me to judge of what is criminal; I say he would be neglecting his children—if he could not do it, I cannot say how far he would be criminal; I simply state the broad fact that he would be neglecting the proper conditions—I say that anything under that, on the part of a person having the charge of a child, is neglect—I have formed my opinion, assuming the fullest amount of covering spoken to by anybody here—I have heard that nearly all the children were the children of destitute parents, or parents unable to provide for them—I have had very large experience in poor neighbourhoods—I was surgeon to a workhouse in Petty, France, for nine years, where we had the refuse of the population—I had no private practice among the poor—I have often visited their houses in the poorer parts of Westminster; I have seen some of the worst dens there, and where the people are working people—I have been in almost every house in the Broadway, Herman's Hill, Strutton Ground, and Peter Street and St. Ann's Lane—I have never seen the certificate that was given by Dr. Ayres to the police, which led to the removal of these children—I did not know there was one—if a child had the disease called tabes mesenterica she would waste away in the way we have heard, except as to the lice; that is an independent matter—she would arrive at the stage of the bones coming through the skin—I am now assuming a case in which the surrounding treatment was proper, but that there was active disease—assuming active scrofulous disease, and that the surroundings were right, the condition of emaciation would be the same, and death would probably occur—the legs in that case would be probably drawn up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Assuming that it was true tabes mesenterica, the treatment I have heard proved, would undoubtedly accelerate the death—the appear<lb/>ance spoken to in the condition of Kate Smith would be the natural appear ance of children not scrofulous, but neglected in the way I have heard—I am able to determine on examination whether children are scrofulous.</p>

               <p>Street, Deptford—I attend to the business—Miss Addiscott dealt with us for bread for the home daily; the children fetched it two or three times a day, three or four quarterns a day—I know Miss Addiscott; I have been to the home and frequently slept there for a week together on a visit—I slept with her in the front parlour when the children were ill—I was there on the Saturday night before Kate Smith died; she was lying in the back parlour on a bed—I cannot swear to every article she had on, but there was a sheet, a blanket, and a counterpane on the bed—she was very ill indeed—Miss Addiscott was in the room with her—I was not there when Mr. Finlay came—I saw a bottle of medicine on the mantelpiece, and Miss Addiscott gave her a dose while I was there—I have been to the home every day during the whole time Miss Addiscott had it open—I took an interest in it, especially when the children were ill—I never saw any beating or slapping of the children by her; she always treated them very kindly while I was there, and never attempted to slap or beat them in any way—my father has lived in the neighbourhood nine years, and is well known in Deptford—I always thought the home was conducted very well indeed—Miss Addiscott used to like the children very much; everything I saw there went on very satis<lb/>factorily—I was there every day in the winter; they had fires every day when it was very cold—I never saw the children pick up cabbage stumps in the street; I have seen them pick up orange peel, which hundreds of children will do; my own brothers and sisters have done it.</p>

My husband is engaged in Her Majesty's Cus<lb/>toms—I am the mother of the prisoner; she first started this home in July, 1877, she is now 22 years of age; she had a little money left her by her grandmother, I cannot tell the amount—I live three or four. minutes' walk from the home in Douglas Street, a private house—before my daughter opened the home she took a good deal of interest in these matters—after she opened it I went there every morning to see her—for the first two or three weeks I don't think she had more than two children, the numbers gradually increased—at one time I think she had as many as 14 or thereabouts; I was in the habit of going about the house and assisting her daily, up to the end of April—I have eight children—I had nothing to do with the money matters—I have been there when the children have had their meals—they had regular meals—they had bread and butter and tea for breakfast, sometimes bread and treacle—I have seen them have meat and potatoes for dinner, and currant pudding and boiled rice, and I have seen</p>

               <p>them have soup, not on the same day, sometimes one, and sometimes the other—they dined in the front parlour during the winter; there was a fire there—my daughter would be with them superintending and giving them their dinner; she kept no servant, only a charwoman or washerwoman—she did the cooking herself—they had bread and butter with their tea—they slept in the two pair front room—they had straw beds, with two sheets, one blanket, a counterpane, and two pillows on each bed; I have seen them with my own eyes—I have never seen my daughter beat the children, she was always kind and affectionate to them—there is no pretence for saying that I ever had occasion to interfere between her and the child she was beating—I never saw her beat a child with a clothes' line, a poker, or a broomstick—the children were fond of. me and came to me occasionally; they never made any complaint to me, and I have had one with me for three or four days together from morning till night, and if she had had a complaint she would have been sure to have made it to me—I have never received coals that my daughter has paid for, I am thankful to say I don't require it—I recollect the illness of Kate Smith; I saw her the day her mother came with her to the home, she was a very slight delicate girl; her mother said that she was in her 13th year then—I thought she was very little for that age—I saw her every day from the time she came in up to the time she took to her bed—she was in a bed in the back parlour, it was an iron bedstead, with two sheets, a blanket, counterpane and two pillows, as I have already stated; by night we should put an extra blanket on her if cold, but she was close by the fire; we used to have a fire in that room—Dr., Ayres and his assistant both attended her; Dr. Finlay saw her on the Saturday evening, as she died on the Sunday morning—the doctor paid her every attention and I myself attended on her day and night—it was my custom every morning to make her something and take it. her—I would cut her a dinner from off my own table and take it her; I would make her a custard, or a pudding, or anything that I thought her appetite would take; she was properly treated—it is not true that after her death the insects crawled from her head and body, and had to be picked off by her sister—I laid her out, and so I did the other two. I did nothing with her hair; that was taken off five or six weeks before she died, so that her head might be kept clean—she had long hair, and it was thought best to cut it short—when I laid her out there were no lice or insects crawling about her bed and over her body—there was not the sign of such a thing on her, she was kept too clean—my two daughters also partially assisted in these matters—I never saw any bruises or marks on the children—Mr. Bottomley, of High Street, Deptford, acted as the undertaker—she died on the Sunday, and she was put in the coffin on the Monday night between 8 and 9 o'clock—that would be about the proper time—I have had the misfortune to bury a child.</p>

I am a licentiate physician practising at Deptford and the neighbourhood, and a M.R.C.S.—I first became acquainted with the Home for Friendless Children some time in September last year—I had not the slightest knowledge of Miss Addiscott before I was called in professionally—I was called in off and on from that time up to April last, on a number of occasions; myself and assistant together paid from 50 to 60 visits—occasionally the children were brought to me at my surgery by Miss Addis<lb/>cott, and I prescribed for them—I saw Kate Smith; I think it was about seven or eight days before her death that they called my attention to that particular case—she was suffering from the very worst form of scrofula—she was thoroughly wasted, thoroughly emaciated; very large head, and every symptom of scrofula that there could possibly be; in fact, what is known in the profession as quite the old man appearance—I hold that scrofula must necessarily be hereditary—she presented the appearance of being a scrofulous subject for some time previous to my seeing her—I should think I might have seen her perhaps five times—I prescribed for her what I considered to be right and proper—I sent medicine, not cod liver oil; I never send cod liver oil if I suggest it; I merely order it—I believe I did prescribe it; I did not see her taking any—I remember advising it, and seeing it in previous cases in the same home—I rather think I saw her last, not my assistant—I saw her after death on the Sunday in the back parlour—I was sent for by Miss Addiscott on account of the death—she came to me for my certificate on the Sunday evening, and I said I would come and see the child—I saw no indication of lice crawling about the bed or the head—I did not take particular notice of her head when I saw her before her death—she had not long hair—I believe the hair of all the children was cut close; I cannot charge my recollection, but generally at the home I have seen the hair cut close, as generally with children—it is always so in every Institution, to keep the head clean, and it was so in this home—I saw the body before I gave the certificate—there were no bruises upon it—I simply looked at the child; I did not examine the body—I did not notice anything—I noticed the linen in the bed—I have a very large practice amongst the poor classes</p>

(Read; "21st April, 1879.—This is to certify that from my medical knowledge of the Girls' Home, managed by Miss Addiscott, at Deptford, I have come to the conclusion that from want of funds or other reasons the children in the home, to a large extent, suffer from want of nourishment, considering that nearly all the children are poor, disposed to scrofula and tubercle, and in such cases efficient nourishment and warmth are most desirable elements in the treatment of such diseases.") I do not know whether the persons I gave that to are the authorities of the Greenwich Board—I think three detectives came to my house, Inspector Phillips was one—I did not write that voluntarily or under pressure; I wrote it at their suggestion—they asked if I would give a certificate to get these children away from the home—I said "I don't see what I have to do with the home or the certificate"—they said "They had been there with the Coroner and Dr. Long, and they believed the children were all starved"—I said "If that is your belief the best thing will be to get them away, and, rather than allow any suffering I will give you a certificate with pleasure"—it was my opinion that there was not sufficient warmth—I do not know of proceedings against Miss Addiscott after that by the guardians—I telegraphed or wrote to the Home Secretary—I did not introduce the solicitor for the defence to Miss Addiscott—I did not introduce my own solicitor to her—I did it exactly in this way, I have never seen Mr. Clark or her together in my life; he is my solicitor—he has been my solicitor six months—I did not suggest that he should be</p>

I am servant to Miss Brown, Higham House, Shooter's Hill Road, Blackheath—on 23rd December I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and put it in an envelope, enclosing 1 1/4 yards of ribbon, and addressed it to "Mrs. J. Pickthorne, Hatherley Fields, near Gloucester," and handed it to my fellow-servant, Grace Miller, to post it, giving her two packets at the same time and the money for the postage.</p>

I am travelling clerk in the Missing Letter Depart<lb/>ment—in consequence of complaints at Shooter's Hill Branch I instructed Poliee-officer Fry to search the prisoner on 4th July—Fry took from him a bunch of keys—I accompanied the prisoner to his lodgings, 28, Bedford Place, Shooter's Hill Road, and saw him unlock a hat-box there, and found in it the first part of the letter produced, and subsequently the second sheet—I said "How did this come here?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Do you know anybody living at Higham House?"—he said "No"—I said "This letter appears to have contained something, and is I believe a post-letter; I shall want some satisfactory explanation as to how it came here"—he said "A young woman left it one evening on the counter at the office"—I said "You had no business to break it open"—he said "It contained a piece of blue ribbon; it was not properly fastened down or addressed"—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling musician—I am married—I have have no fixed abode; I am always travelling—I came up from Brighton on Monday—I have known the prisoner two or three months—I became acquainted with him by stopping at his coffee-house in Oakley Street about half a dozen times—my wife does not travel with me; she does not live with me—I am 22 years of age—on 3rd July at 2 a.m. I was sitting in the coffee-shop humming a song; I had been to a race meeting, and came in that night—the prisoner had unpleasant words with his mother and she went to bed; he then came into my box, and sat on the opposite seat; I Was looking at a hole in the ceiling, and asked him what it was—he said it was a ventilator, and then leaning forward said "Would not this place burn well? I will pay you well if you will set tire to it, for I am well insured"—I said "Oh, would you?"—some one came in, he was called away, and I want to bed; later on in the day he went and bought a glass oil lamp—I did not see him buy it, but I was in my room and heard his sister ask him why he had not bought a 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one, a small one—I did not catch the answer—I was at the top of the street that evening, and saw the prisoner helping to move the furniture out at the front window—I went to the station, gave informa<lb/>tion of what I heard, and took Sergeant Elton back with me; but before that, at 2 o'clock I was standing opposite, and saw the prisoner going to an oil shop in Oakley Street with a bottle—he said he was going to get paraffin and order coals—before that he said he said he would move the best of this furniture, as he did not wish the best destroyed; that was Thursday night—I went to bed at 1.55 by his clock, which I don't think was right—he gave me a glass oil lamp to take upstairs, and I went up without saying anything—I was sitting in the shop all the evening according to my orders; I went to my room, he followed me soon after, and went down again and brought</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050138"/>
               <p>up a pint bottle of paraffin; the same bottle I saw him with the day before—he began saturating the carpet in front of the bed with paraffin; then lie said "It is time now," and he set light to the mattress with the lamp; previous to that he had tried to break the glass of the lamp, but could not, so he took the globe off, and said "I shan't throw it down, as it will make too much noise"—he put it under the carpet, and tried to break it with his fist, but did not succeed—he then set fire to the mattress, and upset the lamp on the floor, and pushed the whole of it under the bed—he told me to stay two or three minutes, and see it well alight—I said nothing, but rushed and gave the alarm to the detectives who were in the street—they sent me for the fire-engine—to the best of my belief on that Saturday morning at 2 o'clock his mother and sister were in the house, and a man Dick who lodged there—I did not see them go to bed; they had rooms at this end—no one occupied the room over me.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050139"/>
               <p>or where she slept—I do not know whether Dick's name is really Charley Colerick—I have slept with him several times, but I did not sleep with him on the Thursday night before the fire—I slept by myself, I am sure, and on the Wednesday night I do not think I was in London—I did not sleep with him when I went to bed at 2 o'clock on Thursday morning—I am certain he was not sleeping in the room over me on the Friday nighty because I know his bed-room is not on that side of the house—I know his bed-room, because I have slept with him—he was in the house that night to the best of my belief—I did not tell him that the prisoner was going to set fire to the place, nor did I tell the mother or the sister—I had only been in my room a few minutes when the prisoner came in with a bottle of oil—it was a dark-brown wine bottle—I got a reward two days afterwards for com<lb/>municating the fact of the fire.</p>

On 3rd June, shortly after 10 p.m., Shepherd made a communication to me outside Kennington Road Police-station—I went to Oakley Street, and saw a van standing outside No. 118, a coffee-house, and a bedstead, bedding, drawers, boxes, and bundles being placed in the van, and some were being brought out at the first-floor window—I saw it removed to, I believe, 52, Brook Street, Kennington Road, not above 300 yards off—I have since seen it in some rooms there—I saw Shepherd again next morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, and gave him certain directions—he came again that evening about 10 o'clock and made another communica<lb/>tion—I told my inspector, and then obtained Inspector Chamberlain's assistance, and he and I, and another inspector and a constable, remained in Westminster Bridge Road and watched the house—I saw Shepherd run out a few minutes to 2, shouting, "Fire! He has set the place on fire," or "set the room on fire"—I told him to call the fire-escape man, and told the constable to spring his rattle—we then went to No. 118—the door was open; we shouted, and ran up the staircase, and saw a, light under the door of the first-floor back room—on opening the door we saw a bed, the foot of which was facing us; the left side was against the wall, the right side was flaming, and there was fire underneath—I heard a voice downstairs, and saw the prisoner's sister in her nightdress, with a blanket on her—she said, "Where is my mother? Save my mother"—she directed us to another staircase—Chamberlain and I went together, and found the prisoner dragging his mother out of a room—we took her downstairs, and I asked him if there was any one else in the house—he said, "Yes, there is a lodger upstairs," pointing to No. 118—we went to the second-floor back, over the room Which was on fire, where I found a man asleep in bed—I believe his name is Charles Colerick—we came down, and I asked the prisoner if there was any one else in bed—he said "No"—I told him I should take him in custody for setting the house on fire—he said, "I know nothing of it"—he had his arms full of clothing; he was dressed, except his boots—I took him to the station, and ran back to the house, and with the fire-escape man, and water-jugs and tea-leaves, we extinguished the fire—I found this parcel under the bed—it is common drugget; it was wet, saturated with paraffin oil—I also found there this top of a paraffin lamp, and in the shop I found a bundle of bread, butter, cheese, bacon, and ham—the cupboard doors were open, and old papers were all over the floor—I charged the prisoner at the station, and found 13 or 14 keys for all the doors, two or three pounds in gold, between seven and eight pounds in silver, nearly 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze, and a deposit note for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been deposited in the London and Westminster Bank the previous day, and also some brass taps—he gave me a key to open the door of 52, Brook Street, where I saw the furniture which I had seen removed, and in a box I found these two policies. (<hi rend="italic">These were both dated 21st February, 1879, one for </hi>600<hi rend="italic">l., and the other for </hi>300<hi rend="italic">l., on the furniture, wearing apparel, and stock-in-trade of William Best.</hi>) I also found there this covenant of a lease—this board (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the floor under the bed just where I took the lamp from—I saw what remained of the furniture of the coffee-house, a few old bedsteads with mattresses and sheet coverings—I should say that all the furniture in the bedrooms would not fetch 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if sold—the furniture at Brook Street was better.</p>

I spoke to Mr. Hunt on, I think, June 24, and wrote an order from Southwark Police Court for thorn to go for this key—it was about the beginning of July that I gave information which led to the prisoners' arrest—I first met Simkins about the latter end of August or the beginning of September, 1878, at Kippar's house—I know it was five or six weeks previous to my apprehension for housebreaking in the Old Kent Road—my friend Workman was arrested previous to me, and a man named Harding, but Baker is his proper name—the first time I saw Simkins was when I took the key to him at Kippar's house—I mostly saw him there—I was not a friend of Kippar's till I was introduced by Workman:—I only visited Simkins while this thing was going on—I went several times to his house during the present case, and I saw him once in a public-house on the day we went to Union Street—we had a glass when we all met at Kippar's house—Simkins drank a glass or two; he never stayed more than a quarter or half an hour—we generally met about 11 a.m. when he came out to lunch, and Simkins would run over sometimes for a minute if he was going on an errand—I have been at Kippar's two or three hours, and Simkins has called in twice—we made it a rule to be there at 11 o'clock to catch him when he came out to lunch, and I have seen him there in the evening—I do not know that he was engaged to be married to Kippar's daughter—I do not know that I have seen her at the house—I saw a girl at the police-court who was represented as his daughter—I have not spoken to Harding or Baker since I was apprehended—I did not see him at the police-court giving evidence—Mr. Hunt told me that he was a witness. Cross-examined by Mr. Ribton. My age is 33—I have been convicted I believe six times prior to this, and am now under sentence of penal servi<lb/>tude for 20 years—I have been sentenced to penal servitude twice—I gave evidence last Session against my friend Workman, and his brother-in-law and his wife—I have been tried at the Surrey Sessions once too often, that</p>

I am barman at the Princess of Wales, London Road, about 2 minutes' walk from the Elephant and Castle—I attended the police-court as a witness for Harford on the Monday before I actually gave evidence, but was not called—I gave my evidence on the remand on the next Saturday, and was bound over—on the Wednesday or Thursday following Sunday the 20th, the prisoner's wife said some<lb/>thing to me, in consequence of which I knew that he was in our house on the Sunday previous—he came in about 10.80 p.m., and was talking to two or three friends of his—I served him—he stayed between 25 minutes and half an hour, and left about 5 minutes before closing time, which is 11 o'clock—I described his dress at the police-court before seeing these clothes—he was wearing a kind of corded coat and this cloth cap—I know Beckwith's Baths in Westminster Bridge Koad, it would take about 7 minutes to walk there briskly from the Princess of Wales, and about a quarter of an hour to walk from the Elephant and Castle to Westminster Bridge—the Baths are about 5 or 7 minutes from Westminster Bridge—it is about 9 minutes' walk from the Baths to the Elephant—I did not see his trousers, his coat was buttoned right up—I did not see Lingard and Small there, they were not the men he was talking to—the police have not spoken to me about this—I have no interest or desire beyond speaking the truth—I am sure he was not out of my sight from 10.30 to 10.55.</p>

               <p>and saw Francis Tarrington and asked him if he had a son-in-law, Henry Atkins, in his employ—he said, "He works for me on and off; he is out of employment"—I said, "Has he been working for you to-day?" and he said, "No, he was at my shop about 10.30 this morning" I said, "He is in custody for having a box of plate in his possession, and has made a statement implicating you, and you must come with me and hear what he has to say about it"—he said, "I know nothing about it," and went with me—on the way to the station he said, "I suppose some one must have asked him to carry a box, and he has been foolish enough to do so; that is a thing I would not do for any person"—I made no reply—at the Kennington Road Station I repeated in his presence the state-<lb/>ment Atkins had made to me, and Atkins said, "That is right"—Francis said, "It is false, I know nothing about it!" and afterwards called me and said, "I remember now, a man came to my place this morning and asked if I had a young man who could carry a box for him over the water; I said, 'Yes;' I suppose this must be the box; but it was not brought in my presence, and I have not seen it"—they were all three then charged with unlawful possession of the silver—we afterwards ascertained that it had been stolen from Major Barron, and on ex<lb/>amining the premises, I found the area door leading to the scullery had been forced open and the barrel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the bolt broken off, and the door leading from the scullery to the kitchen had been forced open with a jemmy; the thieves had then gone through the kitchen, up the staircase into the second-floor front bedroom; I saw there a wardrobe which had contained the plate had been opened by force, and another wardrobe from another room from which the linen had been taken—I afterwards searched Francis Tarrington's premises—he is a coal-dealer, and has a forge under the shop—I took several chisels and screwdrivers to compare the marks on the door, but I found Major Burron had caused the house to be put in repair.</p>

On the 23rd July, with the Magistrate's permission, I saw Francis Tarrington in a cell—he said, "I wish to tell you the truth about this affair, and then that young woman who gave evidence this morning will be the first one you will take. There were four other men in the job; one of them is her young man, and Scotty is another man; Tom Green is another; I do not know the name of the other young man—the servant's young man I mean. The servant's young man put up the job, and let them in or kept her away, I don't know which, till they got in; they took the stuff to a house in Queen Street, Soho Square, first, but there they would have nothing to do with it; they were back to my house a little after ten the same night, and took it down into my cellar. I saw it was silver or silver plate; it was wrapped up in a sheet, or something of that kind. They wanted me to buy it, but I could not, I had not got the money. They went out saying they would get a buyer, and soon after came back with Tommy Farmer; he bid them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce for it, but they would not take that, and as Farmer went out of my house he said to me, 'They want all for themselves.' They then brought a man named Stone, a barber, who keeps a shop in Drury Lane, and he gave them 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per ounce for it; he (Stone) brought the scales and weighed it in my cellar, and it fetched 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd. I went down again after they had weighed it, and said, 'Ain't you gone yet? Are you going to stop here all night?' <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> then said, 'There will be an outcry about this soon, as they won't pay the young fellow who got them.' Stone then hired George to carry the things to his house. They all four came to my house on Friday night. I know <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> and Tom Green, but I had never seen the other two before. The servant's young man is a tall smart young fellow with a dark moustache. The plated stuff that you have got was to be taken to the York Hotel, York Road, and I think it was Tom Green who was going to meet it there at 6 o'clock that evening. I do not know where it was to go from there. My brother (Samuel) does not know anything about it, he is as innocent as a baby"—I took the words down at the time.</p>

               <p>Lower Road, Eotherhithe—on Friday night, May 9th, I secured the house and went to bed at 11.30, and on getting up at 4.45 next morning found the drawers wide open, and one pulled out, and the contents strewed about the floor—I missed from the drawers five sheets, a child's coat and cape, an overcoat, a silk scarf, five pairs of stockings, a chemise, a guernsey, and from the cupboard a table-cloth—I called in the police and found the window-fastening in the back yard broken off—and I saw two marks—a person could get over the gates from Maynard Road into the yard—I went to the pawnbroker's at the policeman's request, and saw this shawl and other things there—they are what I missed.
