One Day I observed that the Prisoner had got a Pair of Leather Breeches behind him, under his Coat; I asked him what he had got there, he said, he had only got his own Leather Breeches; I asked him whether he wore two Pair of Breeches; he run up Stairs and threw these down, and brought down an old Pair of Buckskin Breeches; I went up and found these Breeches, which he had under his Coat; I know the Cloth Breeches are my Father's, and that they were never sold; and that he never had Power given him to sell any Thing for us.</p>

               <p>Andrews. I was in Liquor; but not so much, but that I was sensible of what was done: - there was 7 s. 6 d. in Silver, and the rest in Half-pence: she gave a Knock with her Foot, and there came a Man into the Room, who threatned to throw me out of Window, and throw me down Stairs if I said any thing; I should have taken the Money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290006"/> from her if it had not been for the Man: I charged the Constable with the Prisoner, and a Watchman with the other Woman (Yates) to keep her in Safety, that I might find out the House; and the next Day she came voluntarily, and went before the fitting Alderman: the next Day, after the Constable had her in hold, they told me if I went into the Room I might find my Money, and I took the Money off the Middle of the Quilt on the Bed in the same Room - there were Eleven Shillings - when I went into the House with the Constable he searched for the Prisoner, and she was lying up. on the same Bed. -</p>

               <p>Davey.

            . On Sunday, the 5th of June, as I was coming down Holborn-Bridge, I met a young Woman, who took me to Mrs Ballard's House; we went up one Pair of Stairs, and the young Woman called for some Liquor, which I suppose to be Gin; they had it and drank it, I never tasted it: I gave them Two-pence half-penny for it, they said it was not enough, so I gave them another Half-penny, and was for going away; says Ballard. You must not go till you make us a Present of something else, and I said, I would not give them any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290008"/> thing else, and I would go about my Business. I was sitting at the Bed's Feet, and Harris and another Woman pushed me backward upon the Bed; and, as soon as they had done that, in rushes 2 or 3 more; they got my Shoes off instantly, to get my Buckles; after they had got my Buckles, they got to my Fob, and they took a Silver Cross, they took a Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and a Note of Hand of 3 l. 3 s. which I did not lay in the Indictment. - The Gentlemen of the Jury did not put that down, because I did not know the Date of it. - They used me in a very vile Manner; and if the Watchman had not come to my Assistance, I believe I should have been dead; for I could not have held it out a Quarter of an Hour longer - they stopped my Mouth, leaned upon my Breast, and strove to stifle me as much as they could; I believe I cried out Murder for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour; and when they found the Watchman came to the Door, they run down Stairs - I had not Strength to keep any of them in Custody; as soon as I could I came down Stairs, and saw one of them standing at the Door, with a Poker in her Hand; and, she said, if I came any nearer she would knock me down.</p>

             was there; and to the best of my Knowledge, she was the chief Person that stopped my Breath. - I was astonished; I was out of my Senses; they laid upon my Stomach, and stopped my Breath, so that I could fearce breathe - I cannot say whether Harris did it or no, but she was the first Person that threw me down upon the Bed, and lay upon my Breast.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harris. Was I the Person that was charged by the Watchman first; was there not some-body else discharged, that was concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Flannigal. There was one made her Escape; that was the Woman that stood at the Door, with a Poker in her Hand, and threatned to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Harris. I was not secured at all, till they had all made their Escape but me.</p>

               <p>Flannigal. Harris hid herself in a little bit of a Hole, like a Coal-hole; and the Constable pulled her out, and asked her what she had to do there, and she said she was asleep; I did not know which way the others went.</p>

            . On Sunday Night, the 4th or 5th of June, I was at the Watch-house; a Man came and told me, there was crying out of Murder in Chick-Lane; I went and took my Watchmen with me; and the Neighbours said, they believed they had all made their Escape; however, I searched the House, and found the two Prisoners; Harris was in the Closet, and Ballard was behind the Bed, in the Room below Stairs; I carried them to the Watch house; and Ballard said, if I would let her go back, she would endeavour to find the Things; I sent three Watchmen with her, and in about a Quarter of an Hour they came back with the Things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ballard say, that she was, or was not concerned in the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Bothomly. She said, she was not concerned; but if she was not, what Occasion had she to hide herself.</p>
               <p>Ballard. One of the other Watchmen found the Things upon the Bed.</p>
               <p>Price. When she pulled the Bedstead down the Bed tumbled down, and there they lay - she did not take them up; she said, here they are.</p>
               <p>Harris. I was a little in Liquor, it being Sunday Night; and my Husband beat me, and cut my Mouth, and made me in a Gore-Blood; and I went into the Closet to hide myself, and Ballard said, stay there, and he shall not hurt you.</p>
               <p>Ballard. I was very ill, and had taken a Sweat, and I laid myself down upon the Bed - though the Bed turns up, there is room for any Body to lie behind it.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner 14 Years; she always pretended to me, that she belonged to Plays, &amp;c. and was employed in Singing, and Dancing upon the Ropes, and dresses sometimes in Mens Cloaths. The 8th of this Month she came to my Shop in High-Holbourn, with this Gown upon her Back, and asked me to change it for something that fitted her better; she said, she had it out of pawn; and they would not let her try it on. without buying it outright; I gave her another Gown for it, and two Shillings to boot, and 18 d for this Apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A Dutch Woman carried me to Mrs Marsh, and had half a Crown for carrying me; I was to give her 8 s. a Week for my Lodging and Board; she lent me these Things to put on to go into Company. <rs id="t17430629-18-verdict110" type="verdictDescription">

The Prisoner said he was in Necessity, and wanted Bread, and begged hard to be excuted; I told him it was a very bad Way of getting his Bread; I resolved to prosecute him, for it is but common Justice; he said before the Alderman, that it was the first Fact that he ever committed.</p>

             told me the Boy had thrown them into the Lodge, for he had been with me about a Quarter of an Hour before to see a Prisoner in the Goal: I asked the Prisoner how he came by them, and he presently, owned that he had them from on board of a Vessel down at Billingsgate; I sent a Man down to the Vessel that he said he had them from, and he brought a Person to me who knew the Owner of the Things; and when he came on the Outside of the Gate, he asked the Prisoner how he could serve him so; but said, sooner than prosecute him, he would lose the Goods, so I thought proper to prosecute him. Said I, I thought you had been a poor distressed Boy, but now I see what you are. - I know of this Boy's coming after some loose Boys in the Compter.</p>

            . I know nothing farther of the Prisoner than his coming to the Poultry Compter to see some of those who are under Consinement there; he came with this Parcel of Things, and there happened to be a Mob at the Gate, which he imagined were coming after him, so he threw them into the Turnkey's Habitation; and I desired him not to let the Boy have them. for I thought he was not a Person likely to have such Things of his own, so I sent for a Constable and charged him, and I found that this Parcel belongs to a poor Miller in the Country, who has not a Farthing of Money to carry on the Prosecution; and before he could raise the Money to prosecute the Boy, the Goods must be lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They bid me bring the Things into the Lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask the Boy to bring the Things up to the Lodge?</p>
               <p>Kingston. He is a loose Boy that comes after the Thieves, he brought them in, and being a little surprised, he threw them into the Lodge; so I told Mr Cox it was proper to stop the Things and the Boy too, till we could come at a little better Knowledge of the Affair, and in about a Quarter of an Hour's Time he confessed that he took them out of the Boat, and brought them away clandeslinely; they were taken out of a little one Mast Boat, and he said no Body was on board the Boat when he took them - I am an Under-Turnkey, my Business is to look after the Rats and Mice.</p>

my Friend said, may be may be come out; and in about ten Minutes Time, I saw the Prisoner come out of the House; and, I observed, that she had a great Lane of Goods in her Apron, and I did not perceive that she had any when she went in; I followed her, and called after her, and said Mistress, or Madam, but she would not stop; I then ran after her, and ever took her, and caught her in this Manner, with both my Hands, by her Petticoats, and hold her fast; I asked her what she had been about in my House, or the Apartment that I had in the House she said, she had been doing no Harm, for she had been no farther than my empty Entry, therefore she could do me no Harm - I never saw he before that Time in my Life; she said, she had been bundling up Things in the Entry; I asked her what they were? she said, it was no Matter to me. for they were her Goods: I told her I would see what they were; then, she said, if I would see what they were, I must go with her where she was going, and I should see there; I told her, I would go no farther, but would see them: I held her fast, and put one Hand into her Apron; and the first Thing I saw was one of my own Gowns (there was a large Parcel of Goods produced, as in the Indictment. which were sworn to by Mrs Wheeler) the next Thing I saw was my Husband's Shag Breeches, with the Knee-Buckle in them, the Fellow of which I had then in my Shoe, and have now; when I saw them, I made no farther doubt but they were all mine; I still held her, and cried I was robbed and desired the Neighbours to send for a Constable: she desired that I would not put her into the Hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290015"/> of a Constable, or a Publican, and she would return me my Goods; I own, says she, I have done an ill Thing to you; but if you will let me go about my Business, and not put me into the Hands of any Body - if you will not put me into the Hands of any Body, and not expose me, I will give you your Goods and your Money; the first Time she only said she would give me my Goods; I did not know that she had got any Money; because I did not recollect, that there was any Silver among the Cloaths; and I was frightened for fear she should have got to my other Money; and then, I was willing to withdraw from the Folk, which I had called to my Assistance, to get her into the Apartment again, from which she had taken the Things, thinking she would return me the Money; and believing that she had got a large Sum; I took her into the Entry she came out of, and shut to the Door to keep the Mob out; she then threw down the Cloaths, and put her Hand in her Pocket and pulled out the Money, and gave it me; when I found it was only the Silver that was in the Cloaths; I threw it down; for I was very glad she had not got to the other Money) and then I went to open the Door, to let in the People I had called to my Assistance; she then went to hold me, to prevent me from opening the Door of the Entry; I pushed her from me, to let the People in, that the Thief might go to Newgate; but, I was not willing she should go, till I saw whether she had got my other Money; for she might have spent my Money in Newgate; and, if I had sent her there, she would not have delivered me the Money; and I could not swear to the current Coin. - The Reason of my opening the Door, was to have the Prisoner secured; for I could not have kept her long, if I had not had Assistance: when I opened the Door, some of the Neighbours came in, and desired the Door might be shut again, to keep the Mob from running away with the Things; they bid me take my Cloaths off the Ground, and tie them up, and see what Money there was, which I did, and there was four Shillings; said I, to the Prisoner, there was more Money than this; she said, she had two Shillings when she came in, and if she had more than that, it was my own; she put her Hand in her Pocket, pulled out four Shillings, and put two of them into my Hand, which made six Shillings, and said she had no more, then she begged and prayed for Mercy, and that she might: have Leave to run away, but I thought it was not safe for me to let her; so she was secured, and carried before Justice Deveil; one Thing I forgot, that when the Neighbours first came in, they heard her throw down a Key, and I made her take up the Key, and give it me; and they desired me to go up, and see whether that Key opened my Door; and that Key locked and unlocked my Door, which was then open, and my Drawers swept of all that was in them; I desired she might be searched, and there were 8 Keys more found upon her; there was a Street-Door Key, Keys for Chamber-Doors, and other Keys.</p>

               <p>* The Law allows not the Assistance of Counsel, as to matter of Fact, on any Indictments for Felony, yet, it is the Opinion of many, it would be never the worse, if it did; for, it seems very strange, to allow a Man this Assistance, in Defence of his Property, and deny it to him, when his Life lies at Stake.

            . I keep a Publick-House in Oxford Market; as I was at my Door, I heard somebody call Mr Norman; I turned about, and saw Mrs Wheeler have the Prisoner hold by the Petticoat, and was bringing her along; and desired me to come to her Assistance; and, in the mean Time, took the Prisoner over to her own House; and then I went into my own House again, and sent my Wife; and when I came, the Door was bolted, or latched; I stood a Minute or two, and the Door was opened; there was a Parcel of Linnen lying upon the Floor; I can swear to some of them. Mrs Wheeler was making a great Noise, and said, she was robbed of all she had: There were four Shillings and some Half-pence lying on the Floor; the Prisoner pulled four Shillings out of her Pocket, and gave Mrs Wheeler two; and said, the other two were her's; she began to cry, and begg'd for God's Sake, that she would let her go about her Business; for she was a poor unfortunate Woman, and did it to support a young Child, which she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About six Weeks ago, Mrs Smith came to my Shop to speak to me (she owed me 16 s. 6 d.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290016"/> and desired I would go along with her to see some Lodgings; I told her I could not go; then she came another Time; I told her I was going to leave my House, and take a first Floor; she said she had taken a pretty Place, and desired I would go and see it; this was on Saturday Se'nnight, but I could not go, and on Monday I went to Ratcliff Cross : On Tuesday I saw Mrs Smith again, I told her. I I could not go then, for I must go to the Boarding-School in Cavendish Square; but I would go on Wednesday, and accordingly I did go with her, and as I came down. Oxford Square, says she. Come up Stairs, did not I tell you I had a pretty Apartment; I must move before Quarter Day, and I desire you would see whether there are any Bugs in the Walls, for I had a Receipt from abroad to kill Bags, and had no Occasion to take her Things. She went up one Pair of Stairs higher, and asked if one Mr Johnson was within, a Child answered, and said no; she had a Bundle of Cloath pined up, and she gave them to me to carry for her, and she gave me the Money; I had not got three Yards from the Door before Mrs Wheeler said, G - d d - n you for a B - h, you have robbed me; I said, Madam, I have not; (for no Body could see what I had) I was afraid of her, for I found her to be a very violent spirited Woman, she said little to me, but she called me all the B - es she could think of; one of the Gentlemen of the Jury told me she was a vile Woman, and would swear any thing, and if your Lordship will inquire into her Character, you will find her to be so *.</p>
               <p>* This comes with a very ill Grace from the Prisoner, whose Life is probably owing to the Compassion of the Prosecutrix: For had this Felony been laid to have been committed (as the Fact was) in a Dwelling-House, it had been a capital Offence.</p>

            , says I, Sarah, Moll Rosum has got my Watch; and she said she would find her, but I did not find Poll till Ten o'Clock that Morning. I found her at the Three Tuns, hollowing, and making a Noise in her drunken Airs; I brought her down to Little Charles's, but could not make her own it; and some of the same Sortment that were there said, D - n you, you old where, are you not ashamed to serve my Master so, if you do not give him his Watch, I'll do you a Mischief. The Prisoner was pleased to use a great deal of scurrilous Language; Says she, Is that your Watch? D - n you, you Dog, do you know your Watch? Then she put her Hand into her Bosom, and pulled out a Seal and Ribbon; said she, Do you you know that, if you do not know your Watch? and I said yes, I could swear to it; I could to the Seal, if I could not to the Ribbon: Come, says she, if you will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290018"/> give me a Quartern, I will give you your Watch; so I was forced to comply, and I gave her 7 or 8 Quarterns, but could not get it; now, says she, your Watch is pawned for 15 s. and if you will give me 16 s. and 6 d. I will fetch it out of Pawn; so I gave her 16 s. and 6 d. and followed her to the Bull and Butcher at Cow-Cross, and then to the Boar's Head Tavern, and said, Now, Poll, let me have the Watch; and she laid the Watch down on the Table, and I took it up; she said, You son of a B - h, there's your Watch, you shall be one Pint of Wine and I will be another, and we will drink together; and we drank 3 Pints of Wine together - she laid the Watch down on the Table at the Boar's Head Tavern in Smithfield, and insisted on a Pint of Wine; and after I had taken it up, she said, Now you have got your Watch, you shall see I do not mind a Pint of Wine any more than you do, I will be a Pint with you; She had a pretty deal of Money in her Pocket then; I believe she deceived me in the pawning of the Watch.</p>

               <p>* See No 303. P. 187.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I will explain that a little: About 2 or 3 Months ago, I was going my Rounds, and met her, says she, Master, won't you give me a Dram? (she was very drunk) says I, you are too old to be a Whore now; there is no Body will have any thing to do with you, it is Time to leave it off now, and if you don't you will go to Hell into the Bargain. - She said if she could get half a Crown she would leave it off; that she had not half a Crown in the World; said I, it is hard that all you have in the World is not worth half a Crown; if I thought it would do you good, I would not value half a Crown, and I bid the Woman at the Chandler's Shop give her 2 s. and 6 d. and I would give it her again; said I, perhaps 5 Shillings will do you more Good, and the Woman gave her 5 Shillings by my Order: Poll, is not this Truth? [The Prisoner did not deny it]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You were upon the Bed with me when you missed your Watch, when you kissed me and hugged me, and called me, My Dear: Did not you find your Watch again your own self; I did not think you would expose yourself after this Rate.</p>
               <p>Palmer. After a Month's Imprisonment, and starving alive, I should have thought you would have talked in another Manner; I submit it to the Court, whether they think I would have to do with such a Creature, as that, when there are fine Girls enough to be had - I thought, as I was Constable, I was very safe; I was not afraid; I thought they would not offer to rob me.</p>

            . Last Tuesday, about 6 o'Clock in the Afternoon, this little Girl (Pointer) came to me and said, Mr Barnes, there is a Boy in our House, and he has hid himself behind the Curtain; I went to Mrs Harvey's, and found him in the Kitchen; I put my Hand into his Pocket and pulled out this Hair; said I, Let us see whether you have got any Thing else, and I found all these Things upon him; he took hold of my Hand, and begged of me to perswade her to make it up, and begged of Mrs Harvey to make it up; he said it was the first Fact. He had this Bunch of Keys in his Pocket; there are 7 Keys, one of them opens Mrs Harvey's Drawers, and one of them opens mine - He said, These are my Keys: This Common Prayer-Book was found him, but this no Body owns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw these Keys in my Life before, nor any of these Things; as to that rough Hair no Body can swear to it. <rs id="t17430629-36-verdict209" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live in the New-Change in Rag-Fair; on the 30th of May, I got up between three and four in the Morning, and saw the three Prisoners bringing this Pot to Sarah Green's Door; they went by Nick-Names then; one was called Doctor, another Blueskin, and the other Cock-Eye: I stepped over to them; says Hudson, we have been moving Mrs Green's Goods, and as you are a Bricklayer, if you can get her a Chap for this Pot she will be obliged to you; I asked the Price, and he said 17 s. said I 17 s. is too dear; on Thursday sen'night, I went to Mr Rowe's, and Mrs Rowe said, she wished they were hanged that had stole her Copper; and wanted to buy one; I told her I had seen such a Thing, which is to be sold; I went with Mrs Rowe to Mrs Green's, and asked her if she had such a Thing to dispose of? yes, said she, I have; she took 8 s. to the Pawnbroker's, and fetched it out, and paid 2 d. for the Use; Mrs Rowe, as she was founding it, said, this is my Kettle, it cost me a Golden Guinea; they agreed for 12 s. and my Mistress gave 6 d. Earnest: I went to Justice Jones, and got a Warrant against the Prisoners, and against Sarah Green; she was charged with an Officer, and it is thought he had a Bribe to let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that is the Pot you saw between three and four in the Morning, in the Prisoners Custody ?</p>
               <p>Butler. Yes, I can safely take my Oath of it, with a clear Conscience; here is a particular Mark upon it; here is a Bulge in the Side, and a Flaw in the Rim; there is not one Pot in five Thousand more remarkable; I examined it, when they asked me the 17 s. for it; I saw it upon Hudson's Head that Morning; he went then by the Name of Cock Eye; Hudson was the Person who offered it to Sale, and the rest were officious in saying it was worth so much; I saw it in all their Hands.</p>
               <p>Hudson. I never saw the Man in my Life.</p>
               <p>Butler. I have seen him a great many Times; there are so many of them, that a Man cannot come along Day or Night, but he is liable to be knock'd down; I have seen Hudson frequently picking of Pockets.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about a Fortnight; about two o'Clock on a Tuesday Morning, I cannot tell the Day of the Month, the Prisoner got over a great Wall, into the Church Yard, and then into Mr Cunliff's Garden, and took all these Things off the Lines; there were four of us; the Watchmen beset us all. I was taken up by Mr Lindsey, the Watchman, with the Things upon me; the Watchmen popped out upon us all of a sudden; the Prisoner, and the two others ran away. - The Wall was so high that he could not get over it without his Legs being helped up; nobody was over the Wall but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Lindsey. I took the Linnen from Burton; he stood upon one Step, and the Linnen lay upon another. I saw three of them together at first; two of them flew down like two Birds; at first I thought they had been Figures chalked up against the Wall, I did not reckon there was any Men there. - I believe the Prisoner was one that run down the Steps. - I saw but three in all. - I took Burton upon the Steps: I believe if Webb, the Watchman, had not come to my Assistance, they would have knocked me on the Head. I think I heard an Expression, if I had known he had been coming, I would have knocked his Brains cut: Burton said I was a Watchman, but I am an Officer: Burton said, he wished I had been damned, and in Hell, before I saw him. G - d d - n your Blood, says he, I can tell what you can do; you can send me to New-Prison, and then I shall go to Kingston. <rs id="t17430629-40-verdict227" type="verdictDescription">

After they had knocked me down, one of them put his Knee upon my Breast, while the other rifled my Pockets, and took away my Money, which was sixteen Shillings; upon my crying out Murder the Watch came, and they seeing that the Watch were coming, they took away my Hat and Wig, and made their Escapes; when they were gone, the Watch came up; I charged the Watch with the Woman, and the next Morning she was carried before Justice Richards, and was discharged.</p>

               <p>Fennel. By the Light of a Candle in the House, where I drank the Pint of Beer; and the Woman of the House said, it was a Shame to use a Man so. - I have known the Prisoner ever since April last, by living in the Neighbourhood. I do not know whether he knew me or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kneeled upon your Breast?</p>
               <p>Fennel. Neither of these two Men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your Money out of your Pocket?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. How could you see that the Prisoner was the Man that knocked you down first?</p>
               <p>Fennel. It was by the Light of the Candle, that was held out of the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you first cried out?</p>
               <p>Fennel. I did not cry out 'till I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, that the Prisoner was the first Person that knocked you down?</p>
               <p>Fennel. Yes: I could see every Thing as plain as can be; I saw the Man's Face as plain as can be; if there was no Light but the Light of the Element, there was Light enough to see his Face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to enquire into his Character; because they cannot hang me for what they tried me for before, they have trumped up this Thing; I know no more of it than the Child unborn.</p>

On the 21st of this Month, about 11 o'Clock at Night, the Prisoner, two more, and myself, went into the Blue Anchor in Rag Fair, to drink a Pint of Beer; while we were there, the Prosecutor came in, and called for a Pint of Beer; while he was drinking the Pint of Beer, there was a young Woman came to the Door, and he asked her to drink, and he wanted the Woman to pay for the Pint of Beer: The Landlady turned the Woman out of Doors, and would not let her be along with him. While he was drinking this Pint of Beer, we resolved, when he went out, to rob him; and when he got about twenty Yards from the House, the Prisoner at the Bar struck him with a Mop-stick, and knocked his Hat and Wig off first, and then the Prisoner struck him several Times more, and at last knocked him down. After he was knocked down, two of us fell upon him, and took the Money out of his Pocket; the Prisoner is the Man who took the Money out of his Pocket. In the mean Time, while he was taking the Money out of his Pocket, the Woman who keeps the Blue. Anchor, came out with a Candle, and as we were going to run away, the Prosecutor laid hold on the Prisoner; and one of the Persons, who is got off, beat the Prosecutor very much with a Mop-stick; then we all got away, and the Prosecutor pursued us a good Way afterwards.</p>

               <p>Mrs Brotherton. I heard a Noise, in a Place which we call the Hole in the Wall, fronting the Market; I got out of Bed, and looked out of the Window, and saw the Prisoner, the Prosecutrix, and two more Women together; the Prisoner stopped the Prosecutrix, just by the Door where I live, and she said, she would have her Money; she said, she had none; the Prisoner pulled her Pocket clear out, and turned it, and finding she had no Money, she cursed and swore, and untied her Apron, and said, she would have that; she begged and prayed, for Christ's Sake, that she would not take her Apron; says she, Do not take my Apron away, for I am going to a Gentleman's House, and cannot do without it: I said at first, what are you going to rob the Woman; and told her, I would call the Constable, who lived at next Door; she said, he might be d - d, and I too; she took away her Apron, and swore violently, and run away; the last Witness pursued her without Stockings, Shoes, or Breeches.</p>

               <p>Jury to Mrs Brotherton. When you looked out of Window, and saw the four Women together, did not they look as if they were Arm in Arm?</p>
               <p>Brotherton, when they found that she would not consent to give them her Money, they took her Apron from her by Force; and the other two Women held her, while the Prisoner did it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mullins. You say, the Prisoner turned the Prosecutor's Pocket inside out; what did the Prisoner say then?</p>
               <p>Mullins. She took hold of her Apron, and tore it from her; I saw it plain enough all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. The Prosecutrix seems to be a pretty lusty Woman, did not she struggle with her?</p>
               <p>Mullins. She did struggle with her, I believe, as much as she could; but the Prisoner gave her several Blows; and at last, gave her a Blow upon her Arm, and then took her Apron.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the two Women near at that Time?</p>
               <p>Mullins. They were not near her Body. <rs id="t17430629-47-verdict266" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Beginning of May, the two Prisoners came into my Shop, and asked for some Cambrick, I shewed them some which they said was too fine for them. I went to take down another Box of Cambricks, and as I was doing it, I saw the Little One in the Red Cloak, ( Chaloner,) shuffling something downward into her Pocket, or into her Cloaths. I could not discover which as she stood close to the Counter; I was very much surprized, and stood a Minute or two where my Box stood, and had hardly Power to stir; I fixed my Eyes upon her, and she her's upon me: I stood still for some Minutes, and did not speak a Word. Poole, pretended to fall into a Fit, says Chaloner to Poole, Molly, my dear, Molly, what are you a going? Molly, my dear Molly; Sir, I hope you will not take it amiss, this Gentlewoman is frequently troubled with Fits, four, five, or six, in a Day; says I, I believe this a Fit of Conscience, if it was a real Fit I should discover it. I saw some Tears come out of the Corners of her Eyes, and I thought it was a Fit of Sorrow; she was about ten Minutes before she came out of this Fit; then they looked upon me, and I upon them a good while, and said nothing: At last says Chaloner, Pray, Sir, what is your Cambrick a Yard; I said 4 s. she said, cut off a Quarter of a Yard; I cut off a Quarter of a Yard, and she gave me a Shilling: Upon which as they were going out of the Shop, I said, Hark you, young Woman, I must have a Word with you before we part; upon which I led them both into the back Shop, says I, I am very sorry that I have Occasion to say it, but I am positive of what I am going to say, I am sure you have robbed me of something, and I will search you before you go out of my Shop; I shall be sorry for what I have said, if you are not guilty. When I was going to search them, this Piece of Lawn of Mr Brown's was dropped in the Shop; they stood both close together, and it was found under them upon the Ground: One Mr Bishop, who was in the Shop at that Time, took it up, and asked me, before the Prisoner, if this was not my Property; says he, I saw her, (Poole,) lay it down; No, said I, I have nothing of this Quality in the House, but no doubt but it may belong to one of my Neighbours; said I, do you keep them here, and I will go through the whole Street but I will find out the Owner, if 'tis possible. I went among my Neighbours and into Mr Brown's, and asked if he knew any Thing of it; he owned it, and came to my Shop, and charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290029"/> the Prisoners. Then I took them into a farther back Room, and put my Hands on the outside of their Petticoats, but found nothing; so I desired my Wife to search them, and sent them up Stairs, and I saw them drop a Piece of Lawn upon the Stairs. I did not know I could indict them for it as it was dropped in the House; if I had found it upon them, I would have put it into another Indictment. Mr Bishop said, I have seen you several Times at Guildhall: Poole said, she had been lately deluded by Chaloner, and said she had not been used to this Part of Life, and had been honestly brought up; that her Friends live in the Country, and that she came to Town very lately. I asked her how she came acquainted with Chaloner; she said, she met with her in the Street one Evening, and said she wanted a Lodging, and Chaloner said she should go and lie with her, and the Lodging was upon the bare Boards. - When Bishop said he saw her lay it down, she did not deny it. - I cannot say that she owned it.</p>

            . The Prisoner is the Person who had a Ring found in his Custody, which I lost the the latter End of last March, or the Beginning of April, from off my Counter: A Jew and his Interpreter came into the Shop to ask for some Goods he had bespoke of me, which were some Smelling-Bottles, mounted with Gold; and there came a Lady, her Child, and Servant, into the Shop; I was behind the Counter, and had the Ring in my Hand, putting it into a little black Case, in order to send it to a Customer of mine in the Country: The Jew stood nearest to me; I held the Ring in my Left Hand even while I served the Customer. - I might lay it down and take my Hand off it to pull out a Drawer, and then lay my Hand upon it again; the Jew had no Occasion to stay for any Thing. for I told him I had none of the Things he wanted. I missed it the very Minute the Jew was gone, for I designed to carry it away the Minute I was at Leisure. The Lady and the Jew went away pretty near together. - I did not pursue the Jew immediately, for I was willing to mistrust my self first, and think whether I might not have laid it aside. - It was an

Mr Batalliard, one of my Workmen, happened to come into the Shop, I desired he would go to the Coffee-House among the Dealers, and endeavour to find out whether such a Thing was offered to sale, and for fear I should not meet with the same Ring again, I desired him to get an Emerald as near that as possible, to make the Gentleman another Ring. Some considerable Time afterwards, he brought me a Stone, and laid it down upon the Counter; I thought it was the same, because it looked prodigiously of the same Colour (he brought it to me the last Day of May). When I saw the Stone, I said, Where had you this, I fancy it is the very same Stone that I lost; when I dropp'd it into the Socket, I said, depend upon it, it is the very Stone that came out of the Socket; said I, I do think I am confident of it now, because it fitted to an Exactness. [Mr Bataillard produced the Stone, and Mrs Markham said, she believed it to be the Stone that came out of her Ring] I was sent for by my Lord Mayor the first of June, and was very much surprized to see the Prisoner, the Person who had the Ring in his Possession. I knew the Man very well before, and if I do him Justice, I do not know that he came into the Shop at the same Time that I lost the Ring. I had an ill Opinion of the Prisoner before, and was surprized to see him; He used as generally as he came by to open the Door, and ask if I had looked out my Diamonds, for he wanted to buy some Diamonds of me; and when he came and asked for them, I told him I had not them ready. I made that Excuse because I did not care to show him them. - I cannot tell the Value of the Emerald in particular.</p>

Said he, if you will come into the Publick-House, (I think it was the Three Compasses) I will give you a Tankard of Beer. As we were setting there, Stebeno showed Mr Polak a Ring, with a green Stone in the Middle set round with Diamonds. - I cannot tell how many; if I am not sure I will not say it; if I was positive I would speak it. - There might be nine, ten, or twelve. Polak asked Stebeno, how he came by the Ring; Stebeno said he found it in the Street; Polak asked him what was the Price of it; said Stebeno, I cannot say the Price, I will leave it to your own Judgment, I know you are a Man who will give me the Value of it, and will not wrong me: Polak said, If I should be honest to you, I cannot tell what it comes too without taking out the Stones and weighing them: So Polak took out the middle Stone and the Diamonds, and weighed them in a Scale. I cannot tell what he weighed the Diamonds to, whether two Grains and a Quarter, or what, but Polak said, he would give him 3 l. 10 s. for it; says he, If any body will give you more, take it, - or if you can get any more take it, and come to me last. Stebeno said he would leave it with him; - Stebeno agreed to take the 3 l. 10 s. - and he gave him a Guinea in Part.</p>

I was not for her buying it, because I thought it was rotten; my Wife said she would put a Linning to it, and it would serve for the Nursery, and she gave her 9 s. for it. She said her Husband was dead, and she was going to sell off all her Things; that Quilt stands me in 30 s. and I can buy a new one cheaper; that Man in the Blue Coat said, he wanted to say something to my Wife in private, he went to Alderman Heathcote for a Warrant, and he knowing me to be a Man of Credit, he would not allow it, (grant it.)

The Prisoner brought this Pot to me to sell, whether she put it into the Scale, or whether I did, I cannot tell; I asked her whose it was, she said, she would go and fetch the Person that owned it; I told her, I must stop her, she gave me two or three Slaps, and tore my Shirt out of the Gathers; we followed her, and took her; when she got into London, she said, she did not value us; she abused us very much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the Pot from a Person who came from Mr Crisp's House, and was so much in Liquor, that I could not tell what I did. <rs id="t17430629-59-verdict328" type="verdictDescription">
