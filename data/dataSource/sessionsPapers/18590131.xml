                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—I am now principally engaged by the Mint authorities—on Saturday, 22nd January, in consequence of information I went to 63, Cranbrook-street, Victoria-park, about half-past 2 in the afternoon—I was accompanied by Inspec<lb/>tor Bryant and some other officers—I directed constable Elliott to go and knock at the door—it was opened by a little girl—I directed Elliott to run into the yard—I went to the back-parlour door, which was closed—I forced it open with a sledge hammer, and rushed into the room—I found the three prisoners there sitting at a table by the fire, which was a clear bright one—the other officers entered with me—Tiggell had a file in her right hand, which she flung down—the male prisoner had a plaster of Paris mould in his left hand—he came towards me and made a Kick at me—I pushed him into the corner with the sledge hammer—at that time Margaret Pike commenced stamping on the mould, which the male prisoner had thrown down—I pushed her away and she fell over a chair which was behind her, on her back on the floor—that was to prevent her stamping on the mould—before this I had seen Margaret Pike sweep a handful of shillings off the table, some of which she threw into the fire and I saw melt—some dropped on the floor in different parts of the place—that was on my entering, before she stamped on the mould; it was all instantaneous—I saw the coin which went into the fire, melt, it melted instantly, almost as quick as butter—after I pushed Margaret Pike and she fell, she lay on her back and kicked me with great force with both feet; she kicked in all manner of directions, and seized several of the fragments of the broken mould with her hand, and crushed them in her hand—I saw that—the prisoners were secured, and Serjeant Evans put into my hand this piece of mould of the obverse side of a shilling—before the prisoners were secured Tiggell stamped on the remaining part of the mould as much as she pos<lb/>sibly could—when the prisoners were secured they were taken to a distant part of the room, close to the door—I examined the fire—I found on it this tobacco pipe with white metal in it in a fused state—on the floor I found five counterfeit shillings, which I also produce—the half plaster of Paris mould was put into my hand by Serjeant Evans, it was quite hot—only one part of the mould was found perfect, the fragments of another</p>

               <p>part were found—I produce a band for holding the mould—that was also warm—on the mantelpiece I found a good shilling corresponding in date with the counterfeit, and I believe the one from which the impression was taken—in the cupboard I found a jug containing acid, some bottles, some metal spoons, and a deposit cup for a galvanic battery, and some brushes—the wires were attached to the battery—I saw Evans find them on the ledge under the window—in the cupboard I found some plaster of Paris in powder, and a composition called <hi rend="italic">slumming,</hi> in a saucer, that is used to give the coin a dull appearance after it is electro-plated—I also produce some spoons, and a file that was picked up off the floor by Inspector Bryant—I saw Tiggell throw it down—I took possession of the things—I said to the male prisoner, "Well, Dick, I come to pay you another visit" (the women were present)—he said, "Yes, work has been very bad, and we were obliged to do this for a living"—Margaret Pike then said, "Oh Dick, oh Dick, I told you months ago it would come to this; you had better have kept to your work"—she said, "Mr. Brannan, save my child"—I said, "I have nothing to say to you,
all the imprisonment you have had has had no effect upon you"—there was a little girl in the room, the one that opened the door—the prisoners were all taken to the station.</p>

I would have smashed it all to pieces, I would have stuck a knife in their hearts before I would have parted with it"—I afterwards found this file (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor—there was white metal in the teeth of it—on the mantelpiece I found this bottle containing acid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a receiver of letters at the Post-office, Oxford-street, kept by Mr. Stephenson—on Saturday, 8th January, about a quarter past 8 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in for 3 shillings' worth of stamps—I served him, and he gave me in payment a sixpence, and what appeared to be a half-crown—after he had gone, I looked at the half-crown, and I believed it to be a bad one—I then went out after him, but could not see him—I took the half-crown back again, and put it at the back of the till, where I kept the gold—I kept it entirely apart from any silver—it remained there until Monday—the till was locked up, and I had the key of it—on Monday morning, about 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner walking up and down in front of the shop—he at last came in, and asked for half-a-crown's worth of stamps—as I was getting them out, he took some silver out of his pocket, about 3 half-crowns, and 2 shillings—he did not attempt to give me the money, so I asked him for the half-crown before I would give him the stamps—he refused to give me the money until I had given him the stamps—he then put the remainder of the money in his pocket, except the half-crown he was going to give to me, and I called out that he was the man that gave me the money on Saturday—when I said that, he ran out of the shop, and I ran after him, calling "stop thief—he was stopped by a gentleman in Winsley-street—I was close up behind him—he turned round near Winsley-street to strike me—after that a gentleman stopped him—the</p>

               <p>had heard, I believed him to be an honest industrious sort of man, but that he was possessed of no means as far as I could ascertain, and that I would sell him the goods only for cash—up to that time he had not mentioned the purpose for which he wanted the canvas—I remarked to him that, supposing his principal could not pay him, he did not seem to be able to pay us—he said there could be no risk in the matter, that he was to be paid for the canvas by an order from the captain of a vessel in the docks upon his owners or brokers—he did not name the vessel at that time—he also added that there would be no risk, that we should have a bill on the vessel for any stores or canvas that might be supplied—after some conversation on the matter, I said that I would sell him the canvas on conditions, first that he would tell me the name of the vessel, and that he would hand the order from the captain on his owners to us for collection, for us to receive the money from the owners and account to him for the balance—he then said that the vessel was the <hi rend="italic">Mary Ann,</hi> Cape of Good Hope, commanded by a Dutchman whose name he did not recollect; and he agreed at once to deliver the order, which he did—I then told him that we were relying in this matter entirely upon the truthfulness of his statement—he said that I might rely upon his honesty and truthfulness—he said the canvas was required for sails for the vessel—I supplied him with canvas to the amount of 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said that he had a contract with the captain for a set of sails; and that he was to get them made up by a sail maker—he did not tell me who the sail maker was—I suggested that I should send the goods to the sail maker to save trouble, and I asked his name—he declined to give me the name, as he did not wish the sail-maker to know from whence the canvas came, and he asked me to send the canvas to Railton, Sim &amp; Co., shipbrokers, Seething-lane, one of his referees, as being convenient for the captain to see the canvas there, being close to the docks—I accordingly despatched twenty-seven cases on the 15th, which was all we had in the warehouse at that time, and the remaining sixteen on the 22d—the prisoner called on the 20th to inquire if the rest of the canvas was in hand—I told him it had not arrived, but I expected it on the Monday—he told me to deliver it where the first parcel had been delivered, and it was so delivered—I believed the statement he made that he had a contract with the captain to supply the vessel with sails—I parted with the property upon those representations—I afterwards saw the prisoner at Bow-lane station in the custody of Knight the officer—he requested me not to press the charge, and said that he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account if I would send or go with him, and that he would find security for the remainder—I said that I must go on with the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—On the 21st January I went to the prisoner's house, No. 13, Denzell-street, Clare Market, with Mr. Bryant and other officers, about 8 o'clock in the evening—on entering I saw the prisoner in his shop, in his shirt sleeves, with his arms folded—it is a tobacconist's shop, and he sells a little stationery—when I went in, he unfolded his arms and placed his left hand on the counter—I lost sight of his right hand—I believe he put it under the counter—he stooped—I put my hand against his breast, and pushed him back against the back part of the shop—he put his right hand behind him, and placed his hand on this sword that was on the wall—he did not succeed in getting it down—I called to Mr. Bryant, saying if he did not seize him he would do some mischief—I got over the counter, and Mr. Bryant pulled him away—at that time this sword fell down between him and I, and he was then pulled from that part of the counter—I put my hand into a drawer-hole in the counter, and at the end of that there is a small hole which is sufficient to admit a person's hand, and in that hole, which is behind the drawer-hole, I found this bag, which contains five crowns, each wrapped up in separate papers; twelve half-crowns in one paper, and two florins in one piece of paper, and on the ledge of the drawer I found two florins, loose—Mr. Bryant and Serjeant Brannan took the prisoner into the back parlour—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> I have come to pay you another visit"—he said, "Yes, I wish you <hi rend="italic">was</hi> dead, you old b—r"—I said, "I have been instructed to pay you a visit for dealing in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "This is strong symptoms of it"—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker of 12, Parry-street, Lambeth—on Saturday morning, 25th December, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Parliament-street going home—a female came up and asked me to accompany her, which I declined—she asked me if I would treat her to a glass of drink—I said, "No"—she said, "If you will go into King-street over the way, you can get some coffee there or anything else you like to drink"—I said "No; I am not going out of my way, I am going to Cannon-row and over Westminster-bridge, and I might get some coffee there"—she walked by my side, and just as I turned into Cannon-row, a person seized me violently by the throat from behind, pulled my neck back, thrust his knee into my back, and held me in that position, suffocating me for the time, while the female, who was in front of me, rifled my pockets—I am confident it was a man's grasp—I thrust my right hand into the female's mouth and held her bottom jaw as tightly as possible, and she cried out two or three times, "Take your hand out of my mouth"—the person behind me released my hand from her, and that enabled me to call out "Police" several times—I was thrown down, and the person knelt on my throat while the woman rifled my pockets—they tore my clothes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my waistcoat; it is torn all across from this pocket where my watch was, attached to this ribbon which I have on now—I had 5 half-sovereigns in a little bag, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—that was left safe in my breeches pocket—there was a lamp three yards facing me—the policeman came up, and my watch fell from my pocket and hung by the guard, which it could not have done if my waistcoat had not been torn—I was holding my waistcoat at the time of the struggle—I am confident that the woman rifled my pockets, but cannot say whether the man assisted her—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and live at Romford in Essex—on 22d January I was on a visit with my wife at Mr. Hudson's, 3, Upper Lansdowne-terrace, Notting-hill—I was disturbed about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, looked down the well staircase, and saw a light at the bottom, which appeared to come through a glass partition at the basement of the kitchen stairs—I immediately went down—the light continued till I went over the drawing-room passage, when a person could see anyone coming down, and as I got to the last stair, the light suddenly vanished—I then examined all the doors as I passed; the drawing-room door was fastened, and the door leading down to the passage also—I opened the green baize door of the room, and it was perfectly safe, but I heard a door slam in the kitchen, looked out at the hall-window, and saw the prisoner climbing up the area stairs and over the area gate into the path—I rushed out after him; he ran down the terrace, and directly he saw me he called out for assistance—I followed him about one hundred yards; he turned round preparing to strike me, and I knocked him down, held him, and called "Police"—three policemen came up, and I gave him in custody; he directly pretended to be tipsy—the constables went into the house, and left me to guard the gate and the hall—one of the ladies, Mrs. Maldon, said in the prisoner's presence,</p>

               <p>"Walter, are you alone? is any one with you?"—he said, "I am by myself"—I had known him in Mr. Hudson's service upwards of four years—the door he was attempting to open used always to be kept locked in his time—I examined the hall door, which was fastened; the lock had been tried with some instrument, and the wood was burnt as if a candle had been held to it—three panes of glass had marks of a man's fingers, and one pane had had the putty cut by a knife like this, which was found in the area, and which had been used to snuff a candle—two panes in the kitchen window had been broken for a hand to undraw a bolt, and two panes at the bottom were broken—I saw some meat found in the kitchen, which had been cut off, and mustard and salt put on it—the piece of candle was found on the mat at the door—I also saw a quartern loaf, which had been recently cut—I saw the piece matched with it, and it corresponded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure it was me on the area steps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Positive; I saw another man in the road when I came back, when I was watching the area gate—he was not there when I ran after the prisoner—I am sure he was not the person who ran up the area steps—I knew the prisoner to be Mr. Hudson's servant—I saw his face by the gas when he was on the area steps.</p>

I am cook to Mr. Hudson—I went to bed on Saturday night at a quarter to 11, and fastened up the kitchen window—I afterwards saw that there had been a pane of glass taken out—I was aroused by Mrs. Maldon about 1 or 2 o'clock, went downstairs, and heard somebody leaving the area gate, and saw Mr. Mashiter follow the prisoner—the bread and the beef had been cut, and I saw a piece of candle lying on the mat by the door; it had been taken from a cupboard in the kitchen, and was a whole candle when I went to bed—I had looked and bolted the passage door the night before—some wine was taken from a full bottle which stood on a table in the passage when I went to bed—when the prisoner was brought back, Mrs. Maldon asked him if he was alone, and he said "Yes"—he did not say what he came there for.</p>

From information I received I went to the Holywell public-house in Shoreditch, on Saturday, 4th De<lb/>cember, about ten in the evening, with Clark, and other officers—I found the two prisoners and another man drinking together—we took them out, and charged them with breaking into a house at Hackney, and assaulting a police constable—Frost said he was in the country—the other man made no reply—they were all three taken into custody—I took them to Evershed's house, and they were all three placed before him—he knew nothing of the third man—I afterwards took them to the station—the charge was taken down and read—Frost then said, pointing to the third man, "that's the man that done it, and I'm going to do it for him."</p>

I am a surgeon, at Clapton-square—on the morning, 30th November, I examined Evershed at the Hackney Police-station, he was in a state of considerable exhaustion from loss of blood and the injuries he had received—I examined his scalp—he had four severe contused and lacerated wounds, which had been bleeding very freely, they extended to the bone, varying in length from an inch and a half to three inches—a blunt instrument like a crowbar or jemmy would be, just the sort of thing likely to produce such wounds—I have attended him up to the present time—the sight of one eye was impaired at one time, but it is getting better—he is decidedly improving, but still very weak—at times suffering a good deal still from the general shock to the system.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Christian visitor, and live in Willens-row, Kentish Town. In 1856 my wife was unfortunately deranged, and she was conveyed to St. Pancras Workhouse—Mr. Ford ordered me to pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week for her maintenance to Mr. Birchmore—she went there on 3rd De<lb/>cember, 1856—the first payment was due on 10th December—I paid that to the prisoner, and he put his initials to the sum in this book (<hi rend="italic">producing it.</hi>)—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 10th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 17th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 24th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 31st, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 7th of January; and on the 14th my wife was removed to the hospital—I paid the money to the prisoner in the lower office, under the hall—the entries are in this book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Director of the poor of the parish of St. Pancras, and one of the audit committee—the prisoner was relieving overseer of St. Pancras—there was a written appointment in 1857—I have not got it—he has told me he received money on behalf of the parish—he paid money from week to week—the money he had collected—I did not see him pay it, but I saw the book in which he professed to enter the money he received and paid—this is the book—I cannot say of my own knowledge whether Mr. Copar had acted before the prisoner did—the prisoner's course of business was to enter the monies he received during the week, to pay over the money to Mr. Hibbard, the clerk of the directors, handing the book in; and that book was handed in to the audit committee on the following Friday—we examined it—I was not present when the money was paid over—I know what was the practice—I never heard from the prisoner that he paid over any money that was not entered in the book—I cannot tell at all from anything the prisoner said, whether any sums were paid in by the prisoner without their being entered in the book—when these particular sums of money received from Griffith were called to his attention, he did not then say that he had paid these sums—he acknowledged he was a defaulter—on the 15th of October the audit committee made a certain report relative to Mr. Birchmore, and on the 16th of October he called on me at my private house, and told me that the half-year's dividend of some Consols which he had received in April had not been entered, and I then, not having a suspicion that he was a defaulter in any other amount, told him he had better go and receive the other half-year's dividend, and pay the two half-years' in together—he then asked me if I thought the audit committee would qualify or alter their report—I told him I could not say, but I would summon them for the following Mon<lb/>day, and give him the benefit of making any statement that he might think proper to make—the committee met in consequence, on the 18th, the fol<lb/>lowing Monday, and the prisoner came before them and made a statement relative to the half-year's dividend—he was then asked if he was deficient in any other sums—he replied, there might be one or two trifling amounts, but if he were allowed till the following Friday he should be prepared to give an exact statement—the special committee was appointed by the board to meet on the Friday, according to that request—on that Friday morning, the 22nd, he again called at my house, and said he wished to make a com<lb/>munication to me—I told him I would rather not hear it; I would much rather he should leave it until the committee met—he begged me to hear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310030"/>
               <p>him, and gave as a reason for so doing, that he would much rather com<lb/>municate the case to me than it should be left to one of the directors who, he said, prosecuted him to find it out—he then said he was a defaulter to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that his surety was good—he then asked me if I thought the directors would consent to his liquidating it by retaining half his salary—I told him most certainly they would not do that, and the least punish<lb/>ment he could expect would be dismissal—he then said he hoped they would not prosecute him—I told him that, personally, I had no wish to do so; but it was impossible for me to tell what the board would do—that was about ten o'clock in the morning—the committee met at two o'clock, and he attended the committee, but I should say that I advised him to make what amends he could by telling the truth—he attended the com<lb/>mittee in the afternoon; I don't remember that he attended with his receipt book—a paper was produced, which I have in my hand, showing all the accounts—Griffith's account was called to his attention, and he was asked if he had received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But you told him to make what amends he could by telling the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I told him just before that I could not tell whether the parish would prosecute him or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are one of the directors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been so since 1856—previous to that I had nothing to do with the parish—the prisoner was relieving officer and nominal overseer—as relieving officer I am not aware that any charge was made against him—these are monies received by him as servant to the directors—in 1857 there was an appointment made—he was appointed by the Magistrate, no doubt—I can't tell whether there was an appointment in 1856—he is elected every year by the directors on their first meeting after Easter—the vestry appoint the relieving officer—the auditors were appointed in June, 1858—we disputed the authority of the Poor Law Board, and have had some trouble with our officers—some have absconded—the clerk of the works was taken in custody: not by my authority—I don't know whether one director charged another with stealing a handful of oatmeal—it was thought not a proper thing for him to do—the directors dining together at the expense of the parish was abolished in 1856—the prisoner was to pay over the money he received from Griffith—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310031"/>
               <p>was only nominal overseer—I always understood that he filled exactly the same office as Copar did—I have looked over this book—here is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on the 6th of December; I don't know what that means—all the money put in here was received—I was one of the persons to whom this book was in the habit of being submitted—five men chosen by the rate-payers generally were the auditors—this book was passed by the audit committee—the prisoner said he was a defaulter to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the amount he admitted was 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid by the surety—the sums received for persons in the workhouse were to be paid to the prisoner, and he was to pay them to Mr. Hibbard—these sums are paid for persons in the workhouse, and in the asylum particularly for lunatics.</p>

                  </hi> I am accountant to the parish—I have been an officer of the parish twenty-one years—I have gone through the prisoner's receipt-book—I think I made out a list which was laid before the directors—I do not find that the prisoner has here accounted for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received in the name of Griffith on 10th December, 1856, nor on 17th December, or 24th or 31st December, nor on 7th January, 1857—here is an entry of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 20th December, and the first entry of money received from Griffith after that entry of the 20th is in February, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but here is no date here—he has accounted for those two sums, the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has accounted for no other sums up to February—he has not accounted for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on 27th March, 1858—it is neither in March nor in May, but in April, 1858—here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that is given as having been received in one sum—I saw the prisoner at the vestry house on 22d October—we had conversation relative to his accounts—he stated to me that he was back in his accounts, and asked me what I advised him to do—I told him the best plan would be to communicate to Mr. Wyatt, and I think I asked him about what he was deficient—he said somewhere about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was there when Mr. Copar used to act; he held the same office as the prisoner does—on his death the book was handed to the prisoner and Mr. Copar's name erased.</p>

On Tuesday, 11th January, at half-past 8 in the morning, I went with two constables to 3, Kepple-street, knocked at the door, and it was opened by an old lady who lived in the house—I saw Harragan coming down stairs, and asked him if he lived there—he said, "I do; I am the landlord of the house"—I asked him in what room he lived—he said, "Up stairs on the first floor"—(there are no back rooms)—I asked him if he had any linen drapery in his room—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "I am not satisfied with that; we shall have to search your place"—we searched, and I saw sergeant Bell find two bundles under the bed, consisting one of ribbon and the other of gloves, wrapped up in two shawls—I said, "You must consider yourself in my custody"—he said, "I knew the bundles were here, but I did not know what they con<lb/>tained"—there was a piece of carpet along the bed on the floor, which he kicked under the bed while Sergeant Bell was searching under the bed—I took him to the station, and policeman <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 85 was left in the house.</p>

I am a private in the West York Rifle Militia, raised at Pontefract—on Wednesday, 19th January, about half-past 1 o'clock, I left Pontefract with Hacket, a deserter—I fetched him out of Hatfield Gaol the day before—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to the corporal, and my instructions came from him—I went with Hacket by rail from Ponte-fract to Hull, and then by steam to London—I landed at Fresh Wharf on Friday, 21st, with Hacket and the corporal—Hacket was fastened to my wrist by a handcuff—he stood at Fresh Wharf, London Bridge, with two other men and four women, who appeared to have been waiting for him—they</p>

               <p>halloed to him as soon as they saw him—we went to the Billet-office in Bermondsey and drew a billet—we went to the billet, and it was about 1 o'clock in the night then—the people got up, came down, and said they had no convenience then, but would give as a shilling each to get a lodging—the other people were then next door at a dram-shop—the deserter asked if we might go in there, and the corporal said we might for a few minutes—we did so, and had some refreshment—the prisoner was there, and said he would take us to a coffee-shop—we went across London Bridge with them—they wanted to take us to the left, instead of going over the bridge, but I would not—he said, "There is a coffee-shop, down here"—we went down the steps, and Hacket complained of his wrist being swollen, and asked if I would change hands; the corporal said that I might, and as soon as the handcuffs were off, one of the women pushed the corporal away, and Hacket struck me on the forehead and knocked me down—I jumped up, and the prisoner held me and prevented me from following, and Hacket got clean away up the steps—I kept hold of the prisoner—there were two men and a woman—as soon as they had given Hacket time to get away, the prisoner ran up the steps, and I followed him—he turned towards the bridge and ran up a street—there were then three of them—I followed him, shouting "Police," as loud as I could—he was caught, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am a corporal of the West York Rifle Militia; by virtue of this document purporting to be signed by the quarter-master-general, I received Hacket, and took him with the last witness to Hull, and then up to London—during the whole of this time he was in custody under this document—I went to get a billet at the place the billet indicated—the prisoner was with us—Hackett asked to have the hand changed from the handcuffs, and as soon as it was unlocked and his hands were at liberty, he knocked Dawson down and held him down, and I got a <hi rend="italic">clout</hi> of the head—the prisoner ran away as soon as he had got Hacket at liberty—I saw Dawson follow him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a billiard-table maker—About half-past 2 o'clock on the morning of 25th January last, I was proceeding along Lancaster-place near Waterloo-bridge. I was attacked by three men—one caught me round the throat, while the other two were in front. I hallooed "Murder and Police"—the prisoner Machin had hold of my arm—one seized me round the throat, and Fitzgerald tore my pocket out: there was in it a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, sixpenny-worth of half-pence, and two farthings, one of which had a hole in the centre, 3 keys, a knife, and a comb—the policeman, No. 20, and the toll-collector, heard my cry, and ran to my assistance—two of the men ran towards the Strand pursued by No. 20, and Machin ran across the road towards the new wing of Somerset House, and he was stopped by the toll-collector—he kept him till the policeman came back, and we then gave him into custody—here are 2 farthings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one of them has a hole—I know that farthing—these 3 keys are my property, and this comb and cigar-tube—I was sober on this night.</p>

On 10th November, about twenty minutes past 7 in the evening, I was returning from Bayswater to my own house—the gas was alight—I met the female prisoner in Hyde Park Street—my watch was safe a few minutes before that—it had a chain to it, and was in my right hand waistcoat pocket—the chain passed through my waistcoat button-hole, and the key was attached round my neck—she came quite close to me, and said, "I know you, Sir"—I said, "How do you know me?"—she said, "I live in this neighbourhood/' that she was a servant, and I think she Raid a ladies' maid, living in Hyde Park Square—at that time I saw Wilcox—he rushed round the corner of Hyde Park Square, and pushed the woman, as I thought by accident, against me—I thought she was frightened—I felt her hands about me, but could hardly say where—Wilson then came up, with a stick in his hand, as if he was walking, and said, "Which is the way to Hyde Park Square?"—Wilcox said, "This gentleman" (meaning me) "knows the neighbourhood much better than I do"—the female then disappeared—Wilson went down Hyde Park Street, And Wilcox in a different direction—about 10 o'clock the same night I missed my watch and chain—I believe the prisoners to be the parties—I believe I can say I am sure of them—Wilcox pushed the woman against me.</p>

I was going to wind it up—I took no steps that night—I did not make it known only at home—I informed the police next day—I do not remember any woman coming up and speaking to me in the street; such things do happen sometimes—I had drunk a glass of gin and water after dinner—I dined at home, and then went to my friend's house.</p>

I got up; he then was going to strike me again, and I lifted my hand (which had my penknife in, that I was cutting my nails with) to ward off the blow, and I cut him accidentally. I took away his jacket, and left it with Mrs. Weekly, not for the purpose of making away with it, but thinking he would give me my cape.

I was on duty on Friday morning, 7th January, between 11 and 12 o'clock, in Victoria-street, Clerkenwell—I saw a truck coming down from Hatton Garden—the prisoner and a lad were with it—the prisoner was first walking by the side of it, and afterwards he was pushing behind—I followed the truck to Cow Cross-street—they stopped and left the truck, and the prisoner and his son, who had met them about a hundred yards before they got to Cow Cross, and a man who lives in Petticoat-lane, who had been walking on the pavement by the side of the truck, went into a public-house-the prisoner and his son went in first, followed by the other man—I went in and told the prisoner I belonged to the police, and I said, "Are those goods outside on the truck, yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said "From home"—I said, "Where is that?"—he said, "In Brook-street, Brook's Market"—I said, "What are they?"—he said, "Cuttings"—I said, "What cuttings?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where are you going to take them to?"—he said, "To Petticoat-lane"—I said, "Where there?"—he said he did not know; he had been hired by a man named Aarons to take them there—"I said, "Where does Aarons live?"—he said, "In Brook-street; he keeps a marine-store dealer's shop close to where I live "—I took him into custody, and his son: his son was discharged—I took the trunk to the police-station, and examined it—it contained two whole pieces, of carpet, and some small pieces.</p>

On Saturday evening, 22nd January, I was in Guildford-street, Greenwich, in plain clothes, about half-past 7 o'clock, and on passing the Guildford Arms, I saw a horse and cart at the door—I looked into the house, and saw the prisoner Adams leaning on the bar reading a newspaper—I walked into South-street, Devonshire-road, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I saw the same horse and cart draw up in front of some unfinished houses, which I knew to be Mr. Fleay's—there was nobody with the horse and cart—I walked by it, and just as I got by, I heard footsteps behind me, and saw Shread come from one of the houses with a stick in his hand, smoking a pipe—knowing that there was a watchman there, I thought he was the watchman—he came up and looked me in the face but did not say anything—I went away and returned on the opposite side, and when I got past the cart with my back to it, I heard something fall in the cart, and saw Adams in it pulling at something, and a man with his back towards me pushing something into the cart from behind—they then went into the house—Shread was standing just where I left him, about thirty yards from the horse's head, still smoking a short pipe—a man whose face I had not seen, came out, brought out some lead, and shot it into the cart—I then saw his face, it was Walker—I am sure he is the same man who went into the house—he had something on his shoulder wrapped up in bass matting, but I did not know what it was then—I stepped into the road, and immediately heard a whistle which I believe came from Shread—Walker then ran through the house—Adams jumped out of the cart with the whip in his right hand—I pursued him; and finding I could not catch him, I made a feint after Shread who was walking away, and immediately I did so, Adams got into the cart again—he took the reins in his left hand—I ran to the back of the cart and said, <hi rend="italic">"Pigeon</hi> is it" meaning lead; "if you attempt to drive off, I will knock you down," draw<lb/>ing my staff—he immediately jumped over the side of the cart, ran away, and I saw no more of him—I had seen him at the public-house—I am sure of him—the lamps were at some distance apart—I then took Shread, and said "Halloa, Mr. Watchman, what <hi rend="italic">game</hi> are you after?"—he said, "I am not the watchman, I do not know the watchman; I have been to Mr. Jennings with an estimate for work"—I told him that I should detain him—a lad and a girl came across the road and said, "That is one of the men I saw in the house half an hour ago"—Shread said that he was not in the houses at all—I examined the cart at the police-station, and found these two pieces of lead, and two other pieces—I afterwards went back to the house and found another piece rolled up ready for removal in a piece of bass, weighing one cwt.—those in the cart weighed two cwt.—I have been on the roof and seen where they came from, but did not see the plumber fit them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Coldbath, Greenwich—I was at work at Mr. Penn's factory about half-past seven that evening—I was in South-street, Greenwich, near the new houses, and saw Shread going into No. 5, with a bass bag on his shoulder—I did not know him before—I went half-way across the road, and saw him—I was then about ten yards from him, and took notice of him—this is the sort of bag; it is rather worn—I am quite certain he is the man—when I came out, I saw Walker—there was a cart there then—Shread was about five yards from it, with a stick in his hand—I did not notice whether he was smoking—I saw his face—the lead was put into the cart, and a policeman came across the road, and said, "Halloa, what have you got here? it is lead"—Adams went round the horse's head from the house, and got up into the cart—the policeman said, "If you dare to drive that horse, I will knock you down"—Adams then jumped out of the cart, and I saw Walker run through the house—I had seen Walker come out of the house with a load, which afterwards turned out to be lead—I saw Shread at that time about five yards from him, walking slowly away—he was about two yards from the cart, with his back to me at the time Walker was bringing out the lead; he was behind Walker but not looking at what he was doing—this looks like the bag that I saw Shread go in with.</p>

               <p>—it was through Walker that I engaged shread—I never authorized any of them to remove lead from the houses.

                  </hi>. I am a plumber—I did not make these gutters, but was called to examine them—I measured them, and they corresponded with the lead—there are no edges, because they take half gutters up without cutting—I did not put them down Again because they were too heavy to get through the trap-door on to the roof—one end was turned up and the other down—they correspond in length, width, height, and weight—the lead is five pounds to a foot, and that on the roof is the same—I did not examine to see if the nail holes corresponded—supposing this lead was stretched out, it would cover the whole of the place which had been stripped—the gutter is in two pieces, joined in the middle: one piece comes over the other, and this is one half of the gutter—this would make it complete—about half a ton altogether was removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in service at Perry-hill, near Sydenham. On Thursday, 18th November, about 4 o'clock, I was coming from Catford-bridge towards Ladywell, Lewisham—I went across a footpath there—as I came to the third stile I saw the prisoner sitting on it—he got off the stile and came towards me, and when he got close to me he drew a thick stick from under his coat, and said "I demand what money you have"—he flourished the stick over me—I said "Oh, yes, you shall have my money"—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of half-pence—he then threw my cloak over my shoulders and searched me all over my bosom for my watch—he said "Where do you carry your watch?"—I said "I have no watch"—he said "Then let me look if you have not," and he searched me all over—he examined my pocket—he also tried to throw me down—he would not let me turn back again, but made me go on the way I was going, and he went the other way—I went on for about a mile before I came to a house, and I went in there—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich—on Tuesday morning, 13th January, about 10 o'clock, I was in a room in the barracks called B 1—the prisoner came in with two others who had just come from parade, Dumbelow and Rickards—they followed me out of the room again—my tunic hung up behind the bed, where it always hung when I was not on duty—it had been there three days—I saw my tobacco box about 10 minutes before ten—there was 14 shillings in it—I counted it; a witness who is here saw me do so—nobody else saw me count it—the pri<lb/>soner saw my box—he owed me sixpence; and after he got his pay at a quarter after 8 that morning, he came to pay me; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him sixpence out—I took it out of the box, out of my tunic pocket—he saw the box, and remarked, "You have got a lot of money there;" I said, "Not much"—about 10 o'clock I went out to get a shave—the prisoner, Dumbelow, and Rickards were then in the room—Dumbelow followed me out first, and then Rickards, and the prisoner was left in the room—I came back in about five minutes, and the prisoner was alone in the room—I went to my pocket to get the money to go and pay for a pair of boots, and I found my box and money gone—the prisoner asked me what I was searching for; I said, "for my tobacco-box, containing 14 shillings"—he said, "You must have mislaid it somewhere"—I looked about the room, but could not find it—I have not seen it since—I went and gave information to the corporal, and went with him to the Coach and Horses public-house—the corporal went in and came out with the prisoner—the prisoner said to me, "You do not think I have got your money, do you?"—I said, "I think you have"—he said, "All the money I have got is twopence; I only had sevenpence when I came out"—the corporal wanted to get him to the barracks to have him searched—he was not willing to come—I had to go after the picquet, he then went with us—the corporal went after the ser<lb/>geant; and while he was gone, the prisoner pulled off his boot and stocking—he held the stocking in his hand for a few minutes, and when he thought no one was looking, he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it under the bed—I heard something jink in the stocking—I went across to him and asked what he had there—he said, "It is the twopence I flung out but now; you can take it if you like"—I took up the stocking, and found in it 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and amongst it was a six-pence that I could swear to—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by this hole at the bottom of the head, and it is rather dented on the tail side—I saw that sixpence amongst the other money just before I lost it—I asked the prisoner if anybody had been in the room while I went to be shaved, and he said no one had been.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Green, who keeps the Mitre tavern—on the 3d January, Nicholson, the marine, came in between nine and ten o'clock—he asked for half-a-pint of porter—he appeared very tipsy—I did not want to serve him—he said, "I will relieve you of my presence if you will serve me"—I served him to get rid of him—he put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took it up, and told him it was bad—he said he could pay me for what he had, and he gave me a penny—he asked for the shilling back again, and I said, "Come another time, and I will give it you"—I put the shilling on the marble slab at the back of the counter, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 439). On Monday, 3rd January, in conse<lb/>quence of information, I went in search of the prisoners—I went to the Mitre, and as I went in I raw Nicholson coming out—I went in at one door and he came out at the other—I knew nothing about him at that time—when I came out I looked after the prisoners, and about 500 yards off I saw Harris—I told him I should take him in custody for uttering counterfeit coin—he said, "Oh"—while I was talking to him something dropped down in front of him—I picked it up, and it was this counterfeit shilling—I took him by the hand, and he had in his hand a piece of paper which had this counterfeit shilling wrapped in it—I received this shilling from Mrs. Gordon and this one from Mr. Payne.</p>

I went in at the door at the side of the house, and you went out at the front door—there is no back door—you went out at the very instant I went in—I had looked through the window, as I passed, and saw you—I went in directly—I recognised you from what I saw at the window and in the shop—I am sure you are the man that left the house—you had a soldier's dress—I don't know whether you were drunk or sober—I found on you 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pipe, some tobacco, and a cap—I asked you where you bought the cap, and you told me, and that you gave a sixpence in silver and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver for it—I did not go to the shop to inquire what money you gave—you had another old black cap in your pocket.</p>

I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint—this shil<lb/>ling taken from Harris, and the one found in front of him, are both bad—one is of the date of 1838, and the other 1858—these shillings received from Payne and Gordon are bad—one is of the date 1838, and the other is 1858—and they are from the same moulds as the other two.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185901310083"/>
               <p>—he could not identify me then, but in the morning he said he could know me—I know nothing of the other prisoner—I went to the Bank public-house and sat there, perhaps, for hours—there were two young women in the tap room—Harris introduced himself to me as a mechanic working in the Arsenal—he asked me about some young men in our barracks, and I said I knew them—he said to those young women that be would give them some best beer—I went to the door and stood outside—I said I could not go with him, I could not leave the company I was with—he went away, and I saw no more of him till the next morning—I have no doubt it was a marine who passed this bad money, and the case is very suspicious, but I am as innocent as a child—if this man gets his living in this way, I know nothing of it—the inhabitants of Woolwich cannot Bay that a marine ever offered a bad shilling—I had been a long time in the hospital, and only been four days out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harris's Defence.</hi>—This prisoner and I were seen in conversation, but does that sufficiently establish a connexion?—how often does it occur that two persons meet, one intending to commit a felony, and the other innocent—one may go with another into a public-house, and they may sit down together, but that is not sufficient to establish a connexion—when I was taken, I was putting two shillings in my pocket, and one fell down; now, if I had two shillings, and knew they were bad, why did not I drop both the shillings in the paper?—I must have known it if I had dropped it intentionally—on the morning after I was apprehended, Mr. Payne came to identify me—there was a doubt on his mind, and at the expiration of seven days he said that I was the man—now, if a man cannot recognise another immediately after an occurring circumstance, how can he conscien<lb/>tiously do it at the expiration of seven days?—why did he not do it the first morning I—his answer would be, if he told the truth, because the policeman had not had time to give him instructions—I dropped a shilling on the flags, and the policeman by the side of me. Now, gentlemen, how I became in possession of this money I will mention to you. On the day in question I sold my coat to a man in Beresford-street, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on the Thursday I pawned my waistcoat for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the policeman has got my ticket—there is a ticket of mine with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a black</hi>). I live at No. 25, Hatfield-street, Stamford-street, Blackfriars. I was in Hatfield-street about 7 in the evening, and received a blow with a life preserver on the side of my head—I saw no weapon, but feel satisfied that a fist could not have done it—I was perfectly sober—I was struck from behind, and fell immediately—I heard no foot-steps, but I had seen two men on the opposite side of the street—the pri<lb/>soner, on my oath, is one of them—they crossed over to the same side as I was, but behind me, and I was struck in a second—when I fell my coat was unbuttoned, and my gold chain torn from my neck, by one of the two persons I had seen cross the road—the prisoner then took my grocery, handed it to the man who had my chain, and ran off—the prisoner was attempting to run off too, but I jumped on my legs and seized him, and called "Police," and "Murder"—the police came, and I gave him in charge—he never got out of my possession—my head bled very much.</p>

On Sunday, 9th January last, I was keeping the Red Lion beer-shop, 42, Warwick-street, Borough-road—I made every-thing safe, and went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I came down about 7 next morning and found part of the counter ripped up, and on going into the bar parlour I missed a pair of trousers, a frock coat, and a pair of</p>

On Monday morning, 10th January last, about 6 o'clock, I was on duty in Little Surrey-street, in the Borough-road, and saw three men walking very closely together, coming in the direction from Warwick-street—the prisoner is one of them—one was carrying a carpet bag which I now produce—the other was carrying a large bundle—the prisoner was not carrying anything—thinking it was not altogether right I seized hold of one of them, and he dropped the carpet bag—the prisoner picked it up, and ran away with the party who was carrying the bundle down Little Surrey-street—I had a struggle with the one that I seized, and seeing the parties were escaping with the property I used my truncheon, and immediately followed them—finding I was getting close to them they threw the property down and made their escape—I picked up the bundle and the carpet bag, and brought them to the station—they contained a great number of things which were afterwards shown to the prosecutor, before the magistrate, and identified by him as his property—after taking the things to the station, I came back to Little Surrey-street, and watched a house where I suspected the prisoner lodged—I took him into custody about 1 o'clock the same day—I told him I charged him with breaking into the Bed Lion beer-shop, he said, "I know nothing about it, I was in bed"—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men, I knew him before.</p>

               <p>want to send them to our manufactory in the country"—on the following Saturday, 20th March, I took 63 yards at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was about one third of the order Roberts had given me—it came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the defendant, he was there, Mr. Roberts was not—I left them with the defendant—he said Mr. Roberts was not in the way, I had better call in any time that I might be passing, and he would get him to give me an order every time I looked in, because Mr. Roberts was in a position to want a great quantity of goods, and he said, could I supply them with cashmere and linings, and other things, I said, no, the elastic trade was the only thing that I had anything to do with—I then left—I did not execute any further portion of the order—I went on the Wednesday following, which must have been the 24th, and I saw something that excited some suspicion—I saw my six pieces of elastic placed on a high stool, and I saw no other goods there—the defendant had told me that the elastic was to be sent to the manufactory in the country—I then began to make inquiry—I never called at the place again till I had sent, a letter which I addressed to Mr. Roberts—this is a copy of it; "Mr. Roberts, I beg to inform you that the order you were pleased to give me will be completed in a few hours I shall be obliged if you will favour me with one or two London references." To this I received an answer, dated Prior Place, April the 3rd, and signed "C. Roberts:" "MR. Ferdinando,—Sir, I beg to refer you to Mr. Talk, No. 5, St. Dunstan's-hill, Lower Thames-street, and Mr. Stanton, No. 10, Hampton-street, Walworth"—in consequence of this I went six or seven times to No. 5, St. Dunstan's-hill, Lower Thames-street, but I was not able to see Mr. Tulk—I went to Hampton-street—I there saw a woman who called herself Mrs. Stanton—I have found since it was Mrs. Stanton—I had some communication with her—I went to Hampton-street, and not being satisfied, I wrote a letter to Mr. Stanton, to which I received this answer—I have seen the defendant write since, and he made an admission that he wrote this letter—the defendant came to me on the day after I received this letter, and I said to him. "I received a letter from Mr. Stanton, which is not to my mind satisfactory" (I did not know the defendant then by any name, I only knew him as foreman to Mr. Roberts)—I said, "Will you be good enough to tell me what his position is in trade"—he said he was a man of the highest position, he frequently would have goods in to the amounts of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and always paid ready money, he was quite an independent sort of man in trade—he said he had served Mr. Roberts for a period of four years with various kinds of leather—I made a remark that it was strange I had never seen him, and I asked what sort of a man he was in appearance—he said, "A man somewhat like yourself, small in stature, dark complexion"—I then said, "What is the position of Roberts in trade?"—he said Mr. Roberts was a man of considerable property, and he had a large factory at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire—in the course of that conversation I addressed the defendant by the name of Mr. Roberts—he said, "My name is not Roberts"—I said, "I know that very well, but as I don't know your name, I address you by the name of the firm; it is usual to do so; we always do so in the City"—he seemed a little annoyed by my calling him Roberts, and I said, "Pray, what is your name"—he said, "My name is Smith"—we had some further conversation, and he left my house at No. 3, Fort-street.</p>

Roberts, wholesale boot and shoe maker,"—I saw no stock—I was taken into a handsome counting-house, fitted up with dum<lb/>mies all round—I was there the first time, I should say, ten or twelve minutes and on that occasion, the 17th March, he gave me this order—on the 20th I took in a portion of the order to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the reference to Stanton was at No. 10, Hampton-street—I never saw Stanton there at all <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you had this interview with Roberts, and he complained to you, had you the day before been with Stanton at a public-house drinking for two or three hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were some five or six of us; we were there I should think about an hour and a quarter, having a friendly glass—I spoke to Roberts of Stanton as Smith, and Roberts spoke of Stanton as Smith—when I saw Roberts on the pier and the steam-boat I did not give him in custody—he went on the steam-boat, and I followed him, but that</p>
