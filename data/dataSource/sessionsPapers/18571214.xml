                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Northolt. The prisoner was my horse keeper for six or eight months—I discharged him about 13th Sept. twelve months—on Saturday, 7th Nov., I had a hay stack, a bean stack, an oat stack, and a small stack of tares, within 100 yards of my house, and about a quarter, to 10 o'clock that night the prisoner gave an alarm—I rushed out, and found him in front of my house, in the garden; he said, "Mr. Gurney, Mr. Gurney, your ricks are all on fire!"—he was rather excited, and out of breath, as if he had been running—I went to my rick yard, and discovered a small fire at the corner of a hay rick—four or five of my neighbours, and some working men, were there—the prisoner went down the yard just before me—he lived with his father, within a slight distance of my house—it is a plain road from my rick yard to his father's cottage, which adjoins the same road—the fire was extinguished after a short time—next morning I saw some footmarks of the previous night, which I traced from the rick yard, through some hurdles, into a meadow, and over a stile, to within ten feet of Buckland's cottage, both there and back—no one had a right to go across the fields in that direction—I had a stack on fire once before.</p>

I reside at Northolt, adjoining the pri<lb/>soner's house—I was at home, and heard the prisoner call out, "Moore, fire, fire!"—I came out, but could not discover any fire till I got to the rick yard—it was then just reaching the thatch—I helped to put it out—next morning, Sunday, about 11 o'clock, I traced footmarks from the rick yard, ten or twelve yards from the corner of the rick to three yards and a half from the prisoner's house; they were quite fresh and distinct—on Monday, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came to my gate, and asked me if I wanted to see his shoes—I said, "Yes"—he showed them to me, and I told him that they corresponded with the track—I did not take them from him, but I saw that there was one large nail in the centre of the heel of the left shoe—he said that he had been into Mr. Gurney's rick yard, and returned the same way—it is about 130 yards from his house to the rick yard, the back way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eaton Lodge, Hampstead Road. On 4th Nov., I went to bed about 10 o'clock—my servant examined the doors and windows—I got up about 5 o'clock next morning, and found the draw<lb/>ing room and parlour in confusion—the drawers were open, and several things scattered about—a back window was opened at the lower part of the house, and egg shells, table linen, napkins, and other articles were strewed about—the window had been opened by putting back the catch—I found a knife with which it could be forced back—I missed two coats, seven table cloths, a snuff box, telescope, and other articles.</p>

I was on duty n Rathbone Place, on 6th Nov.—about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock that morning I saw Harris and Payne together, in company with a female—they were about 100 yards from Mr. White's shop, and were standing talking—I went on my beat, and left them there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Payne's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). At the time the depositions were taken I was not in a state to defend or protect myself, in consequence of the shameful treatment of the policeman who took me into custody; on the evening of 5th Nov., I went to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, to meet some friends; I remained till the following morning; and on my way home, through Charles Street, Soho Square, I saw three or four persons run out of Rathbone Place and turn up Oxford Street; I crossed over Oxford Street, and a little way up Rathbone Place I turned up an archway for a necessary purpose; and on coming out I saw, standing on a door-step, a time piece; I took it up and looked at it; I thought somebody had set it down and forgotten it; I expected a reward would be offered for it; I put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185712140008"/>
               <p>it under my arm, and turned up Rathbone Place; the policeman came across, and asked what I had; I immediately told him, "A time piece;" and I handed it to him; he asked where I got it, and I told him what I now state; he then told me that there had been a clock shop broken into just by, and that I must go with him to the shop; I answered, "Certainly I will;" he then called the shopkeeper up, and told him that two windows had been broken; he asked him if he had lost anything; the shopkeeper answered he had lost some clocks, and he thought the one I had was his; the policeman then said I must accompany him to the police station; I refused doing so, not knowing anything of the robbery; I turned, and said I was going home; he stopped me, and we went back to the shop till he was ready to go, and then a scuffle took place between us because I refused to go; but upon another constable coming up I consented to go quietly; on our way to the station, as we were walking quietly, the constable 136 said, "What did you strike me in the mouth for?" I said I did not strike him, or if I did, it was by accident; he said, "Take that, you b—," striking me in the face right and left till I fell; he then kicked me in the side and the hip, and said, "Get up, you b—;" I said, "What are you doing this for, and what have I done? directly I got up he struck me with his fist and his staff; I fell again, screaming "Murder!" as well as I could, or I believe he would have killed me; when I arrived at the police station, I asked to see the doctor, who came and said my jaw was broken, and I must be taken to the hospital, and there the house surgeon examined me, and said both my jaws were broken, and all my teeth were knocked out, which are now fastened in with wires; both my eyes were seriously injured, and the doctor thought I should lose the sight of one, and I was not expected to live; I was confined to bed for two weeks, therefore I was unable to prepare my defence before the Magistrate; the doctor told me that my face would never be right, and that I never should be the man I had been; there were no blows struck before we got to Oxford Street; a policeman swears he saw me and another man, and a woman, standing in Rathbone Place, within a short distance of where the robbery was committed; how is it possible for anybody to swear to me in the state in which my face was when even my own friends did not know me; they took another man about my size and height, and kept him a fortnight, and discharged him; and if they were sure I was the man, why did they take him; in respect to my character, I have twelve months good character, as a butler, at No. 12, Great Cumberland Place, Hyde Park; my late master says, if I had been inclined to be a rogue, I could have done so while in his service; I had a deal of valuable property under my care; I am every morning in the habit of going to gentlemen's houses, where I could rob if I were so inclined; I know nothing of the man who is charged with me.</p>

In consequence of in<lb/>formation, I went, on the morning of 1st Dec., to Mr. Solly, in Fitche's Court, Noble Street, with Mr. Frederick Summers—while I was there the prisoner Solomon came, and brought with him this parcel—he went in the counting house, and undid the parcel—I saw the contents of it—it was these embossed labels—I asked him if they were his property; he said "Yes"—I asked him what he wanted for them; he said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver. On the evening of 22nd Jan., 1856, I was in Davies Street, Berkeley Square—the prisoner Attwell came up to me; he had nothing with him, but in consequence of what passed between us I saw this box standing on the kerb—he and another man lifted it, and I drove with it to Leonard Square, Shoreditch—Attwell took the box on his shoulder there, and I took it away—he went down Leonard Street, and crossed the road in an angular direction—I have since discovered where Jackson lives; it is right in that direction—where I lost sight of Attwell is about fifty yards from Jackson's house—when the advertisements were published I gave information to the police of what I knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on 16th June last; I was then residing at Reading, and was a widow. I lived at Reading about five weeks after the marriage, and then came to London, and lived at No. 1, Purton Street, Ledbury Road—my husband did not continue to reside with me—he was away from me five weeks, and the last time seven weeks—he was at home on 19th Nov.—he only came home the previous night—we were about to move into the country, and were packing up our things—on the 19th, after dinner, we were packing up the bed clothes, and as I was reach<lb/>ing the sheet I received a very severe blow on the right side of my head from behind—it quite stunned me; I did not know where I was for a time—there was no one else in the room but myself and my husband—he was standing behind me at the time I received the blow—when I recovered my<lb/>self, I found myself lying on a pillow before the fire—the pillow was in my mouth, and my mouth was full of blood—I cannot tell at all how long I had been insensible—I got to the top of the stairs, and called the landlady, Mrs. Fisher—she came to my assistance—a policeman was called in, and a medi<lb/>cal man attended me—I had had no quarrel with my husband that day—I never had any quarrel with him at all—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

The pri<lb/>soner was occasionally employed by me to do copying at my office—on 9th Dec I received from my father this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mr. Dalton—I had received two other cheques before, and I put the three into my table desk, in the prisoner's presence, and locked the drawer—I gave one of the cheques to a gentleman named Walthew, put the other into my pocket, and left the third in the drawer—the prisoner had the opportunity of seeing that it was left there—I left the office between 12 and 1 o'clock, leaving the prisoner there, and Charles Wheeler, my clerk—I was absent about half an hour—I returned, waited in the office not mere than ten minutes, and then went out, and was absent for about half an hour again; I then immediately went to the drawer, and the cheque was gone—when I returned the first time the prisoner was in the office, and Wheeler was out,; he came in, to the best of my recollection, before I left the second time, but I am not quite positive—the prisoner was not in the office when I came back the second time, and I did not see him that day, or the next—he had finished the work he had in hand, but he ordinarily attended every day—he had been paid for the work which he had done, except the last, but I had lent him much more than what was unpaid—he came to me on Friday morning, the 11th, at the Bankruptcy Court, in consequence of a letter which I wrote to him to come there to work, and after his work was finished I gave him in charge; I could not get an officer before—when I went out that day, he had whiskers half down his face, and a good deal of hair under his chin, but on the Friday morning it had all disappeared, and he was as he is now.</p>

               <p>are bringing a false charge, Mr. Spicer; I am too innocent to do anything of the kind"—I said, "I hoped you were, but the Bank clerk identifies you distinctly"—he then requested to speak to me—he appeared rather astonished, not particularly agitated—he said at the station house that the charge was untrue—his appearance was different on the Friday morning; his hair had been shaved off, and the hair under the chin also—I did not say anything to him about it, nor to the bank clerk, nor did he to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Spicer—on 9th Dec. I was in the office—I remember Mr. Spicer going out about the middle of the day—at that time the prisoner was in the office with me—while Mr. Spicer was out the prisoner's wife came to the office; that was about 10 minutes to 1 o'clock, before Mr. Spicer returned the first time—the prisoner told me to go to my lunch, and I left him and Mrs. Scott in the office together, and nobody else; when I came back Mr. Spicer was there, and the prisoner, Mrs. Scott was gone—Mr. Spicer afterwards went out—after that the prisoner seemed as if he was looking for some paper—he opened the drawer—I was standing by the fire place, and I saw the cheque in the corner, rolled up; he then shut the drawer—I had seen Mr. Spicer put the cheque into the drawer, and I had seen him pay one to Mr. Walker, and put another into his pocket—I saw the third cheque safe in the drawer when the prisoner opened it—he did not take anything out then—he then said he was going to his lunch, and while he was gone, Mr. Spicer returned, and went to the drawer—it was directly after Mr. Spicer had gone out that he opened the drawer; before Mr. Spicer came back the first time, and directly after Mr. Spicer had left the second time, the prisoner said he was going to his lunch, and went away—while he was away Mr. Spicer returned—the prisoner came back that evening while Mr. Spicer was out, and he wrote this note, and told me to give it to Mr. Spicer, and ask him to leave an answer—I told the prisoner that Mr. Spicer had lost a cheque, and that he had gone down to the bank to stop payment—he told me to ask Mr. Spicer to be sure and leave an answer to the note, as it was very important, and he would return in half an hour, as Mrs. Scott was waiting for him—I gave the note to Mr. Spicer—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the Bankruptey Court—(<hi rend="italic">Note read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—I enclose you two bills for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which, if you will cash for me, I shall feel obliged. I hope what the boy tells me about your losing a cheque will prove incorrect, and that you have mislaid it. Yours truly, Robert Scott.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> You say you saw this particular cheque rolled up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was crumpled up, as cheques generally are—it was in the corner of the drawer—there were other papers there—the prisoner usually told me to go to lunch—it was twenty minutes past 1 o'clock when I came back—Mr. Spicer said that he was going into the City, and would get his lunch; and directly he had gone, the prisoner went out also—Mr. Spicer came back before going to the City, and went to the drawer—it was about half past 1 o'clock that the prisoner left for his lunch—I am quite sure that he had whiskers—I had noticed them before, when he has been sitting in the office—my attention was not directed to them in any way—he had hair under his chin—it was not very bushy—it was a kind of brown colour—I have always seen him wear those whiskers since I have been there—I went</p>

               <p>on the 1st of Dec.—he had no whiskers at the Bankruptey Court on Friday—I noticed that directly I saw him—I mentioned it to the banker's clerk when I fetched him—I went to fetch him from Currie and Co.'s, Cornhill, and walked with him from there to the Bankruptey Court—I told him that the prisoner had no whiskers, and no hair on his face—what I said was, that Mr. Scott had shaved all the hair off his face—I did not tell him that Mr. Scott was the man who had taken the cheque—I suppose he knew he was going to identify the prisoner—I did not tell him so—I did not tell him that we had got the man who stole the cheque—Mr. Spicer had been to the bank before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at Currie's, the bankers. On 9th Dec. this cheque was presented to me—I cashed it with five sovereigns—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner who presented it—it was only five minutes after I had paid it that Mr. Spicer came and inquired if I could identify the party, and I described him as having whiskers—the person who presented the draft certainly had hair on his face, but whether they were whiskers adjoining his hair, or merely hair on the chin, I cannot say, because he had his hat on—to the best of my belief the prisoner was that person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> You had never seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I cash a great many cheques during the day—I do not under<lb/>take to speak positively to the prisoner, since he has been shaved—I could speak with more certainty to a man with hair on his face—I noticed hair on the chin, and whiskers, as I thought—I described him to Mr. Spicer as having hair on his face—I did not observe whiskers on the side of the face—it was not a beard—the hair was on the chin, or on a portion of the cheek, possibly—I did not notice under his chin, he did not hold his head up—I cannot tell what colour it was—I believe it was rather a darkish dye—Wheeler came to me from the Bankruptcy Court—he told me that Scott was at the Bankruptcy Court, and I was to come there to identify him, but he had been shaved—I went there—he was not shown to me—I saw Mr. Spicer walk up to him, and directly I looked at him I thought by his features he was the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 55). I took the prisoner into custody on 30th Nov.—I told him I must apprehend him for obtaining goods under false pretences from Mr. Legg and Mr. Davis—he said, "I will pay them as soon as I get my pension, that will be on Wednesday"—I said, "What have you got to say to forging Captain Williams's name?"—he said, "I am very sorry that I ever saw him."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Lieutenant Williams wished to raise 100 recruits at his own expense, with a view to obtain his commission, and engaged me; it is customary to take the recruits to a coffee house; sometimes he would write the order, and when unable to get the money, he has authorised me, both verbally and in writing, to get a bed and supper; he knew I was without money, and during the week I took the usual order for bed and supper; on the Saturday he would come to no terms, and I had no alter<lb/>native but to request my creditors to wait till the following Wednesday, but in the interim he gave me in charge; I went to India in 1842, as orderly-room sergeant, and have served in the Gwalior campaign, in the Sutlej, and the Punjaub, and received one star and two medals, with clasps; what I did I did in ignorance, and without the most remote idea of doing wrong.</p>

Morley's—he said he thought they might know him, and I accompanied him there—I asked him if he brought the order from Mrs. Darke; he said, "Yes"—they did not recognize him at Morley's, and I returned with him to our warehouse, gave him a portion of the goods ordered, and sent a porter with him with orders to give him into custody if the order was not genuine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mrs. Dawson. I was in the shop on 26th Nov.; I saw the prisoner give Miss Dawson three sixpences—on 3rd Dec. I saw her give her two sixpences—she put them between her teeth, and said, "These are bad, and you gave me two bad ones this day week"—I sent for the beadle, and I saw a piece of paper drop from the prisoner—a lad and I picked it up; it contained a bad sixpence—I went with the prisoner, and as she was going into the dock I heard something rattle; I stooped, and found a bad sixpence—I gave them to the constable.</p>

I never knew Smith till 5th Nov., when he came to our house, No. 9, Manning Place—he asked me whether I would go to Mr. Defries's stable and get a note for him out of a tin in the room adjoining Albert Comber's room, in the room next to the coal cellar—I said, "Yes;" and I went and got the note, and gave it him at my place—he read it—I only saw him once afterwards—he said to my husband, that if my husband <hi rend="italic">opened</hi>, he would deny everything that he had said—he said, on the 5th Nov., that he saw the plate between between the bed and the mattress at <hi rend="italic">Blackey's</hi> lodging.</p>

I was called to the Bank; and saw the prisoner there—in consequence of a communication that was made to me, I asked the prisoner where he got the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from—he said a man had given it to him in the street—I said, "Where in the street?"—he said, "In Ludgate Hill"—I asked him what he was to have for getting it cashed—he said, "A pound"—I asked him where he was to meet the man again—he said, "In St. Paul's Churchyard"—I asked him to write his own name and address on a piece of paper, which he did, "William Wilcox, 76, Hatton Garden, clerk," that was correct—I was not in uniform, but I had told him that I was an officer—I took him to the station—I there asked him if he had any more notes about him—he said, no, he had no more notes, but he had some loose cash—I told him that he must put it out on the desk—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a handful of gold, and laid it on the desk—I asked where he got it from—he said, the same person that had given him the note to get cashed had given him the gold—I asked what he was going to do with the gold—he hesi<lb/>tated, and made no reply—I counted it, and found twenty sovereigns—I then asked him if he had been to Messrs. Coutts that day—he said, "I have, I may as well tell you the whole truth about it; the man that gave me the note to get cashed, gave me a cheque for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I took to Messrs. Coutts, and got cashed for a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 50 sovereigns"—I asked what had become of the remaining part of the gold—he said that he had put his hand into his pocket, and given it to the person that gave him the cheque—I said, "How much did you give him?" he said, "I don't know; I put my hand into my pocket, and gave it to him indiscriminately."</p>

In Oct. last I lived at No. 11, Adam Street East, Marylebone at the house of Mr. Gilmore—the prisoner and I both lived in one room there—on 29th Oct. I had to go into the infirmary, and was there three weeks—I came out on 19th Nov.—I went back to my lodging—I asked the prisoner if there had been any letters there—she gave me one which was opened, and said it had come that morning—I asked if there had been any money in it—she said, "No"—I expected some—I wrote home to my friends, and received an answer on the 24th—I afterward, on the same day, asked the prisoner for the remainder of the tickets of my clothes—she gave them to me—I then asked her for the letter and the money order that was in it—I told her that I had had a letter stating that it had been sent and received—she bounced up and went into a passion, and brought forward four bills, and said that I owed her that money—I do not know what they amounted to—she afterwards gave them to the policeman—her father was in the room at that time—he is rather deaf—he asked what was the matter, and I repeated it to him, and while I was repeating it she jumped up, took a knife out of the table drawer and said she would stab me and be the death of me, if she was hanged for it, and with that I went out of the room as quickly as I could—she stated before that that she had received the money order and kept it for the debt, and then she brought up these bills—I did not owe her any money—I made inquiries at the post office in Old Cavendish Street—the signature to this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I never authorised the prisoner or anybody to sign my name and receive the money—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner on Friday, the 20th, the day after I came out of the infirmary; I told her I was so badly off I did not know what I should do, I had not a penny to get anything, and she gave me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said, "Don't show it to my father."</p>

               <p>him, "You are employed at the East India House?"—he said, "Yes; these d—things were kicking about; who told you I was employed at the East India House?"—I said I found it by inquiry—he said the position he was placed in would he the means of reducing him from a state of affluence to that of poverty, and be a lasting stain on his character—after his examination at the Mansion House, we proceeded to his residence, searched his place, and found five brooms, a mop, and two brushes, and on the brooms I find the brand has been cut off—here is part of the brand on this one, which can be seen with a magnifying glass—I also took a spade, and found these fifty-one books in the dust hole in the garden.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> Is the opium you have in that department perfectly safe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Dr. Royle received some opium in 1855, and handed it over to my charge—if I am away, it would remain in the India House till I return—there is a person in the apartment where I am; he is not generally there—if Dr. Royle and I were away, he would receive it—there is an entry made, and I do not find any addition to what I had received on other occasions—no use is made of this opium but for experiments—I do not know what quantity is sent over in each year—I do not know that waste paper and other things are taken by the messengers—the chief clerk was changed two or three years ago—when they are changed, the room is cleared out—I cannot tell what becomes of the clearings.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">referred to Rex v.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CROWDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the evidence was hardly of a nature to be presented to the Jury; the case of Rex v.

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, painter, and glazier, of No. 4, Maddox Place, Greenwich Road. On 5th Dec. I left my shop, and went into the parlour at a little before 10 o'clock, and had just taken my seat when I saw the prisoner enter the shop, and take some brushes and a glazier's diamond off the counter—in rising from the table I stumbled against a chair, which prevented my getting on as fast as I ought, and by the time I had got to the street door he had gone—he pulled the door to after him, and got twenty yards from my house—I had a loose coat on, the pocket of which was torn behind, and my pocket book, containing a number of papers and letters, flew out, and a person who was coming along the road, facing the prisoner, picked it up while I went in pursuit of him—I lost sight of him in turning round to look for my pocket book, but saw him four or five minutes afterwards, within twenty yards of where I had been standing looking for him—he had made his way to Deptford Bridge, and Matthews, who had picked up my pocket book, showed him to me—we secured him, and I said, "Where are my brushes?"—he said, "I know nothing about them"—I took him into custody—about half an hour after I had been at the Police Court a young girl came to my shop and offered the brushes for sale.</p>
