               <p>Q. When had you seen that piece of printed cotton? - A. I have no doubt, in my own mind, that I had seen it during the morning, but not to make any observation of it; I said, a constable must be sent for, and she said, what for; it was not in her possession, but she was at least ten yards from the place where the cottons were kept; I sent for the constable and took her and the man to Bow-street; the man was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that cotton? - A.Fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in your shop at the time? - A. My young man was first serving her, he went away and then I took his place; he is not here.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabout in Fleet-street was Mr. Mason's? - A. About the middle of Fleet-street, he is a seedsman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any servant with the chaise?- A. No, I had no servants; Mr. Mason request<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160005"/>ed me to go up into the dining-room to take some bread and cheese and ale, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a window in the dining-room? - A. Yes.</p>

            , went down Fleet-street, and overtook the man with the chaise and horses.</p>
               <p>Q. You have charged two sets of harness? - A.Yes, because I run double; there were two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. When the chaise and horses were brought back, were they in the same state in which they were, when you lost them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare, as near as you can state? - A. As well as I can recollect, I put it at 40l. and the gelding at 20l.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he was brought back? - A. He said, that some person saw him at the door, and told him, if he would take that chaise and horses to Blackfriars-bridge, he would give him one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you were the owner of this chaise and horses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you left your chaise and horses standing? - A.At Mr. Mason's in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you afterwards find them? - A. They were brought back to me at Mr. Mason's.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you found it exactly where you left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble of going to the window to see if there was any crowd? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether there was a stoppage in the street at the time or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN BANKS sworn. - I am apprentice to Mr. Mason, a seedsman, in Fleet-street, on the right-hand side from here; I saw the prisoner get into the chaise, take the reins in his hands and drive off; I then asked the shopman, whether he was a servant of Mr. Taylor's, he said, he did not know; I then ran after him, went to the shafts of the chaise, and asked him where he was going with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the door, when you first saw him? - A. Six or seven doors to the best of my recollection; he told me, a gentleman came to him, and told him he would give him a shilling to drive it to Blackfriar's-bridge; I then told him to stop, and asked him who the gentleman was; he said, he did not know who the gentleman was, he supposed he was at the door where he took the chaise from; he would not stop, and I ran to the horses head and stopped them, he them jumped out of the chaise, and endeavoured to make his escape, I caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running? - A.Running; he then began to hustle and push me about, and endeavoured to get away from me; my fellowservant, the shopman, then came to my assistance, and by that means he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This transaction happened in the morning? - A.Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you he had been desired by a gentleman to drive this chaise to blackfriar's-bridge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know it is a difficult thing to drive through Fleet-street in the middle of the day, and therefore not at all unnatural for a gentleman to ask him to drive so far for him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you stopped the horse, he desisted, and gave the chaise into your possession? - A. He got out of the chaise and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not run away till after you had laid hold of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he was frightened, and attempted to get from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any gentleman near your door, at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRUCE sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Mason, seedsman, in Fleet-street; I saw a man in the chaise drive away from the shop door towards Fleet-market; the boy ran out after the man, and stopped the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you see any gentleman near him, or hear any gentleman give any orders? - A. No person whatever; I saw the boy stop the chaise, and I went up to his assistance; I saw a man scufiling with him, and trying to get away; I then laid hold of the prisoner's collar, and brought him back to my master's house; some other people brought the chaise back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The shopdoor was open? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A man must have been mad to think of stealing a chaise in that situation, and you looking at him? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know that Fleet-street is a noisy place at noon-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, a person might have said, take this chaise to Blackstiar's-bridge, and you not have heard it? - A. No; I work close to the door.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER AULD sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Berkeley-square, and coming down Fleet-street, there was a a great crowd; a gentleman's phaeton stood by the side of the pavement; there was a stoppage, and the phaeton got across the road, and a gentleman's coachman that was coming could not get along, and he desired me to turn the horses round, and I did; I had no intention of stealing them.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mr. Taylor.) Did you leave your horses close to the kirb, or were they across the road? - A. No such thing as across the road, I left them close to the kirb where they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bruce.) You saw the prisoner get into the chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chaise then standing near the kirb, or across the road? - A. As close to the kirb as it could. <rs id="t18010916-4-verdict18" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Were they the property of your late husband? - A. No; they were intrusted to him to clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they are not property that you could possibly identify? - A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT NEWMAN sworn. - I am a constable; Mr. Harris sent for me to take charge of the prisoner; Mr. Harris was alive at that time; the prisoner then had the breeches on; Mr. Harris said, in the presence of the prisoner, I will swear these are my breeches that he has now got on; I had them to clean; he said, Mr. Harris had given them to him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Harris.) Q.Had you ever seen these breeches yourself, in the cellar? - A. I had, nearly three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant in the house? - A. He was a weekly servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were there any wages due to the prisoner at the time? - A. I don't exactly know; when he absconded from our service, I believe there was half-a-crown due to him,</p>
               <p>Q. The breeches are worth, what? - A. I don't know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Harris had been in the habit of lending the prisoner a waistcoat or breeches? - A. I had once lent him a waistcoat and breeches of Mr. Harris's own wear, but never any thing of a customer's, and when I told Mr. Harris of it, he blamed me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, there is no mark upon them by which any person here can identify them to be Mr. Harris's breeches? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been often disappointed of my wages of a Saturday night; I asked Mr. Harris the favour of this pair of breeches, to lend me them till I could get my own out of pledge, and he said, never mind it if it is for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-5-verdict22" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Levitt.) What did you do with the note that you took from the drawer? - A. I paid it into the hands of Mr. Lamb.</p>
               <p>Lamb. I received a note from Susan Levitt, but I do not know that this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other notes in the same place, at the same time? - A. I cannot say whether there were or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fisher. I know this note to be the same that I received from Levitt, and that I paid him for his wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 12th of August, I was behind my master counter, and saw this note lying upon the ground, not knowing it was my master's, I put it in my pocket, intending, if there was any mention made to give it back; I was sent out, and when I came back again, I forgot it; my master, in the evening, went to my mother's, and then searched me, and I being frightened, said, I had no pockets to my breeches, and then my master felt and found this note in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-7-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. How was he occupied? - A.We had been occupied in ringing on account of the new Rector, and we employed Otherly to assist us as an extra hand, as we had but very short notice; we went to the Ship public-house about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing there? - A.Drinking, and making merry.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Otherly when he went away? - A. Very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be true, as he has sworn, that he was not drunk at that time? - A. He must falseswear himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been altogether quite good humoured, or was there any altercation? - A. No; in the course of the evening, a little before twelve o'clock, a young man, a bricklayer, of the name of Caney, came in promiscuously, and knowing me, and others of the party, and knowing Otherly, he asked leave to spend an hour with us; a dispute arose between Otherly and him, which could chalk farthest on the floor for a wager, Caney beat Otherly, and he refused paying for it; a great many words arose, and Caney said, rather than have any words he would pay for it himself; and Otherly used very aggravating expressions, and Caney gave him a very severe blow; then Otherly threatened to take the law of him, he would not go to a common Justice, but take out a Judge's warrant; he then aggravated him to that degree that flesh and blood could not bear with it; I, and the rest of the company, told him Caney had served him just right, for aggravating the man as he had done.</p>

I do not know the prisoners; I saw Otherly on the morning of the 9th of June, about nine o'clock; I asked him how he got home, and he said he got home very well, but by some means, being so very much intoxicated, he had fell in the fields, and very much bedaubed himself; he did not say a single syllable about being robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know to whom this butter belonged?- A. It belonged to Mr. Francis Inman.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. By the mark; the Lord Mayor ordered it to be delivered, it being a perishable commodity; the constable has the cask.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH BENNETT sworn. - I am a constable: I took charge of the prisoner; the cask was knocked to pieces by being thrown down; the prisoner told me a man had given him sixpence to carry the cask of butter up the quay.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Inman.) Brewer's quay was where your butter was? - A. Yes, it was landed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man ordered me to take the firkin of butter to the top of the gateway, while he called a coach; I took it to the top of the gateway, and never saw the man afterwards, and this man laid hold of me; I know the wharfinger's clerk, and saw him pass me, and therefore it was not likely that I should stand at the top of the gateway after I had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Englebart.) Did you see any gentleman near the prisoner? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>MARY WYCOMBE sworn. - I was coming up Whitecross-street about five o'clock in the afternoon; there were two lads standing near Mr. Henley's shop-door, and just before I got to the shopdoor, one of them took a piece of check from the door; I went in, and gave an alarm; one of them ran into a court that went into Bunhill-row; I cannot say which of them had the tick.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. That is the lad that Mr. Henley brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that that is one of the two lads that were standing at the door? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q.Had you ever seen either of these lads before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All this was done in a very short time? - A. Yes, it was all done in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you could not swear he was one of the boys? - A. No; I have said I could not swear he was the person that took the check; I said, I was sure he was one of the two lads that were standing about the door.</p>
               <p>Henley. I know this tick to be my property; I had bought it that morning. GUILTY, aged 19, Of <rs id="t18010916-14-verdict69" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. What time did you discover you had been robbed? - A.Before eight o'clock I missed the pocket-book and the money; it was all in the pocket-book; I had left the key in the bureau, but not locked; I suspected the prisoner, because he was the only person in the house; he could not go down stairs to go out, without going through my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him that morning? - A. Yes, I had seen him that morning, and drank with him, I was in bed; I asked him what he got up so soon for; he said he did not know, he could not sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stop any time with you? - A. No, only drank with me in bed.</p>
               <p>Q.What, at six in the morning? - A. Yes; he went down, and got up about eight in the morning; he fetched the liquor for me; he drank with me, and the man that gave me the money drank with me too.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had that money been given you? The night before the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it given you as a present, or to take care of? - A. It was a man just come from sea, that always gives me every thing, just as if he was my husband; the prisoner never came back to my lodging; he had lodged five weeks in my house, and never paid me any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you notice that he was going to quit your lodgings? A. No; I saw him again last Thursday, at Wapping, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have any money when he was at your house? - A. No, not a shilling.</p>

               <p>(John Griffiths, an officer, produced the bag of soap.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Taylor.) Can you swear to that property? - A. I should not have sworn to the property if he had not confessed it at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour?- A. None at all; he said he had taken it from our manufactory, but it was given him by a man that worked with him,

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How came your name to be Ann? - A. That is my christian name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not known by the name of Black Esther? - A. Yes, but that is not my name.</p>
               <p>Q.Where do you ply from ten o'clock at night, till two in the morning? - A. In the Hay-market, and St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have these honest gentlemen believe, that a gentleman gave you a two pound note? - A. Yes, that was no object.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go for the gin? - A. To the corner of Prince's-court, Hedge-lane, the man's name is Dolan.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; they are all a combined set together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any watchman that you had been robbed? - A. No; the watchmen were a party concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. I see a gentleman's name upon the back of the bill, that I dare say will explain all this -How came you acquainted with Mr. William Kelly, has he not been acting as your solicitor, in concucting your prosecution? - A. Nobody has conducted my prosecution; I don't know that I ever saw Mr. Kelly till I took out the warrant at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that there is a reward of forty pounds if this man is convicted? - A. Yes; but I don't come here for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at Brentford when your friend Kelly stood in the pillory? - A. I am no person of that description.</p>
               <p>Q. So you take two lovers at a time to these places? - A. It was only to have a bit of fun.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you gave any alarm at all? - A. This man keeps a house for all sorts of prostitution; a nasty, unfeeling, disagreeable rascal like that, what chance could I have with him; if I had said any thing, they would have killed me upon the spot; I thought it would be the best way to stop till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the man fetch two watchmen for the purpose of removing you and these two fellows from his house? - A. He had no business to remove us, we paid him for the use of his place, and were very quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not give charge to the watchmen to remove you and the two men? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.This two pound note was not given you by the two men you brought into the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160017"/>Q.How came you to say so before the Magistrate? - A. I said it was given me by a gentleman, in Pall-mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that one of the two men gare you half-a-guinea, and not content with that, you asked him for more, and then he gave you a two pound note? - A. No, I never said no such thing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KELLY sworn. - On the 2d of this month, I was at a public-house, in Marlborough-street; I saw the prisoner at the bar there, in the custody of a constable; he told me he had sent home for forty shillings, and fourteen shillings in silver, to satisfy the black, infamous whore, who had charged him with the robbery; I told him, if he had not been conscious he had done wrong, he was to blame to send for the money to satisfy her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know a little of Courts of Justice, I believe, Mr. Kelly - in the first place, I would ask you, if you know this woman? - A. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is, I believe, one of the most infamous prostitutes to be found in the night about the Hay-market? - A. I never spoke to her in my life, before I saw her at Marlborough-street; I have heard she is a very infamous woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, have lived by informing? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did live by informing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stand in the pillory by informing? - A. I did not come here to answer that.</p>
               <p>Court. He is certainly not compellible to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't chuse to answer that question? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I am just as well content as if you did -Upon your oath, how many informations have you lodged in your life - I don't ask you within one hundred? - A. Never one hundred.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor caused to be lodged? - A. No, nor yet fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how you get your livelihood? - A. As well as I can; I assist an attorney, and do a little conveyancing.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be curious enough to know the attorney, who would wish Mr. Kelly's assistance?- A. Is it necessary that I should answer that question?</p>
               <p>Court. I think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who is that attorney? - A. Mr. Howard, No. 16, Charles-street, Fitzroy-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he pay you weekly? - A. No; if I serve a notice, he pays me, or if I serve a writ, he pays me.</p>
               <p>Q.How often may he employ you? - A. Perhaps once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the only way you have of getting a living - what other honest way of getting a living? - (The witness gave no answer.)</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Howard, I believe, is a gentleman, who now and then puts an advertisement in the papers, he is a very generous man, and advertises to lend money? - A. You may know it, but I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.What other way have you of getting a living? - A. I do business for other gentlemen as well as Mr. Howard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are they? - A. Mr. Wilkinson, who lives near there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you work for him? - A. Three or four times a week.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the only way you have of getting a living? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds, if this man is convicted? - A. Not to me; on the contrary, if I thought I was entitled to sorry shillings, I would really give it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a reward of forty pounds?- A. No; I hope the man's life is not at stake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you really hope so upon your oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he is charged with? - A. Robbing this woman of forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you did not know was a capital offence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been conducting this prosecution for this woman? - A. No; on the contrary, I am exceedingly sorry I have had to attend here.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner; I searched him at the watch-house, at Covent Garden; I found a great number of duplicates, among which, was one of a watch; I took it to Mr. Rochfort's, and the young man produced that watch; when I found the duplicate, the prisoner said it was his master's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing, before that, to induce him to confess? - A. No, I did not. (The watch was deposed to by Mr. Hinde).</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written paper, stating his contrition for the offence he had committed, that he was upon board wages, which he had not received for eight or nine weeks, having applied to his master for it in vain, till being almost in a state of starvation, he was tempted to pledge them till he could get the payment of his wages.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hinde. I constantly paid him his wages before-hand, upon his application, before they were due; I had lost a great number of things at different times; he has been dabling in the lottery.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the colour of your pocket-book?- A. Red.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was it? - A.One of Johnson's pocket-books.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this pocket-book contain any thing? - A. Yes; there were some memorandums, and there were eleven one-pound Bank of England notes, and a five-pound Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of those notes since?- A. No, not a bit of them, nor ever shall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him immediately when you saw the book in his hand? - A.Immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw the person that took the pocket-book put it in his pocket, did not you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a pretty large croud collected? - A. There were thirty or forty, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, four or five deep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the number of the notes?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And your pocket-book was a common pocket-book? - A. Yes; there is a thing which I forgot to tell the Judge - my pocket-book was tied round with a black cotton string, and I saw that.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, I understand you to say this, that your pocket-book was a common pocket-book, tied round with a black cotton string? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it ever happen to you in Kent to see a pocket-book tied round with a black cotton string?- A. Never, nor yet in London.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing upon the outside of the pocket-book? - A. There was my name upon the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you saw when it was in the man's hand? - A. I do not think that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you or not observe your name upon it at the time it was in the man's hand? - A. I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The only opportunity you had of seeing the pocket-book in the man's hand, was a very short time? - A. Yes, about fifteen seconds, or not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to say, upon the casual view you had, surrounded by the number of people that you were, though you did not see the name upon it, that that was the same pocket-book?- A. I will, according to the best of my opinion, swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it? - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is your belief about it? - A. My positive belief is, that it was my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROGERS sworn. - I am a plaisterer; I know nothing of the robbery; I saw Mr. Hadrill put eleven Bank-notes of one pound each into his pocket-book, and a five-pound note before he left my house in Gutter-lane, on the 20th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of his pocket-book? - A. A red one, tied with a black string; he did not leave my house till after dinner; he was going to the west-end of the town.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make observation enough of it to know whether it was your pig or not? - A. Yes; I am sure it was my pig; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p> - HARDY sworn. - I keep a potato-shop: The prisoner brought a pig into the market for sale, I bought it of him; Mr. Alcock came to me about twelve o'clock; the prisoner asked twelve shillings for it, I gave him eleven shillings; then Mr. Alcock came and claimed it; the next morning the prisoner was found, and I went before Alderman Perchard, and identified the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Alcock). When did you see the pig after you had lost it? - A. The Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. The pig might have been taken astray for any thing you know? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Billingsgate with some oysters, and in Fenchurch-street this pig was running along, and several people running to catch it; several people owned it; I said, nobody should have the pig, I would take care of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-24-verdict118" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you see the situation in which you have placed yourself; you, a professional man, have been actually compounding felony; you could not appear in a situation less respectable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pullen. A.Being very little conversant with this sort of business, I acted more agreeable to my feelings than any thing else; that is the only extenuation I can offer for my conduct.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe I can put an end to all this, which, in such a case, nobody will be very sorry for; I will shew that the first was not a legal marriage, he being a minor.</p>

               <p> - COLLINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a brewer, at Richmond: I have known the prisoner these twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him in 1795, at which time he is said to have married? - A. He was at that time but just come from abroad; I knew him in 1789, 1790, 1791, and 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what age he is now? - A. I cannot say, I think twenty-eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know at all what age he is of now?- A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not a young man of exceeding good character? - A. Yes; but he has been very easily persuaded to a great many things that he ought not have been. <rs id="t18010916-26-verdict129" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Is this a light,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160023"/>or a dark celiar? - A. It is rather dark; it is near twenty yards long, and only one window.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him take any tea? - A. No; I only heard the rattling of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about nine o'clock in the morning?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you stopped him at night? - A. A little before eight o'clock, the usual time of his going away home.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to tea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any tea? - A. We cannot miss a small quantity, we deal so largely.</p>
               <p>Q. It was such tea as is to he had in any shop in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long has he lived with you? - A.Nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good character with him? - A. A middling one.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Deakin and Allanton: I was set to watch the prisoner; I saw him go to the tea-chest, where these two bags were, he turned it round to get at the bags, and then shut the window; I followed him up very shortly after; I could not see any thing he did, it was so dark; I gave information to Mr. Allanson that he had been at the tea-chest, and when he was going home they called him back, and asked him if he had not got some tea; he said he had not any; they insisted upon seeing what he had got, and then he said he had, and begged they would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner went down as usual to shut the window, before he went home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to do which, he must go near this tea-chest? - A. Not very near; I saw him at the tea-chest, and saw him turn it round.(The tea produced).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. On Thursday, the 27th of August, I was employed in a field belonging to the Duke of Clarence, where there were some Mazzaghan beans tied in sheaves with a pitched string; I left the field about six o'clock, they were then all right; I went again the next morning at six o'clock, and missed four shocks, containing sixteen sheaves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say they were all safe the night before - did you untie them to see if they were all safe? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not unusual to tie up sheaves with a string of that sort? - A. It is in that parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps in the parish of Kingston, Sunbury, and round about there, you may have seen such a thing? - A. No; I have not.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GODEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a bailiff to his Royal Highness, William Henry, Duke of Clarence, he is Ranger of Bushy-park: On Friday the 28th of August, I got a warrant, and went with the constable, Mr. Scurr, about half-past four in the afternoon to the premises of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the bean-field? - A.About half a mile upon Hampton-Common; we searched all over the gardens and house, but could not find them; at last I saw some furze, and a great-coat over it; I pulled away part of the furze, and there were the beans; there was a hog-stye just by, the hogs were eating part of them; I found twelve sheaves and a half, and one loose; the prisoner was taken at Sunbury; I know them to be the same beans that were in his Highness's field, I know them by the soil; I asked the prisoner whose great-coat that was that I had found upon the furze, and he said it was his, he had bought it at Twickenham; two sheaves of the beans are here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to swear to beans by the soil? - A. By the herbage; this was a bit of land that had not been ploughed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160024"/>for three hundred years before; about four years ago, timber was growing upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You saw old grass at the roots of the beans? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 21st of July I had charge of the prisoner; I searched her, and found upon her the key of this woman's room; after that I went to a lodging of her's in White-hart-yard, and there she gave me these duplicates from the mantle-piece, (produces them), which apply to the property that has been produced.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PRITCHETT sworn. - (Produces a handkerchief and a shirt). I do not recollect the person that pledged them; they were pledged by a woman; the handkerchief in the name of Jane Moxam, and the shirt in the name of Jane Johnson.(The property was identified by Mrs. Johnson).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mrs. Johnson employed me to make away with these things to pay her rent.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Johnson. I had told her in the course of the day that I should be obliged to make away with some things to pay a quarter's rent, but I did not tell her to do it, nor did not know that she had taken them. <rs id="t18010916-30-verdict149" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was servant to Mr. Kuby, in February, 1792.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man who was then in custody upon a charge of robbing Mr. Baker? - A. Yes; I was not present at his trial.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you in Court when he received the order of transportation? - A. Yes, I was; he left Newgate on the 13th of June, 1792, but I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at Woolwich? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were neither present at the time of the trial, nor of the respite, nor of the delivery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. In February, 1792, I was a watchman in Castle Baynard Ward; I apprehended the prisoner at that time; I know him perfectly well; I was present when he was tried for robbing Mr. Baker's house, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after May, 1792? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe the witnesses upon that occasion were ordered out of Court, and examined separately? - A. I believe they were.</p>

             CAPPER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the clerks in the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any further extension of his Majesty's mercy towards this man, beyond saving his life, on condition of transportation for life? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were not in the office at the time this man is said to have received his respite? - A. I was in the office, but not in that department.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe as to any thing that takes place with respect to prisoners after they are tried here and convicted, it is always entered in books kept for that purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore all the information you derive respecting this man, has been from those books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I told Governor Hunter that I had received his Majesty's pardon on condition of being transported for life; but Mr. Bleckstock, of the House of Lords, sent me a letter, informing me, he had got me a mitigation; Governor Hunter looked into the books there, and saw I was entered for seven years only, and thinking my time was out, I asked Governor Hunter to permit me to come over with him, and he brought me over.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- HUNTER, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you came into the office of Governor, I believe you know mistakes have often happened in the terms for which persons have been ordered to be transported, for seven or fourteen years, or for life? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You were Governor of New South Wales?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have but just returned? - A. I returned in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being sent over from this country as a transport? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how long he had been there? - A. He lived a considerable time in the house with me as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, during that time, conduct himself to your satisfaction? - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember an application from him to come home with you in your ship? - A. He applied to me some time before I quitted the country, in consequence of his time being expired, upon which I desired him to bring me a note from the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your secretary's name, at Botany Bay, Foulkes? - A. He is one of the clerks in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as take that into your hand, and tell me if that is the hand-writing of Mr. Foulkes?- A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, in consequence of your desire, bring that to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his bringing that to you, what was your conduct? - A. I ordered the books to be brought to me, not chusing to give credit to any note, and when these books were produced to me, he appeared to stand on these books for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. In that part in which he appeared to be sent to Botany Bay for seven years, did there appear to be any erasure, or attempt at erasure? - A. Not that I observed; it was the original list that was sent from England that I examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from whence that list comes?- A.From the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other books in which this entry would find its way, besides the list you looked at?- A. The list that comes from England is what we always look at.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the faith of what you saw in that list, what did you do? - A. I gave him permission to go where he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were not content with that general permission, but being satisfied with his conduct as a servant, did you not permit him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160026"/>come home with you in your ship? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you place him, in consequence of his conduct, in a situation of confidence in the course of his passage home? - A. He had the care of the live stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the lists kept with you, as the records of Botany Bay? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find, upon examining this with the original list which is kept as as a matter of record, that this was a correct copy? - A. Yes.(It was read as follows) - "

               <p>Q. And in the original, I think you said you did not observe any erasure or interlineation, or any thing of the kind? - A. In most of the lists there are a great many erasures, there are very few but what come with some.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the same sort of list that would have application to all the persons sent on board that vessel? - A. The same list.</p>

I will tell you fairly how I feel this case; it is certainly a very strong case for consideration elsewhere, but here I do not see how we can proceed as to the term for which he was ordered to be transported, but what appears upon the record: at the same time the account we have now heard is very fit for consideration heareafter.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of day or night? - A. I cannot say, I was very much intoxicated with liquor; I staid there all night, and did not miss my watch till the next morning; I afterwards saw him pull it out of his pocket on the 25th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him between the 25th and 26th of August? - A. Yes, two or three times; he worked at East Acton and I at Ealing. On the 25th of August, I asked him about my watch, and he pulled out a watch that he said he gave a guinea for, and put it in the landlord's hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you never asked him for it before? - A. Yes, I asked him for it the Sunday following, and he said he had seen it; I then had him taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KENTISH, sworn. - I am a constable; I went to the prisoner and challenged him with having the prosecutor's watch; the prosecutor was with me; the prisoner said he had no watch at all; I put my hand against his sob, and there I felt a watch; I asked him to shew it to me, and he said he would not; I told him, then I would search him. The prisoner and the prosecutor then went into another room, and then the landlord brought out the watch and delivered it to me; his name is Higgins. (Produces it.) I have had it ever since.(The watch was deposed to by Messer.)</p>
               <p>- HIGGINS, sworn - I keep the Horse and Groom at East Acton. On the 25th of August, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Kentish were at my house; the prisoner is a gardener, and lodged at my house; I heard an alarm, that they were come to take the gardener; the first I heard him say was, that he had no watch but one, that he had given a guinea for; I found that the prisoner and the prosecutor were acquainted; I said they had better go into another room and settle it; they were in the room by themselves about a quarter of an hour; then they called me in, and the prisoner gave me the watch, saying, there was the watch, if it was Messer's he should have it; he would bring the man by to-morrow night that he bought it of for a guinea; Messer said, if he did give a guinea for it he should have it again; the prisoner desired I would take care of it till the next evening; the prisoner had been out in the course of the day as I understood to find the person he had bought the watch of; he came in the evening and said he could not find him, but he would not deliver up the watch without the guinea that he had paid for it, or go before a Magistrate; then they all went together to the Justice's, and he recommended them to Bow-street; we went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed; he lodged in my house ten or twelve weeks; he was a very sober, industrious man, and has done a great deal of work for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in company with this young man; he and I were both very much intoxicated; I dropped asleep, and he went away and left me; the next time I saw him, he accused me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160029"/>of taking his watch; about five weeks after that I went to London and bought a watch; I gave a guinea for it, after that Kentish and Messer came to Higgins's and challenged me with the watch; I said, if they would give me a guinea, they should have the watch, and I delivered it into the hands of the landlord.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Hill: On the 17th of June I received from Mr. Hill a Bank-note for 500l. and another for 300l.; I put them into a common black leather pocket-book, with a strap to it; it contained also 25l. in small notes of my own, some memorandums, and some patterns of Bath coating and kerseymere; I went from Will's Coffee-house to the Custom-house, it was as near twelve o'clock as could be; as I was going to the Custom-house, I saw the prisoner at the bar just by the Coal Exchange, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Belasco, who was before my Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a City officer; I know the prisoner, and I know Belasco; I saw them both in Thames-street, on the 17th of June, about five or ten minutes after twelve o'clock, as near as I can recollect; I apprehended the prisoner the next day, at his own house, in Petticoat-lane; I searched the room, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you found the prisoner in a distressed condition? - A. Yes, with a child lying by him, quite naked; he had hardly any clothes to cover him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Belasco before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have apprehended him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that the Lord-Mayor gave Lazarus an intimation that he should be admitted an evidence against Belasco, when he should be taken, if he told all he knew upon the subject?- A. I believe the language of the Lord-Mayor was this, that he thought it would be best for him to tell every thing he knew, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were not present at all the examinations? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know that person, David Belasco? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was convicted upon that indictment? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp took an objection to the competence of the witness's testimony, which was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>David Belasco. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me if you know him? - A. Perfectly well. On the 17th of June I met with him in Thames-street, and I went with him to his apartments, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, and directly as we got about twenty yards up Philpot-lane, or Orange-lane, he said, Davey, come along, I have got a pocketbook; I immediately went home with him, and he opened the pocket-book; it was a black leather pocket-book, to the best of my recollection, with a strap, and a name on it on one side; it contained a parcel of letters and a bit of kerseymere, a kind of a pepper and salt colour, for a waistcoat or breeches, it was a kind of a mixture to the best of my recollection, pepper and salt, I did not take much notice what the colour was, I looked at it in a hurry; the letters were then read, and there being no fire, his wife tore the letters, and struck a light and burnt them, with the kerseymere; there was a Bank-note of 300l. and another of 500l. and a kind of a draft, I cannot say what it was, I cannot read, that was burnt, and the pocket-book likewise.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the 500l. and the 300l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160037"/>notes? - A. He went out to sell the notes, and returned in about twenty minutes with them; his wife said, Davey, you had better go to one Mr. Farmer, in Woolpack-alley; he was not at home; his wife sent me to him, where he was, in Duke's-place, and I sold him the notes; he was to give me 400l. I am no scholar, and he counted down to me 400l. I gave the money to the prisoner, and told him it had been counted down to me 400l. but I was no scholar in reading the notes. I gave - Lazarus, the prisoner's wife, 112l. as well as I could count them; in counting that down, I reckoned I had given him upwards of 200l. or else Mr. Farmer must have cheated me of the difference; there was 30l. given by me, by the prisoner's order, to a young man of the name of Jacobs, who goes by the name of Light and Scabby Head, and the remaining part I had myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was your share? - A. I have a bad memory, and can't recollect; he then told me, he would go down to Bristol; says I, I shall go and clean myself, and you come to me, and I will go with you; and, instead of doing that, he got drunk, and I went to Bristol without him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So you thought it sitting to cut, and run to Bristol? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word of this story that you have been telling us so glibly, till you were taken up and charged with this offence yourself? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were promised, by the Lord-Mayor, that, if you would turn stag, and tell all you knew about it, you should turn evidence? - A. I don't understand about stag.</p>
               <p>Q. If you would be a witness against Lazarus, he would admit you an evidence for the Crown? - A. He did, and then I up and told all that really did pass.</p>
               <p>Q. This kerseymere that you speak of, was a pepper-and-salt colour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you cannot read? - A. No, except it is my own Hebrew language.</p>
               <p>Q. Then be so good as tell me how you know a one from a five pound bank-note? - A. A one, two, or a five or so, I can tell; but, if it comes above that, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person who was tried here and convicted of stealing a pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been tried in this place? - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you the other time? - A. I was honourably acquitted by the laws of my country; that was a long time ago, but now I have come to know better.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been taken up by different constables? - A. No oftener than I have suffered for; and I don't think it right that you should tell me of what I have suffered for; I was one year in the House of Correction for what you are speaking of.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up as a rogue and vagabond? - A. That is a libel to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was sent for six months to the House of Correction as a rogue and vagabond? - A. No, not for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long then? - A. Four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in the New Prison? - A. Yes, that was the time I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. At no other time? - A. No, only when there was a game of cards playing among neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in custody, then? - A. Four days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Stone.) Q. Was there more than one piece of cloth in your pocket-book? - A. One was buff-coloured kerseymere, and the other dark black and white mixture, what you may call a pepper-and-salt.</p>

            , (City Marshal,) sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you remember any conversation in the Poultry Compter between the prisoner and Mr. Isaacs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that conversation, were there any promises of favour made to him by Mr. Isaacs or any body else? - A. I said, remember, Lazarus, there is no one present who can have any authority to make you a promise of favour, or tempt you to speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had not Lazarus been given to understand, before that, that he should be admitted an evidence against Belasco? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Isaacs there before you? - A. He was there the day before. On the 19th of June last, I think, he said he was inclined to tell all he knew; I told him, if he was induced to say what he was about to say from any promise, not to speak, for no promise would be made him; he said, that himself, Belasco, and a man they call Scabby Head, went out with an intent to pick pockets, and near the Custom House they saw Mr. Stone; they followed him; the prisoner was not on the same side of the way with Stone; he was opposite to him, and saw Belasco draw the book out of his pocket; he crossed over, and Belasco said, follow me; they went to Petticoat-lane; Belasco went out with the intention to dispose of the bank-notes. I then desired that Mr. Stone, who was below, might come up; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; and the prisoner said, that is the gentleman that was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Isaacs had been to the prisoner in the Compter the day before? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the Lord-Mayor's orders that the prisoner should see nobody but such persons as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160038"/>you or Mr. Teague might approve? - A. Yes; Mr. Isaacs applied to me, and I mentioned it to the Lord-Mayor, who permitted him to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Isaacs was attorney for the prosecution, and the prisoner's own friends were refused? - A. I believe they were, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. His own attorney was refused? - A. I recollect Mr. Isaacs had seen him two or three times before his own attorney saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not Lazarus given to understand, at the Mansion House, that he should be admitted an evidence against Belasco? - A. Not till after I had seen him, in the presence of Mr. Teague and Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that intimation given to him before the first, second, or third, examination? - A. I cannot tell, upon my oath; I believe it was after the conversation with Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. And at a month's distance, he was committed to take his trial? - A. It was a long time after; it was more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not in consequence of the story that Lazarus told to you, in the Poultry Compter, that the Lord-Mayor was induced to flatter him that he should be admitted a witness?- A.It was in consequence of that conversation; the Lord-Mayor said, remember, if you are admitted an evidence, you must state the whole; you must reserve nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And when Belasco was taken, Lazarus was committed for trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did my Lord-Mayor assign a reason why he was not admitted an evidence? - A. My Lord-Mayor said, it was because he was convinced he had told him a bundle of untruths.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - On the 6th of July the prisoner was delivered into my custody, charged with stealing the notes; after he was locked up I searched him, and in the inside of the lining of his coat, which was cut, I found these notes, (produces them); after that I saw him writing something and requested him to let me look at it; it was a long time before he would give it me, I was under the necessity of unlocking the door and taking it out of his hand.

               <p>"My dear Lady, I am very sorry for my misconduct, but it was distress that drove me to it; but my master lives at No. 54, Park-street; but if you will go there I know that a word of your's will go a great way; for, if you will say that I had some notes of you, that will clear me.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was so much intoxicated with liquor and vexation of mind, that I don't know any thing I did while I was at the office; I was told they would take all my money from me, that was my reason for concealing the notes; the five-pound note my father gave me just before; he is here.</p>

Not particularly; but he is a favourite of my wife's, and she has frequently sent notes up to him and likewise cloaths; I have missed notes several times, and when I have enquired for them, I have been informed that she has sent them up to Jem, because he was in distress.</p>

               <p>Q. And therefore I take it, it was for that reason you desired him to write his name in the book, in case it should turn out unfound, if any thing was the matter with it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house, I believe, is in Smithfield Market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not toll it? - A. No, it was not bought in the Market.</p>

               <p>Q.So that any body might have observed him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was absent some little time, before he returned and agreed with you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Chandos-street, Covent-Garden, I keep a cook's-shop; I was at Smithfield Market on Friday, the 26th of June, with Worth; we went into the Bartholomew's Coffee-house; I saw the prisoner, a man of the name of Rowe, that went limping, and another man that sold a horse to the prisoner; he gave him six guineas and a half for it, in money and Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse? - A. It was rather a dark brown horse, rather a lightish dark, a kind of a sorrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a mare or a gelding? - A. I did not take notice, it had a white face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time was this? - A. About two o'clock, as near as could be, within about a quarter of an hour one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Elphick). Q. Had this horse a white face? - A. He had a star in his forehead, and a white slip on his nose.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep a house, No. 11, Denmark-street, St. Giles's: On Sunday morning, the 19th of July, about two o'clock, I was alarmed that the house had been broke open; I got up, but could not discover where they had got in; before I went to bed, I had tried the outer door, and found the spring lock fast.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, was it light? - A. Not clearly; for there was a parcel in the passage, and it could not be distinguished what it was till a light was called for.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were alarmed, how did you find your doors inside the house? - A. The parlour door had been forced; the brass box, which receives the lock, was pushed on one side the door of the front room on the first floor, appeared to have been forced by tools applied on the outside, for the whole of the pannel was split down; the papers in the desk were strewed about the parlour, the desk having been forced open; the two parlours had been robbed; the front room up one pair of stairs, which Mr. Williams occupied, and the front kitchen-door, was broke; but I don't know that any thing was taken out of it; Mr. Williams had a padlock upon the front kitchen-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose the persons must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160042"/>have been in the house? - A. If they had done it in the most expeditious manner, they could not have done it in less than an hour; it could not have been day-light when they got into the house; there were matches lying at my room door, which had the appearance of having been used.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the three prisoners, and tell me whether, before the 19th of July, you were acquainted with their persons? - A. Yes, all three of them. On the 19th of July, at near half past two o'clock in the morning, going past the end of Denmark-street, in Crown-street, (Mr. Bateson's house is the third door from Crown-street,) I observed the prisoner Freake, Nowland, and another man, whom I believe to be Whitfield, but I cannot be certain, for, as he passed me, he huddled among the rest; there was also a butcher with them; there were four of them; Nowland was the last man; Freake and the butcher had a bundle huddled between them close to the wall. I saw them come from the porch-way of Mr. Bateson's door, from inside the railing, and they all turned into Freake's house, the corner of Dudley-court. I live right opposite Freake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then day-light? - A. It was just break of day; just the twilight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been any break of day an hour before that? - A. No, nor half an hour. I could not get proper assistance till between six and seven; I alarmed Mr. Bateson about a quarter of an hour after I had first seen them; I went over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, from what had been done, that it could have been effected in an hour? - A. I don't think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards apprehend either of the prisoners? - A. Yes, Freake was the first; I apprehended him that very morning, about seven o'clock, near his own house; we searched him and his house, but found nothing; I was at the apprehending of Nowland; I went to search him, and he pulled a bundle of papers out of his pocket, and said, this is what you want, I suppose; which turned out to be bank-notes. Black has the notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether Freake has a brother or not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are not very unlike one another? - A. There is a difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Slater? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that you had forgot what you had said at Bow-street, and wished him to remind you? - A. No such thing; he told me he had got a subpoena, and I said, all he had to do was to speak the truth, as to what I said when I called him off his beat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are the two brothers so much alike, that you could mistake one for the other? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was this man, and not his brother? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your room near his? - A. Yes, he has to go through my room to get into his; his wife called me up the next morning at five o'clock, and I then saw him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have gone out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160043"/>in the course of that night through your room without your knowing it, and return again? - A. No, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>Q. You asked her, perhaps, who it was that was so kind as to bring her husband home? - A. No, I never asked her any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the door to be left open at that time of night? - A. For the lodger to come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out? - A. No, he was at home; but his wife might not be at home.</p>

               <p>Q. It has been positively sworn that three or four men went into Freake's house - will you swear that that is false? - A. Yes, that I will swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open between two and three?- A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut or open when you went to-bed? - A. I shut it close too, but did not bolt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up in the house?- A. For what I know, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not bolt it, and therefore people might come in without making much noise? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual way of leaving your door?- A. It is up a yard, and not like being in a public street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a bolt to the door? - A. I don't know whether there is or not; I never take any other trouble than shutting the door to.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it fastened? - A. Only with a latch; three or four people might come in and go up stairs without my knowing it, but not into his; he got up between six and seven o'clock, and washed himself at the pump.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the watchmen come there the next day?- A. No, they came to the shop; they did not come to his own house.</p>

               <p>Q. What for? - A. Nothing particular; I heard that he was taken, and I naturally wanted to know what it was about.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to, to give evidence here? - A. I cannot say how long ago it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you? - A. His wife applied to me when the Sessions began.</p>

             produced the other two bundles, which he took from Phillips, the contents of which were identified by Mrs. Clarke.)</p>
               <p>Crocker. As we were going to the office, Phillips told me he saw Nell come out with the things, and he asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he was going to a stage-coach to his sister, and asked him to help carry the bundles, for he said it looked aukward for a soldier to be carrying bundles at that time in the morning, and he told me he helped him to carry them on purpose to find out where he was going with them.</p>

               <p>Nell's defence. I was drinking a pint of beer at Old's house with this young man, and we stopped till it was too late to get into our lodgings; we went up St. Martin's-lane, and there were two soldiers sitting upon a step with these bundles, and when we came up, they ran away, and left them; we took them up with an intention of going to Bow-street to find an owner for them.</p>
               <p>Phillips's defence. What Crocker says is very false; I never said any such thing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In the course of three-quarters of an hour, Kent might have got away? - A.Most certainly he might.</p>

             sworn. - I am a clerk in the accompting-house of Messrs. Blanchency and Co.; I have compared the cocoa in the jacket with that in the bag, and also with the sample from which we bought it; they appear to me to be exactly the same.</p>
               <p>Myers's defence. I was at work for Mr. Henry Cooper, a lighterman, at Cox's-quay; my employer desired me to go and assist in getting a barge up against tide, and I asked Kent to give me a cast down; I had been very ill for a fortnight, and had been at work all night; I was very much jaded, and laid down; Mr. Little came on board, turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160046"/>up the tarpaulin, and said, what do you do here? I told him nothing, only that I was going down with Kent, who had agreed to give me a cast, and he immediately took me before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Kent's defence. There was a hole in one bag, which came down with a piece of cotton in it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Myers called five, and Kent six witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

I was called upon to examine the number of sheets left in the ward, as is usual when any sister goes away; I missed seven pair; I then, according to the Treasurer's order, took the prisoner into custody; I went with her and the officer to the Compter; but, before that, I asked her what was become of the seven pair of sheets, and she said they were in her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made her any promise that you would not prosecute her if she confessed where they were? - A. I told her I had orders to take her to the Compter if she did not tell me where they were; I could not get any satisfactory answer, and I took her to the Compter; the next morning I went to the Compter, and she said she had pawned them, and would give me the duplicates if I could get her dismissed from the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that of herself, without your saying any thing to her? - A. Yes; she then gave me the duplicates; in consequence of which I went to Mr. Briggs, Smithfield-bars, and there I found four pair of sheets pawned in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the Hospital mark upon them?- A. The mark had been rubbed over with pipeclay, but there was sufficient remaining for me to see it; I then went to Mr. Watson's, in Watling-street, according to duplicates that she gave me; I saw two pair of sheets there pawned in the name of Hill; she was then committed.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOTILLER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Mr. Briggs, pawnbroker, Smithfield-bars. I remember the prisoner coming to our shop, and pledging the sheets that Mr. Payter claimed; the mark had been rubbed over with pipe-clay, or something white, so that when I held them up, I did not see it, or I should not have taken them in. (Seven sheets produced, and identified by Mr. Payter.)</p>
               <p>ELEANOR HILL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner many years; I pledged two sheets for her at Mr. Watson's; she told me they were her own; I never saw them unfolded.</p>
               <p>- WATSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember taking in any sheets from the last witness? - A. I have no recollection of it; I don't know that I took them in; I delivered to Mr. Payter the sheets that he claimed.</p>
               <p>Hill. There were a pair of sheets that I had redeemed at Mr. Watson's, and had not returned to the prisoner, which I delivered to Mr. Payter.(Payter produced them.)</p>
               <p>Hill. These are the same that I received from Mrs. Davis; I particularly remarked the letter H at the corner.</p>
               <p>Payter. These sheets belong to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in great distress before I got into the Hospital; I had been obliged to make away with a great deal of my wearing apparel; I made a very bad appearance; I thought these sheets would not be wanted, and I pledged them for the purpose of getting some of my clothes out to appear in. <rs id="t18010916-62-verdict327" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. (Counsel for Hunt.) Q. The person you suppose to be Hunt, was dressed in black at that time? - A. Yes; but I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see him again for a fortnight afterwards? - A.No; he was taken up by the description I gave of him at the Office; they knew him from my description.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. - Mrs. Wyatt gave me a description of Hunt on the 17th of August; she said she was sure she should know him again: we were after him till the 27th, and then we took him in Feathers-court, Holborn, from her description.</p>

I know no nothing of the man that stands by my side; a gentleman told me to go and order some linen to be sent to Mr. Godwin's, and I should be rewarded; I did so, and just before I got to Mr. Godwin's, the gentleman met us, and sent the woman back for some cambric; I went to Mr. Godwin's with the linen, and when we had got within the door, the gentleman said we had got to the wrong house; I immediately, upon coming out, heard a cry of stop thief; he ran away, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Hunt, left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you the gentleman that North saw with him in the boat? - A. No; I was upon deck, I was the foreman of this man.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure he could not take the tortoiseshell? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q.(To North). Do you know that man? - A. This man I believe is the other man who was in the boat.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it broke open? - A.By a skeleton key; I came into the house at five o'clock, and shut the door after me, the house door has a spring lock; after that I was with my brothers in the parlour; between eight and nine o'clock I heard the door open, I thought it was one of our lodgers, I opened the door to see whether it was or not; I saw the prisoner going off the step of the door with two bundles; I asked him who he pleased to want, and he said he wanted my father, but he had seen my father; I told him he had not seen my father, for my father and mother were both gone out; I asked him what things he had there; he said they were his; I said I am sure they are not, I will follow you; then he went to a public-house, and dropped the basket in the passage, and the other bundle he took with him and went out at the other door; then I came home again and did not see any thing of the man afterwards; I saw the basket and the bundle the next day at Guildhall.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On Sunday evening, the 5th of July, I was sent for to the Castle, in Norwith-court, to take charge of the prisoner and these bundles, (produces the bundles and a basket); he said they did not belong to him, he had found them; the basket was lying upon the table; Mrs. Harris came into the room, and she wished the bundles to be opened, the prisoner was present; she said, the things were not her property, but there was a particular gown that she knew to be the property of Mrs. Vaughan; he then said, if the things belonged to the lady, she was very welcome to take them, for they did not belong to him; he said he was rather in a hurry, he would call again presently; I told him, no, he must not go yet, I wanted to speak with him; I observed his left hand go to his left hand pocket, and draw back again; I heard, or thought I heard something fall behind him on the bench where he sat; I then desired him to stand up, because there was something that I wanted, and immediately I found these three skeleton keys, (produces them); upon that I searched him, and found upon him these six small keys, which are common keys, a knife, two screw-drivers, not broke, and this very strong serew-drier, broke (produces them); I said, he had so many tools about him, I should not wonder if he had pistols; he said, no, he had not, but if he had, bl - y end to him if I should not have had it; after I had taken him to the Compter, I went to Mr. Harris's to examine the street door, and the one-pair of stairs room door; the large skelation key opened the street door with great ease, perhaps with mare ease than the right key would; the smaller skeletons would not go into the lock of the one-pair of stairs door, and that door had been forced open, I suspected, at the hinges, because the bolt of the lock was not shoved back; I then compared the broken screw-driver with the bruises upon the door, and found it correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. In the presence of the prisoner, did you hear how the basket came at the public-house? - A. Yes; two or three people said he had left it in the passage, and said he would call for it presently.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in liquor? - A. No, only merry; one of the prisoners asked my friend if he would see her safe home, and he said he would; we both went to the bottom of Golden-lane, and there I lost my friend and one of the women; the other told me they would come after us: I then went with Clarke up stairs into a house; she sat down upon the foot of the bed, and pulled me right over her; she then picked my pocket of my watch, a half-crown, and two shillings. I had seen my money and watch in the afternoon; as soon as she had robbed me, she ran down stairs; I followed her, and saw her a few minutes afterwards at the White-Hart, in Golden-lane; she ran through the tap-room, and I saw no more of her till the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Clarke.) Q. You were coming from work, I suppose? - A. No, I had been visiting a friend.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no difficulty in finding the prisoner, Clarke, the next day? - A. No, I could not find her till Mr. Rittson, the publican, found her for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Rittson that you had not money enough to give the ladies, and you gave her the watch to borrow some upon? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say you had not money enough to pay her that compliment she was deserving of the night before, and you would give her five shillings more? - A. No, I told her I did not mind treating her with half-a-crown's-worth, if she would tell where it was.</p>

Yes, I went home; and between ten and eleven o'clock he came to me, and told me he had lost his watch; I live at No. 25, Clerkenwell-close; he stopped there all night, and the next morning I went with him to inquire for it; the landlord went with us to find her; there was a flogging-match in the street, and we lost Riley in the crowd; the landlord found Clarke; I asked her for the watch; she said she did not mean to keep it, but she did not like to deliver it to me before the officer: Riley came in, and told her if she would let him have his watch, he would forgive her, and spend something.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Mr. Wright here? - A. No; I found he had been there, and had received instructions where the note lay; it lay at Mr. Hodsoll's, in the Strand: On Monday morning, as soon as the banking-house was open, I went to inquire if the bill had been taken up, and found it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. No; from thence I went to the Bank, and put a stop upon the number of the note, thinking he might have fell into some bad bands; from there I went on board the receiving-ship at the Tower, to see if he had been impressed, but he was not there; I then thought, perhaps, he had got the note cashed at the Bank himself; I went to the Bank, and found it had come in on the Saturday; I then went to Bow-street, advertised him, and got a special warrant to apprehend him wherever I could find him; on Tuesday morning, in consequence of information, I gave the warrant to Mr. Belmaine, a constable, who took him at Gravesend.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know any thing dishonest of me before? - A. I had no reason to suspect him of dishonesty; I had known him from a child; he has been in my service two years; I intrusted him commonly and frequently to take up this.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BELMAINE sworn. - I am a whitesmith; I apprehended the prisoner at Gravesend; I took him to the City of Amsterdam, at Gravesend, and I found nothing upon him but a penny; he said all the rest he had lost at Bartholomew-Fair; I found, under where he had been sitting, a pocketbook, containing a one-pound bank-note and some other money.</p>

I paid it to the prisoner in fifty one-pound notes; I remember him very well; I am sure he is the man; the number of the one-pound notes that I gave him were from 9151 to 9200, both numbers included, dated the 5th of August, in the present year.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. This appears to be one of them, by the number 9174.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TURTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a barge-man; I work for Mr. James Aslett, of Isleworth: On the 6th of August I was at work unloading a tug that was loaded with oats, the prisoner was at work with me; I slept on board that night with my brother, a little boy, about eight years old; my brother waked me between ten and eleven o'clock; I got up, and saw a man taking a sack from off the wharf; I went up to that man, and asked him who he was; he made no reply, but knocked me down, and ran away; then I saw another man and he ran away, then I saw a third man, about as far from the oats as I am from you, I pursued him and asked him who he was; I knew him, it was

            , the prisoner; he shuffled away from me and went through the water.</p>
               <p>Q. How close were you to him, had you hold of him? - A. No, I touched him, and that was all; I am sure it was him, I saw him very clearly; he went across the water and up a little alley that goes the back way to his house, the water was about knee high; I then went and alarmed my master; I went to the prisoner's house and he was not at home; he was taken about half an hour after in Church-row, about a quarter of a mile off; my master asked him where he came from; he said he came from Brentford; my master asked him if he saw any body run by him; he said yes, two men, but he did not know who they were, he said he was looking after his son; upon that my master felt his legs and found him wet pretty near up to his knees; my master asked him how he came so wet, and he said getting out of the lug in the afternoon; he said she had a great deal of water in her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true? - A. No; there was not more than an inch of water in the lug; the corn was in it at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was it light enough for you to know him? - A. Yes; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does this alley lead to? - A. Up to his house, and it leads into the town.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the oats? - A. They were dropped under the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not taken out of the lug? - A. No; my master locked up the oats; they are in Court.</p>
               <p>PHILLIS THOMAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live two doors from the prisoner; I saw him go into his own house between ten and eleven o'clock at night of the 6th of August, he came out again, in five minutes at the outside, and in about ten minutes after Turton and Mr. Aslett came to look for him.</p>
               <p>JAMES ASLETT, Jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. This is the sack of oats that was upon the wharf the night before; it is my father's property, it had been removed about two yards.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Turton). What was the man doing with the sack? - A. He had got it upon his back going to carry it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the job; I was not the man that did the piece of business; I do not deny but I was by there looking after my son, but I know nothing of this business.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Aslett.) Q. How long had he been in your service? - A. We employed him by the day, as we wanted him, we only had him occasionally.</p>

            , in Fenchurch-street: On the 20th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner mending the bottom of a box; he stooped down under a stool, and began to rummage among some papers; I was looking at him, and by the motion of his body, I thought I saw him put something into the box; I suspected he had taken something, and I watched him; when he was going away, I said, Raven, will you have some beer; he said, yes, go into the Red Lion, call for a pot, and I will come to you in a minute or two; I said, I will wait, I can go along with you; he said I am only going to the Ship to leave this; I said I will go with you; then we went on till we came into Lime-street; going along, I said, Raven, have you got a hat there; he said yes, I am only going to leave it for a gentleman, and I will go along with you; I said you must excuse me, for I must see that hat, I must see what sort of a one it is; he then broke the string that was round the box, and instantly pulled out these two hats; I said, are you not a pretty fellow for doing such tricks as these, and I instantly took him back to the warehouse; but neither of the firm being in town, nor the foreman in the way, I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were Mr. Borrodaile's hats? - A. By seeing him take them off the premises; they have no mark on them that I know them by.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He said, you can take the hats back and let me go: I am a constable myself and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was finisher at Mr. Borrodaile's house, that some time ago there were some old hat-boxes put aside to be burnt, that he put one of them aside to take home for his children's playthings, and that on the night he was taken he put two books into a box, not knowing there was any thing else in it; that he had a wife and two children, and she was eight months gone in pregnancy.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Crow). Were there any books in the box? - A. No book at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect you are on your oath as an honest man sworn to speak the truth? - A. Yes; there was no book at all in the box, nothing but the two hats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I would not take the books that night, and I left them behind me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him for eight years, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as name your brother trustees? - A.(Repeats them).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you fourteen gentlemen the managers of the funds of the Society? - A. We are.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you take it by turns to audit the payment of renewal premiums? - A. Not the fourteen, we are divided into committees for different purposes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your turn to audit from the 10th to the 11th of July? - A. I did that week audit the payments; we do not take it in regular turns.</p>
               <p>Q.Previous to this 10th of July, was the prisoner at the bar in the service of you gentlemen trustees?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity? - A. As accomptant.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he a clerk? - A.Certainly; and had been so about two years, more or less, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the duty of the prisoner at the bar to receive the payments of renewal premiums for the Society? - A. It was his department.</p>
               <p>Q. And endowment premiums also? - A. And endowment premiums generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at the prisoner's account from the 10th to the 17th of July, and tell us if you know any thing of having audited that account? - A. I certainly do, for I put my name to it, and all the entries are in the prisoner's own hand-writing.(The account from the 10th to the 16th inclusive read).</p>
               <p>Receipts by the prisoner of renewal premiums, amounting to 602l. 10s. 11d. and endowment premiums 23l. making in the whole, for the London renewals, 625l. 10s. 11d.</p>
               <p>On the other side, July 14th:</p>
               <p>By Robarts and Company - £.381 15 7 15th, by ditto - - 140 17 4 17th, by ditto - 102 18 0 Making, in the whole, 625 10 11</p>
               <p>Q. Are Robarts, Curtis, and Company, the bankers of the Society? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you examined and passed the accounts of the prisoner, was it your practice to examine the items contained in the banker's book? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it in this case? - A. I am fully persuaded I did, before I put my name to the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, upon any occasion, sign such account, as audited by you, without finding the items agree? - A. Never, to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the name of that book? - A. This book we call the London renewal book.(The banker's book produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the book produced by the prisoner before you audited and passed this account on the 17th of July? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Do the items in that book, as they stand now, correspond with the items in the other account? - A. They do not; it certainly is not in the same state, because I passed the full sum of 381l. 15s. 7d.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you passed his account, was there any erasure before the 81? - A. I am confident there could not have been.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any erasure now? - A. There certainly apears to be one very strongly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for the prisoner, at the time he passed his account, to produce a slip of paper, containing items which were severally ticked by you, item by item? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prisoner dismissed from his employment? - A. I cannot tell; I do not think I was in town at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it after the 17th of July? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have told us that book was produced by the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not, and is it not frequently produced by Mr. Bowers, one of your clerks? - A. Mr. Bowers may have had it.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no entry in that banker's book in the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. That book is permitted to be in the hands of Mr. Bowers, and every Trustee? - A. It certainly is not locked up, but I do not know of its being in any body's hands, except the messenger's.</p>
               <p>Q. All the Trustees have access to it? - A. That department is confined to four gentlemen, the two Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Godwin, and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is not locked up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is like any other voucher produced at the time, and not confined to his custody at all? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have frequently known consisiderable mistakes in your banker's book, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160070"/>amount of four or five hundred pounds? - A. I have never known of any.</p>

               <p>Q. Are the entries in that book of your handwriting? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at July the 14th? - A.Cash eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven pence, is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. On whose account did you receive that? - A. On account of the Pelican Life Insurance Office.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive it? - A. I do not know; I received it by a draft upon Weston and Company, bankers.</p>
               <p>Q.By whom drawn? - A. I do not know; we never take an account of the drawer's name.</p>
               <p>Q.When you made that entry, was there any erasure previous to the figure 8? - A. Not that I saw or knew of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you did not, upon that day, receive three hundred and eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven-pence? - A. I am quite sure I did not, corresponding with the book in which I entered it at the time I received it; that book is here: (refers to the book, reads,) Pelican Office, eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven-pence, on Weston.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Boldero.) Q. Though you do not know of any mistakes that happen, do you mean to say this prisoner was at all deficient three hundred pounds in his account with the Society? - A. I am not prepared to answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to pledge yourself there is any thing like that deficiency? - A. I do not mean to pledge myself at all, because we may not be able to ascertain the whole amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Thomas.) Q. By whom the draft was drawn you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TIBBS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am clerk to Messrs. Weston and Company, at the Borough Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner kept cash at Messrs. Westons on the 14th of July last? - A. Yes, he did. (Produces his book.)</p>
               <p>Q.Have you an entry of a draft of his there?- A. Yes; on the 14th of July I received a draft for eighty-one pounds, fifteen shillings, and seven pence, drawn upon our house by John M'Gregor; it came through the house of Robarts and Company; it was paid the same day, and carried to the prisoner's account.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. I am clerk in the Pelican Office; Mr. M'Gregor was a clerk there also; he was dismissed on Thursday, the 23d of July, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, after that period, his coming to the Office? - A.He came to the Office the next day, I was in the Office at the time, and two Directors; it was on a Friday, when the cash of the Office was to be settled; it was settled every Friday; there was an order that the Directors were to see him, and he was to be requested to give up his keys; he said, he thought he had sent his keys the day before by the messenger, Mason; Mason denied it; the prisoner gave Mason a note to go home to his house to fetch the keys. During Mason's absence, Mr. M'Gregor, having had an accident, complained he was thirsty, and was advised to drink spruce-beer for his complaint; he went out, and did not return that day; when Mason returned, he brought me a draft for six hundred pounds, upon Weston and Company, drawn by M'Gregor, and made payable to himself, with a message, saying, he was so unwell he could not attend himself; that he had sent it desiring me to give it to Mr. Bowers, for the renewals he had received that part of the week that he had attended.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the custom in the Office with respect to the quantity of money the clerks may receive?- A.Every clerk, who has received one hundred pounds, should pay it into the Office that evening, and settle the accounts every Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when he was before the Directors for the purpose of settling his account?- A. It was after he was discharged; he was discharged on one Thursday, and the Thursday following he was to make up his accounts to the Board.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any deficiency in his accounts to the Office at this time? - A. There is a deficiency of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you know that this injury he had received was occasioned by being thrown out of a carriage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon application being made to him, he sent a draft for six hundred pounds - was not that more than sufficient to balance the account? - A. There is fifty pounds remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not recollect something about a bill of fifty pounds, about which there was a mistake?- A. I do not; Mr. M'Gregor wrote me, after he was in the Compter, that he had paid in a bill of fifty pounds, which had not been presented for payment; but that bill I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. Six hundred pounds was paid in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe some subsequent payments? - A. Yes, I think on the Thursday following, thirty-one pounds, nine shillings, and eleven pence, and he afterwards paid me a draft of sixty-seven pounds, ten shillings, on account of another insurance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at the time he left the Office there was a deficiency of seven hundred and fifty pounds?- A. There was a deficiency of more than that when he was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, and see if you can find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160071"/>any entries made of the sum of six hundred pounds and the other sums? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are the entries in that book the prisoner's writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not attend on the day the Directors attended, and was taken ill? - A. He attended on the Thursday, and went away ill.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all the Directors have these keys? A. None of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Taking the whole together, there would be a deficiency of fifty pounds? - A. Yes, taking the bills and cash; some of the bills have been paid since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I only mean to state the reason of my absence from the Office, in consequence of an accident I had received on the 21st of July; I went to the White Hart Tavern to meet a few friends, and in coming home, a little before nine, I was overturned in a chaise, and so much hurt that I was taken up as nearly dead; I sent to Mr. Bowers, requesting him to make a few entries for me in my cast-books, which I had not made; it was my intention to have attended at the Office on the Wednesday, but was prevented; on the Thursday, being exceedingly bruised by the chaise going over my body, I could not make the entries; however I went with intent to go to the Office, but in the way was prevented by indisposition, from loss of blood. On the Tuesday night I sent a note to the Pelican Office, in which I said there were several entries not made, and I should be very much obliged to Mr. Bowers if he would enter them for me; I understood Mr. Stonestreet was very angry with me for having sent but one key, and I was that very day suspended from my employment; I came on the Friday, and was prevented from settling my accounts; I was desired not to touch the keys; Mr. Bowers has got a duplicate-key of those very drawers, and I have frequently found them open in the morning when I could have sworn I had locked them the night before; and sometimes I have found them opened with a chissel; Mr. Godwin desired me to make out the account, and give them the balance; Mr. Stonestreet said, recollect yourself on Thursday next, (which was Board day,) and, what you have to say, the Board will attend to; I had not the books at my command, and therefore I could not make out the account; I rather suspect there is a balance in my favour. The banker's book is frequently very erroneous, and Mr. Boldero has observed the slovenly way in which it has been done; there is an erasure in that very book of one hundred and forty-five pounds; the Policy Office, as well as the Pelican Office, have an account at the same bankers, and they had entered the one for the other; I am not indebted to the Office one single shilling; on the contrary, I conceive there is something owing to me; I had no intention of defrauding these gentlemen, it was the farthest from my heart.</p>

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>PETER BOWERS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any mistakes in the banker's books?- A. I recollect an instance of one hundred and forty-five pounds being carried by the banker's to the Pelican account, which belonged to some other person.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called sixteen witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY, aged 36.</p>
               <p>London Jury, before Mr. Common Serjeant.</p>
               <p>Mr. KNOWLES, (in Arrest of Judgment).</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>It seems to me that I shall be able to shew your Lordship, that, in point of fact, the crime is not sufficiently averred upon this record. I take it, that this Act of Parliament creates no new felony, but refers the offence to the class of larcenies, and, therefore, every indictment upon this Act of Parliament must contain upon the face of it a good charge of larceny against the person accused. That the indictment should previously state, as this has done, the circumstances from which that inference is drawn. I do not quarrel with, but inasmuch as the Grand Jury have drawn the conclusion that this man has committed a larceny, it remains for us to contend that they have not drawn that conclusion rightly and according to law. I say, here is no charge of larceny against this person, though he is prosecuted for a larceny. Every charge of larceny must contain not only the charge of taking, stealing, and carrying away, but it must also charge the taking something which is the property either of some persons known or of some persons unknown; if the persons are known, it must aver that the thing alledged to have been stolen is the money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160072"/>goods, or chattels of that person, and must be described to have been stolen from him; if the persons are unknown, it must describe the money, goods, and chattels as being the property of persons unknown to the Jurors. So not only in cases of larceny, but in cases of highway robbery, to make out a highway robbery I must charge that the person has taken violently and feloniously from the person of the prosecutor, a gold watch, or ten pounds in money; and having so charged it, I must not stop short there, if I do, I do not present a proper record, but I must say he has taken violently and feloniously from the person of A. B. ten guineas, the monies of the said A. B. Now, my Lord, this is an indictment for stealing monies, but there is no person mentioned whose monies this person has stolen; it is alledged that he has feloniously stolen, taken, and carried away the said sum of money, which is said to be three hundred pounds; but it does not any where aver that that three hundred pounds so stolen is the monies of these gentlemen, or that it is the monies of any person whatever. I take it, therefore, that neither in the first or second count is there any averment of property in any person. Now, it is not sufficient that I should be told, "Can any body of common sense say that if it is taken from them it is not their money?" But we must read this record with the sense and understanding of lawyers, and I say, that in no construction can a lawyer find an allegation of property at all. Suppose an indictment for a highway robbery had alledged that the prisoner had at such a time violently and feloniously taken from the person of such an one ten guineas in money, and had stopped there, I take it that would not have been a sufficient description of a highway robbery, because it should aver that that money should belong to some person or other; but here it is no where alledged that this money, charged to have been stolen, is the money of any body. Now, this answer, I am sure, cannot be given, that the force of precedents will justify it; if it could, my answer would be this, that the Act of Parliament only passed in the year 1799, and there cannot be a sufficient number of precedents to say that shall bind us; but the force of precedents is the other way, for I will only recur to the indictment which immediately preceded this; if I had been put to defend that person I should have had no such ground to stand upon, for there the indictment charges that

            , the prosecutrix; but here it is no where alledged that it is the money of the persons from whom it is alledged to have been stolen. My Lord, in Hawkins I find this passage: "It seems to be taken as a ground in many books, that regularly the persons offended as well as the defendant ought to be certainly described in every indictment, and agreeably hereto it hath been adjudged, that an indictment for stealing a certain piece of linen cloth of one J. S. without adding de bonis &amp; catallis cujusdam. J. S. is insufficient, because it doth not expressly appear to whom the goods stolen did belong." You must, therefore, not only say he took it of such an one, but you must aver that it was his property, or that of some other person. I conceive, therefore, that this indictment is bad, and cannot be maintained.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Cox? - A. I saw him the morning I presented the bill; in the month of March last, Jones applied to me, and asked me to do him the favour to discount him a bill at a short date, drawn by Mr. Cox to Mr. Bircham; I asked him for the bill; he said, he had not got it; he went away, and fetched it; I found it was not indorsed; I desired him to get it indorsed; he brought it back indorsed by Bircham and Jones; I gave him the money for the bill, twenty-nine pounds, nineteen shillings, and six-pence; Jones said, there is a week's score, you may take that out of the bill; he returned again in about half an hour, and said, I had reckoned the money six-pence short, and I gave him six-pennyworth of copper; I did not take a farthing for discount, I think it had two days to run. When it became due, I went to Mr. Cox, in Worcester-place, Thames-street, and presented the note; I saw him, he said he could not take up the note then, but he would take it up in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no objection to the bill then? - A. No; the bill was not taken up, and I employed a notary; I do not recollect his name; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that bill at last paid? - A. The money was brought me by Jones; I gave the bill to Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did Jones tell you he had merely written the bill, or do you recollect that you saw the name of Jones on the bill, as the drawer? - A. I saw the name of Jones at the bottom of the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say, that that bill was drawn by him as he was directed by Bircham, the superior clerk; and did not he refuse to take from you the money for it till he should speak to Bircham? - A. He did; he said I must speak to Mr. Bircham first.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was acting under his direction?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the drawer of the bill? - A. It was drawn from Mr. Cox to Mr. Bircham; I promise to pay, so many days after date, to Mr. Bircham.</p>

(The constable produced the property, which was identified by Mr. Clarke).</p>

As near as I can guess, between the hours of twelve and two; a coach came up, and there came two men and a woman out of it; the woman went into the public-house; then the men took the bags out of the coach and carried them into the public-house, and then they went up Field-lane.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a City constable: On Friday the 31st of July, I went to the One Tun, Holborn-bridge, to the best of my recollection, about four o'clock, or a little before four; I found Price, and Brown and his wife, in the tap-room, in a box adjoining the bar; there were two other men in the box, and at the farther end of the box, next to Price, I found this bag, (producing it); Price fat on the left-hand side of the box, all the rest were on the other side of the box; I took them all three into custody, and the bundle likewise; I asked Price if he knew any thing of the bundle; he said, he knew nothing at all about it; I asked Brown the same; he said, he knew nothing about it; I asked Mrs. Brown, and she said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any great coat upon Price? - A. Yes; that was taken off his back at the Compter. (Produces a great coat, and a bag, containing a bridle, saddle, and a martingal).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When you went in, what became of the other two men that were in the box?- A. They staid in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found only one bundle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Price any questions about the coat?- A. He had not a word to say about the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that he said he bought it of a Jew? - A. No; before the Alderman, he said he bought it in Monmouth-street.(The great coat, and the other articles, identified by Mills).</p>
               <p>Price's defence. I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; the great coat I bought of a Jew in the street.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I knew a young man that lived at this public-house, and my wife and I went in and had a pot of beer; there were six or seven people in the box; there was a Jew in the box that lately came from transportation, as I am informed, and he had his arm on this property when the officers came in; I did not know them to be officers; some of the people in the box jumped over the table, and went away; I was very willing to go with them.</p>
               <p>Parrot. When they were taken, there was a great skirmish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. In that skirmish, who was it that

             a knife? - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Graham) Q. When you took these prisoners, did they resist? - A. Yes; Price 
               <persName id="t18010916-130-person874">drew</persName>
             a knife, and I prevented him from opening it; I had a great deal of difficulty in securing Price; Brown and his wife went peaceably along.</p>
               <p>Brown called one witness, who gave him a good character. Price, GUILTY, aged 27.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Rodwell, who keeps a chandler's shop, No. 46, London Wall: On Friday evening, the 4th of September, about eight o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into my shop; he asked me for a quarter of a pound of ham, a three-penny loaf, and some onions, which amounted altogether to ten-pence half-penny; he then threw down a crooked half-guinea for me to give him change; I looked at the half-guinea, and perceived it to be a good one; I sent the half-guinea by my daughter into the little room behind the shop, where a young woman was sitting of the name of

               <p>Q. Was the shilling he gave you the same shilling that you had given him? - A. I am perfectly sure it was not; I put the shilling which he gave me into my right hand, and collared him with my left hand; I told him he was a villain, that he was ringing the chatter with me, and desired two gentlemen that were standing by to take notice; the prisoner said, what are you going to do you must not throttle me; I told him I was going to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the person who was with him?- A. We left him with the basket; I led him down Token-house-yard, and as I was crossing Lothburg I heard some money rattle; a person who was behind me said, here is the money in the gulley-hole; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear what he said? - A. Yes; I looked into the gulley-hole and saw both gold and silver; I then sent to the Manslon-house for two officers, and held the prisoner at the spot till Mr. Canner came, and Mr. Dover came up at the same time; I requested them not to leave the money till they saw it taken up, and I took the prisoner to the Mansion-house; I gave Mr. Canner a shilling I had from the prisoner, first having marked it; I then returned to the gulley-hole, the grating was taken up, and the money delivered to Mr. Canner.</p>

I am a shoemaker on Fish-street hill: On a Saturday morning, I cannot say the day of the month, a person of the name of Bedson came to my house, I was out; he waited till I came home, and while I was talking with him, Bryce came in; Bedson had brought me some leather, as a sample, which I was looking at; it was dressed leather; I told them it was leather that was stolen out of Leadenhalf-market, that had come from Bristol; Bedson told me that Bryce had shewn him a letter which had come from a person of the name of Higgs, and that it was honestly come by - that Mr. Higgs had advanced money upon it; I said, I was sure it came in such a channel, that it was stolen, and that if I bought it, I ought to be hanged that moment, for I had transported one of my men the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. In January Sessions, on a Friday; I advised Bedson to have nothing to do with it, but to return the sample to Bryce, whom he said he had it of; I said, if it was ever so honestly come by, it would not suit me to purchase it, because it came to a considerable sum; Bryce said, I might pay twenty pounds in money, and the rest in bills; Bryce then said to Bedson, I will take it back again to where I had it; I have known Bedson some years, he is a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never understood from Bryce that this was his own leather? - A. I understood he had it from another person to sell for him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a bricklayer; I have known Mr. Bryce six or seven years: On the 16th of January, Mr. Bryce came to the Blue Anchor in East Smithfield, opposite to where I live; he called me out of the kitchen into the tap-room, where we were by ourselves; he told me he had got a quantity of leather to sell, and as I knew Mr. Mason, if I would go and ask him if he would buy it; Mr. Bryce represented to me that he had it from Mr.

            , whom I knew very well; Mr. Bryce said, he having been in the leather business before, Mr. Mason would not like to buy it of him, if it was ever so honestly come by - he had been taken up for some leather in the Borough, that was stolen sometime ago; I went to his house, and he took four skins out of a drawer in the counter, tied up in a handkerchief; I then went to Mr. Mason's with the skins; I waited till Mr. Mason came in, and he would not have any thing to do with them, and he advised me to have nothing to do with them; Mr. Bryce then came in; Mr. Mason told him he would not have any thing to do with them; and Mr. Bryce said he would not have any thing to do with them; the same evening, I saw Mr. Bryce standing at his door smoking his pipe; he called me over, and asked me if I know any body else; I mentioned Mr. Rowe to him, and he proposed my going to him; I went to Mr. Rowe on Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, without the sample; Mr. Bryce gave me the letter.(Mr. Knapp produced the letter, which was read, as follows;)</p>

               <p>15th Jan. 1801. J. HIGGS.</p>
               <p>Addressed Mr. W. Bryce, East Smithfield."</p>
               <p>Bedson. Mr. Bryce afterwards told me he had seen Mr. Rowe, and that he said he would buy it; I did not see him again till after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You delivered the sample to Bryce, and he said he would not have any thing more to do with it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mr. Higgs before? - A. Yes; and always considered him a very respectable man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not on account of the respectability of the Higgs's that you went both to Mason and Rowe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.After you knew it had been stolen, you offered it to Rowe? - A. I knew if it was stolen, Mr. Rowe, being a currier, would know it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you knew Bryce's character? - A. I understood from him, that Mr. Higgs had lent money upon this leather, and that the time was out; I knew him to be a pawnbroker about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Griffiths.) Q. How much leather did you find at Higgs's? A. Three hundred and fourteen pounds weight. (Produces a part of it.)</p>
               <p>Groom. These two skins of leather are of my own manufacture, and are Mr. Crawley's property.(Mr. Alley addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendants, Higgs's, and called six witnesses, who gave them an excellent character.)</p>
