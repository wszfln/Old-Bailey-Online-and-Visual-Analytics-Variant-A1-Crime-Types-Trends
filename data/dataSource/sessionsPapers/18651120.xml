               <p>his business would amount to some 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, at all events he mentioned some amount—I asked him if he would require to pay in any bills and to draw against those bills; he said he should—he said they would be bills that he received in the course of his trade—I asked him what the probable floating amount would be—he said some 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I referred him to the head manager, and the result was that an account was opened very shortly after that conversation; he was supplied with credit papers at the time—we have a printed form in which a customer places his name and specifies the amounts which he pays in to his credit; those papers are received by us when the amount is paid in—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the credit papers we issued—they are all in Taylor's handwriting—they represent the amounts paid in between certain dates, which are on the face of them—there are a good many bills represented by these papers, more than seventeen, among them are seventeen marked from B to R inclusive—they repre<lb/>sent in round numbers about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were paid in between April 6th and April 26th—every one of those bills has been dishonoured—the amount due to the bank by Taylor is about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the whole of that may be said to have been contracted within that period—it was created by his drawing cheques against the bills, he had value for them; we charge a com<lb/>mission at the end of the half year—when we take bills in the way we took them of Taylor we then charge the interest on the bills—no discount has been charged on the face of the account; he drew the money—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are the cheques, they were drawn between 6th and 26th April, some of them were paid subsequently—on 26th April I wrote this letter to him (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that no more bills of Taylor's would be negotiated by the Bank</hi>)—on the following day I received this answer—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "27th April, 1865.

I could not swear to him—on the second occasion he was ordered to stand up—I then said, "There was a man with him; I believe that man to be the prisoner Kelly"—I understood the best of my belief to be swearing; I am very positive now, and was so on the second examination.</p>

               <p>Kelly's; it was carried on under the name of Burgess and Co.—that was in consequence of a proposition from Nicholl to me—there was a conversation on the subject in the presence of Kell, to the effect that it must be carried on in the name of Burgess and Co., that Nicholl was a leather-seller, and it would prejudice him in his business, if he was known to be keeping a boot-shop—Nicholl mentioned to me the name of Brewer; that was in Kelly's presence: he said he was a respectable young man in their employ in Dean-street, that probably references would be required on account of an office that was going to be taken by him—the acceptances to these two bills marked "Q" and "R" are both in the handwriting of Farnham; they are signed "W. F. Brewer" in Farnham's writing, the man I was in the habit of seeing with Kelly, and have seen with Taylor—the signature to this agreement for the office, "William F. Brewer," is Farnham's writing—this letter is also Farnham's writing, it is signed "Frederick Reeves and Co." and headed "Langbourn Chambers"—this letter signed "W. Hamilton," dated from Langbourn Chambers, is also Farnham's writing, and this other also signed "T. K. Reeves and Co."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter of Covent-garden and Farringdon markets, it is my duty to mind the carts—on 20th October I was in Far<lb/>ringdon market and saw the beadle take Hatton in custody, the other two prisoners were with him, they were all talking together—they had a barrow and a bushel of onions—on Saturday 21st I saw them in Burleigh-street, Covent-garden, they had a barrow—I spoke to the beadle and he watched them with me—Hatton took a handkerchief out of his pocket and gave the others something out of it several times, and also to two other men—he was standing in a doorway three or four yards from me—the men then went to the market and were away ten minutes or quarter of an hour and came back with cabbages, turnips and flowers—I watched them from quarter past eight to ten—when they came back Hatton gave them something from the handkerchief again, and the four men went away again—when they saw the inspector they all ran away—I saw a constable coming in sight, and saw Hatton swallow two half-sovereigns; he also threw down a halfcrown which I picked up and gave to the beadle—I took Hatton to the station, he said, "Do not lock me up, it will not do you any good"—the barrow was taken to the station.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200016"/>
               <p>a search warrant signed by one of the Magistrates of Bow-street, to search for counterfeit coin, and asked him whether he had any in his possession—he hesitated and then said, "No."—I said, "You are entitled to have the warrant read to you if think proper"—he said, "There is no occasion, MR. Brannan."—West commenced searching him, and I went outside the bar with Fife to command a view of the inside—I afterwards returned to the prisoner and asked him whether there was a back way out of the premises—he said, "Yes" and I directed the officer to search the back yard—the prisoner entered the yard first, followed by West—I <hi rend="italic">took</hi> a lantern and saw West go to one closet and then to a second, when he put his hand between the rafters and the tiles and handed me seven packets—I opened one—it contained ten bad shillings, and West opened another—six of the packets contained ten shillings each, and one contained nine—when I opened the packets I said to the prisoner, "This is bad"—he said nothing—I then went outside the bar, and West and Ackrell went up<lb/>stairs with the prisoner—they did not search him till they returned down<lb/>stairs—they then searched the bar—there was an elderly female there, and I believe the prisoner's two daughters—one of them handed me a packet containing twelve fragments of counterfeit coin, old and discoloured—she said, "This we have taken in the way of trade"—I said, "Oh, very well"—Ackrell and Elliott searched a little closet behind the bar which she took the fragments from—I heard something drop—the female stood between me and the officers—Ackrell then handed me two bad shillings and Elliott three bad shillings—the females had no bonnets on—they were evidently behind the bar attending to the business—the middle-aged woman attempted to take a packet from Elliott's hand, but did not succeed—he handed it to me, and she said, "<hi rend="italic">Them</hi> were not there last Saturday fortnight when I cleaned out that place"—they were bad shillings—we all went back into the parlour, and the prisoner said, "Do they correspond in date with those you found in the privy?"—I looked at them, and said, "Yes, some of them"—he said, "Let me look at one of them"—I said, "Certainly, you shall have every indulgence"—he bit it in two; I produce the pieces—he was taken to the station—the coins were wrapped up separately in tissue-paper as counterfeit coin usually is.</p>

Brannan said, "Have you got a back yard?"—the prisoner went into the yard, and I followed him—Ackrell and Brannan followed us—it was about a quarter to seven o'clock—I had one of our lamps—I searched the closets—in the first I found nothing, but in the second I found seven parcels on the rafters—I saw them by turning on my light, and handed them down—I said, "Here is something looks bad here"—I unfolded one packet, and said, "You see, this is counterfeit coin"—the prisoner made no remark—I took him to a room while the house was searched by Brannan and Ackrell—nothing was found—we were up stairs, I should think, an hour and a half—we then came down into the bar, and Ackrell and Elliott searched the bar—while I had charge of the bar, standing by the parlour door, within the bar I could see Ackrell and Elliott, but could not see what they were doing—two hours or more were occupied—on the way to the station, the prisoner said that it was an unfortunate affair about the coin behind the bar; they had taken a great deal when he first came into business at that house, but he did not remember taking any lately—the charge was read at the station, and he wanted to know whether the dates of the coins found behind the bar corresponded with those found in the closets—we examined them, and Brannan told him that they did—I took some good silver from his pockets.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter out of employ—on 13th November, about 11.30 in the morning I saw the prisoner and another man near Westminster Abbey, going towards the bridge—they went on board a steamboat—I went on board with them, and got out at London-bridge—I followed them to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and the man not in custody went into a shop—I can't say whether it was a cigar-shop or a pastrycook's—the prisoner stood on the opposite side, by the General Post-office—when the other man came out he joined the prisoner—they went to Jewin-street, Aldersgate, where I saw the prisoner pass something to the other man—I was about 200 yards from them—I still followed them—the one not in custody went into a butcher's shop, in Noble-street—the prisoner remained outside—I went into the shop and spoke to the money-taker—they held one man and let the other man go—he went out of the shop, but in a different direction to where the prisoner was standing—I went out, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of Noble-street, but not in the same place as I had left the man not in custody—I went to him, and said that he was in company with a man who had just gone in—he said that he was a commercial traveller.</p>

               <p>and I had better mind what I was saying, as he would make me prove my words—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I followed to the station, and saw a tobacco-pouch drop from the right leg of his trousers, in Fore-street—I picked it up, and handed it to the constable at once—it was opened at the station—it contained five bad half-crowns, and four florins, with tissue-paper between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Royal George public-house—on 5th November I closed my house at five minutes to eleven, and went upstairs to the first floor—all the parties had not gone—I heard some gentlemen going out and asked them to remain till some parties outside had passed—I heard a rumbling at the door, and heard somebody say, "You have got my watch"—I opened the door and saw McCormack run away—the man who lost his watch cried out, "Murder," and was struggling with another man who I do not know in the road.</p>

I was on duty in George-street, Chelsea, about quarter past eleven, and saw Green held by Page, who gave him in custody to Benson, and charged him with stealing his watch—Page gave me a description of McCormack and I took him at half-past twelve at his father's, and took him to Page, who said, "That is the man."</p>

I am a professor of fencing and gymnastics—about ten minutes to eleven on Sunday night a person called my attention to a disturbance in George-street—I went there and saw Page holding Green by the collar—Page gave me a watch and said that he picked it up in the road while he had hold of Green—Green was given into my custody, but on the way to the station some one ran between him and me and separated us, and Green ran away—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief!" Sergeant Parkins of the B division ran round the corner of Union-street, knocked me into the road and Green escaped—I had seen him outside the Crown that Sunday evening I next saw him on the Tuesday night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 270) On the 20th of October, about a quarter to seven in the evening, I was on duty in the Euston-road, at the corner of Brook-street—it was just getting dark—I saw the prisoner driving a pony-cart at the rate of about seven miles an hour—he was whipping the pony—at the time he turned the corner an omnibus was passing, going towards paddington—the prisoner turned to the right, in the same direction—he continued whipping the pony, endeavouring to pass the</p>

               <p>omnibus—a female was crossing the road from the north side to the south, and the right shaft of the prisoner's part caught her in the side of the face, and knocked her down, and the wheels of the omnibus went over her—I assisted in picking her up, and put her in a cab and took her to the University Hospital—the prisoner had beep drinking, but I could not see that he was drunk.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see the woman attempt to cross? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first I saw of her was in the middle of the road—the omnibus was then about half a dozen yards from her—the omnibus was going at a moderate rate; I should say about four miles an hour—I did not notice the pony tumble—when he came out of Brook-street the omnibus was perhaps half a dozen yards behind, and it gradually got in front of the cart—the cart then came slowly after it and got in front of it, and the prisoner commenced whipping his horse again—at the time the accident happened the omnibus horses were close to the back of the cart, almost touching—there were a great many vehicles passing up and down the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an omnibus driver, and live at 18, Vincent-terrace, Islington—on the 20th October I was driving an omnibus in the Euston Road, from a quarter to ten minutes to seven in the evening—I saw the deceased on the opposite side of the road, about to cross—she crossed behind a railway van which was coming down on the opposite side to me—I was going to Brompton—the prisoner's pony and cart came by me rather sharp, and instead of keeping in the middle of the road, he kept whipping his pony to come on the near side, and he very nearly hit my horses in going by—he was going at the rate of from six to seven miles an hour—it was not going at that pace all along, but by his whipping the pony it made a spring just there, and the woman was knocked down—she would have got out of my way if she had not been knocked down.</p>

Medlock before—that was the reason he paid cash—the prisoner never paid me money received from a Mr. Williamson, or from a Mr. Harris, that I know of—if he did they are entered in the books—I know the name of Poyle—I have no recollection of his paying me three guineas in August, or in July 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from a Mr. Collier—ha paid Poyle's money, there is no doubt about that—I don't find the amount of 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in July in the books—I find an amount, on 29th July, of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 17th 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. both received from the prisoner—he gave us no name—I saw Mr. Poyle, and I found that he had paid the prisoner a cheque, but that cheque he never brought us—he paid us the money—I really cannot tell you whether it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot find any other sum paid by Poyle—there is an entry in the day-book of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 21st. August, placed to Messrs. Medlock and Ellis' debit, and on that day the prisoner received that amount and did not pay it in—if it had been paid, it would have been entered in the ready-money book, not in this book at all—he has paid several sums on account of Spinks and Sons—I don't see the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the books paid by Spinks in September—I can't say whether he paid it—I don't know the name of Gibbs—there is no entry here of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Gibbs—I cannot swear that he did not, in July, pay me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Baker, but if he did, I think it would be entered here—Mr. Jacques is here—the prisoner has increased our business, no doubt, ft little—i imagine it was by means of his own connection—we have not opened accounts with his customers, because we do not know them sufficiently—what be has done has been more a ready-money trade—I never heard before we gave him into custody that he had gone to Mr. Rawlins and requested him not to give us credit for goods—such a thing was never intimated—I know Mr. Rawlins quite well—he is a customer—we had goods delivered last week by him—we buy of him—he did not come to our place two or three days before the prisoner left and say that he had requested him not to trust us with goods—some time before the prisoner left I told him that we could not afford to give him that salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I never heard before I gave him into custody that he was going into some other employment—he has paid me as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and it has been entered by our book-keeper, "from McNeilly 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." for so many watches, without giving the names of the persons to whom the watches were sold—when he came home, on 21st August, he gave this account, "six silver</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Messrs. Chaplin and Home, the railway carriers, and have an office in Billingsgate Market—on Thursday morning, the 2nd of November, at about half-past 9 I saw the two prisoners—I was standing at my window—there was a van of Messrs. McNamara's nearly opposite—Rains had charge of it—he was delivering boxes of fish to the porters—I saw him deliver three to Blackburn—the boxes had the letter "M" upon them—there was a cart standing near the pavement, and he put these boxes in it—shortly afterwards Rains delivered to Blackburn two more boxes, marked with the figure "8"—Blackburn turned the boxes upside down, and threw a sack over them—and as soon as be had done that he put his hands in the pockets of his "smock" and walked away—I went and looked at the cart, and found it had the name of Grisley on it, some<lb/>where down by Bow—I then told one of Mr. McNamara's clerks what I had seen—the herrings were found afterwards, but not in the cart—while I was looking from my window, Rains was delivering boxes to some porters on the other side of the van—the van would hold, I should think, about 300 boxes—the porters receiving on one side of the van could not see what was going on on the other—Blackburn had his boxes from the side where the regular porters were not working—I have known Blackburn about fourteen years—he is a porter there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. McNamara—on Thursday, the 2d of November, Rains had charge of one of our vans at Billingsgate-market—that van was laden with two dozen boxes of herrings, which were to be delivered at the market—it was his duty to deliver them—those marked "M" were to be delivered to Mr. Dearsley, and those marked with the letter "8" to Mr. Jex—he had no authority to deliver them to anybody else—I received some information from Mr. Woodgate, and in consequence of that Blackburn was brought into our office—I afterwards saw five boxes of herrings—they were delivered to me from Mr. Grisley's cart—three of them were marked "M" and two "8"—the "M's" were Mr. Dearsley's and the "8's" Mr. Jex's, and they ought to have been delivered to them—I know nothing of Blackburn, only as a porter working in the market—after I had got the boxes, I asked Rains how he had delivered his load, and whether he had delivered any to anybody but the regular men—he said no, he had not, he did not know anything about it—I asked him to come from the van into the office to see if he had delivered any to Blackburn—Black<lb/>burn</p>

               <p>was in the office, but he objected to come and identify him—I do not think he has been in our employ long, but he has been delivering at Billings-Bate for the last three or four weeks every day—we generally deliver a great quantity to Mr. Dearsley, he is a very large salesman—and to Mr. Jex too—MR. Harris, one of our clerks, asked Blackburn to change his clothes—he Bid this in order that a boy who had seen him might identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Red Lion public-house, Covent-garden—the prisoner had been courting me for some years prior to this transaction—the courtship ceased three weeks before this occurred; I broke it off—on the evening of 12th October I was in company with the witness White, coming towards my home—when within a short distance of it, I saw the prisoner—he came up to me, and said he wanted to speak to me—he said, "Have you been to my cousin's?"—I said no—he then said, "You must go now"—I said, "I will not go"—he said, "You will"—I said, "I won't"—with that he pulled a razor out of his pocket and shewed it to me—I said, "Miss White, for God's sake fetch your uncle"—while she ran to fetch her uncle, Mr. Loder, the prisoner took hold of me and dragged me across the road and threw me down, and then taking the razor out of his pocket, he commenced cutting me across my face, and said he would do for me—I said nothing to him, but I tried to hit him with my umbrella when he threw me—before he commenced cutting me, I said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, don't kill me, for the sake of my poor mother"—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

I live at the Red Lion public-house, Covent-garden—I recollect going towards home on the evening of 12th October with the last witness—when we were near home I saw the prisoner, he came up to the prosecutrix and caught hold of her, and said, "I want to speak to you"—he tried to pull her away from me, and he asked her if she had been to his cousin's—she said No—he said, "You shall go with me now"—she said "I</p>

               <p>will not"—he caught hold of her again, and then he drew what looked to me like a sharp-bladed knife from his pocket and said, "If you don't go with me I will cut my throat"—he then put it back in his pocket again, and caught hold of her again, and tried to drag her away. She said, "You will let me go in first, and I will go" (meaning to his cousins)—he said, "You shall not go in"—he pulled the knife, as I thought, out of his pocket again, and put it back a second time—he then caught bold of her, and pulled her away from me, from the Bedford Hotel up to the corner of the piazza—where he first spoke to her was just opposite the Bedford Hotel, about a stone's throw from the Red Lion—we were coming from St. Martin's-lane, towards Russell-street—he dragged her about two or three yards—he did not appear to be at all excited, not when he first spoke to her, or afterwards; he seemed very cool indeed—I ran for assistance, and did not see what happened after<lb/>wards.</p>

I am barman at the Red Lion public-house—I recollect Miss White running into the Bed Lion on the night in question—from what she said to me, I ran up to the piazza—I saw the prisoner knock Miss Jennings down—when I got to him be had got his left arm round her neck, and the razor in his right hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was sawing at her throat—I knocked him on the muscle of the right arm, in which he held the razor, and knocked the razor out of his hand—he got up, and looked at me in the face, and said, "D—n and blast you"—I afterwards picked the razor up, and took it to Bow-street.</p>

Davies said, "I have to give my master a week's notice to leave, and my time is up on Monday, and the ship will start on Monday night at 6 o'clock;" and he said, "My master got me another place in the City;" I said to him," Why don't you go to that place until the spring, and then we will go away together, I don't care about going now; it is the wrong time of year?" but he said, "Uncle says it is the right time to go now;" and Davies said, "I have paid seven pounds deposit, and I told the man I was called White, and you Adams;" I said to him, "My name is Dymond, that you know;" "Yes," he said, "I know, but uncle said I was not to let father or mother know anything about it, for mother would break her poor heart if she knew."</p>

Edwards was with her, and they insisted upon seeing the contents of the cases—I objected to it, and Mr. Edwards took the law in his own hands and wrenched one or two of the cases open—Mrs. Moore then discovered that some things were missing, and she complained very much of missing things—I was only given to under<lb/>stand they were her property by herself and Mr. Edwards; they gave me strong injunctions not to let the property go out of the place, but I could deliver it to no other person than Haynes, and I hold property now in the warehouse in the name of Haynes.</p>

On Sunday night, 27th October, I was on duty in Old Nichol-street—there was a quarrel among some women, and I went up to them, and advised them to go home quietly—one of them said, "You b—sod, you knocked me about the other night"—she held out her arm—I turned to look at it, and saw the prisoner Smith on the other side of the road—he crossed, and struck me a violent blow on the side of my bead with a life-preserver or a stick—it penetrated my helmet, and bent the rim—I fell from the blow—Smith ran away; I got up and followed him about twenty yards—when I had got about two yards from him, he turned round and struck me in the front of my forehead, with the same instrument, I believe—I closed with him, and in the struggle we both fell—while he was struggling on the ground, Dean came up, and struck me on the legs and body with something like a poker, while Lewis kicked me violently on the fingers, elbows, and body—I became excited from loss of blood, and they all three got away—some civilian came up, and I was assisted to the station by him and a constable, and was attended by Dr. Phillips, the divisional surgeon—I afterwards went with Sergeant Savage and other constables, to 1, New Nichol-street, Lewis's house—that is the next street to Old Nichol-street—I knew the prisoners before, and had seen them together</p>

               <p>—the assault was ten or twenty yards from that house—we found Lewis there in bed—I told him I should charge him with assaulting me—he said, "I know nothing about it, I have been in bed ever since seven o'clock"—a lad that was in bed with him, said that his father had been in bed all the afternoon as he was tipsy—Lewis was taken to the station—I knew where Dean lived—I think it is 21, Old Nichol-street, thirty or forty yards off—we went there and found him—I said that I wanted him for assaulting me that night—he said, "I know nothing about it; I was at King's Cross at eleven o'clock" I searched the room and found this poker between the bed and mattress—I made inquiries after Smith the same night, but I knew where he lived, as I had seen him go there with Lewis—a constable found him—I have seen the prisoners altogether as companions at two beer-shops in New Nichol-street, but not much in the day time.</p>

On the morning of 31st October, about twenty minutes to 12, I was in Shoreditch—I had had information which caused me to look for Smith, and I saw him walking down the street—I followed him, saw him go into a draper's shop, and waited till he came out—he then went back as far as Church-street, which leads into Old Nichol-street—I went round and met him in Cross-street, close to Old Nichol-street—I said, "You must consider yourself in my custody for assaulting Cowley, 160, in Old Nichol-street, on Sunday-night"—he said, "Do you know who I am?"—I said, "Yes, by the description I have received you are the man; you will have to go to the police-station with me"—he drew himself up and bolted forward, calling out, "<hi rend="italic">Rouse, rouse</hi>," which means rescue—a large number of his companions ran out of the Garibaldi and Prince of Wales beer-shops, and Prickett ran up to me and struck me a blow on the back of the head with a large stick about two feet long—it knocked me down and stunned me for a moment—I bled and was senseless for a moment—I got up again and was struck by a large stone or brick on the side of my head, which knocked me down again apparently insensible for a moment or two—while in the act of rising, I drew my truncheon, but Smith snatched it from my hand and struck me two very severe blows across the head, (my helmet had been knocked off by the first blow)—I became smothered in blood—my cape is covered with it now, and it is also torn—Smith was very violent; he threw himself under two or three carts—Law came to my assistance and laid hold of Smith by the arm—he was very violent, threw himself down, tore his coat-sleeve, and got away—after we got to Church-street he threw himself under two carts—there was a great mob—they were flinging stones and sticks at me and Law—we were then the only two constables with Smith—Law caught him again on the other side of a cart, and he was very violent, and threw himself down a great number of times under some carts in Church-street, where he knocked himself about a great deal in his endeavours to get away—a very large mob still pursued us crying, "Kill the police"—I heard Prickett say, "Do not let the b—s take him like that"—he said that in Cross-street and Church-street and Club-row, till he was taken in custody himself—with a great deal of difficulty we got Smith into Club-row, and constables Allingham and Smith came to our assistance after a long period—I did not notice Crockett at all—when Smith got to the station he had some wounds—I believe the biggest part of them were done under the cart—I am sure Prickett is the man who struck</p>

Where did you first see Smith in Shore-ditch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just off Newman's-passage, two or three hundred yards from where I apprehended him—I had not time to take him in Shoreditch—he was on one side, and I was on the other—I did not go over and take him, on account of the busses and carts—I did not cross the street in Shoreditch—he crossed over and came to Church-street—I did not take him then because I had not the chance—a large number of his companions ran out—I knew that by seeing him speak to them—I do not think I said that before the Magistrate, for I was in such a state that I was hardly able to stand in the witness-box—I was struck twice by Smith with my own truncheon—Prickett also struck my head—that might have made me senseless for the moment, but I came to myself—I was then struck with a brick on the side of the head, and fell senseless—I was senseless twice for a moment, but not for half an hour, because I know the time I got to the station—I assisted Smith to the station—I did not say that I was assisted by my brother con<lb/>stable to the station; those are Mr. Wontner's words—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated</hi>: "I was assisted away by my brother constable"—I told the Magistrate's clerk he had made a mistake—he corrected it, and it was put down here, at the bottom of my evidence (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"I did not say I was assisted away, but that I assisted the other constable in taking Smith")—MR. Wontner addressed the Magistrate, and commented upon the feet that I was assisted away by my brother constable, and when the clerk read my deposition over, I corrected it—Law came up before I received any blows—I know that there are summonses against me and Law for excess of duty, but I have not seen any for attempting to murder Smith, nor have I heard witnesses ex<lb/>amined on such a summons—I heard witnesses examined for the defendant at the police-court—I heard Hall, a cab-proprietor, examined—Law and I did not lay hold of Smith by the collar on each side—I cannot say whether Smith had a parcel and an umbrella in his hand—Law had hold of him, but I had not hold of him at the same time—we were not bitting him over the head with our staves—I never saw him put up his arms to save his head—we did not drag him towards the cab, striking him all the while—I never saw him struck on the head—after the surgeon was examined yesterday, I knew that Smith had eleven wounds on his head, but I never saw him struck on the head—he did not fall down against a cab—I did not see Law drag him up against a butcher's shop—it was near a butcher's at the corner of Cross-street that he struck me on the head with my staff—I did not see Law hit Smith on the head near the butcher's, or see him fall as if he was dead—one of us did not fell on top of him, that I am aware of—I never saw him fall, but I saw him down at different times—he was on the pavement by the butcher's shop, but whether he fell or threw himself down I do not know—he did not seem to be quite insensible—I did not see one of the policemen beat him on the head, and on different parts of his body—the butcher did not say, "For God's sake do not murder the man, but secure him"—no one offered to assist us to take him, they tried to get him away—some one, I believe, went to get some water—I suppose they fetched it for Smith—I did not strike Smith on the bead with my truncheon after the water was got—I heard no one cry '"Shame!"—Smith did not put his head under a costermonger's barrow; he flung himself under an apple-stall—Law and I did not then run round to the other side of the barrow and hit him on the</p>

I came up to my brother officers at the Church-street end of Club-row—I saw Ingram and Law holding Smith, who was doing nothing at that time, but there was a mob of 150 or 200 people, who prevented their getting on—they were yelling and vowing vengeance against the police—I saw Prickett there—he said, "Don't let the b—s take him"—the mob were pressing so close to my brother constables, that I took out my staff, as they could not move—I turned my back to their backs, and kept the mob at bay, within arm's length, in a small circle—they all this time continued pushing, and endeavouring to close up—other constables afterwards came up—one or two of them assisted in keeping the mob back—I saw a stone and a stick thrown from a window in Club-row—the stone struck one of the constables on the shoulder; it was nearly as large as my fist, there was a great deal of excitement, and I was excited in the mob, and can't tell exactly—other stones were thrown, but not until we got further towards the station—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> continued—other stones were thrown in Anchor-street, and in the railway arch, and after we got through the railway arch—I saw Crockett throw one stone after we got through the railway arch—I cannot say whether it hit anyone—I caught hold of him and another stone dropped from his hand at his feet—another constable and I kept hold of him, and then he went quietly to The station—I was with them all up to the time Smith was taken to the station—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> continued right to the corner of Peabody's buildings, which is close to the station.</p>

I live at 47, Bethnal-green-road—on 31st October, I was in Hall's cab, going to the hospital with my son—the cab was stobbed by a waggon at the corner of Cross-street—there was a cart on the other side—I saw two policemen some distance down the street—they had a man between them that had a very small parcel under his arm—they had it dreadful fight—the two policemen be at him at once—I do not know the man—he was not fighting with the two constables, because a policeman who had him by the collar with his right hand, beat him on the front of his head with his left, and the other policeman, the tallest one, beat him on the back of his head rapidly with his staff, but did not lay hold of him—in the five minutes the cab was detained I should think they struck him ten or twelve times, but I begged the driver to turn the cab, so that I should not see it—they came towards the cab—I could not say whether the prisoner fell or whether they pushed him down, but he" was down on the ground by the grocer's—there was a window broken—they dragged him into the middle of the road, and then he appeared to get foot-hold—he was close against the cab, I could have touched his head—he got up, and the shortest policeman dragged him towards the pavement again, and the tall policeman put up his arm and staff with great violence, I bid my face in my handkerchief and heard a blow—the people shrieked most violently, and the man halloaed as if in pain—there were many people there; they came up against the cab when he got a foothold, he had a wound on his head an inch and a half or two inches long—there was a butcher's shop near—I did not hear what the people shrieked out, but the prisoner screamed out from the treatment he was receiving—I saw blood on him.</p>

I am a butcher, of 19, Church-street, Shoreditch, two doors from the Church-street end of Cross-street—Cross-street has only four houses on each side—it is only about twice the length of this Court from Church-street to Old Nichol-street—on Tuesday morning, 31st October, I was in front of my shop—I have a place there where I stand outside—I saw some people running towards Cross-street from each side of the way—I saw a man struggling with two officers, and as they came to the front of my shop he fell to the ground, and while he was on the ground the two officers repeatedly struck him, one on the head and the other on the lower parts of the body—I went to them and said, "For God's sake, do not murder the man, secure him, or call for further help"—the tallest officer flourished his staff over the prisoner and said, "Get out of the way"—the policeman's back was towards me—the man was all over blood and mud—by appearance he had been rolling in the mud, and his head was bleeding in more than one place—I did not take much notice whether the constables were calm and collected, because when I had told them not to murder the man, I went into my shop—the man had regained his feet, and the people had gathered round him—the constables were taking it very quietly, but they seemed very much to aim at knocking the man about, they were not more excited than other people would be under such circumstances—the man got on his feet—I left my shop, went to the corner of Club-row, and saw him on the ground, and three or four females round him—to the best of my belief they were trying to get his watch from him—the policeman told them to get away—the man asked for a drink of water, and the women all rushed away directly to get the water—as he turned round to ask for the water, the short policeman hit him on the head with his staff, and he fell senseless—he was standing before that, leaning against the policeman—the people all screamed out, "They have murdered him," and I felt so sick I was obliged to turn away—I cannot say how many blows were struck.</p>

He held up his staff, and said, "Stand back" I said, "Why do not you put him in a cab and take him properly?" He said, in a rough manner, "Will you help us to take him?" as much as to say, What is that to do with you? While I was looking at the shameful manner in which they were dragging him along four more policemen came up. I should not have stopped if I had done anything, but Law said, "Take that long fellow; he has thrown a piece of stick at me;" it was about twice the length of a piece of firewood, and would not have weighed an ounce. I did not throw it, but I saw it hit him. I said, "I look as if I had been throwing things, don't I?" I have a brother-in-law a constable, and I knew what I should get if I resisted them. Smith's head was cut about shamefully, and everybody said, "You</p>

And Law said, "Yes; when you get there you will not have a word to say for yourself. When I got to the station, he said that I had struck him over the head with a stick. I said, "What sort of a stick?" He said, "A short walking stick." It is all false, they try to make out that I am a companion of thieves, but I work hard for my living and can prove it. I could not stand seeing the man knocked about like that and could not help speaking. I do not associate with any body about there, I have been in prison a fortnight, and they have had too much time to hatch up their lies. When they got me to the station they thought I was a man named Long Hunt, a hawker, and they accused me of being a hawker, they now want to patch up their case by saying they know me to be the companion of this man, which is false.</p>

At 11 o'clock, on 31st October, the prisoner and thirty other sailors were outside the German Flag public-house in St. George's-street quarrelling—I told them to go away—the prisoner would not; he was drunk—I took hold of him and he struck me with his fist, and then drew a knife, opened it, and struck at my face with it—I struck his arm aside, and caught him by the collar—the sailors dragged us both into the house—another constable came to my assistance, and we took him to the station.</p>

There were eight or nine men outside the door; when I came out they flew at me and struck me; they knocked him and made a hole in his head, then he got up and took a knife out of his pocket; his shipmates came and dragged me out of the public-house; then the policeman came up and took me.</p>

He was so completely stunned, as well as injured, that he was not able to see anything about it, and the parties who were kind enough to see him attended to say they never saw it. It contains shirts, brushes, &amp;c. Your attention to this will oblige, yours respectfully, J. L. Worth.")—("Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey, 24/6/65. Sir, some few days ago I wrote you from Islington in respect to my brother's package, which has not come to hand; and as I am down at his house, they have requested me to apply again. He is still too ill from the effects of the accident to be able to see to matters himself, although somewhat better. If you have found it, will you please send it at your earliest convenience to be left at the Sunningdale Station. The accident has been a serious matter to him, as well as to other persons, but I hope he will get over it, although from the severe shock, he will never be the same man again. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, G. L. Worth")—("Prospect Cottage, Lightwater, near Bagshot, Surrey: Sir,—Your letter being sent to Islington, instead of here, has caused extra delay, but I beg to state that this being a scattered district you had better say "Immediate" on any letter you may send, as sometimes they are kept over for a day or two if they have not many this way. The nearest way to come here is either to Black-water or Sunningdale, from either place between five and six miles, as my brother's property joins Chobham-common, but is in Windlesham parish, about two miles and a half from Bagshot In the confusion when first wrote, I forgot to say, that in addition to the articles mentioned, a photograph of my relative's wife, with a number of private letters, were also in the parcel, which he hopes may yet be found. He is advised to go to Leamington, to his sister's, for further change, if able to go, but I cannot go with him before Monday. With regard to compensation for this matter, he wishes me to say that you can either do it with him or with his legal adviser, but he wants what is reasonable and fair between all parties, and if you think it can be amicably arranged for). he will agree to that, although he is sure he will be all that out of pocket. Your obedient servant, G. L. Worth.")—("Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey. 6/7/65: Sir, Yours of the 3rd has just arrived at the time I was writing one to you, as my brother is getting out of all patience about his missing articles, and being in a very weak state is exceedingly fidgety. He has desired me to state that he named so low a sum in the last letter in order that no delay might arise, and legal proceedings be unnecessary, and I find his friends here blame him very much for saying anything like so small an amount, for it appears that he is not likely to be the man he was before the accident. The name of the medical man is Mr. Stewart, (successor to Mr. Blunt), who resides at the 'Folly,' Windlesham, Bagshot, Surrey, to whom you can communicate. My brother cannot be removed at present, but he is anxious to have his letters and a photograph, as well as his clothes, if possible; and as he thinks, poor fellow, that he will be able to go to his relatives at</p>

I therefore trust you will arrange matters so as to prevent his sending up to town for his solicitor, as I urged him to name a small sum to avoid law if possible. I am, Sir, yours truly, J. L. Worth.")—("12/7/1865. Prospect House, Lightwater, Bagshot, Surrey. Sir,—My brother again requests me to write you about his package, and desires me to say that unless he receives a satisfactory reply ho will place it out of his hands altogether, as he cannot help thinking the package would have been found if attention had been paid to it in the first instance, and the letters are of importance to him, as one in particular is a letter of acknowledgment for money of some amount, and therefore of importance to him. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, G. L. Worth <hi rend="italic">per</hi> J. F. Worth. N. B. Of course I am compelled to write what he tells me, as he is exceedingly nervous and excited at times. Do pray get it settled, as I am sure delay makes him worse. J. L. Worth")—("The Folly, West End, Chobham, Surrey. 29th July, 1865. John Adams, Esq.: My dear Sir,—Your letter being wrongly addressed, and my temporary absence, has caused some delay. Mr. John Worth has sustained injury to his head and shoulder, but is much better, although the shock has had a somewhat serious effect upon his system, which will require months to overcome. No danger need now be apprehended, but at first I deemed it advisable to have him kept perfectly quiet and away from most of his friends. Very faith-fully yours, C. J. Stewart.")</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 217). About half-past 12 on Saturday night, 12th November, I was on duty in Commercial-street, Ro<lb/>therhithe, and took the prisoner and another foreigner into custody for being drunk and disorderly and insulting several people; the other had a stick and the prisoner had a stone, but he threw it away before I got up to him—they were calling people names, and saying what they could not do, in a sort of sneering way—it was said in broken English, I could hardly understand them—I was taking them to the station, but I could not get them on, and I sprang my rattle, and Reed came to my assistance—I asked him to take the prisoner for me—he did so, and took him along—I took the other—as Reed was taking him along the prisoner let a knife drop from his sleeve, and aimed at his breast—a button turned it off—he then made a second attempt and put the knife in Reed's left thigh and ran away—I let go of the man I had, and ran and took the prisoner in custody—he drew the knife at me—I had a stick in my hand that I had taken from the other Italian, and I knocked him down, and he threw the knife away—a green-grocer, who lived close by, picked it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a dagger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 5, Queen-street, Hackney-road—on this Saturday night, about half-past 12, I was in Commercial-street, Rotherhithe—the springing of a rattle attracted my attention—I went up, and the policeman had the prisoner and another Italian in custody—he asked me to take the prisoner from him, which I did, by taking him by the collar, as we were going up the street he drew this dagger from his sleeve, and made an attempt to stab me in the breast, but a button on my coat turned it, and he then stabbed me in the thigh—I am sure it was the prisoner who stabbed me, not the other Italian—I did not see what he did with the knife—he ran away, and the constable after him—I was taken to the station, and a doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am a surgeon—I was called to the station, and found the prosecutor and prisoner lying on benches, both wounded and bleeding—I said, "Which is the most serious case for me to attend to first?" The inspector directed me to attend to the prosecutor—he was quite blanched from loss of blood, in fact the quantity of blood was so great that the place smelt like a slaughter-house—his trousers were completely matted with blood, and his boot and stocking—I directed them to be taken off, and took a sponge and cleansed the wound—the bleeding had then ceased—I dressed the wound—I did not ascertain its depth—it must have been either deep, or some large artery was wounded—the wound was just about the size which this knife would make—I then attended to the prisoner—he had a wound on the head such as a stick would make.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I know nothing about it—I was very drunk, and could not be able to stab anybody; besides, I had. no knife—being a foreigner I have nobody to speak for me, if I was in my own country I could have plenty.</p>
