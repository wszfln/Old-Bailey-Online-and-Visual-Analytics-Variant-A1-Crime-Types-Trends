                  </hi>. I am a carman of 18, Little Windmill Street—on 28th November, about 11.30 I was in an omnibus—there were other passengers when I got in, mostly females—the prisoner and another man got in at the Minories and sat opposite me—they conversed together—the omnibus pulled up at the Royal Exchange and all the passengers rose to get out—as. Wilcox was going out he placed his hands across the door and said to the conductor "Are you going to Putney?"—the two prisoners were before me and I was behind Cooper who said "I want to go to Putney"—the inside of the omnibus was dark, because the door was thrown open and thrown back—as Cooper did not move I pushed him rather roughly, saying, "Go on mate"—I then felt a sudden pull at my waistcoat, looked down and saw my gold watch in Cooper's hand—the chain still held; it went in at one button hole and out at another—I called out "Police! he has got my watch"—he attempted to get out by slipping his hand under Wilcox's arm and then Wilcox lowered his arm to prevent my following—we all three fell into the road and Wilcox dropped the watch and tried to escape—it then hung by the chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lock-keeper of the City Road Basin, in the service of the Regent's Canal Company—on 28th October I was on duty at 10.45 when the prisoner's barge <hi rend="italic">Oose</hi> came down the basin—a lot more barges were waiting to go through the lock—it was too dark for me to see whether the prisoner was in charge, and it was on the low level, but who<lb/>ever was on board was trying to force it forward out of its turn—I ordered it back, and it stopped till between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was the only person on duty—when I ordered it back the person I addressed used very bad hnguage to me—the prisoner and a woman then came down the towing path and crossed by the gates; the prisoner then hallooed out to the man at the cabin end of his boat "Won't the b----let you through?"—the answer was "No"—he then said to the woman "Mary, open the gate, and I will pull in"—that was the lock gate—I asked him if he had got any order to pull in—he said "I will pull in for either you or your b----master"—I went up to him with my lantern, and held it up to his face to see who he was, and saw it was the prisoner—he threw the <hi rend="italic">bite</hi> of his rope round me, that is the centre of it, and dropped it just at the calves of my</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brompton, in Northampton shire—I drive the horses for the barges—I was by the lock when the prisoner's boat was close to a Northampton boat, which went in—there was room in the lock for the prisoner's boat as well, but the door was slammed by the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> along with the Northampton boat—Hibbert then came out, and the order was for the prisoner's boat to shove back and Allen Hall did so—he went back, I dare say 10 yards, and lay alongside the ice wharf—two barges then came up and were let in before the prisoner's barge, and he came with his wife and complained, and he threw me off the tack steering—his wife opened the outside gate and he pulled the boat into the lock, and Hibbert ran up to him and struck at, him with his bull's-eye lautern—I was not 10 yards away—he did not strike him, but the prisoner shoved him back, and his heel caught a stump which they tie barges to, and he fell into the lock—I know what a bull's-eye is—it was a bull's-eye lautern—he catched his heel against the strapping stump, which is a piece of wood in the ground with iron round it to which barges are tied—when Hibbert fell into the lock, Jones put the rope round him, and under the boat cloths, and pull him into the boat—Scott then called out "Shut the gate"—the wife shut the gate, and they called out "Draw up"—he said "I shall not draw up until I know how the man's legs are"—the lock-keeper ran round and drew the paddles up and let the water in, and another <hi rend="italic">chap drawed</hi> it up—Jones did not use no bad lauguage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That is as true as the rest of my story—I was not 10 yards from Jones when the lantern was pushed at him—this was in the dark, it was 12.30 at night—Jones did not throw a rope round Hibbert, when he was on the land—the rope did not catch him round the calves, it was a very gentle push that Jones gave, and Hibbert walked back and caught his heel and feel into the lock.</p>

I live at Northampton—I worked on the same boat as the prisoner, and was in charge of the baat on this night; the prisoner and his wife were away—I came up to the lock with another boat and tried to follow it into the lock—I hallooed to them to stop the boat, but they would not, and I gave the lock-keeper my pass, but he told me to shove back and would not let me in—there was room for me—that was Edwards—he put me back for about two hours—two barges went through before me—I</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner and his wife come across the lock bridge—only two barges passed through in that time—the prisoner said "Won't they let you through?"—I said "No"—he said "Give me a rope and I will pull you in"—I did so and he pulled into the lock—he kept hold of the rope, and while he was holding it Hibbert came up and struck him with the lamp—he put his hand up to save the blow, tumbled over the strapping stump and fell into the lock—I was in the stern of the boat; I ran round and helped to get him out—the prisoner helped also, he jumped from one side of the lock to the other over the water to get him out, but I could not do so; I had to run round—he did not jump from one side of the lock to its other side, but from the lock into the boat—Hibbert was pulled into the boat, and we rose the water and landed him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not give this evidence before the Magistrate—it was very dark—the prisoner used no bad language, not a word—he was struck a heavy blow in the face with the lantern, upon which he put out his hand, and Hibbert walked backwards, and tumbled into the lock.</p>

I am a chemist and druggist at 6, Store Street, Bedford Square—on two occasions the prisoner has passed bad money at my shop, a bad florin on one occasion and a bad shilling on the other—the florin was given to the constable—on the second occasion I saw the prisoner across the road receive something from some one, and he came into my shop and tendered a bad 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I tested the coin with nitrate of silver, which turned it black.</p>

It is not because the coin was black that it is not good; I am inflicted with a wound in the thigh, and have been in the prosecutor's shop several times. A child of six years of age would not go a second time if he knew he had done wrong; the young gentleman I spoke to across the road gave me the ls., and he said he had wished he had a thousand of them. Unfortunately he is in Wales, or he would be here to prove that the ls. was good. Another thing they have not produced the ls., my sight is very bad; I might take a piece of lead for a ls., not knowing it to be counterfeit.</p>

The case cited does not govern this case: a conspiracy feloniously to steal is obviously an offence, although the word 'unlawfully' does not precede the word 'conspire.'

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Messrs.

I came to work on the morning of the 6th November, about 4.35—while I was waiting a policeman came up, and he and I were let in by Sandford; we went through the outer warehouse—I made the observation that the gas was not alight; Sandford replied "You need not trouble about it," as I was late—he had a lantern in his hand—I left him and the policeman together, and as I was going away Sandford said I need not light the fires, for he would be down in a few minutes—I then went down to where Matthews was, and Sandford came down in about ten minutes.</p>

I was housemaid to Mrs. Flynn, of 22, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall—the prisoner Slowgrove was cook in her employment and was about to leave on 27th November, according to notice—Mrs. Flynn searched her box in my presence, and everything in it belonged to Miss Flynn—a constable was sent for, but Slowgrove was not given in charge that night—after the constable left, on opening the box a second time, a silk dress of Mrs. Flynn's was found it—Jennings was a frequent visitor to Slowgrove, and on a subsequent day I saw a pencil taken out of Jennings' pocket, which was mine, and which I had missed when I went for my holiday in August, from a drawer in my bedroom.</p>

On Monday morning, 30th November, I went with Odear to Mrs. Flynn's house about 12 o'clock, and from information I received from her I went to Queen Street, Oxford Street, where I found the prisoners in bed—I told Slowgrove I was going to take her in custody for stealing the property from Suffolk Street—she said that she knew all about it—Jennings went to the station with us—I searched the place and found thirty-eight composite candles, a lace fall, some dress trimmings, and other articles—on arriving at the station I told Jennings that I wanted him to go to Should ham Street with me—he did so, and pointed to No. 20, in the parlour of which house a box was handed to me containing the articles in this bag, four toilet covers, two chemises, a plated cream jug, six forks, two trays, four knives, a marrow spoon, a plated butter knife, a window blind, some snuffers, a salt spoon, and a knife sharpener—I left him there and he was afterwards taken in custody.</p>

On 30th November I met Jennings in Shouldham Street, and told him I should take him for being concerned with Slowgrove in stealing articles from Suffolk Street, Pall Mall—he said "Very well, I thought it would come to that, the things were given me by Slowgrove to take away to my brother, because when the place was looked over I did not want them to be pulled about, as they were the property of my father"—I searched them at the station and found this pencil case, which is identified by Miss Finch—last Tuesday evening I went with Pickles to Queen Street and found this bag—there were some aprons and chemises in it.</p>

I am the wife of George Hiscock, of 4, Gloucester Road, Kew—I have known the prisoner about four years—I saw him wearing a pin like this between two and three years ago—at that time my husband kept a wine-house at the corner of Rose Street, Long Acre—I remember his bringing it into the kitchen in his hand; he used to come there to have his dinner—we left there two years ago next January, and then went to live at Kew—I have seen him wearing it on several occasions since that—it had a small ticket on it when he brought it into the kitchen, and to the best of my belief this is the same; it had a stem like this, and these scrolls under it as it is now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. The prisoner lodged with us prior to January, 1874, when we left London, and it was prior to January, 1874, that I saw the pin complete as it is now, and I saw him wearing it—I said before the Magistrate "I believe the pin produced to be the pin."</p>

               <p>pin was repaired for him on my premises—the stem was broken off the back part of the pin and we had to solder it on again—this open gold work beneath the diamonds was there then, and it is in the same state now except that three or four little diamonds are out of it—I repaired it a second time about six months after that, as near as I can guess; the stem was then very much bent and partly torn away from the back—we then saw that three or four of the very smallest of diamonds were out and I dare say I could see that now—they were not replaced—they must be still out. (<hi rend="italic">Examining it with a glass.</hi>) Two are out on one side of the <hi rend="italic">fleur delys</hi> and three out on the other—these very small diamonds are only worth about a shilling a piece—I scarcely ever saw the prisoner without this pin in his scarf for from seven to nine months, or something like that—I first repaired it for him ten months before I saw it at the police-court, and I had seen him wearing it before I repaired it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 9th August Joseph Pilgrim was received into Guy's Hospital, but I was not on duty—I first saw him about 20th August, and saw bruises on his legs which were wearing away, and swellings which were disappearing; they were chiefly in his right leg—it was difficult to tell in what state the bones were, as the swellings had not subsided; but I have examined them since, and found a great deal of thickening, and I believe his right leg to have been broken—he was six weeks in the hospital—the surgeon who received him is in the country; his term of office has expired—I sent the patient to the convalescent hospital, and I know that he went because his signature was given—he re-appeared a month afterwards—I examined him a few days since, and ha still walks somewhat lame—it will be three or four months from the injury before he walks well—a fall on the ground would not be likely to cause all the injuries I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The small bones might have been broken by a fall, and the other injuries done by external violence—the injuries were almost all over his right leg below his knee—I believe his leg was broken on account of the thickening of the bone, but I did not see him early enough to say that it was broken.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187512130033"/>
               <p>by the neck, and continually shoving me, and he knocked me down and kicked me; I fell five or six times—Thomas also followed me up close, con<lb/>stantly shoving me—I saw him kick me once, and I said "Will you allow me to go home?" but they kept shoving me the reverse way, though I told them I lived at the back of the church—when they got me into the dark they kicked me five or six times; I had several bruises—I used no abusive or improper language, I was doing nothing to cause a breach of the peace, I was standing by myself—I said "Now you have broken my <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> "what do you mean to do?" and they walked away and left me lying on the ground—my wife said "Don't you think you have done enough to my husband?"—I was in such agony that I hardly knew where I was—assistance came to help me home—I went to the hospital on the following Monday, and re<lb/>mained there sis weeks; I then went home for a week, and was then sent to the Convalescent Home at Bognor for four weeks—I also had bruises about my body—after I had been home three weeks I made a complaint to the authorities.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assault took place I think quite half a mile from the police-station—I will not swear that it is more than 200 yards—I told the Magistrate at Greenwich that I never had any misunderstanding with the police before—I have been sentenced to two months' imprison<lb/>ment for an assault upon my wife—I have not turned her out of the house at night—she has not been wandering about Blackheath when I have been at home—she has not been shut out; she has always had the house to walk into—I have not been at home in the middle of the night when she has been out—I recollect being at 1, King Street, Blackheath Hill, in. April, 1873—I saw two constables there, who insulted my wife—I don't know their names—there was no noise whatever—I saw those two men outside my own door, but I do not live in King Street—my wife's brother lives at 1, King Street—the police did not go into my brother-in-law's house, where my wife and I were on that night—Basket is not like one of the men; he was stouter built and had long whiskers and was fair—I was not there to hear what complaint my wife made to the police—I made none—I did not tell her not to take a summons out—she did not go through with it—I did not see her insulted—I was in my own house and do not know what she did—I saw the police in the street when. I went out—they told me to go home, and I did so—there was no disturbance at my brother-in-law's house; the poor woman was dying—I obeyed the police and went home, and in the meantime my wife had been insulted by the police and gone to the station—I could not walk home on the night I was assaulted; they partly carried me home—this was just after closing hour—the police stopped the singing—I did not say that they need not interfere, nor did I interfere—I did not tell the policeman that he was to mind his own business, nothing of the kind—I saw one of the prisoners in the act of kicking a young man—neither of the young men are here—I should like to find them—by kicking I mean lifting up his <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—it was also near 12 o'clock at night when my wife was insulted in 1873.</p>

               <p>men came up the hill singing, and two policemen, the prisoners, followed them—my husband said to me "Did you say that, <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>?" and immediately afterwards Basket took him by the neck and told him to move on—the push he received made him fall, and as he tried to get up the pushing continued and Basket kicked him several times and Thomas kicked him once—he called out that his leg was broken and I took Thomas by the shoulders and prevented him giving a second kick—he was pushed down four or five times—I asked Thomas if he had not done enough—the prisoners went away and I followed them for their numbers; Basket dared me to look him in the face and he placed his hand on his number—Thomas stood behind him all the time—I saw their faces; these are the men—I returned to my husband and I and a young man named Houghton assisted him home, and we had quite a job to get him upstairs; he went to the hospital on the Monday following, and I complained to the Magistrate on the same day, who told me to stop till my husband was better—my husband used no improper language to the police—they did not give him any chance to go on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They asked him to move on—I made a complaint against the police in 1873, and was referred to the Magistrate—my husband has been convicted of assaulting me once, the best of men may do that; he has only done it once to that degree—I have never had to stay out all night unless I was at work at a gentleman's house—my husband has never been so violent to me that I was obliged to leave the house; I may have been seen on Blackheath Hill at midnight if I have been to a party to wait—I was threatened to be locked up, but they did not do it—one of the men was bigger and older than either of these prisoners—I cannot recollect whether he was or was not either of those men; he was a big man—one was a fair man, with a fair beard and whiskers—my sister-in-law was dying at 1, King Street, in 1873, and there was a disturbance afterwards—I do not know that the two policemen I complained of came up to quell the disturbance—I was at the station-house—the two constables I charged were, I believe, on that beat—I was not outside the Horse and Groom on that night in 1873; it was close to the Horse and Groom—I believe the people were outside the Horse and Groom, where the singing was going on.</p>

               <p>directly I saw a chance I did interfere—I asked Basket why they were push<lb/>ing the man about—he said that it was no business of mine—I told him he was exceeding his duty—he told me if I was not careful he would serve me the same—I saw him kicked, but cannot say which constable's foot it was that was raised to him—I assisted him home with difficulty—I did not hear him use any improper language, or see any improper conduct—when he was kicked he was in a position between sitting and lying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have every reason to believe that it was Basket's foot that I saw up to kick him—I was rather excited—I should think there might have been eight or ten persons present—when the young men were coming up the hill I heard a voice say "Let the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> alone"—this seemed to me to be an interference with the police, but I did not see it—I did not see whether the police were trying to stop the young men singing—I was in the Horse and Groom yard, but 1 had not been in the house—it was twenty-five minutes or half an hour from the beginning of it to my seeing the man home—I may have heard the police say "Move on," and I may not, but they did not give him a chance—I cannot say how near this was to the nearest police-station—I did not go to the station that night—it was very late, and I was just getting home—I did not see the man twist him-self from the police who were trying to get him along—I will not swear that he did not—the wife was there—she was not very noisy, but I believe she was very excited—I heard some persons singing, but I should not have thought that it was an annoyance to the neighbourhood—Pilgrim walked home, but the best part of his weight was upon me—I did not notice whether he put one foot before the. other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of 29, King Street, Blackheath—on the morning of 8th August, a little after 12 o'clock, I was by the Horse and Groom talking to Mr. Houghton; I heard a disturbance, went to see what it was, and saw Pilgrim and his wife having a little bit of a disturbance with the police—I saw the constables push him down violently two or three times, and the last time I saw the elder one make an attempt to kick at him I decidedly saw him raise his foot—I cannot say whether he did kick him, but the man immediately cried out that he was kicked and that his leg was broken—I saw him pushed down about four or five times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Pilgrim seven or eight years—he used to live near me—Houghton is a friend of mine—I did not see the com<lb/>mencement of it—the people were cleared out of the Horse and Groom about 12.15—I heard no singing whatever, not a sentence—Houghton and I met before we got to the Horse and Groom and we stood talking—we got 200 yards before this happened, or perhaps not so far—no one said "Leave the <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> alone;" but Pilgrim's wife said "Let him alone"—the police may have told him to move on, but he was down on the ground when I came up—the shoving down was what I 'mean by the disturbance—I did not hear any language used in particular.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Lower Park Road, Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell, with my father, who is clerk to Mr. Joshua Williams, the Queen's Counsel—the house is one of a row—there are no cellars—there is a door in the centre and a sitting room on each side, the kitchen, offices behind, and four bedrooms above; one of them is a small room over the hall, and is occupied by the servant—the bedroom on the right is my father's and mother's, mine is on the left, and the room at the back of my father's is occupied by my sisters from Saturday to Monday—the prisoner was the only servant, she came the first week in August—on 30th October she was the only person in the house during the day, except my mother—no fires had been lighted in the upper rooms since last winter; there was one gas light in each bed room; the gas was not turned off at the meter at night, it was kept low; it was not turned on till we went to bed, and it was turned off in the morning when we got up; there was no leakage or any smell of gas—on Saturday morning, 30th October, I left home about 9 o'clock, my father and I usually leave together and return about 6 o'clock—my sister generally comes home between 4 and 5 o'clock on Saturday—When I came home on 30th I found the firemen there—communication was made to me, in consequence of which I went to my bedroom and found my cupboard had been burnt out; there was a row of shelves in it and a quan<lb/>tity of paper and bundles of unbound books belonging to my father were kept there—it was all right when I left in the morning—I found that the cup<lb/>board had been emptied of its contents, which were all burnt and blackened, the lower shelves were burnt nearly through and were black and charred; half their substance was gone, the upper shelves were not burnt quite so much, but they were all very much burnt, and also all round the cupboard, the wall, and ceiling—the fire had evidently commenced in the centre of the cupboard where the shelves were—the prisoner came up into the room with me and the firemen, and I said to her "Sarah, can you account for this in any way?"—she said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said "Somebody must have been here, a fire can't take place of itself," and I asked her when she was last at the cupboard—she said "I have not been there for a long time, I have no occasion <hi rend="italic">to go</hi> there"—I said "Are you quite sure you have not been there to-day with a candle, or light of some kind"—she again said "No, I have not been there for a long while"—then she said "Do you know, Mr. Henry, that there is some gunpowder in that cupboard"—I said "No, I was not aware of it," but I went to the cupboard in her presence and found a small tin canister amongst some bags and other things containing about a small teaspoonful of powder; I did not open it, I merely shook it, it had a double stopper—it was not near the part of the cupboard that was burnt, it was on the floor—I said to the prisoner "Well, but this has got nothing to do with the fire, it has not been near it"—it had been there, I should think, five or</p>

               <p>six years, I had quite forgotten it until she mentioned—that was all that passed then—I mentioned the matter afterwards in her presence, merely saying what an unaccountable thing it was, and so on—on Saturday morning, 20th November, I left home at my usual time, about 9 o'clock—there was no gas burning in my room at that time, nor any fire—my father left about the same time—before leaving I went into my mother's room, there was no fire or gas alight there—my mother was in bed—I returned home about 6 o'clock—my sisters and mother were at home—the prisoner was out—there was a fireman and a salvage man there—I found the place in great confusion—the upper rooms had been very much damaged by fire and the water had been all over the place—the upstairs rooms were all more or less burnt, except the servant's room, that was not injured—the greatest damage by fire was in my father's and mother's bedroom; that room was entirely burnt out, the ceiling was gone, and nothing but bare walls left—the rafters were most burnt on the left hand side of the room behind the door—there were a great number of pegs on the wall upon which dresses hung—they were all burnt, not a vestige was left; the room was entirely burnt out and gutted, only a few fragments of the bedstead and chairs were left; the only thing that was left at all entire was a chest of drawers, only the top portion of that was burnt away, and the two top drawers and the three lower drawers were scorched—there was a box under the bed, that was partly consumed—the other rooms were nearly blackened and scorched—there was a chest of drawers in my sister's room, they had not been touched by fire, not even smoked—my room was blacked and scorched—the servant's room was quit untouched, the staircase was very much burnt, the wall had to be pulled down—there were carpets in all the rooms, that in my mother's room was quite destroyed, the others were only damaged by smoke and heat—there there was oil cloth on the stairs, that was not burnt; the fire was kept principally above—we have settled with the insurance company for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we claimed 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the damage to the house was quite as much; we are only tenants—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the insurance company for the damage done on 30th October—the prisoner came in about half an hour after my return on 20th November with her father, she brought in a can of beer for the men; that must have been about 7 o'clock—the father said "I have come to see about this dreadful affair and to try and have it all cleared up"—I said "It is a dreadful affair and it is as extraordinary as it is dreadful, this is the second fire we have had here within three weeks"—then I said to the prisoner "Do you know anything about this, Sarah?"—she said "No, I know nothing at all about it"—I then said to the father "Mr. Howse, Sarah's conduct has been very unsatisfactory for some time past, she is very untruthful, we can never believe what she says"—I said she had borrowed money in our name—her father then asked me if we had paid her her wages regularly—I said "Yes"—he said "She has not brought any wages home since she has been with you, and she has told me that you have never yet paid her any"—he shen asked her "Have you got your clothes all right?"—she said "Yes"—he then asked to be allowed to go upstairs and look into her box—we went upstairs with him and the prisoner into her room—she had a box there, it was locked—the father said "Where's your key? unlock the box"—she said "I have lost the key"—he said "I will very soon open if, then" and he broke it open, or the salvage man did at his request, and there was nothing in it but a heap of rubbish, a few articles of dirty linen, dirty bits of clothing, but nothing wearable, no dresses or underlinen—the</p>

               <p>father seemed greatly distressed, and asked the prisoner what she had done with the water-proof cloak he had given her, and that when she came to our house three months) ago he had given her a new outfit of clothes—he stopped in the house until about 11 o'clock—we remained up all night nearly, we could only lay down upon the sofa or chairs—about 3 o'clock in the morning my eldest sister called me into her room and in one of the top short drawers there was a small card box with some cotton wool in it—she called my attention to a heap of burnt paper in the centre of the drawer—the card box was burnt, and also the roof of the drawer very much scorched—that drawer fitted pretty closely—the burnt paper was on the top of the drawer—these are portions of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and these are two of the little boxes that were in the drawer—they contained gloves, handkerchiefs, and so on—the burnt paper was lying upon them quite at the top—the drawer was full—the prisoner was in her own room at this time—about 10 o'clock Inspector Edge came, and about 11 o'clock the prisoner was given into ous<lb/>tody for wilfully firing the house—I went to the station with her and saw certain pawn tickets produced by the female searcher.</p>

Margaret Sherwood. I am the wife of Henry Sherwood—my son Henry is clerk to Mr. Fooks, Q.C.—my husband and son left home on the morning of the 30th October about 9 o'clock—I was left alone in the house that day with the prisoner—I usually dine about 1 o'clock—the house was in its usual state at that time to all appearance—I had not been upstairs since I came down about 10 o'clock—I usually lie on the sofa in the after<lb/>noon—it was the prisoner's duty to go up and attend to the rooms after the family had come down in the morning—she did so on the 30th October—it takes her nearly the whole morning—about 3 o'clock, whilst I was lying on the sofa in the sitting room my attention was aroused by a knocking at the door—I think I went and opened it—the prisoner was there and some woman—they had noticed smoke coming out of my son's room—a soldie came in and went upstairs, some water was got, and put out the fire in the cupboard—the prisoner went upstairs, and came down to me and said "Mr. Henry's room is on fire; "I went up directly—she had opened the door, and the flames were coming out—the books in the cupboard wer burning—I said to the prisoner I could not understand how it happened, and she made no reply—on Saturday the 20th November I left my bedroom a little before 10 o'clock in the morning—an old servant of mine named Sarah Mannning, came in about 10 o'clock or a little after, and I kept her to dinner that day—the prisoner was upstairs the whole morning; she came down to dinner, and then went up again—I had no occasion to go up to my bedroom; I remained in the kitchen—Manning left about two</p>

Do you think it was hanging in the room?"—she said "No, I have not seen it since I helped mistress fold it up on the Monday after she had been at Mr. Charles's"—that is my married brother at Brixton—I believe that' was on 24th October—I told her father that I had missed the sheet and petticoat from my drawer and that she had lost the key of her box; he asked her where it was—she told him she had lost it, and he ordered her box to be forced open—on the Saturday afternoon after the fire I tried to open the top right hand drawer of the chest of drawers in my bed-room, but could not; the key would not turn, and early on Sunday morning, about 3 o'clock, I unlocked it with a key and missed the chain and the lid of the box, and on opening the drawer further I discovered the burnt paper—I called my sister and brother and then closed it—I did not move anything, and I believe I</p>
