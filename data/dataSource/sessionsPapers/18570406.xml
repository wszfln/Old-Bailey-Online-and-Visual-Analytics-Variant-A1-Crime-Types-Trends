                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Shortridge, trading under the firm of Yeovil, Shortridge, and Co., a wine merchant, at No. 17, Mark Lane. The counting house is on the ground floor—there are two rooms; a front one and a back room—there is an iron safe in the front count<lb/>ing house—the key of the safe is kept in a desk in the same counting house—that desk is open during the day—at night it is locked, and the key is put into a sample chest—on Wednesday, 28th Jan., I received two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Currie and Co., the bankers—one I sent to the Custom House in pay<lb/>ment of duty, the other I put into the cash box that was kept in the iron safe—I did not have occasion to open the cash box till the morning of the 30th—when I opened it, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was not there—there are two clerks in the office; one besides myself—Mr. Shortridge and Mr. Chip, the other clerk, have access to the safe—the prisoner was employed to clean the count<lb/>ing house, after we had gone of a night—she was employed at the beginning of the year, until she was taken into custody—her husband was not in the employ of Mr. Shortridge—it was my duty to pay her for her services in keeping the offices clean—I did not at any time pay her that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I have not paid it away to any one—I am quite sure of it—that is the note that I put into the cash box on the afternoon of the 28th—I took no memo<lb/>randum of the number or date; I cannot speak to it positively, only by having obtained the number after I had missed it—I did not take any notice of any part of the notes when I received them from Messrs. Currie—I did when I paid one away to the Customs; I wrote the name of Shortridge on it—this is not the note that I paid away at the Custom House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Shortridge, and have been so more than forty-five years. I recollect seeing Walton, the porter, give Lorton two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; he was sent to the bankers for them on 28th Jan.—I did not use any of the contents of the cash box between the afternoon of 28th Jan. and the 30th; I abstained from doing so in consequence of great deficiencies—that reason makes me recollect it better—I was present on the 30th, when Lorton took out the cash box from the iron safe—at that time he missed the note—I do not think I opened the safe on the morning of 30th Jan., nor for several mornings before that—I usually locked up the safe at night—it was my duty to do so every evening, being there later, and attending to the business that had to be done, principally in the cellar—I have no doubt I locked it up on the 28th—the key of the desk in which the key of the safe is kept, is kept in a sample chest—the sample chest is locked; I have the key in my pocket—I do not think I opened the chest on the 30th—I do not recollect whether Lorton took the key of the desk out of the sample chest, or whether I did—Lorton kept one key of the sample chest, and I another—when I left the counting house in the evening I gave the key to the prisoner, or her husband; I generally gave it to her—I am quite certain that the sample chest was perfect on the morning of the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Muncaster and Warre, pawnbrokers, Skinner Street, Snow Hill. On the evening of 20th March the prisoner came to our shop about a quarter past 6 o'clock, and offered a Bible in pledge—I asked him who it belonged to—he said it was his property—I asked if he dealt in Bibles or books—he said he did, he was a dealer in them—I then asked if he was a binder—he said, "Yes"—I said it was rather unusual for binders of books to deal in them, especially books of that kind, and I asked him whether it really did belong to him, or whether he was bringing it for some one else—he then asked me to give him the book again—I refused to do so—he said if I would give it him back, he would really feel thankful, that he had taken it from his master's stock, and he merely wished to raise a temporary loan upon it, and it was his intention to replace it in the stock again—I then said that I had seen him in the shop before, and asked if he had pledged any with us previously—he said he had, and that he had two in pledge—I asked him what they were in for, and I then told him that I felt it to be my duty to give him in charge to the police—I went to the door to look for a policeman—I was some little time in finding one, in the mean time the prisoner escaped from the side door—at that moment the policeman came up and took him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the Bible—I also produce a Prayer Book, pledged on 7th March, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a Church Service on the 12th, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was what the prisoner asked upon them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Wheatsheaf. I remember the prisoner being in my house on 18th March, about half past 5 o'clock—I did not see him served—I saw the half crown was bad which Barton brought in—I gave it to the constable—when Barton gave it me. I went into the bar, saw the prisoner, and asked him where he took it—he said, "Of Mr. James, in High—street, Marylebonne"—he went out at one door and I at the other—I stood, and saw him look back several times, till he got to a mews, which he went down—I went down a street on this side of the mews, and ran and caught sight of him—he ran down several streets, and with a good deal of dodging I caught him, and brought him back to the house—I then asked him where he took the half crown; he said, "Of Mr. Williams"—I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—he had gone one third of a mile when I came up to him—I lost sight of him when he turned the corner of the mews, but, with that exception, I kept sight of him all the time.</p>

               <p>I accompanied the last witness to the cottage—I saw the door broken—it opens into the room—I followed the last witness in—I immediately seized Fowler, who was rising from a chair—he fastened on me by my hair, and kicked me violently—we had a struggle for several minutes—the last witness assisted me, and we succeeded in pushing Fowler on the bed, and after some time in handcuffing him—I then found these four counterfeit shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor by the bed side—they are finished—I then searched Fowler, and in his trowsers pocket I found a good shilling, which has been used in solution for coating—while I was struggling with Fowler, I saw Usher stamping on part of a mould, which had been dropped by Phillips—Usher kicked it under the table—it was then out of her reach—she tried to escape out of the room, and was stopped by sergeant Brannan—I went afterwards with Fowler and Phillips and sergeant Brannan, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to the police court—as we were going, Phillips said, "We are not married, sir; we have only been a few days together; he told me if any of you came, to be sure and break the moulds; how do you think I shall get on?"—I said, "I don't know"—Fowler was sitting there—he heard it, but said nothing—Usher was in another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Mr. Brannan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This mould has on it the obverse side of a florin, it is made of plaster of Paris—the moulds are formed on a piece of glass like this, or sometimes on tin—this plaster of Paris is in powder, it is put in the mould, and hardened with water—the impression on the mould is by putting a coin on the glass, and the plaster runs all over it, and then the mould is half done—here is a frag<lb/>ment of a mould with enough to enable me to see that it is the reverse side of a florin—here are Britannia metal spoons, and metal used in making the coin—this spoon has been put in as they wanted it, and so much would be melted away—here are twenty or thirty counterfeit shillings of the reign of George the Third, 1816; some of them are quite complete, and ready for circulation—here is no mould for making shillings, nor any part of one—here is a good sixpence, which has been used in the acid—this is the acid—here is the jar and the battery—here is a good sixpence attached to one wire, and in these other wires are the shillings—they are all put into the acid, and the acid takes the silver off the good sixpence at the bottom, and throws it on the bad shillings—they then undergo another process, which is scouring with sand, to take off the taste which they have from the acid—after that they are coloured, to make them look well when thrown down, like shillings that have been some time in circulation—almost anything will do that, sometimes they use a little black, or a little dust—here is a good shil<lb/>ling which has been in the solution—here is everything necessary for carry<lb/>ing on the business of coining—here is some stuff used for cleaning the coin—these files have white metal in their teeth, after getting the gets off; these are used to file the coins—this battery is on a large scale—it would hold half crowns as well as shillings—a good shilling would coat, very likely, a thou<lb/>sand—it would go a great way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler's Defence</hi>, I have known Phillips for some time, and we were to have been married on the 6th; I deny the charge of coining; the house was certainly occupied by me, and I gave a man my consent that these articles should be there, on condition of his acknowledging a debt due to me of 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I took no part in making these coins; I allowed my house to be used for such purposes without the knowledge of the crime, and without the knowledge of Phillips; I have stated this not to exonerate myself; I am aware that I must suffer, but I wish to prove to you the innocence of this female; I had allowed the man to have the use of my place for six weeks, and four of them had expired; I had contrived to keep Phillips ignorant of it, by sending her on visits or errands when anything was going on, but on the Sunday previous I accidentally said to her, "If anything happens, put those away which shall be at the fire;" she said, "What?" I told her to keep everything out of sight, and to say that she knew nothing of what was going on; Usher has known me the last three or four years, and knew that I obtained an honest livelihood; she had no thought that anything wrong was going on; she came in that day without fear, little thinking that within half an hour she would be in custody; is it likely that a man should leave the door of a house, when he was carrying on such a dangerous trade, on the <hi rend="italic">jar</hi>, or on only the common fastening of a lock, which would open with a kick? had I been in the habit of obtaining my living by such means, I should have fastened it, but though I was in the house, and knew what was</p>

               <p>going on, I was not aware that I was so awfully breaking the laws; Usher came in without suspicion, and when she saw five men rush in in the manner that they did, and use such violence, she became alarmed; Phillips knew nothing, but was kept in ignorance; she was with a man whom she thought was to be her lawful husband in less than a fortnight.</p>

The prisoner was a letter carrier in that office—I cannot say how long he had been employed there—he was employed on the morning of 12th March, in what is called the Circulation office—that is the office where letters are stamped and then taken to the sorters—he was employed at one of the stamping tables, in stamping letters and taking them away into another room to the sorters—this was about 6 o'clock in the morning—there is a partition between the stamper and the man that takes the letters away; he was at the end of the table; it is a long table; there is a partition between the stamper that he takes from, and the other man that takes from the other stamper—there are different tables, but only one was at this table—in consequence of some instruction that I had received, I was in the office with Mr. Clare, watching the prisoner—he could not see us—I saw him taking the letters from behind the stamper; he gathered up a quantity of letters, and selected a letter which bore two penny stamps—he took it out, and kept it by itself; I saw him take hold of it and feel it before he laid it down, and then he took up that armful of letters, the armful of letters that he had collected up, that he selected this one from, and took them away to the sorting room, leaving the letter with the two stamps standing on the table—he then came back again, collected up another handful of letters, perhaps a dozen, and set them up against the partition, and the letter with the two stamps he set up behind them—he set it up against the partition, and the others in front of it; the letter with the two stamps was then next the partition—he then collected four more separate handfuls, and set them up against the others, and each time he did so, he took the letter with the two stamps that he had put behind, and put it in front of each handful, so as to be nearest to him—he then just turned round to look behind him, and unbuttoned his waistcoat two or three buttons at the bottom, turned round to the table again, placed his arm down with the letters, and at the same time with his light hand took up the letter with the two stamps, and put it under his waistcoat—he then placed his thumb against the letters to press them, and took them away—Mr. Clare was with me all the time this</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the General Post Office. The prisoner was a letter carrier, and was also employed in the Circulation office as a stamper—his proper duty was to stamp the letters, and nothing else—he went out of course on the morning in question, and gave his stamp to the man that should have been behind him, and for a few minutes he did the duty of the man that should have carried the letters—the man to whom he gave the stamp was the man who should have carried the letters into the other room—I was there with Bingham on the morning of 11th March—I was in such a situation that I could see all that the prisoner did—I had gone there for that purpose; I was at a window—when the stamper stamps the letters, he removes them away behind him, and the man who carries them to the next office packs them up behind him against the partition until he has got a bundle, and then carries them to the sorting table—I saw the prisoner, in taking the letters from behind the stamper, select one bearing two stamps; he felt it, and placed it against the partition on the stamping table—he then selected more letters from behind the stamper, again took up that letter, felt it again, and then placed it at the back of the letters he had collected—he then collected some more, took the letter from the back of the letters, and placed it in front—he then turned round sharply, as if to see if any one was observing him, took the letter in his right hand, unbuttoned his waistcoat, placed the letters on his wrist and arm to carry them away, and slipped letter into his waistcoat—I then went down to the inspector's room, and afterwards went to the prisoner and brought him into the room—as we went along I saw him shuffling his hand about his trowsers and waistcoat—when</p>

               <p>we got into the room, I told him that he had been seen to secrete a letter in his waistcoat or the waistband of his trowsers—he said he had not—I told Bingham to search him—the prisoner took off his coat and waist<lb/>coat, and then his trowsers—I saw him, as he was taking off his trowsers, pushing and shifting something about, as if he was pushing it up behind his shirt—he was sitting down at that time—when his trowsers were off he was told to stand up—I saw his arms close to his shirt, and I said to him, "Take your arms away"—Bingham took hold of his shirt and shook it, and this letter fell down on the floor; it bears the Aylesbury post mark of 11th March—that would arrive in the Circulation office on 12th March, and would be sent out that morning—I felt the letter, and found that it contained something—it has the Inland post mark on it, which shows that it had arrived at the Post Office that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine. I examined this child—supposing it had had a ligature tied round its neck, and been thrown into the water, it might present such appearances as I saw, but death from suffocation would not correctly express it—I first saw the child on Tuesday morning, 17th March—it had a ligature tied once tightly round the neck—it was linen of some kind—it was twisted—the cause of death was not very obvious—the appearances of suffocation were not well marked—the only diseased condition I noticed was some collapse of the lungs and more than ordinary vasculation of the intestines, appearances as if the child had had diarrhoea—I think those appearances were not suffi<lb/>cient to cause death, taking the generally nourished appearance of the child into consideration; it appeared to have been properly nourished—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060032"/>
               <p>appearances about the intestines would not indicate any aggravated state of diarrhoea; there was no ulceration, but an inflammatory state—there was a slight amount of fluid blood on the right side of the heart, which was somewhat indicative of suffocation, but not well marked evidence of it—I think, considering the collapsed state of the lungs, and the child probably being in a low condition, judging from its flabby appearance, that the appearances of suffocation would not be so well marked as in a more robust child, or a child whose lungs were not col<lb/>lapsed—the other organs were healthy—the appearances were not opposed to death from suffocation, but I could not give a positive opinion—the effects would be the same in suffocation and strangulation, as far the ventricles of the heart were concerned—the appearances would not justify me in saying that death was from strangulation, though not inconsistent with it—I think I have seen cases of children who have died of cold and exhaustion from exposure—I ought to add that I do not think that death was produced from drowning, which would also cause suffocation—judging from the mark round the neck, which corresponded with the situation of the ligature, I should be rather inclined to think that death was caused as a result of that ligature, but I would not state positively—children dying from exhaustion would probably present a similar appearance of lung—collapse of the lung is a very common appearance after death from any exhausting cause; anything that lowers the vital powers, but to a greater extent than was presented here—the ligature was tied tightly round the neck, so tightly that I was obliged to cut it behind—I do not say that death could not have been produced by the ligature; I think it might, and I incline to the opinion that it was so—I believe it is impossible to distinguish marks made immediately before and immediately after death; after some interval, it is plainly to be distinguished—the marks round the neck of this child were consistent with their having been made while it was alive or very shortly after death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Howe, a groom, of No. 32, Middle Grove Street, Commercial Road. On 25th Feb. I went with the deceased Eliza Bunn to the prisoner's house, in Commercial Road. I believe he takes likenesses—we were shown up stairs, and saw the prisoner—I asked him for my boy's likeness, which he had taken in the morning—he said that the boy did not sit still, and he did not wish to let me have it, he would like to see the boy again—I said, "You cannot see him again, for he has gone to sea; he went this morning; it is very unkind and ungrateful of you not to let me have the likeness, as the boy has gone away, and I may never see him again"—he said it was not correct, and he would not let me have it—I said, "I have recommended you several customers, and it is very unkind of you;" and I said, "It is the generality of men like you, who take likenesses and keep them if they are good, to hang at the door for show; and if you don't let me have it, and I see it hanging at the door or anywhere else, I will smash it"—upon that the prisoner caught me by the shoulders, and went to push me out of the room—the deceased was standing close to me—she was thirty-six years old—she was a neighbour of mine—the prisoner pushed me towards the door, and Mrs. Bunn went in between us, to prevent his pushing me out of the room, and with that the prisoner fell down—Mrs. Bunn merely said, "Don't push my friend out of the room"—I did not observe whether he had anything in his hand at the time; I was very excited—there was a pan by the side of the fire, with water in it—the prisoner fell by the fire; the room is very small; I do not know whether he fell on the pan; the pan was broken, and the water was all over the room—I ran out of the room on to the landing; I turned round to see whether my friend was coming, and they were both scuffling together—I went into the room again to part them, to get my friend to come away—I then saw that the prisoner had a hammer in his hand, and he struck Mrs. Bunn on the head with it, and it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060034"/>
               <p>sounded just like you would sound an empty tub—I said, "Oh my!" when he struck the blow, I was so frightened—she said, "You fetch a policeman, and I will hold him till you come back"—I then went and fetched a police<lb/>man, and the prisoner was taken to the station; we charged him there with the assault, and then we went before the Magistrate that same day, and he was fined 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or eight days' imprisonment; the deceased and I then went home to my place, and we then went to her own house, which is right opposite my place—I did not think at that time that she was seriously hurt; the blood was flowing all down her face when we went to the station and to the Magistrate—I saw the blood in the room when she was struck—I did not see her again till the next day, Thursday; she was then in bed, and complained of her head—I saw her again on the Friday; she seemed a little worse then—on the Saturday I fetched a medical man to her, and from what he said I went with her to the hospital—I went to the hospital on the Monday, and found that she was dead.</p>

               <p>and I fell with my behind into a pan of water;" the pan then lay in the room broken into four or five pieces, and the water was spilt about the room—I then said, "What is this all about?"—Mrs. Howe then stated in the prisoner's presence what she has stated here, about her son's likeness—that the prisoner refused to give it up, and tried to put them out of the room; that they refused to go without the likeness, a scuffle ensued between them, and he struck the deceased on the head with the hammer—I said, "Where is the hammer?"—this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was then brought to me by Willis—I then took the prisoner to the station, and to the Magi<lb/>strate—on 2nd March I heard of the deceased's death, and took the prisoner again into custody—I said, "Mr. Clark, I must apprehend you in conse<lb/>quence of the woman, Bunn, being dead in the London Hospital"—he said, "Is she dead, I am very sorry for it"—he seemed much agitated.</p>

On the afternoon of 28th Feb., I saw the deceased, Eliza Bunn, at the hospital, she was not sensible—she had a wound on the right side of the forehead—she continued insensible till she died, on Monday, 2nd March—I examined her skull next day—I found a very small punctured fracture, evidently made by some small pointed instrument; it had perforated the outer part of the skull, and the inner part, being of a more brittle nature, it had split and fractured two pieces off—in my opinion that Was the cause of death—this hammer would be precisely the instrument to cause such an in<lb/>jury, the sharp point of it—I tried the hammer, and found it fit exactly with the external fracture of the skull—I consider it would have required a hard blow to cause the injury—I should say it must have been a smart blow, not a blow of extreme violence; it would cause blood to flow immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the prisoner, in his shop. In consequence of what Ellen Willis said to me on the day in question, I went up stairs to the prisoner's room—I there saw the prisoner, the deceased, and Mrs. Howe; the deceased had the prisoner by his neck handkerchief, and Mrs. Howe had him by the hair of his head—they all three had hold of the hammer at the same time, and were struggling together—I thought, per<lb/>haps, that there might be some more blows struck if I let either party get it, and I got Mrs. Howe from them out on to the landing—I then went back again into the room and took the hammer from the prisoner and the deceased; they both had hold of it, they were not struggling then, they merely had hold of it—I gave it to Mrs. Willis, and went down stairs to take in the pictures; Mrs. Willis gave it to the policeman—when I went into the room Mrs. Howe said that the prisoner had struck her with the hammer—I saw blood flowing from the deceased's head when I first went in, they were then struggling together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I was employed by the prisoner on 25th Feb.—I remember Mrs. Howe and the deceased coming up into the pri<lb/>soner's room; at the time they came in Mr. Clark was driving some tacks in the wall to hang specimens upon—Mrs. Howe said she had come for her son's likeness, which was taken there in the morning—Mr. Clark said, on account of the weather being dull, and the boy not sitting still, the likeness would not come out, but if he could see the boy again he would take it afresh—Mrs. Howe said he could not see the boy again, as he had gone to sea—Mr. Clark said, then he would return her the sixpence which the boy had left as a deposit, and he was very sorry, but as the likeness would not come out, he could not let her have it—she said she knew it was a customary thing for artists, when they had got a good likeness, to keep it to hang out<lb/>side the door as a specimen; that she would not go till she had got it, and if he did not give it to her she would smash everything there was in the room, and likewise the specimens hanging at the door—he said he could not give it to her as he had not got a likeness, and if she did not go out of the house he would have her taken out by a policeman; and he opened the room door—upon that the deceased ran and struck him in the face, saying, "Take that; now you will give me the boy's likeness, for we will not go out with<lb/>out it"—he said he could not give it to her, and the deceased and Mrs. Howe both struck him repeatedly—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> them both out of the room—the</p>

               <p>deceased ran back into the room, took him round the waist, and threw him into a large pan of water, and broke the pan—he got up and told them to go out—they said they would not go out, and struck him again; he then seized the hammer and struck the deceased with it; he had it in his hand all the time—the deceased and Mrs. Howe then caught hold of him, the deceased by the neck handkerchief, and Mrs. Howe by the hair of his head—I went down stairs and fetched the door's man (Haunton) up, and he took the hammer from them, and Mrs. Howe went to look for a policeman—I saw the deceased's head bleeding, and heard the prisoner say he had struck her with the hammer, and he was sorry.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have admitted from the first that I used the hammer, but I used it in self-defence, being in mortal fear of my life, struck down as I was by two able bodied women standing on my own hearth; it would have been of no use for me to attempt to obtain the protection of the police, because, before the police could have arrived, I should have been in the same position as the unfortunate woman whose death I lament; it was in defence of my own life and property that I struck the blow, and the moment it was struck I regretted it; I had no idea that anything like death would have resulted from it, it was not a blow calculated to produce death; it was done without premeditation, without any other impulse but that which has been considered the first law of nature, self-preservation; if you can convict me of manslaughter on this charge, I do not believe there is a gentleman among you who will be safe in his shop or warehouse from the attacks of persons who excite their passions in gin shops, and then come to your premises; I had no intention of injuring the woman, still less of de<lb/>priving her of life; I only wished to defend my own life.</p>

On Monday, 16th Feb., in the afternoon, I had a firkin of butter in my establishment—I saw it last in my shop about 3 o'clock—I missed it next morning, and in consequence of information I went with Copping to the prisoner's shop—it is an oil shop, in Leonard Street, Curtain Road—I went in first by myself, leaving the officer outside—I saw the prisoner, and said to him, "I understand you bought a firkin of butter last evening which was stolen from my shop"—he said, "No, I have bought no butter"—I said, "It is no use your deny<lb/>ing it; I have a man outside who saw it stolen from my shop, and watched it till it was brought to yours"—he said again that he had bought no butter—a constable came in uniform, and asked the prisoner if he had not bought any butter—the prisoner denied it again—the constable told him that we had proof of it, and had a person outside that saw it stolen—the prisoner then said that he had had some butter brought there the previous evening, but he did not buy it; he had lent some money on it—we went into the parlour behind the shop, and the prisoner said to me, "I suppose you have no vindictive feeling towards me"—I said, "No"—he asked if I knew the value of the firkin of butter—I said it cost me about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "If you will make out your bill, I will pay you for it; I am a respect<lb/>able man, and have been in business a number of years; I would rather do that than have any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it"—I repudiated anything of that—the butter is here.</p>

I was near the prosecutor's shop, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—I saw four men together, and one of them went and took up a cask of butter from the prosecutor's shop, and put into a bag, and then upon a barrow, and took it to the Curtain Road to the prisoner's shop—I followed them—they did not stop before they got to Mr. Jackson's shop—when they got there, they took it off the barrow into the shop—two of them went into the prisoner's shop; one of them came out again—the bag containing the butter was taken in—I saw them all leave the shop—they only took the barrow away—I believe the bag was left there with the butter—I followed them for a short distance, on my road home—I was in custody three weeks ago; it was a mistake on the constable's part—the Magistrate said that I was honourably discharged—there was no evidence against me.</p>

I received at Coutts's bank these notes—this is the cheque, it has my writing on the back of it—I took the notes home, and placed them with some more in a pocket book—on 3rd Feb. I went out to a public house in the Haymarket, between 8 and 9 o'clock, in search of a man named Stewart—I saw the prisoners at the bar; I knew them before—I asked them about Mr. Stewart; they said that he was not there, he was at the ball at the Harlequin—I agreed to go with them to the ball, but I had no money with me; I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with them, and went to my house—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was left at the door, and we three went into the parlour—I carry two keys, locking the outer door and the parlour door—I opened the street door with this key, and the parlour door with this one—we all got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went into the parlour—I opened the folding doors of the back parlour, and took my pocket book, and took out one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; there were twelve 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes left in it, and nine of them were those I had received at Coutts's—I placed my pocket book between the chairs against the wall, and I heard it fall on the floor—the prisoners could see what I was doing—the room is very small—I closed the folding doors after me, and came out, and joined the prisoners; we all went into the street; I looked my doors after me, and put the keys into the right hand tail pocket of my coat—I found the keys afterwards in my left hand pocket—we then went across the road to the Union public house, and had some bread and cheese and ale—I paid for it out of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—we stood at the bar while we were eating and drinking—the prisoners were close to me—Morton went out during the time—he might be away three or four minutes, or more—I did not look after him—Farthing stood there talking to me, and eating the bread and cheese, and drinking the ale—Farthing went to the door—when Morton came back, he went out—Farthing went out once or twice—after they returned, we all got in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went to the ball—we all three went in together; I missed them in about an hour or an hour and a half—I never saw them again till they were in custody—on my return home, I found the doors locked, everything right as I left it, but the notes were gone—I found my keys in my left hand pocket, which is quite a different place to where I put them—Mr. John Morris is the landlord of the house I live in—that is nearly opposite to the Union public house—you may cross to it in about a minute; I got to the ball about 11 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the East India Company. In and previous to 1834 I was in the shipping department of the Company—I was there at the time they discontinued their commercial undertakings—there were at that time a great many commanders and petty officers of their ships, and after a time an arrangement was made to compensate them, and also down as low as boatswains, gunners, and carpenters, but an ordinary seaman would not be entitled to a pension—the persons who had served in the lowest grades for ten years previous to 28th Aug., 1833, were to receive a pension of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, commencing from 22nd April, 1834—for the purpose of granting these pensions, forms of</p>

               <p>applications were prepared by the Company, and given to any person who applied; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—in or about 1836, I received the declaration in the form filled up, purporting to be from Lewis Evans, but at this distance of time I cannot say from whom—on the receipt of it, I referred to such lists of vessels referred to as would prove the eligibility of the party to the pension; ten years' service was sufficient to qualify him—in consequence of what I found in the wages' lists, and upon my recom<lb/>mendation, a pension was granted to him, which has been paid ever since—it would commence, I think, in 1834—unless I had believed that statement to have been true, it would not have been granted—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came into the department, I will not say that it was in July, 1856—it was proposed to give some alms houses (which had been erected two centuries) to the old servants of the Company, and they took steps to make it known, by placards in the pay office—in consequence of this letter, I referred to the vessels <hi rend="italic">General Harriss</hi> and <hi rend="italic">General Hewitt</hi>, to ascertain the actual period that he served on board each, as it required a period of ten years' actual ser<lb/>vice to give him eligibility to the alms houses—I referred to all the vessels, and discovered something which induced me to make further inquiry as to the prisoner.</p>

I am seventy-three years of age, and infirm; I have been forty years upon the sea, and eight years in the East India Company's service; in the year 1836, I received a summons from the East India Company, to attend at Leadenhall Street; I was there ordered to give an account of the time I had been in the Company's service; I accordingly did so for eight years; I was asked my name, and replied, "Lewis Evans;" they then said, "You are described on our books as <hi rend="italic">'Edward</hi> Lewis Evans, "are you one and the same man?" I replied, "Yes;" they then said they supposed it was their error, and desired me to go to the Mansion House, and make affidavit to the effect that I was "Lewis Evans," <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> "Edward Lewis Evans;" this I did; I was then informed that <hi rend="italic">"compensation"</hi> was due to me; at this time I also furnished the Company with the names of the various ships in which I had served; after this I went again to sea, and was absent about twelve months; upon my return to England I again received a summons from the East India House; I was then informed that I was entitled to a pension of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; I replied, "I thought it was not due to me," as I had not served the full time; one of the clerks then said something to the following effect, viz., "You old fool, it is due to you;" I was then desired to write for my certificates of baptism and marriage, which I did; about a month after, I received a third summons, and was taken by a clerk of the name of Bryant to Captain Baker's office, and delivered my certificates; from thence I went to the treasurer's office, and received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my pension; the treasurer then presented me with a formal order to receive my pension, which order I produced to the Lord Mayor on Wednesday week last; I presumed at the time that I received my pension through the kindness of my friend, Captain Baker, and from my merit; this pension I have duly received for nineteen years, without any demur on the part of the East India Company; in the year 1856, I made application to the Company to be admitted into the alms houses, at Poplar; I received the accompanying letter in reply; I answered this letter to the effect that I was then so ill that I had no hopes of being an applicant, or something to that effect—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters were also produced, one informing the defendant that before his application for one of the almshouses could be granted, he must state the names of all the ships in which he lead served; and another in reply, from the defendant, stating, that in consequence of ill health he did not hope to become a candidate.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Hollick's, a draper, in High Street, Poplar, as an assistant. On 5th March, I was at the Poplar station of the Blackwall Railway—it was half past 8 o'clock when I took my ticket there—I was going to the Hampstead Road—I had to change carriages at Stepney, and got into a second class carriage on the North London line; that was about 20 minutes past 8 o'clock—there were several passengers in the carriage, but all of them got out at the Camden Town station, and left me alone—as the train was about to start from the Camden Town station, I observed the prisoner look in at the window of the carriage—he opened the door, and got in—I was sitting in the corner; he seated himself on the opposite seat, about the middle of it—he was quite a stranger to me—he asked me what was the next station—I told him Hampstead Road—he said, "That's right"—he then moved up the seat opposite to me—he said, "It is about half past 8 o'clock, is it not? what is the time?"—I took out my watch, and said it was 25 minutes past 8, all but a minute—I then put my watch into my pocket again, and turned my head to look out of the window—I then felt a violent blow strike me in the neck; I sprang to my feet—I then felt myself struck in the arm in the same manner—I grappled with the prisoner, and he nearly overpowered me, when I saw a knife in his</p>

               <p>left hand—we were then in the middle of the seat, where he sat when he first got into the carriage—I caught at the blade of the knife with my right hand—it was a sticking knife, not a clasped knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I caught his neck and wrist with my left hand, and pushed him up into the corner—he struck me with the right hand, but the knife was in his left when I held it—I pushed him up into the corner, and called out "Murder!" several times—the train was in motion all this time—I did not lose my hold of the knife at all until the train stopped—the injuries inflicted upon me were inflicted before I got hold of the knife—while I was holding the knife an attempt was made to draw it through my hand, I felt it cut deeper; I had only hold of it by the blade, nothing else—while I was struggling with him for the knife, I pushed his arm against the back of the seat, to prevent him from pulling it through my hand—he struggled and tried to get away, but I squeezed his throat—the speed of the train was slackening at this time, and was nearly stopping—I again called out "Murder!" several times—I ascertained that I was wounded directly I caught the knife; I felt that I was bleeding from my neck and arm—immediately the train stopped the carriage door was opened by a guard or porter, and I said, "Take this man, he has stabbed me"—I still held him—he dropped the handle of the knife immediately the door was opened, and said, "The knife is not mine; this gentleman tried to stab me, and in self defence I stabbed him"—I did not observe whether he was wounded in any way—I gave the knife to the porter by the handle; it was not my knife; I had a small clasped knife—I did not use it in any way—I did not take it out of my pocket—I did not make any attack upon the prisoner before I was stabbed—the blade of the knife is not so sharp lower down where I held it, or it would have cut my hand through—I was taken into the office of the station, and a surgeon attended me directly—I was sent home by a special train, and have been attended several times since by two surgeons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, near the Hampstead Road station. On 5th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was called to attend to the prosecutor—he was sitting in a chair, quite faint, his clothes much stained with blood, and a handkerchief tied round his neck was also saturated with blood—on removing the hand<lb/>kerchief I found a wound on the left side of the neck, about two inches from the ear—it was about an inch in length, and about the same depth; the edges were smooth, so that it was made by a sharp instrument—it was about the width of this knife; it was a stab apparently made by the point of the knife—it went certainly within half an inch of the carotid artery, and I should think the end of the wound must have been much nearer, as it inclined forward—it was a very dangerous wound—on taking</p>

               <p>off his clothes I found a wound on the outer side of the left arm, about the same size, but twice as deep; it was quite two inches deep; that was also made by stabbing, and it inclined upwards also—there was a bruise at the right side of the back of the neck; that was altogether distinct from the wound—there were some scratches over the right eyebrow, and the right side of the chin—there were two slight cuts on his right hand, scarcely through the skin, between the forefinger and thumb—it would have required a good deal of violence to cause the wound in the neck, to get the knife in the depth that it went; the wound in the arm must have been given with even more force, it was deeper.</p>

About 6 o'clock, on the morning of the 16th, I observed a pane of glass under the wall, by the staircase window—the glass was not broken, it was laid down under the wall—I observed under the window the eighteen gallon cask that was on the night before on the other side of the steps—I found it right under the window—mounting upon that, a person might well reach the place where the pane of glass had been—removing that, the hand could be put through so as to undo the catch, and open the sash.</p>

On the 16th March, about 11 o'clock, I went to the Manor Farm—I observed that a square of glass had been taken from the staircase window; it had been taken out by cutting part of the lead, and pushing the other part back with a knife—I received a knife from the witness Townsend—I compared that with the marks on the lead, and found that it corresponded—it fitted exactly in the marks—the square of glass was about five inches by eight inches; part of the lead work was cut in a slanting direction, and the other part was pushed back—I compared the knife with the marks, and it corresponded—I observed the knife before I went to the lead marks—on the blade of it were some marks of some lead which I pointed out to Mr. Johnson previously—those were such marks as would have been made if a person had cut in such a manner—the taking out of that pane would enable a person to get their hands through to the fasten<lb/>ing of the window inside; you move it, and it opens like a door—there was no mark on the shutters—the dog kennel was directly opposite this—the position of the outhouse was where they would be most likely to go if the policemen came in the opposite direction—there was also some lead on the edge of the knife, but I could not keep it on.</p>

On the night of 11th March he came home between 10 and 11 o'clock; the prisoner came in after him, with five more, and they were down on him—I went in between them, and got him up—I saw the pri<lb/>soner strike him a blow with his fist—I cannot say whether there was any<lb/>thing in his hand, but immediately he gave him the blow I saw the blood come—this was on the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of No. 14, Ship Alley, Wellclose Square. The prosecutor lodged at my house—on 11th March I saw him come home, about 11 o'clock—we were in the back parlour, the front door was open—we heard a rush in at the door, and I and Jennings ran out—there were four or five men running in at once; Felix was in the midst of them—I asked them what they wanted in my house; there was about a dozen more coming in, and they were all at Felix—when I saw the men in such a passion about him, I told them to be quiet, and asked what was the matter—I could not get any satisfactory answer from them, and they would not keep off from the man—I tried as much as possible to take him away from them—Jennings dragged him to the stairs, and I got on the stairs to keep the men off—some of the men ran up stairs, and I prevented them from going any higher, but the prisoner jumped up behind me, and ran up the stairs, while Jennings held Felix in her arms—the prisoner gave him a push with his fist on the front part of the head, and the blood rushed out imme<lb/>diately—I saw no blood before the blow was struck; the police came in immediately, before the prisoner or any of the others had left—I looked the door till the policeman came; I would not let any one out, there were four<lb/>teen or sixteen of them all locked in—I opened the door to let the police<lb/>man in, and locked it again—he asked who was the man that did it; we showed him the man, and let the others go—the prisoner was given into custody—I saw the prosecutor struck before this, but I did not see any knives or any blood—I kept them off a dozen times—the last blow was the blow struck by the prisoner, and it was immediately after that blow that the blood came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons of St. Bartho<lb/>lomew's Hospital. I saw the deceased on Tuesday morning, between 1 and 2 o'clock, when she was brought to the hospital—she had a wound on the upper part of the head, on the scalp, about three quarters of an inch long; it was not bleeding then—it appeared to be recent—I dressed it, and she left—I saw her again on the following Friday week; she then had erysipelas—she came again on the Saturday, and then became an in-patient; the erysipelas was rather worse than the day before—she died on the Monday night or Tuesday morning—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I was present, but did not make it—the erysipelas was the cause of death—ery<lb/>sipelas frequently follows wounds on the head—she had it somewhat severely, and it followed the wound—in my judgment it was caused by the wound on the head, from its being confined to the head and face, and from it so fre<lb/>quently following a wound on the head—a blunt instrument would have inflicted such a wound; it is possible that a person's knuckles may have done it, but only barely possible I think—I found nothing to cause the erysipelas but the wound on the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons of St. Bartholo<lb/>mew's Hospital. I did not see the deceased until she came on the Friday, ten days after she first came to the hospital—she was then suffering from severe erysipelas of the head and face—she came into the hospital on the next day, Saturday, and into the ward over which I have the supervision; I examined her head, I found a small scalp wound, about three quarters of an inch in length, situated nearly on the top of the head—she died on the Tuesday morning, about half past 1 o'clock—I made an examination of the body after death—in my judgment the erysipelas was the cause of death—I believe the wound was the exciting cause of that erysipelas—I found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060085"/>
               <p>nothing else to account for it; the other organs were tolerably healthy—I think it is not at all probable that a man's knuckles would produce such a wound; I think it must have been some blunt heavy instrument—judging from its situation, I should say it was not produced by a fall—I will not say a man's knuckles may not have caused it, it is possible, but not at all probable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have arisen from natural causes, independent of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the wound was the exciting cause; there might be a tendency to erysipelas—it is quite possible that the erysipelas might have been there without any wound, erysipelas more frequently attacks the head and face, even without any wound, but in my judgment the wound was the exciting cause, because it appeared principally to affect the very neighbour<lb/>hood of the wound—it was more powerful there.</p>

               <p>chips were inside the drawer, not on the floor; they were merely a few chips broken off the edges, as if some instrument had been put into the drawer—I told the father on one day that Brown, the officer, had told me that he had seen the prisoner in Newgate, and that he had admitted that he had destroyed the cheque or cheques; the father came to me two or three times—he brought the boy to me, I cannot recollect the day, and I asked him about the cheques, and I said to the father, "You had better take the boy, and take care of him; he is much better under your custody than being given in charge to the police"—I generally found the boy there when I got to the office in the morning, but I suppose the office was opened for the purpose of being cleaned before he got there—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque was in the pass book when it was brought home—the other cheques I have never seen, except the one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never sent any present to the boy's mother; I never sent a tortoise made of sealing wax as a relish for her tea—I swear most distinctly I never sent messages to his mother—I never sent her any coals with a letter telling her how to light her fire, nor did I afterwards, when I came to my senses, send an apology saying I was sorry for what I had done—this is the first time I have heard that I was in the habit of drinking and doing such silly things—I am not aware that I ever got into a state of intoxication; I cannot say I never did, but I swear positively I never sent any such messages, in fact I do not think I even knew that the boy had a mother.</p>

I went to the end of Farringdon Street, Holborn, on 2nd Feb., about 7 o'clock in the evening, and saw the two prisoners driving a horse and cart, which had baskets in it—I and my brother officer hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed it till we came to Red Lion Street—they turned into Red lion Street, and stopped the cart opposite the Red Lion public house—both the prisoners got out, and went into the public house; we stopped outside with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoners came out, and Beard got into the cart, and turned into Holborn, Dennis turned round the corner, and we lost sight of him—Beard drove along towards Queen Street, and we followed him—when the cart arrived at the end of Queen Street it went rather slowly—we got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and stopped the horse—I got into the cart; I put my hand into one of the baskets, and came in contact with one of the tusks—I said to Beard, "What have you here?"—he said, "It is not mine"—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I don't know; a man employed me in Tooley Street, and gave me half a crown to drive the cart for him"—I said, "Who is the man?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "I shall take you into custody for stealing these things"—he said, "All right, old fellow; I can't help it"—I took Beard into custody, and Brown drove the cart—in going down Holborn Hill, Beard directed our attention, and said some one was running after us, and that was the man that hired him—there were a great many persons about, and we did not know but that Beard's statement might be a <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi>, and we drove on—we saw some one running, but I could not say who it was—when we got to the station I examined the baskets, and found in them seventy-three elephant's teeth—Beard did not say anything at the station—on 27th Feb. I went after Dennis—we traced him to a place, and went into the house, and as soon as we got to the bottom of the stairs, we saw Dennis making his exit from another room—I called him by name, and he answered me—I told him we were officers, and we must speak with him—we told him we came to take him for being concerned with a person named Beard, now awaiting his trial at the Central Criminal Court, for stealing elephants' tusks—I said, "You need not answer any questions that I put to you, unless you think well: Do you know Beard?"—he hesitated a while, and said that he did not; but after a while he said that he did—I said, "You went with him to hire a cart of a person named Coster"—he said, "I know nothing about the cart; I know nothing about the transaction"—he after<lb/>wards said, Well, I did hire a cart, and Beard went with me"—when we got to the station, he said, "I have been <hi rend="italic">sold</hi>, and I will <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on the whole b—lot"—he said, before he got to the station, "A man named Jones hired me to hire the cart"—I saw the cart, it had on it, "William Mundy, Bethnal Green Road"—I have looked at the other teeth that I had when Pickard was in custody, and these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), have the same marks—Pickard was tried on 2nd Feb.—he had been in custody some time before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Edward Rudd and others, trading under the name of Vivian and Son. On 13th Feb. we consigned to our agent at Rotterdam 300 bars—I have seen the bars produced here today—I find on them the initials that were on our's—this is our brass—the price of this metal is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; it is sold for bolting together the timbers of a ship—those consigned to Rotterdam were three quarters of an inch—these produced are the same size—our order was for 300 three quarters of an inch.</p>

On 29th June, I went up to my bed room, at the top of the house, at a little after 7 o'clock in the evening; I saw something pass the window outside, but cannot say what—you can walk on the gutter or on the parapet—I went down to my mistress's room, which is on the lower floor, about ten minutes afterwards, and missed a dressing case—my bed room window was open; it had been left open, it was not broken—a person might have got from the gutter in at the window and gone down stairs—the dressing case contained a necklace, a bracelet, a brooch, two scent bottles, and a handkerchief; I saw it safe at a little before six o'clock—it was worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with it's contents—there is an empty house a few doors off, from which it is possible for a person to get to that window—the dressing case was a foot long.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 29th Jan., about half past 7 o'clock I was in Cleve<lb/>land Square—a boy told me something, and I saw the prisoners and a tall man, who had a square box about a foot long, come out of No. 12, which is unoccu<lb/>pied—the box was loosely covered with a handkerchief, but I saw one corner of it—the man with the box closed the door behind him—Levy walked first, and I walked up to him, thinking I knew him—I observed him closely; the other man was about three yards behind him, and the other half a yard behind him—I can swear that both the prisoners are the men—they walked on towards Charles Street, towards the Great Western Railway terminus, and got out of my sight—I waited in the square, and Williams returned, and said, "What are those policemen doing there?"—I recognised him again, and said, "There has been a robbery;" he said, "Have they got them?" I said, "I do not know;" he said, "Did they detect the servants, or did the servants detect them?" and then said, "The men must have detected the servants first"—this was about ten minutes afterwards, about a quarter to 8—I was joined by Lucy Fowler—Williams walked towards</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of William Thomas Treggon. He has many warehouses and manufactories; one is at No. 66, St. John Street, and his counting house is in Jewin Street—he is in the habit of buying zinc and cuttings at the warehouse in St. John Street—Creasy was warehouseman there—it would be his duty to weigh the cuttings, and to give the persons bringing them a note or invoice—he ought to weigh them, and enter the weight in a day book and in the invoice ticket, then tear it out of the book, and give it to the person who brought the cuttings, and enter a copy of the weight on the counterfoil—the note which he would give to the vendor would serve as a receipt for his having received these cuttings, and, being presented in Jewin Street, the person would be paid the money for them—Creasy was not to pay any one, the money was paid in Jewin Street by me or by the cashier—I remember a note being handed to me on Monday, 23rd March—this is it—the writing on it is Creasy's—it is for 1 cwt. of cuttings—Foreman presented it to me—we should deduct 4 lbs. for the tare, and give him 16*. a hundred<lb/>weight—I wrote a note for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that he had received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before, and I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I deducted the tare, and gave him 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I produce the counterfoil of that transaction, No. 64—it is in Creasy's writing—in the day book there is an entry in Creasy's writing for 1 cwt.—the counterfoil No. 63 is not in the book, it has been abstracted—it ought to have been in the book; nothing ought to have been taken from the book—on Wednesday evening, 26th March, I was at St. John Street, when the two prisoners were taken—I heard Creasy ask to be allowed to retire to the water closet—I saw an officer follow him, and next morning these two notes and two counterfoils were given to me—the note was for 2 qrs. and the counterfoil, which has been torn out the book—they are both in Creasy's writing—they are both in a soiled state—I took the counterfoil book, looked through it in Creasy's presence, and asked him where the note was for the 2 qrs.; he said that he had destroyed it—I asked him where the counterfoil was; he said that he had destroyed it likewise—that was before he asked to retire—I heard the officer tell him he was taken for defrauding Mr. Treggon, and I think he said for obtaining money under false pretences—Creasy said that it was brought in in two parts, and there might have been about 1 cwt.—I asked him what he had done with the ticket for 2 qrs. which he first gave me—he said he had destroyed it—I turned it back to look for the counterfoil, and he said he had destroyed that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in No. 7, Queen Street, Kingsland Road. I am a plumber—I have a brother named Thomas—I knew Foreman about three years ago—he was then a marine store dealer—I met him in Kingsland Road, with another man, in Dec. last; my brother was with me—Foreman asked us whether we used new zinc, and said he could get us some cheap—he did not say anything about old zinc that day, he did afterwards; he said that he could get us a good price for old zinc or for new cuttings in St. John Street—in consequence of this I made a communication to Mr. Treggon and to the officer—on Sunday, 22nd March, I saw Foreman; he said that if I had any zinc or cuttings, he would go with them to-morrow, Monday—I said that I would call on him, and I met him on the Monday—I went to Mr. Riley's, in Hoxton, and there bought 2 qrs. 20 lbs. of zinc cuttings; while I was buying them Foreman went to a public house—I had the zinc weighed in presence of policeman <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 145—after I had procured this zinc, and weighed it, I met Foreman—the zinc was in a bag—I then went with Foreman to Mr. Treggon's; before we got there, Foreman said that he had rather take it in two bags, and it was accordingly divided, and taken in two bags—I went with him to St. John Street; Foreman went in with the first lot; when he came out, he said he had given the man that weighed it 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he had got a ticket for 2 qrs.—he showed me the ticket, and I gave it him back—he and I went in together with the second lot, and I saw Creasy there; after he had weighed it, he wrote out a bill for 1 cwt.—Foreman gave him the bill back for the 2 qrs., and he put a shilling on the bill—Creasy gave the bill for the cwt. to Foreman, and said, "There you are, I have made you a note, for a cwt."—this is the note—I and Foreman then went to Jewin Street, and while on the way Foreman told me he had given Creasy 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained outside while Foreman went into the office in Jewin Street—he came out, and said that he had given 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Foreman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had previously given him the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he gave to Creasy—I did not give him the penny—when I went in the second time, I saw the quantity weighed, and it weighed 1 qr. and 9 lbs.—on 25th March I went to Mr. Treggon's again—I had pre<lb/>viously bought 2 qrs. and 7 lbs. of zinc—I accompanied Foreman in, and I saw Creasy there, and there was another man standing within about a yard of the scale—I saw Creasy weigh the bag of zinc in that other man's presence—I saw Creasy make out the note for it—this is it—it is for 2 qrs. and 8 lbs.—when Creasy handed Foreman the note, I heard him whisper to Foreman that he should not come so late, he should come sooner—it was then about 6 o'clock—when I and Foreman got outside, we met <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 145, and he ordered us both to ftp back—I saw Mr. Gale there, and Foreman</p>

I got some more zinc, 1 qr.—I took that myself, and saw Greasy; he weighed it, and gave me this bill for 1 qr. and 8 lbs.—he said, "I had the beer next door"—when he weighed it, I put a small weight on the scale; he said, "We are not particular here"—he did not weigh the bag after the zinc was shot out—I took these notes to Jewin Street, and there I was paid the amounts 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I saw Foreman several times afterwards, and I think I gave him a shilling or two.</p>

On 20th March, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in High Street, Stratford, near the Bird-in-Hand public house, and saw the prisoner and another man, and a woman, who was discharged before the Magistrate, standing near the prosecutor's house—the two men went up the street, the contrary way, and the woman stood still to watch me—I went on a little way down the street to see another constable, Elliott; I told him something, went back again, and we heard a whistle—we came up the street behind a wagon, that we should not be seen, and when we got within a few yards of Mr. Tarrant's house they were all three together, coming to meet us—Cook, the man who got away, was carrying something, which afterwards turned oat to be sheet lead—the pri<lb/>soner tried to screen him from our view—he put his hands under his coat and walked in this way, so that we should not see what Cook had got—I said to the constable, "It is all right, they have got something"—Harries ran away, and Elliott after him—the man with the lead was too powerful for me—he kicked me on the knee and on the thumb—the lead fell from his jacket, and he got away—we went to the station with the woman and the lead—I then went to Mr. Tarrant's, and found that some lead had been re<lb/>moved from the top of the door porch, the lead fitted the place exactly; it was* safe at 10 o'clock, when I went on duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the sloop <hi rend="italic">Cunliff</hi>, of Hull, and reside at Hull. On Thursday, 12th March, I was in Greenwich, and met a woman, I went with her to a room, and gave her some money to fetch some drink—before she went out I put my watch under the pillow, and while she was out the prisoners came in and said that it was their room, and demanded half a crown for it—I said that they would get it—I missed my watch, and saw Davis go to the bed and take it from under the pillow; he gave it to me, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra for giving me the watch—he wanted some drink, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more for some—the drink did not come, and I said, "Never mind, show me the road to Greenwich Hospital, and I will go;" for I found myself in bad quarters, and wanted to get out; the prisoners went out with me, and they picked up another party, whom I cannot identify—it was then past 12 o'clock; it was half past 11 when I went to the house—they seemed to be acquainted with the third man—they pointed the road out to me, and I had just left them a step or two when I felt a blow on my head, and I felt a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch at the same instant—I did not see who struck me, but Davis came, and said, "What is the matter? what is the matter?"—I said, "You know what is the matter," and they all ran away—nobody else was near to me at the time to hit me but one of the three men—I screamed out "Police!" and afterwards saw them in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Robert Thomas Wells and Hesketh Davis Wells, firewood merchants, at Canal Wharf, Deptford. I know the prisoner Morris—he goes by the name of Harris—he is a wood<lb/>cutter—he had a particular part in the shed parted off where he worked—he works at so much per hundred—each man has a place, and keeps it sepa<lb/>rate—Burke was in the service as a carman—his duty was to come at 7 o'clock, when he had cleaned his horses, and then come to me and ask for his orders—on 23rd Feb., I gave him an order to take 1, 000 bundles of 14 in., and 1, 000 of 15 in.—he was to get the 14 in. from Morris, and the 15 in. from a person of the name of Collins—he was to take the 21, 000's, and also 500 of 15 ins., 1, 000 to Morley in Somers Town, 500 to Mr. Chambers, in Somers Town, and the other 1, 000 to some one else—he had no authority from me to take away more than 1, 000 of 14 in. that day—I gave the order—all orders go through me or Mr. Wells—each day we re<lb/>ceive an account from the men—Morris gave me his account of 1, 000 14 in to Burke—I saw Burke when he came home—I asked him, "What have you had? "—he said 1, 000 15 in. and 1, 000 of 14 in., and he paid me for the 1, 000 15 in., but nothing for the 14 in.—Mr. Gilbert had the 1, 000 14 in. accounts monthly—the value of 200 bundles of 14 in. is 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a widow; I manage a tobacco shop for Mr. Henry Augustus Bedwell, at Deptford Bridge—I have known the prisoner for two years; a relation of his lodged at one time in Mr. Bed<lb/>well's house, and part of the time the prisoner was there—he was very well acquainted with the premises—he was of times there alone—the old lady, his relation, had left for some time—on Sunday, 5th Oct., I went out about 11 o'clock in the morning; I locked the house up, and left no one in it—I am sure the back bedroom window was fastened—the street door was locked, and I had the key of the street door with me—I got home between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—I found my servant, Clara, waiting outside—she had tried to open the door, and could not get in—after I got in I found that the door was bolted inside—when I went out I had locked it; it could not have been bolted—I got Thomas Stannard, and I waited while he got over the fence at the back; he called out that all the back of the house was open—he opened the front door, and I got in, and found my bunch of keys on the mat—I had left them locked up in a drawer in my bedroom—I went in and found another key which had been in my bedroom—I had left the cash box on the counter, under some waste paper, when I went out; it had contained about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver; when I returned it had been moved, and was standing on a stool in the shop; it was open, and everything had been</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 34). On 31st Jan., I was employed to watch the premises of Mr. Waring, a tanner, of Spa Road, Bermondsey, part of which are in the occupation of Mr. Barrow—I placed myself in Mr. Barrow's house, and could see any persons who entered Mr. Waring's pre<lb/>mises—about 10 o'clock I saw Tobin and Vernon go to Mr. Waring's pre<lb/>mises—they took the direction of a shed which is there, and in a few minutes I lost sight of them; I saw Tobin alone, about twenty minutes afterwards, going out of the yard into Spa Road—I saw nothing more of him—between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon a man, named Butler, brought a truck there; it was drawn through the gateway, into Mr. Barrow's yard—he was followed by Vernon and Tobin, who shortly afterwards came out of the yard and separated—I proceeded to the end of the yard, and saw the truck, which had been taken in empty by Butler, loaded with hide pieces—I saw no more till about 6 o'clock, when I saw Tobin, Davis, and Broderick stan<lb/>ding at the corner of Mr. Barrow's gateway; they remained there a few minutes, and all three went up the yard—in two or three minutes Brode<lb/>rick and Davis brought the truck out and went up Spa Road, towards Grange Road—I lost sight of Tobin, but I believe he was in the yard—when they got into Grange Road, I took hold of Broderick, and said, "Where have you brought these things from that you have got in the truck"—he said, "We have nothing to do with it, we have been employed by a tall man"—I took him into custody, and placed him, for security, in a butcher's shop; and Smith, who was with me, took Davis—I then went into Spa Road, and met Tobin close by Mr. Barrow's premises—I said, "I want you to go with me on a charge of stealing some hide pieces belonging to Mr. Waring"—he said, "Do not talk to me about hide pieces, I know nothing about them; speak to my foreman, Mr. M'Laughlin"—I then took him into custody, and took him to where the other prisoners were—they were then all taken to the station, and Butler also—when the charge was stated against Butler at the station, he said, "I will tell the truth, all I know about it; Tobin gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to take the cart into the yard, and after it was loaded he wanted me to draw it out; but being told that something was wrong, I would not have anything to do with it;" the others said nothing in reply to that—I weighed the pieces I found in the truck; they weighed 2cwt. 2qrs. 18 lbs.—there was one bundle tied up, and the rest were loose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner, and occupy premises adjoining Mr. Wa<lb/>ring's tanyard, where there are pits for soaking hides and a shed. His pre<lb/>mises are divided from mine by a fence, and there is a gate from his pre<lb/>mises into the main road, which was fastened; there was no work going on, the frost had stopped it—I was on the premises on the Saturday and saw Tobin there, who I knew to be for some time in Mr. Waring's employ, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I had seen him there frequently, and had often gone through the yard—he came in through my premises, in consequence of the gate being fastened, and got over into Mr. Waring's premises, by jumping over the fence; there is tan on one side and some hides on the other, so that it was easy to get over—I saw him and another man who I had never seen before, get over in the morning; I went into the yard and heard the rattling of <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi> in the shed, but could not see anything—Tobin came and spoke to me when I was about the centre of the yard—he said that he had the key—I said that I had a great deal of property in the place, and I did not think anybody ought to go in who thought proper—he said that he came for 3 or 4 cwt of hide pieces, for samples, which were to be taken as soon as the cart came, and asked me if I had any objection to their bringing them by that road—I said, "No," and he went to the shed again—the other man must have been in the shed at that time, be<lb/>cause I heard him rattling the <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi> while Tobin was talking to me—Tobin returned to the shed and remained about twenty minutes; he then passed through my premises again and went out—when he had gone I still heard the noise of a man working in the shed for nearly an hour—I left the yard and returned between 2 and 3 o'clock—I then went to Mr. Waring's shed, and found two bundles of hide pieces tied up on the floor, but did not in<lb/>terfere with them—between 3 and 4 o'clock Tobin and another man came</p>

               <p>through the yard; I thought it was Butler, I am sure it was not the man who came with him first—they both went to the shed, and I observed them bringing a bale of pieces towards the top of the ladder on the upper floor—Tobin came down to the foot of the ladder and the other pushed the pieces after him—the other man attempted to lift it on his back, but it was too heavy, I suppose, and he dropped it—I afterwards saw the two bales brought over the fence; two of Mr. Acker's men, who has a, lease of the premises adjoining, assisted them and lifted the bales over—I did not see the other man at that time, I was in the adjoining premises and could not have seen if I had been there—they were loaded into a truck that was standing in my yard near the fence, by Acker's men—I was engaged on my own business at the other part of the yard and did not see who was assist<lb/>ing them—I did not see the truck moved away, as I left the yard, but I saw it at nearly 6 o'clock—there were three men standing outside the gate, but I cannot swear to them, it was nearly dark.</p>

Bevington's premises; that is not a quarter of a mile from Mr. Waring's—it would take about ten minutes to go, hardly that—Tobin went with me—he saw them unloaded, and then he went into the counting house—I did not see whether they were weighed or not—they were carried into a shed—I did not go into the counting house—when I came out, I saw Vernon waiting outside—Tobin paid me for the cart, and then joined Vernon—my cart had my name and address on it, "Thomas Merryman No. 14, Spa Road."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hide and skin merchant at Bermondsey. I have had many dealings with Messrs.

Bevington and Proctor—I have known Mr. Be<lb/>vington I should think these twenty years—he is at present churchwarden of the parish, and a trustee of the Free Grammar School at Bermondsey—during the whole time I have known him, his character has been the most straightforward of any in the trade—I have dealt with him for many years, and never had the slightest dispute in any way.</p>

Candy's, Esq., Well Field, Streatham—I placed inside it twelve penny postage stamps, and sealed it with adhesive gum, and gave it to Mr. Cole to post; that was about 12 o'clock in the day—later in the day, I saw that letter in the Post Office, in the Circulation department, where the letters are stamped; it was despatched that even<lb/>ing, and would arrive at Streatham, in due course by the evening bag—there is an 8 o'clock delivery at Streatham on Saturdays—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—it bears the midday stamp.</p>

On 16th March I received a letter from Mr. Sculthorpe—I posted it at the General Post Office, in the ordinary way, by dropping it into the letter box—this is the letter—in the course of that afternoon I went down to Streatham with Smee the officer—I inquired about the letter and found it had not been delivered—I waited as late as 9 o'clock—I then went to the neighbourhood of the prisoner's house and saw him on his return home—I stopped him and asked him if his name was Wright—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he was on duty when the 6 o'clock letters arrived from London—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he sorted the letters for delivery—he said he sorted some of them—I asked if he had seen a letter directed to James Denyer, C. Candy's, Esq., Well Field, Streatham—he said, no he had not—I said he must have seen it, for I could prove that it was sent down, and that I had seen the other letter carrier, who was prepared to make oath that he had not seen the letter (I had seen the other letter carrier)—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060145"/>
               <p>repeated that he had not seen it—I told him I knew better, and the reason of his not delivering it—I asked if he had any objection to let me see the con<lb/>tents of his pockets—he said, "None"—I then went with him into his house, accompanied by the constable and Pratt, the charge taker—I saw this pocket book taken from him, and took from it this envelope, folded up as it is now—it is addressed to Mrs. Denyer, No. 10, Devonshire Street, Queen Square, Holborn—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for having that in his possession—he hesitated—I said, "I can account for it, for this is the enve<lb/>lope given to you by young Denyer, to whom the letter I am searching for is directed"—I told him it was given him to enclose an order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he was to obtain—he said, he did not get the money order, for he had for<lb/>gotten who had given him the money—I said it did not appear that he had forgotten it, by his not delivering the letter, as directed, to the party—he said he thought that might be the party, from what another letter carrier had told him on the Saturday previous—I again asked him what had become of the letter—his wife, who was present, also asked him what he had done with it, and begged of him to tell me the truth; after hesitating a minute or more, he said, "I will show it you"—I said, "Where is it, then?"—he said, "I will go and show it you"—I sent Smee with him, I remained in the house—they returned in about twenty-five minutes, and Smee gave me the letter in question and four others—the letters themselves have been for<lb/>warded to the parties they were intended for, and I only produce the covers—when these letters were produced I asked the prisoner why they were not delivered—he said he had not had time—Smee told me, in his presence, where he had found them—I asked the prisoner if he had not been to No. 10, Streatham Common—he said, yes, he had—I said, "You have been to the Rookery, too, have you not?"—he said, yes, he had—I said, "Then those houses being on either side of Mr. Candy's, you must have passed his door to go to them"—he made no reply—he must have passed Mr. Candy's to go to the Rookery—the whole of these covers have the stamp of 16th March—they are within the prisoner's delivery—he was detained in cus<lb/>tody—I afterwards received from Pratt four letters and two newspapers, I produce the covers—they bear the Post Office stamp of 4th, 9th, and 12th March—I afterwards went to a field with Smee, and found seventeen or eighteen letters and three newspapers—I produce the covers, they appear all to bear the Post Office stamp of November—I also found ten others in the same field, bearing the December stamp—the whole of those letters are addressed to persons within the prisoner's delivery.</p>

Some<lb/>time in the month of March, about 11 o'clock in the evening, my house was safe; the shutters and doors were fast, I retired to rest, I saw the beef which I had bought, safe on the block—I was woke up by a noise, and about 4 o'clock I missed my beef—I found my house had been broken into—there was a shutter drawn out, and that was put up beside the other shutters—the beef was at the hack of the shop, they must have come in to get it—there is a piece of board against the shutters, and they must have got over that—the gas was alight when I came into the shop; I had put it out when I went to</p>

On Saturday morning, 28th March, I was on duty near Pike's public house; about half past 4 o'clock Powderhill came running out at a side door, and was followed directly by Leary and the prosecutrix, who laid hold of Leary, and gave him into custody for being concerned with <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi> in stealing 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or fifteen sovereigns, which he had snatched out of her hand at the bar—a woman picked up a half sovereign outside the door, and I told her she had better give it to the prosecutrix—on the way to the station. Leary said to her, "Do not you come up against me and I will go and find <hi rend="italic">Jessee</hi>, and turn you up six <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>," which I anticipate meant sovereigns—she said, "Very well, but the policeman must go with you"—I said, "No; I cannot allow a felony to be compromised in that way, you must both come to the station"—About two hours afterwards I was in Kent Street, in search of Powderhill; I saw him pursued by several people, and by a constable, calling "Stop thief!"—he had a different dress on—I afterwards found the coat he had had on in the White Lion, Kent Street; he claimed it at the station, and afterwards asked the Magistrate whether he might be allowed to have it; he has it on now—on the way to the station we were followed by a female, and a great mob of people, and he said, "Stop a minute, I want to see my wife"—I said, "Very well"—he said to her, "You may <hi rend="italic">turn Annie</hi> up three <hi rend="italic">quid, "</hi> meaning the proscutrix, "or we shall be <hi rend="italic">lagged."</hi>
