On the 18th of last month my door happened to be open, the prisoner came up stairs, and there being a hair-cloth on the stairs, we did not hear her. She went through a little parlour into the dining-room; I saw her there, and as she was going down stairs I stopt her. She had seven cups, and seven saucers, a tea-pot, a bason, and sugar-dish, all china, in her apron. I sent for a constable; she was taken before a justice, and committed; I have brought a cup and saucer of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention Haines's name to Cowley ?</p>
               <p>Royds. I did. (Four pieces of shalloon produced in court). These are all my property; two of them I had at Mr. Sky's, in Bucklersbury; the other four pieces that Pierce bought by Cowley he will not produce, nor tell whould he has disposed of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sky. My wife and my servant told me that Haines brought these two piece of bay to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>
               <p>Sky. My wife is near her time, and not in a capacity to attend here; and my servant is gone away to her own country.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I took the prisoner Haines up on the 22d of January, and took him before my Lord-Mayor, there these goods were produced, and I charged him with taking them from us; he acknowledged he had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warehouse mentioned at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can't say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any favour previous to this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told him, when I took him up, if he would confess every thing, it might be a means of making his case more favourable. He was very obstinate at first; he first confessed two pieces, after that four. I mentioned the bays, and part of them were produced before my Lord-Mayor, (a piece produced in court) this he owned there that he had taken; here is about ten or eleven yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these four pieces of shalloon and this bays?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260004"/>Prosecutor. The shalloons are worth about six pounds, and the bays about eighteen or nineteen shillings; these are all the goods I could fix upon at that time. (A piece of everlasting produced in court). The prisoner Haines acknowledged the taking of this from me, and said, before I saw it, it was a piece of cross-rib, which it is; but the mark being taken off, I cannot swear to it. Here is thirty yards of it. He owned he had carried it to Cowley, and said Cowley had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you charge Cowley with receiving these goods, knowing them to have been stolen?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Cowley owned to me he had sold some at little more than half the value; this piece of everlasting I found in his room.</p>

I asked him then how his friend came by them? he said he had them of a brother in Yorkshire, and had but two or three now and then; he asked thirty shillings a-piece for these two, I gave him twenty-six shillings a-piece. I have goods now at home that I bought from Yorkshire at twenty-four shillings, and other goods at twenty-eight as good as these.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This Pierce refused to give me an account what he had done with the pieces he bought of Cowley. We have some much dearer than these; we have from thirty shillings to four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pierce. Look at this bays; was what you bought of Cowley like these?</p>
               <p>Pierce. They were as near the quality to these as I can recollect. I inquired where he had them, he said they were sent him out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the shalloons you bought of Cowley ?</p>

               <p>Pierce. I can't be certain how long.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know the person you sold them to?</p>
               <p>Pierce. No, I do not; they were sold some to one person, and some to another, cut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't you give an account of any particular person?</p>
               <p>Pierce. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Please to ask him whether he sold them white or dy'd?</p>
               <p>Pierce to the Question. They were sold in the white cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no such thing as cutting, and wearing this white.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any book to produce to shew who you sold these goods to?</p>
               <p>Pierce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what you sold them for?</p>
               <p>Pierce. I sold them by the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How much per yard?</p>
               <p>Pierce. Fourteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I sent for this man to come and give his evidence here, he refused, and said no, I will not, when you shew me black and white I will come, but not before.</p>

            . Cowley was a lodger in my house; one evening he brought a piece of shalloon home, and desired me to look on it, he said he had it of one Haines; he desired I would tell him what it was worth per yard, I said, I could not justly tell, but said it was very slight, and might be worth about a shilling per yard. I have seen Haines twice at my house; I asked him how Haines came by such goods? he said, Haines told him it was given him in exchange for some old cloaths. Some time after that I found Cowley had some bays, which was about a fortnight before he was taken up; I understood that the bays was to be sold for a shilling or fourteen-pence per yard, which he had from Haines, then I told him I would inquire into the thing, fearing it was a bad affair, then he said he should be glad if I would go down to Haines's master; I went to Mr. Sky at the Green-man in Bucklersbury, and acquainted him with it, and desired he would endeavour to find it out, he said Haines lived with a bays-factor. In about an hour after Mr. Royds and Mr. Sky came to my house, there they found Cowley. I remember Cowley told me one day he was going to sell a piece of bays, and the people were going to stop him, and he told Haines of it, and Haines said to him, he could have brought his master and brother to have released him.</p>

I never saw the prisoner till before justice Fielding on that day, there was the bacon; he said a man was to give him a groat to carry the bacon to the Three-tuns, Fetter-lane, ( the bacon produced in court, and deposed to by the string it hung by, and the hole which the prosecutor cut to the gammon end ) after that the prisoner said a gentleman offered him two-pence or a grant to leave it at a constable's house, named Field, in Whetstone's-park by Lincoln's inn-fields, on the back of Holborn.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I was going along with two of my neighbours to see the fire about two in the morning, on the Wednesday morning, the first day of last sessions. Just as I came into Whetstone's-park, I met the prisoner with a piece of bacon at his back; I asked him how he came by it? he said his brother gave it him, and he was going to have it fry'd with some eggs. I said, I'll know how you came by it; he said he just came out of Mr. Field's at the Crown in Whetstone's-park, I went back there with him, Mrs. Field said he had been there with it, but she did not know how he came by it. I took him to the watch house, Mr. Field happened to be constable of the night; we found the next day who belonged to the bacon, and the prosecutor came, and the prisoner was committed to New-prison.</p>

               <p>I had been in Shoe-lane, and was going home, and just above Chancery-lane in Holborn, there I tumbled over the bacon. I took it up, and carried it to Mr. Field's the constable to see who owned it, I left it there, and found him at the fire, his wife had told me he was there, I told him I had left a piece of bacon at his house, I did not know whose it was, so I went and took it to carry it home, and just at his door. I met the watchman with the bacon on my back.</p>

The prisoner asked me to go along with him to the prosecutor's house at Ponder's-end, knowing nobody lived in it then, we went; he broke the lower hinge of the back-door, and I the other, about ten o'clock at night; then we went and looked about, and took away a warming-pan, a five-pint pewter tankard, a brass pot with a lid to it, a copper saucepan with a lid, two brass clock-weights, we carried them to Norton-falgate, and the prisoner sold them to a brasier in his shop, but I don't know his name.

            . On the 24th of January last, a quarter before twelve at noon, the two prisoners came up the court; I called out at the window, and asked them what they wanted? I came down stairs, stept to the door, and asked what they would have? I thought they were reading the bill upon the gate, lodgings to let. Lashershang asked if I had a room to let? I said, yes, gentlemen, I have one up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. In what language did he speak to you? (He having an interpreter in court).</p>
               <p>M. Baily. In English. He said, can we look at it? I shut my parlour-door with my left-hand, it is near the foot of the stairs; I thought they both followed me: Lashershang followed me a little way up, about ten or twelve stairs; the other called him, and said, come along. I hearing him below, ran down by Lashershang, and found my room-door open, and the watch gone, which was hanging up in the room when I shut the door. I should not have known the other to be the man, but he owned he was with Lashershang, and Lashershang shewed us him when he was taken, When I missed the watch, I turned to Lashershang, and said; where is your friend ? he has robbed me. I left him in my passage, and ran out; and a neighbour was standing at the end of the court, who said there was a man ran by him; then we looked, but saw nobody running: then I went and took Lashershang by the collar, and took him into the public-house; there was a Frenchman that lodges in the court, I desired him to go and talk to him, for he would not speak English: he threw his cloaths about, to show he had not the watch. I said he had it not, but his companion had. We took him before my Lord-Mayor, and was told he was gone to Guild-hall; we came back, and in the Poultry the little man was taken, but I did not see him taken; they were both taken before my Lord-Mayor, and searched, but De Blancourt had been gone an hour and three-quarter: they found nothing of the watch. My Lord-Mayor talked French to them, and explained it to me; for I did not know what they said: I never found the watch again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the parlour-door locked?</p>
               <p>M. Baily. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lashershang speak English ?</p>
               <p>M. Baily. Yes, he did, and in the Hole-in-the-wall alehouse after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you command the prospect of the door when you was on the stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Baily. No, I did not look behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for a person to be got out of fight in that time?</p>
               <p>M. Baily. Yes; for when I saw my door open, I turned round, and said to Lashershang, who was on the second stair, or there-abouts, where is your friend? he has robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said you had been up stairs for some minutes before?</p>
               <p>M. Baily. No, sir.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Flower-de-luce-court, Fleet-street; the day this watch was lost I was sent for to Mrs. Baily; I came into the Hole-in-the-wall, and saw Lashershang in custody; we took him in a coach to the Mansion-house; going by the Poultry-compter, came by the other prisoner; we were on foot then; this was as we came back from Guild-hall. Lashershang clapt his hand on the other's shoulder, and spoke French to him, and then lifted up his waistcoat, and clapt his hand to his pocket; the little man pushed off directly. There was another man in company with us; I said to him, certainly that is the man that was with him: I pushed after him, and catched him near the Royal-Exchange.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Lashershang speak English at the Hole-in-the-wall ?</p>
               <p>Acton. No, I did not. I said to the man, when I came to him, your friend wants to speak with you. He said, me go. They desired to be heard in French, and my Lord spoke to them in French, and they both spoke French to him; I could not understand the prisoners; they were both committed. I was before my Lord-Mayor twice after that; they spoke French then; I know nothing that passed there but what my Lord-Mayor told me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them make any resistance ?</p>
               <p>Acton. When a prisoner is in safe hands, he may very well go easy.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by pushing away?</p>
               <p>Acton. When a man runs away, that is pushing hard, I think.</p>
               <p>Lashershang's defence.</p>
               <p>I met my companion in Hays's court on the 24th of January; we went together in order to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260009"/> get a new lodging to lodge together; as one did understand the language, we could make shift to get one. In our walk we went to a chymist's, where there was a bill put up; but the lodging did not suit us. We proceeded, and went to where the prosecutrix lives; being there, the woman called to us out at the window, and asked us what we wanted? She came down stairs; I met her about four steps from the bottom, the door being open; I went up after her about half way up the second story, and asked if there were any more? She said, yes. I said it will not do. Then my companion called me down; when I came down I did not see my companion. After she had looked into the parlour she seized me, and went to the end of the alley, to ask if any body had seen the person. She met a man at the last door in the court, and asked him if he had seen a Frenchman go that way? He said, no. I remained with my arms across till her return; and when she came back I went into an alehouse, and was there a quarter of an hour, without knowing what she wanted with me. I said they might search me. They went for a constable, and took me in a coach to my Lord-Mayor. At my coming from my Lord-Mayor my companion came and asked where I had been? and said he had been looking for me. I said I was in the hands of a constable. He said he would go and seek for help for me. As I was going to apply for a friend, I made motion to let the people know that was my companion. They took us to my Lord-Mayor, and searched us, and found nothing but a little money upon us. After having been in prison seven days, my Lord-Mayor let me out to come upon my own recognizance, and now I appear.</p>
               <p>De Blancourt's defence.</p>
               <p>The reason why I went out of the court first was, because I was not within the house but staid without; being got into Fleet-street, I looked several ways for my companion, but could not see him; at last, when I met with him, I rebuked him for having hid himself. He said he was in the hands of the constable; I told him I would get a friend to help him; upon which I was going, and two men pursued me, and said, master! upon which I stopt, and asked them what they wanted? They said, a Frenchman, a friend of mine, wanted me. I said I was willing to go. Then I went back, and we were carried before my Lord-Mayor, and were examined apart in French and English, and what we said my Lord-Mayor was so kind as to give it them in English.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two years: he came to my house on the 30th of November about eleven, and staid till between twelve and one; he came again about three in the afternoon, and went away between five and six. I had eight guineas and two thirty-six-shilling pieces in my bureau in the room where he and I sat, which was locked. I had occasion to go up stairs about three or four o'clock, and left him alone for about fifteen minutes. My keys were all in a bunch together, left in the book-case lock which was over the bureau. When I came down I found him sitting where I left him, and the keys where I had left them. And between nine and ten at night I had occasion to go to my money, and missed four guineas. I had lodgers above, but I could suspect nobody but the prisoner at the bar, having left nobody alone in the room but him, from the time I had seen it to the time I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>C. Hogg. I had taken three half-crowns out that morning when he was there, and it was safe then.</p>

            . On the 4th of December I heard Mr. Pickering say to the prisoner, go to Drury-lane and fetch a load of tallow: he went through Bow-yard, Mrs. Pickering said, that is the wrong way. He said it is the right way to where I am going. I went to the prisoner in Ludgate, and I asked him how he could go to sell Mr. Pickering's cart and horses? he said, I own I am a rogue, but Gilbert is a bigger, for once before I sold him a cart and two horses for three guineas and half, and he sold one of the horses for six pounds, and what he did with the cart and other horse he did not know. He said then he had sold these, and he had taken two guineas of the money, if not more; Watson was with us at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Watson. What did you hear the prisoner own ?</p>

            . I live at the Crown and Star, Leaden-hall-street; my brother is a linen-draper; the prisoner came into our shop under a pretence of buying some handkerchiefs; I shewed him some, he said they would not do, and desired to see some more; when I went to take some more down, I saw him going to put some under his coat from off the counter; I tur ned about and looked at him, and he dropped them: I would not shew him any more. Then he wanted to see a piece of check for an apron for his mother; as I was going to take down some to shew him, I saw him put his hand amongst the handkerchiefs and took up this piece, containing two handkerchiefs (producing it) and put it under his waistcoat-flap; then he said he saw there was no check that would do for him, and was going out; I laid hold on him before he got out of the shop. I charged him with the handkerchiefs, he denied them. Upon lifting up his waistcoat I found them upon him; I secured him, and sent for my brother; he was taken before my Lord-Mayor, where he owned the fact, and was committed.</p>

            . I am a victualer at the bottom of Clerkenwell-green, I think it was on the 13th of February about half an hour after five o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a watchman, who told me there had been two men at Mr. Newel's vaults; I went with him, and pursued and took the prisoner Humphrys with a cask full of something on his shoulder, about three hundred yards from the vault; I took him to justice Withers, he committed him, and ordered me to take care of the cask, and what was in it, it has been in my custody ever since. ( Produced in court).</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Newel, I take care of these wine-vaults, I believe there is about twenty gallons taken out of a half hogshead; on the twelfth, being the day before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260012"/> the robbery, I and my master was in that vault, I looked over the cellar and examined the vessels to see if they were tight and full, all was right then; the constable called me up the next morning about five, I got up and went down into the vault, I found the lock of the outward door pushed back, and some blood on the lock and the door; the lock was broke off from the inward door; I examined the casks, and there was about twenty gallons missing out of one half-hogshead.</p>

               <p>Q. Had that been tapped ?</p>
               <p>Apletree. It had not.</p>

            . I am a watchman; going from Mr. Harlow's to call the hour five in the morning on the 13th of February, I met the two prisoners; they crossed over the way from Mr. Newel's vault. Humphrys was first, with this cask on his shoulder; and the other prisoner had a lesser cask on his shoulder, and a pewter cratie (produced in court). I saw the door stand open; I asked them what business they had there ? They said, they were coming again, there was more behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that answer ?</p>
               <p>Isaac. I do not know whether they meant more wine or more men behind. I went to the vault-door and halloold; but none answered. Then I went directly to Mr. Harlow's, and told him what I suspected, and said I believe they were gone down Mutton-lane. He came, and we overtook Humphry about Ward's-rents; he had the biggest cask on his shoulder, and thi bottle of wine in his pocket ( producing one). We took hold of him; he fain would have had us take the wine, and let him go about his business; but Mr. Harlow said he would not compound felony. We told him to his house, and I went and called Mr. Newel. Milbourn was taken between the hours of six and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Look at the bottle, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know it to be mine, it is marked as I mark all my full quarts with a long J upon the neck of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is in the two casks ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is Mountain; I believe them to be both filled out of the half hogshead of mine.</p>
               <p>Isaac. I was gone to bed when Wilbourn was taken, and out of, I believe, a dozen I pitched upon him; I asked what was become of the crane he had on his shoulder? he said he had lost it, his wife was then with him, I threatened to stop her, she went and produced the crane, and said Humphrys ordered her to carry it away. Mr. Newel asked him whose crane it was? Humphrys said it was his, he also owned it had been carried to Wilbourn's house, and into Sharp's-alley.</p>
               <p>Humphrys's defence.</p>
               <p>I beg mercy of the court.</p>

            . I live in Monmouth-street; on Wednesday was a week the prisoner came to my door; I asked her if she had any thing to sell? She said she had. She came in and opened the gowns, and said she was obliged to make up some money, and must part with them, and she chose rather to sell them out and out, rather than to pawn them. She asked me three guineas for them; I bought them of her for two guineas and a half. Mr. Shootes came to me the next day with two women; they wanted to buy some; we shewed them these. Then he went out and fetched a search-warrant, and claimed them. She was taken up, and I knew her again before the justice.</p>

               <p>My mistress was in a great hurry to have the work done, so I took these things home to finish; I had drank a dram, and my head was very light; I went home and drank two more drams, and was not capable of doing any thing; I was not sensible of what I did. I had some money to make up that day; I went and made money of these things; after which the prosecutor agreed, and made it a debt, and took my things in part of payment.</p>

I took her before the justice, she confessed she had taken them away, and sent them to be pawned by

            . Last Monday about nine or ten o'clock the prosecutrix came to my shop in Hounsditch, and said she had been robbed by her servant; we went into Barbican to the prisoner's husband, and told him his wife had robbed the prosecutrix; he said he would go along with us to a pawnbroker's where she used; he went to Mr. Armsted's in Redcross-street, there we found five napkins, a neckcloth and a pillowbear. We met with a person who told us she was set out for Shrewsbury; I went to the book-keeper, and was informed by him that one of the name was in the waggon, I got a house and followed her, and before I came to Upper-holloway overtook the waggon, and took her out, and told her she had robbed Mrs. Coleman; I sent for a constable, and brought her back to London. She confessed to me she had robbed Mrs. Coleman of two petticoats, a silk gown and a shirt.</p>

I went as fast as I could over the houses after them, and when I got within one house of them I heard murder cried before me, it seemed to come from a place where they dry cloaths upon some leads; I went as fast as I could over the other house, then I saw two women in their shifts on the leads, screaming out, and desired I would come to them as soon as I could, for there were some thieves broke into their house; I desired them to stand on one side, and I jumped down to them, and bid them not be afraid, and said I would go search for them, for they had robbed my house, and I was in search of them.

            , an evidence here, was taken about three houses from that house I pursued them to, in a garret or cock-loft, he was put in the round-house; I went there to him, and asked him how he could do such a thing as to break into my house and rob me? he denied it. I went home, and in about a, quarter of an hour I came again, then he told me that he was at the top of the house and saw me, that betwixt eleven and twelve he and the two prisoners broke into my house; as soon as they entered the door, Marchant drew a knife, and swore he would stab the first that met them; they took the three sheets in the one pair of stairs, and went up into the garrets, there they thought to begin at the top, and strip the house to the bottom, and my wife was ready to lie-in in the two pair of stairs, and that the two prisoners were for strangling her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know of her being there?</p>
               <p>Price. They heard she was then in labour, and had two women with her; then the evidence said, no, no, she has been a good mistress to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Price. He had, about two months, some time before; the woman going up disturbed them, so they got out at the trap-door, and made out with the three sheets, they went one way and he another, and he lay betwixt some chimnies all night; then he told me where they were to be found. We went, and carried them before justice Bedwell. Myers owned there he had been along with the other two, and coming down Drury-lane he tried to get in at some houses, but coming to my house he did not go in. Marchant said much the same, he owned he was at my house with Evans, they both said they were not in, and they also said they took nothing away, upon their being charged with the three sheets.</p>

            . I am sixteen years of age; I have known the two prisoners about three months, their master, Mr. Preston in Brown's-gardens, St. Giles's, is a dust-man, and hires them to go about to take other peoples properties from them. I went to the King's head at the Seven-dials on Saturday the 25th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, called for a pint of hot there, and saw the two prisoners sitting; they asked me if I would go out a thieving with them?</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by yourselves?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes, we were in a box by ourselves, they asked me privately, there were two or three other people in the house. I said I would; we went out to rob the first house we could, by breaking it open; we went down St. Martin's-lane, but found no house convenient till we got to Mr. Price's, I had lived servant there, when we got there it was about eleven o'clock. Myers lifted up the latch, and found the door fast, it has a spring-lock to it; they both put their backs to the door, and it flew open. We heard a rumbling up stairs, what it was we could not tell; then Myers drew his knife in the entry, and swore he would kill the first person that offered to make any resistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260017"/>Q. Are you sure it was Myers ?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, I am sure it was Myers; then we went and took three sheets in a flat, such as they bring butter in; they were in the entry; then we went up stairs, and I left them in the one pair of stairs, and went up into the garret. Mrs. Price was very bad up two pair of stairs; I bundled up a pair of breeches and a shirt, two frocks, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said relating to her?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, when the woman came up stairs with a little girl, I crept under the bed, and the two prisoners ran out on the tiles at the trap-door. I heard the maid go down, then I crept from under the bed, and went out on the tiles. The two prisoners jumped down on a little sort of a lead, and I saw a door open. Mr. Price came before I could have time to jump down. Mr. Price was near me, and I saw two women come out and cry murder. Mr. Price left off looking any more after us. We had bundled up a pair of leather breeches, and a shirt; but did not take them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a fustian frock taken away?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost one, but cannot be sure it was that night. I observed the lock to the outer door was forced the next morning; it was a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there mention made of killing Mrs. Price?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, not as I heard. When Myers talked of killing the first person, I said, may-be my mistress may come down first; she has been a very good mistress to me; don't go to do any murder.</p>

When I came back, in about two hours and a half, I found the door of my chair open (I had shut it when I left it) the cushion was gone. The Sunday following, a constable that is here, came to me, and asked me if I had lost any thing? I described the cushion I had lost. The prisoner was in St. Margaret's round-house; I went, and he took the prisoner to his house; there he said it was her cushion, and a gentleman's servant gave it her. We took her before justice Ledia rd, where she kept in the same story.</p>

            . The prisoner asked me to buy some old cloaths on the 25th of January in Dean's-yard. I went with her to the pawnbroker's, she asked for the things she brought the night before; then this cushion, and the calimanco cover to it, were produced. I would not have it, but before it was produced, I, as is usual in buying things at pawnbrokers, laid down two shillings and a penny; she took up the two shillings, and the pawnbroker the penny; when I saw what it was, I would not have it, but they would not deliver my money back again. I went home, and told my mistress of it. She ordered me to go and fetch the cushion. I went to the pawnbroker the next day, and asked for it; he made me give two shillings and a penny more, and delivered it to me. Then I carried it to Mr. Mantor the constable, and went and brought the prisoner there; but she thought that she was going to have some beer, as it was a public-house. Then they asked her if she knew the cushion? She said, yes; and said it was her property. Then she was taken before the justice, and said that it was her own, and was from thence committed to the Gatehouse.</p>

Booth took it, and said he knew a man near the Seven-dials, named Morgan, that bought stolen things, we went both there; the prisoner went in, and I heard him ask Morgan's wife whether they would buy the saddle? I staid at the door, she said her husband was ill, and desired him to leave it; then he desired her to lend him 2 s. upon it till the Monday, which she did.</p>

I asked the prisoner a great many questions, he said he lodged with Mr. Finsham a peruke-maker in the neighbourhood, and said he was a taylor, and wanted a little money, to buy some cloth to make a surtout coat, and that I need not be afraid of losing my money, for Mr. Bundock, a Hair-merchant at the next door, and all the gentlemen in the street, that is, King-street, Tower-hill, knew him very well, and said he wanted only two guineas: when I was going to lend it him, he desired half a guinea more, and said that would buy trimmings. On the Thursday it was advertised, I went to Mr. Finsham to know if he had a taylor lodged there? he said he had, I saw him, he is much about the size of the prisoner, but different in his cloaths. Mr. Finsham asked me what was the matter ? I told him a silver tankard had been stolen, and pawned by the name of

               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was accusing an innocent person, and the prisoner was by about four or five in that afternoon, and I observed the prisoner's countenance to change, so I suspected him; and on the 26th of December, I saw an advertisement in the paper, of a lid of a silver tankard offered to be sold at Mr. Stevens's, a goldsmith, at the  without Bishopsgate. I went there with the body of the tankard, and saw the lid was the same that was taken off. I desired him to describe the man who brought it; he described the prisoner both in person and cloaths. I went and found him at the Golden-key alehouse in Cock-lane, Spitalfields, the same night; the next morning I took him before my Lord-Mayor, with the lid of the tankard, and the four yards of linen cloth, he having before that told me where he had sold that. There I accused him of the robbery; he acknowledged every thing, and said he had nobody with him in the doing it. He said he broke the door with a ripping chissel, and that he tried at the other door, but could not get it open, where we found the wood broke by wrenching it. He also said he was in the house with a lighted candle an hour and half; that he broke open the drawers where the goods were, and that he had disposed of the large silver spoon at Mr. Lloyd's, a little on the other side Mr. Stevens's in Bishopsgate-street; and the four yards of cloth to Mrs. Goldfinch, near the Cock, where I took him; the handkerchiefs I did not search after.</p>

               <p>James Dredge. I am book-keeper at the King's-arms, Holborn-bridge; I saw the prisoner at the bar jump up at the tail of a cart, and take a basket out this day se'nnight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart going?</p>
               <p>Dredge. It was coming into the yard, (the basket produced) this is the basket. I was before the alderman when the prisoner was there, the prisoner said he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the cart ?</p>
               <p>Dredge. I was within five yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you secure the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dredge. Directly, with the basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this is the basket?</p>
               <p>Dredge. I took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner any time in the yard before?</p>

               <p>John Griffin. I have the care of Mess. John and Caple Hanbury's tobacco; I was present when fifty hogsheads of tobacco were put on board a lighter, three or four days before the 11th of December, at Gally-key; it lay down at Union stairs, just beyond the hermitage on the Middlesex side. I saw every thing safe, and covered it with a tarpaulin, on the 11th, about four in the afternoon. The next morning I heard there was some tobacco missing, and that the custom-house people had taken two men and some tobacco. I went and saw the tobacco, it weighed two hundred pounds and a half. (He produced two hands of tobacco.) One I took out of a hogshead that was opened and had some stole from, and the other is of that the officers had taken; I can swear to them to be of one hogshead. I have had to do with tobacco for thirty years, and I know these to be Mess. Hanbury's tobacco, as well as I know my two gloves to be fellows. There was one hogshead opened, and better than a third part of the tobacco gone. On the 13th I had been to see the man that impeached the prisoner in the Compter. After that I went to the prisoner, and told him what the other, named Hedges, had said; that is, that the prisoner and one Tolly were with him in the affair. He said that he was in the boat, and Hedges handed it to him out of the lighter, and said he would get Tolly if he could.</p>

On the 11th of December he and I went down to Deptford, to meet a ship to bring her up.

We went down to Cherry-garden-stairs, where lay the prisoner's boat; we got in her, and went to Union-stairs, there lay this lighter with tobacco; this was between eight and nine in the evening; we saw nobody stirring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the tobacco?</p>
               <p>Hedges. It was covered with a tarpaulin; Tolly went into her, and took some tobacco out, and handed it to the prisoner, who stood upon the lighter's gunnel, and he handed it to me into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tolly take it out of the hogshead ?</p>
               <p>Hedges. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of tobacco was it?</p>
               <p>Hedges. It was dark, I cannot tell what sort it was; we were going on shore with it, and in the middle of the river two Custom-house officers came soul of us, and took me, and brought me to the Poultry-compter; Tolly jump'd over-board, and the prisoner got in a boat with a pair of oars, that came along-side of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Who belonged to that oars boat?</p>
               <p>Hedges. I can't tell who they were; I believe the prisoner had not been in that boat above a minute before I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hedges. It was quite dark.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a waterman?</p>
               <p>Hedges. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you talk of the prisoner's boat?</p>
               <p>Hedges. Because he hires that boat of Mrs. Potter at 1 s. 6 d. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know what scheme you was going upon at setting out?</p>
               <p>Hedges. I don't know whether he did or not; he and Tolly sent for me to the Red-lion.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they tell you there?</p>
               <p>Hedges. Tolly said he had bought some tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand they were going to steal tobacco?</p>
               <p>Hedges. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think when they went to the lighter and took it?</p>
               <p>Hedges. I was surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to them when you saw them take it?</p>
               <p>Hedges. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether I sent for him, or he for me?</p>

             and I were in a boat, betwixt the Hermitage and Union-stairs we saw a vessel come from a ship's stern, where this lighter lay with the tobacco; we rowed and laid hold of the boat, and said, what have you got here? a man said, d - n your eyes, what is that to you; we said, we are officers; one of them said, if you are officers, d - n your eyes, you shall go over-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who said that?</p>
               <p>Dunkin. It was dark, I do not know; my partner said, if I do, you shall go too; he jumped into our boat, I had hold of theirs; they had a skirmish in the boat, and in the scuffle they both went over-board; my partner called out, Joe, I am over-board, lift me up; I let go their boat, and got him into ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he that fell over-board with your partner?</p>
               <p>Dunkin. I don't know; after I had got my partner in, we rowed to their boat, and I laid hold of their boat with my left-hand; a man said, if I would not let go he would cut my hand. I said, then cut away: he took a knife and cut my fingers. I let go, then they rowed away round the same fare which we saw them come out from. I knowing an officer which was upon the river, named Norman, called out for help, and said, draw your cutlaces and come; this I said to affright them; we rowed and got up to them a second time, then they got up and stood two of them with scullers, and the other with the water-board of the boat; we defended ourselves as well as we could, the man with the water-board jumped into my boat and made a stroke at me, and broke his board, then he, like a spaniel dog, jumped over-board; I went to shove after him with my sculler. I saw his hat as he swam, but I could not go so fast as he; after that I jumped into their boat and took Hedges by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was in the boat at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260026"/>Dunkin. There was none but he.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man?</p>
               <p>Dunkin. I do not know which way he got off. I asked Hedges where the other man was? he said he was got into an oars boat, the tobacco lay in the boat; then Hedges said it was his venture, and hoped we would not be too hard with him, but let him have some of it. We carried it to his majesty's Custom-house and weighed it, it weighed two hundred and a half and eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I offer to molest you in any shape?</p>
               <p>Dunkin. They all three opposed us, but I could not then distinguish the prisoner from the rest.</p>

             on the river Thames, we saw a boat come away from a ship between the Hermitage and Union-stairs, we rowed after her, and came up on one side her, there were three men in her, two rowing and one sitting, we told them we were officers belonging to his majesty's customs, and would see what they had; they said, d - n your eyes, we have nothing for you, and you have no business here.

             about five minutes before we had seen this boat, I called for his assistance, we could hear nothing of him, but Mr. Blundel and his waterman came up, and right against East-lane we endeavoured to board them again, two of them stood with the scullers, and the other with the water-board; one of them struck at me, I bobbed and jumped into their boat among them; one of them jumped over-board, I cut him down the head with my hanger, he swam to shore; a pair of oars came and took in another, I tripped Hedge's heels up and laid him down in the bottom of the boat; then Mr. Blundel. came and opened his lanthorn and looked at the tobacco lying loose in the boat, he said this is stolen tobacco; then we rowed up to his majesty's warehouse; after that we carried Hedges to the Poultry-compter, he said he would impeach his consorts if I would get him admitted an evidence, and gave in the names of Tolly and the prisoner in writing. I left him and went down to the Custom-house, there I saw his wife, whom I had known several years, and the prisoner was along with her.</p>

            . I was going down to attend the tide; I had not been on the water above two or three minutes before I heard a cry for help. I ordered my waterman to row, I thought somebody had tumbled over-board; we came alongside the boat, which gave the officers fresh courage to attempt their adversary a second time; I saw the men strike with their oars and water-board. I drew my tuck and said, if they struck the men I would run them through.</p>

               <p>Goodfellow. I was; I heard the prisoner desire to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Dunkin again. Before the prisoner went before the alderman, he told me he was hired as a waterman by the other two; I asked him if he was a waterman? he said no, but he hired a boat of the widow Potter.</p>
               <p>Griffin again. The prisoner told me he went and rowed down the river after Hedges was taken, to see if he could find the tobacco that same night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of December last, Hedges, Tolly, and I had been to Deptford looking after a ship; after we came up, we went to the Red-lion, there we had some beer; they both went away and left me; in about an hour after they came again, and desired the favour of me to give them a cast over to Union-stairs. I said, I am going home, it is all in my way, with all my heart, come along. We went and got into the boat; when we came to pass by this vessel, they desired me to put them on board her, and said they wanted to speak with an acquaintance of theirs. I clapt them on board, and had some water in my boat, and went to heave it out. Hedges got into the lighter under the covering, and Tolly was upon the gunnel; he hove a cask of tobacco into my boat; it fell upon my knees, I heaved it off my knees, and said, what the duce are you upon; I will not suffer this thing. Then Tolly swore he would knock my brains out if I offered to make any words. He took my hook-rope and made it fast, and brought the tobacco, and Hedges handed it to me.</p>

On the 1st of January we were to have company to supper, the maid was ordered to clean the spoons, and bring them down stairs. She presently came down, and said she must go out. We told her, as we were to have company, she must not go. Then she begged for three-quarters of an hour; we let her go, but she never returned. Then we received a letter, which the prisoner at the bar said she wrote. We took the prisoner on the 4th of January, and before justice Clark she there owned that her daughter gave her the things at her request, and she had pawned them: and by her direction we found the table-spoon and sattin waistcoat at Mr. Woolridge's, and two shirts and one sheet pawned to Mrs. Waters. She owned to them, but would to no more. I once catched her at my house, by getting up sooner than ordinary; then I did not know who she was; she told me she came from my maid's mother, and she was very ill. The maid had been out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260028"/> the night before, but did not say, at her return, that her mother was ill. After that came the sister, and told me her mother was recovered. We found some of the goods after at Mr. Brunkley's, pawn'd by the prisoner.</p>

            ; they would not confess any thing. I have had extreme losses in having silk and bobbins taken away, my books have been continually deficient in the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the silk and bobbins be taken away without your knowledge ?</p>
               <p>Pearson. Yes: on my mill is one hundred and sixty bobbins; there are always a number of bobbins-given out, may-be ten or twenty, in order to supply the mill; as often as a bobbin runs empty in the mill, they put a full one in, and take that out; and if a servant makes a mistake in telling a number of bobbins to the mill, the person has an opportunity of taking that bobbin away; we deliver them all full, and they return them empty; if they return us our number of empty bobbins, we know not but they have been honest; if they have taken away full ones, and drawn the silk off at their own homes, they can put in an empty bobbin, instead of a full one, then they may take away a full one for themselves every time they go out of the shop; for we suppose every empty bobbin they return they had away full.</p>

               <p>Court. Let the court know how you knew they were Mr. Pearson's bobbins.</p>
               <p>M. James. Because the first letter of his name was on them.</p>
               <p>Q. What letter is that?</p>
               <p>M. James. It was a P.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to know they were his than by that letter being on them?</p>
               <p>M. James. No, I have not; only I know there is no other name of that letter in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it only P?</p>
               <p>M. James. It was, if there are two of a name in the trade, then one is wrote out at large; I took up one of them and asked Baxter how she came by that? she took it out of my hands, and said, what is that to me; I did not know but she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260029"/> might have them out of Mr. Pearson's shop to wind; I had not known her long then.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is it customary with you to deliver bobbins out in order to be worked at their own houses?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, it is, my lord, it would be impossible to carry on business without doing it. I have had about 800 work-people myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. James. What sort of silk was this you saw?</p>
               <p>M. James. It was silk round the bobbins, and a bundle of skains wrapped in a coarse cloth.</p>

            . I have known both the prisoners a great many years. I went to Mrs. Winter's house in the beginning of June last, she told me she had got a considerable quantity of silk in her house, I saw there an earthen stein full of bobbins and silk. I took it out and told the bobbins, there were twelve full tram-bobbins, six single, and three leaves of China silk, and six small slips.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call tram-bobbins ?</p>

            . I live in Ratcliff-highway, I wind silk; the prisoners live in the same landlord's rents as I do, they owed him a sum of money; I think it was on the 4th of June the landlord sent a person to put a padlock on their door; they asked me to let them be in my lodgings till they got a being of their own.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms have you?</p>
               <p>E. Winter. I have two; I gave them liberty to be with me. They brought an earthen stein full of bobbins and silk with them, in the whole there were 12 tram-bobbins, six single bobbins, three leaves of China silk, six slips, and some skains of silk, but they were so small I did not tell them; they bid me hide the stein in the corner of the room, I did not like their proceedings, and made them shew it to Mrs. Lawson; she told me if I would carry it to Mr. Pearson's house next morning he would give me a guinea for my breakfast. I said then it shall fall into somebody else's hands, for I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever work for Mr. Pearson.</p>
               <p>E. Winter. No, I never did; Mrs. Lawson desired me to get it out of my house as soon as I could; then I went to Baxter on the Monday-morning, and desired her to come and take the stien out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she?</p>
               <p>E. Winter. She was at work at home, she was but three days at our house before her landlord let her in again to her lodgings. She asked me what I was afraid of, and did not come to fetch it away, so I took and carried it to her lodging; about six weeks after this, I was complaining one day how bad my work was, Baxter said, don't be uneasy about your waste, for I'll bring you two bobbins to draw off in the room of it, but my husband would not let me have it.</p>
               <p>Baxter's defence.</p>
               <p>I had two shops of work, I work'd a parcel for one, and a parcel for the other; I never had any of the prosecutor's bobbins or silk in my charge but when I work'd for him in his shop.</p>
               <p>Gill's defence.</p>
               <p>I have work'd for Mr. Pearson, but I never wronged him of the value of a pin; I never had any of his work in my charge but what I worked in his shop.</p>

            . I don't know that I ever saw the prisoner before the 21st of January, on which day I had been at Buckingham-street, York-buildings; returning home I accidentally met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>Otway. It was about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet her?</p>
               <p>Otway. I believe it might be somewhere in <placeName id="t17550226-46-crimeloc251">the Strand</placeName>

At the corner of Burleigh-street she shied away, as if she wanted to get from me. When I found that, I thought she had got something from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house?</p>
               <p>Otway. I was going to my house in Holborn; I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my watch; she was at a little distance from me, I ran and laid hold of her, and charged her with stealing my watch; she told me she knew nothing of it. I said she must know it, because nobody had been in my company but her. She wanted to get away; I called for assistance; two watchmen came and asked what was the matter? I said, I believed that woman had got my watch. They were going to take her to the watch-house; as we were going along the Strand, she made a full stop, and said she would go no farther; the watchmen said she should. When she found they would not let her go, she said to the watchmen, if they would go into Burleigh street, she thought they might find it; so we went back, and going along Burleigh-street, Allen, one of the watchmen found a watch near a pawnbroker's door; he said to me, I have found a watch, but I don't know whether it is yours or not. I told him if it had not the marks which I should give of it, it was not mine. He put it in his pocket, and when we came with the prisoner to the constable, he delivered it to him. The constable asked me the marks of it. I told him I could not be positive of the No. but believed it to be 1622. I said it was a silver watch, and had Crook, London, on the dial-plate. In the morning we went before Justice Cox, who committed the prisoner to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing there?</p>
               <p>Otway. No; she told the justice I was in liquor, and might drop the watch there; she said she saw it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came from Buckingham-street, was you sober or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Otway. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it in your pocket when you came from thence?</p>
               <p>Otway. I am sure I had, because the prisoner saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met the prisoner in the Strand; how came you to Burleigh-street? Is that the nearest way from Buckingham-street to Holborn?</p>
               <p>Otway. I thought it was that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came first into Burleigh-street, had you been as far as where the watch was found?</p>
               <p>Otway. No, I had not; she was gone on there, and might have laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you got into Burleigh-street when she wanted to get away from you?</p>
               <p>Otway. I was got just in at the corner.</p>

            . I am a Watchman; on the 1st of February last, I had just finished calling the hour one; I came to the Golden-lion tavern, when the prosecutor called watch! I went, and he was at the corner of the street; he told me a woman had robbed him of his watch, and she was just gone up the street; and followed, and caught hold of her, and said this is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she got up the street?</p>
               <p>Allen. She was got up about two or three doors; he gave me charge of her, and I was going to take her to St. Martin's round-house; I brought her down Burleigh-street; when we got facing the Globe alehouse by the Savoy-steps, she said, this man has been rude with me; he got me up into a door-way in Burleigh-street; and pulled out what he had, and very possible his watch might drop at that time. She insisted upon going no farther; but said, if we would go back with her to either Burleigh-street or Exeter-street, we should find the watch. We returned back, and going up Burleigh-street, at the sixth door on the left-hand, (a pawnbroker's,) there I picked up the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who saw the watch first?</p>
               <p>Allen. I did; the woman having said he had had her up in a door-way, I went on and looked in all the door-ways I came at. The watch lay with the glass downwards; but that was not broke, and the watch was going. I put it in my breeches-pocket, and said to the prosecutor, I have picked up a silver watch, as you say yours is, it may be yours; you must describe the name and the number when you come to the watch-house. We went there, and I delivered it to the constable of the night. The prosecutor described the watch, and told the maker's name, but could not tell the number. The next morning we went before justice Cox, there the prisoner said she did see the watch, and that they would find it either in Burleigh-street or Exeter-street.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house about a quarter after one in the morning by the prosecutor and two watchmen. Allen, one of the watchmen, gave me this watch (producing it ). I put it into my waistcoat pocket, and asked Allen if he had shewn it to the prosecutor after he had picked it up, he said he had not; then I asked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260031"/> prosecutor what the maker's name was on the dial-plate? he told me it was Crook, London; I turned aside and found it so. After that I asked him the number? he said he did not know; I asked what was with inside the case, whether it was a printed bill or plain paper? he said it was a piece of plain paper, I opened the watch and found it so. After that he said, if I pulled that paper out underneath, I should see the name of a person, and Newcastle upon Tyne. I looked, and found a paper, on it was

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming near the Fountain-tavern, this man, the prosecutor, was very drunk, he came by, and said to me, will you go and drink any thing? I said, no, you have had enough already, friend; he took hold of me and pulled me about, I had but a little way to go; I staid a little, he knocked at a door. I went and turned the corner to go home, he came and began to pull and use me very ill, (this drunken man did,) he said it is not late yet, it is not above eleven o'clock, and pulled out his watch, that was the way I came to know he had one. I went down Burleigh-street, in the middle of it, I stopped at a pawnbroker's door there on purpose to get rid of him, he came there and knocked several times; I went on, and when I was got about two or three doors from him, he said I had robbed him of his watch; then I said, it can't be lost, it must be either in this street or the other; and when he had told the watchman he had lost his watch, I said, go down to Burleigh-street or Exeter-street and you'll find it, because I saw it in his hand.</p>

            . I live in Stone-cutter-street, and am a horse-keeper; I had three guineas, three half-guineas, a French half-crown, and twenty-one half-crowns, besides some small money in a little box, in a corn-bin in the stable; it was taken out, I suspected the prisoner, he being used to be in the stable; he lived with Mr. Cushee a a corn-chandler in Shoe-lane, I had lent him a stock, and took it out of the place where the money was, and put it about his neck on the 19th of January, then he saw the money, it was in a little white purse in the box. I took him up on suspicion, and had him to Guild-hall, he confessed there before several people that he had taken the money out of the box; he then took three guineas out of his shoe, and a French half-crown, which was all he had left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the very words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Panson. He owned he had got the money and the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner in order to induce him to a confession?</p>
               <p>Panson. No, I did not; he called to me and said he was very sorry it should happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned money at that time?</p>
               <p>Panson. I had, and he owned he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the sum ?</p>
               <p>Panson. He owned all the particulars, as I mentioned them to him at several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cushee. He produced a French half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Do you know this piece? look at it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the very piece that was with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular mark to it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a black spot on the smooth side of it, by which I know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there were a number of French half-crowns all mixed together, could you know that very piece from the rest?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I could.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you pick that out from the rest?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I could because of the mark, the spot of dirt.</p>

I said there was a house up, which was the Green-dragon, I took him there, he called for a pint of purl, and drank it all up, and called for another; then he pulled out his money to pay for it, among which I saw some guineas and a piece something like a half-crown.</p>

I got out of bed and came down part of the stairs, and saw the pestil lying in one place, and the mortar in another, on the floor in the kitchen; I went down, and missed three shillings and six-pence in halfpence, that the prisoner at the bar had put into a pewter tankard in a woollen cap the night before, which was his own that he brought from his last place. I had bought a coat for my daughter and left the money in the mortar, which was fifteen shillings, and told her if the man brought it to pay him, the boy at the bar knew of my putting it there. I know it was in the mortar at twelve at night when I went to bed, but it was gone when I got up and the prisoner too; about eleven o'clock on the Monday the prisoner was brought home by a man that knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any money found upon him?</p>
               <p>S. Carr. No, he had none about him.</p>

               <p>S. Carr. He is about fifteen years of age; we told him if he would tell us the truth we would do nothing to him, but he would not own any thing. We took him before the alderman, there he confessed what he had done with the money, and said an old man, which we found to be innocent, was concerned in it.</p>

            . The prisoner went from my service on the Friday; I heard he had robbed his master on the Sunday, he was taken, and I went to him in the Compter, and asked him how he came to be so wicked as to rob his master, he said an old Dutchman got him to do it; he said, the Dutchman came into his master's house in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260033"/> morning before his master and mistress were up, and threatened to stab him with a knife if he did not give him that money, and he fetched it and gave it him, and they went away and were all night together. I apprehended he was telling me a parcel of lies, I begged he would tell me the truth, and said, he would fare the better for it, and worse if he did not; then he told me the Dutchman was not with him when he committed the robbery, but said he took the fifteen shillings out of the mortar. I asked him how he came to look in the mortar for money? he said, his young mistress gave him some brass to scower and he saw the money in the mortar over-night, as he had to do with the brass things near it. I asked him what he had done with the money? he told me he owed one of the princess dowager of Wales's servants eleven shillings, named Parker, and where he lived. I sent a servant to inquire, and I found he had paid him the money he said he owed him. He is a poor man's son at Gloucester, and has no friends in town.</p>

We were before justice St. Lawrance, there the prisoner did not own he was guilty; but owned Anne Mountain came to his room, and delivered the watch to Skinner, to go and pawn it; and the prisoner owned he was concerned in going to the pawnbroker's.</p>

             came to my house, and brought a watch to pawn, (produced by the prosecutor). I believe this is the same; it has been in the prosecutor's hands some time; they pawned it for fifteen shillings; the next day I saw an advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you advertise it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; Anne Mountain's husband did at my request.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gibson, Are you sure the prisoner was one that brought it.</p>
               <p>Gibson. I am. Seeing the advertisement, I went to the prosecutor's house; upon asking him if he had lost a watch, he said he had. I told him I believed I had got it; and told him what sort of a man brought it, and asked him if he knew him? He said no. There was Anne Mountain's husband along with him: he said he knew him, and told me where I might find him. I went and found Skinner there; but the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175502260035"/> gone out of town with Anne Mountain. On the Monday following I had word come that the prisoner was returned, and that he was in a little court in Drury-lane, up three pair of stairs. I went and took him to the prosecutor, and then before justice St. Lawrance, and produced the watch. The prisoner said, he finding Anne Mountain had been advertised, went out of town with her.</p>

            . On the 22d of February, 1754, I was employed by Mrs. Jenkins to take an inventory of Mrs. Blynn's goods; when I went to take possession, Mrs. Jacobs and her husband called me, and took and threw my inventory-book away. I went again on the 28th, and took possession with a letter of attorney; she told me then, if swearing would take away Stevens's and Blynn's lives, she would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you, and where do you live?</p>
               <p>King. I am a journeyman upholsterer, and live in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>John-King. Mrs. Jacobs has come backwards and forwards to my mistress's, she is Stevens's Sister. About the latter-end of February she came and said, for God's sake don't let Mr. Stevens come home to night, for his three enemies have been there, and they will drag him through the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your mistress.</p>
               <p>King. Her name is Phillips, she keeps a pewterer's shop in Watling-street; she is sick in bed, and can't come.</p>

I told Jacobs we had got a letter of attorney; she took the lock, and said, God blast your eyes, you old b - h, I'll knock your brains out: she threw the lock away, and her husband and she took Mr. King by the collar, I thought they would have strangled him. She, Mrs. Jacobs, called me a thousand old bawds, and Stevens a sodomite. I heard her swear, if he did not deliver some money to her, she would keep the feather-bed, bolster, pillow, blankets, sheets, and a parrot in a cage; I was afraid she would take my life away. I have known the prisoner ever since the year 1715, I never knew any harm of him in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you take the hundred weight?</p>
               <p>Vinton. We took that all away at several times, from the beginning in the morning, to the time we left work; after we got it on shore we sent for a man, one Duffey, to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Vinton. I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the hundred weight for?</p>
               <p>Vinton. We had fifty shillings for it, and shared the money equally among us.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for your share?</p>
               <p>Vinton. After the reckoning was paid I had three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does this tobacco belong to?</p>
               <p>Vinton. I can't tell that. After that we took another hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you on board that ship?</p>
               <p>Vinton. I don't know, we made some broken days.</p>
               <p>Q. Who employed you?</p>
               <p>Vinton. The captain did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you first taken up about this tobacco?</p>
               <p>Vinton. No, I was stopped with some iron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price. I am headborough; I took the prisoner in custody the Wednesday in last sessions, at the Bell, Shadwell, he was charged with stealing tobacco, but he denied it.</p>
