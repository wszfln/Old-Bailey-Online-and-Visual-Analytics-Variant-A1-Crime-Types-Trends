            . I am a police officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 4th of December I went down with Mr. Vaughan to his barn door, it appeared to have been broken open by an iron instrument, by some rust being on the door. I went to Old Hayden's house, he was at home sitting by the fire; I went to search his house; I had no warrant; I asked him for the candle that was on the table, he said he would be d - d if I should have it; he said he had killed many men in his time, and he would not mind killing me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Hayden the elder has been a soldier.</p>
               <p>Cook. I sent to the next door and got a candle, I then went up stairs, I found a bushel of flour; I found the wheat in the back kitchen, or washhouse, it was in sacks, and covered over with two or three trusses of straw. I asked his wife in his presence how it came there, she said she did not know, she was sure it was not there at six o'clock the night before. He said nothing to it. I told Old Haydon he must go to town with me; he said he would not go; I then went to Young Hayden's house, there I found this crow, it is an implement of husbandry, and a sack of Mr. Vaughan's.

The prisoner brought the table to me, I was to give him two pound for the table; he owed me a pair of smallclothes, and I gave him another table for it; he brought it to my house about seven or eight o'clock in the evening; it was quite light; he was seen publicly to bring it by the neighbours.</p>

She and her husband came the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you observe any thing - A. Some weeks elapsed before I made any observation. From the difference of the hammering I knew it was not our business; I had a suspicion, I took the opportunity to make myself certain that it was what I expected; I made a crevise in the partition, so that I could see well into the room. I saw him rubbing as it were with his thumbs shillings or sixpences.</p>
               <p>COURT. Some pieces - A. Yes; and I saw him use also a brush. The three prisoners were all there to my knowledge then. I saw Mrs. Deacon standing between her husband and the fire place, handing different articles from the fire to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What articles - A. They seemed to be something out of a tin pot that was going backwards and forwards I cannot describe them, but they were something. This was about a fortnight before they were taken; I gave information at the office. At one time I saw Deacon give some silver to Williams; she wrapped it up in paper, and put it in her pocket. There were various people came after them, particularly a Jew.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street office. In consequence of a warrant granted by Mr. Read, I went with Clark, Donaldson, and Vickrey, to the prisoners lodgings, No. 4, Change-court, Drury-lane, on Wednesday, January the 16th, between twelve and one in the day. When I got there Vickrey shoved open the door; I went in and seized Williams. Deacon and his wife were on each side of the fire; Williams was sitting under the window; I laid hold of Williams by the pocket, and held her till some conversation took place between Deacon and Vickrey. I found in her pocket two sixpences and a piece of blacking. I then searched Mrs. Deacon, I found two good shillings and a piece of blacking; I found no counterfeit money upon her. Then I proceeded to search the room; behind a box in the room I found a paper of whitening, and several pieces of leather, they appeared to be damp; they are dirty, and appeared to have been used in polishing something with whiteness. I found this brush behind the same box. The bed was on the ground. Under the head of the bed I found an old pair of women's pockets, they seemed to be stained with aquafortis. On a board in the room I found a rag, stone, and a pair of scissars. In a rack under the window I found a brush sticking up, and another pair of scissars; there was some leather nailed against the wall; the scissars and brush were put in. Under a board under the window I found a piece of leather stained very much with aquafortis, and two fingerstalls, which were quite wet, in a pocket that was quite wet, it is not dry now, stained in the same manner as the leather. I found a small mixture in this paper which I cannot describe. I took the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You met with no resistance, though you forced the door open - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none of the parties doing wrong, and you found upon Williams two sixpences; they are not fit for circulation - A. They were fit for circulation at the time I found them; I should have taken them if I had gone for change.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. Q. You are an officer of Bow-street - A. I was at the time; I was with Vickrey and Lack; I searched the two Deacons; I found upon the man Deacon fourteen shillings, nine sixpences, and three half crowns, in his waistcoat pockets, all bad. I searched the mantle piece, I found six bad sixpences; I searched his breeches pockets, I found a bad sixpence, and a blank of the size of a shilling. I searched further, I found a bad dollar, and two blanks, one the size of a shilling, and the other a sixpence. I found some cuttings of silver in a paper, and some blacking in a tin cannister, and a little whitening.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the habit of apprehending persons in the same case of the prisoners before - A. Many; I was in company with Donaldson and the others; I was the first in the room, they followed me; Deacon (the man) was sitting on the right hand of the fire-place, the woman on the left, and Williams was sitting nearer the window, she was working at her needle, I told them we had a warrant to search that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200005"/>room for counterfeit money, they made no reply, nor offered any resistance. Deacon offered to get off his seat, I desired him to sit still. I saw the officers find the things, they shewed them to me on the table. The two sixpences and the blacking was the first thing that was shewed me. Blacking is a thing that is used after the money is coloured. They rub the piece with blacking when it is coloured and bright, it takes off the polish and brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it common blacking. - A. It is a mixture of wax, tallow, and lamp black. It is not a sort of blacking that we should use for our shoes. I saw the whole that Lack found. I directed him to take care of them. Aquafortis with other things found in the house, would produce the colour of silver undoubtedly. After the silver is embibed in the mettle, aquafortis would bring it on the surface. Cream of tarter is an ingredient that is used for the purpose of putting a silver on the metal. I never knew whitening to be used. Scouring paper I have always found in these houses. The finger stalls, I have seen them, I have no doubt they were used for the purpose of colouring money. I do believe the cloths have been used for the purpose of wiping the money after having aquafortis on it. A bird cage was handed to me by Donaldson; in that bird cage, I found this aquafortis bottle. This is a bag of blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blanks are there. - A. There is above an hundred. Here are shillings, sixpences, half crowns, and a dollar or two. After I had been searching some time, Mrs. Deacon got from her seat, and under her chair where she sat, I found a counterfeit sixpence, it then appeared to have directly come from the hand of the finisher. In the same bag with the blanks, I found some pieces of silver, I have no doubt they were intended for making colour to put on the blanks. Here are some counterfeit half guineas, I found nothing to colour them. Here are four sixpences in the same place, that had been scoured ready for the process of colouring, they are complete to be coloured now, there was some cream of tartar in the same cage, and some sand paper. Some of these have been used for the purpose of rubbing metal, and this has not been used. These cloths were found in an old tea chest, they were then wet. I have no doubt but they had been washed out, there was a sufficient smell of aquafortis on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that found by Clerk in the man Deacon's pocket, is that a counterfeit. - A. It is, it has been coloured. These are the two sixpences found in Williams's pocket, these are very much changed coloured now, to what they were when found; and when produced to the magistrate, they were handed to me, they were then fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of any shoemaking in the apartment. - A. There was part of a shoemaker's kit, it did not appear that there was any carried on at that time. There were a great many old shoes about, but none appearing in a state of mending at that time.</p>

            . I am a gardener, I live in the New Road, Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Withers. - A. Yes, I have known him eight or ten years or more. On the day before Christmas day, he called at my house in Circuit Street, New Road, Paddington, he asked me whether I was at work, I told him it was such a wet morning I could not go to work, he said he wanted to speak to me about a little job, he was going to a public-house the corner of the street, would I have any beer. We went together to the public-house, there he said if I would come in the morning to the Brazen Head, he would meet me there about nine or ten o'clock. I went there at ten o'clock at night, he was not there, I had two pints of beer and a pipe of tobacco. I staid there till past eleven, came out, and went past his house, I saw a light, I went in, he was sitting by the fire, he said</p>
               <p>"Quelch, you are almost drunk," I said,</p>
               <p>"I am not much better," he asked me to sit down, I did, and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his house from the Brazen Head. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200006"/>A. About two hundred yards. I sat there I do not know how long. He awoke me; then we went up the hill to the Brazen Head up Bell Street, he turned down Frost's Gardens, there is a chapel behind that, there he brought a ladder. As we made up the hill, we met a person, Withers told me it was Thorpe, Withers, said to Thorpe,</p>
               <p>"holloa master, do not run over me," that was just before we got the ladder. I said,</p>
               <p>"if that is Thorp, it is not his way home," he said</p>
               <p>"he has come this way because the water is up." I knew Thorp very well, but I did not know him then. Thorp lives down Bates's Row, he could not go along the gravel pits, the water was flooded there after a fall of rain. Withers and I went behind the chapels, and he brought a ladder out.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not go with him. - A. I stopped in Frost's passage, he went round the chapel and got the ladder. When we had got the ladder, we went down Bell Street the way we came up, we made a stop in Bell Street, there was a man and his wife next door to the Brazen Head quarrelling, a woman of the opposite side of the way came out with a light. After they were all gone, and all was quiet; we came up to the Brazen Head, he pointed up to the window, and said he was going to take these watches out, he laid the ladder down under a window on the opposite side of the way, we stopped there. Holmes and his wife were making a noise, when they were quiet, three men came down Bell Street, they knocked at the Brazen Head door, the door was not opened to them, they were in liquor; and stopped twenty minutes. After they were gone, Withers then took the ladder, and put it up against the window, he went up the ladder, and raised up the window at the bottom with a small pick axe, he took the watches out, which hung on a frame, he took the frame and all, and handed it down to me One of the watches fell of the frame on the ground, I took it up and put it in my pocket, that is the watch that I offered to pawn at Mr. Dobree's. Withers came off the ladder, we left it just as it was, under the window, and away we went. At Lisson Green he took the watches off the frame, and put them into his hat, I asked him what he meaned to do with them, he said, to take them to Freeland, I knew him, he is a broker, at the bottom of Quebeck Street, in York Street, I said,</p>
               <p>"suppose Freeland will not take them," he said,</p>
               <p>"he will take any thing, if he will not take them, you must take them to your house," I told him I would not have them in my house for any consideration, he said, he knew if he took them home. they would search his house immediately, I must take them to my house, nobody would have any suspicion of me. We both went to Freeland's house as the watch went four o'clock. We went to Freeland's back door, he went round before me; when I went round he was got in just as I got to the window, there was a light, I saw Withers and Freeland in the room, I saw where they put the watches, down on the table, Freeland was standing at the table, I went from the window, Withers came to me, he said, it was all right, I did not go into the house, Withers said, he had got a one pound note, and Freeland would settle the remainder another day, I went home then. I met him the next morning in Circuit Street, he gave me five shillings worth of half-pence, said, he should get the remainder of it the next day. On the evening of the next day, I saw him at the Royal Oak, Circuit Street. We went into Paddington Street. there he gave me four pounds four shillings more, he told me he got it off Freeland, that was my share. On the 5th of January, I pawned the watch I had at Dobree's, I was stopped, and I told this story directly, I have been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you kept all this snug until you thought you should be prosecuted, and then you told it. You do not understand this, you are a lucky fellow. - A. I think I am very unlucky.</p>
               <p>Q. Four pound nine shillings you received, you are lucky that you are not punished. - A. I do not know but I may be punished, I deserve to be punished.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you told this story first. - A. That very night, at Marlborough Street office, I told the officer of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in custody before, honesty. - A. Never before for any misdemeanor for thieving.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been taken up by any constable before. - A. Yes, I was before the justice at Marlborough Street, a man charged me with thieving his tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been at Marlborough Street. - A. Never before, or at any other office.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you charged about a wheelbarrow. - A. At Marlborough Street office, I bought some potatoes of a man, he lent me a barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he charge you with stealing the barrow. - A. He did, that was nine or ten years ago, it slipped my memory.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMEED. Q. You are the landlord of the Brazen Head public house, are you not. - A. Yes, Mr. Seabrook informed me of the robbery in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night had you heard any knocking at the door. - A. Yes, I did not get up, I think it was about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>JOHN THORP. Q. You live at Lisson Green. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of Christmas eve had you been out your benefit club. - A I had, I was going up Oxford Street as the watchmen were going two. When I came to Lisson Green, I should suppose it was near half after two, I went down Bell Street by the Brazen Head. Going down the hill about thirty yards from the Brazen Head, it was a dark night, one of the men spoke, or else I should have run against him, I cannot recollect the words. As soon as ever he spoke to me, I passed by and went on, I believe it to be Withers's voice, I have no other proof than the voice, I have known him ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that knowledge of him you believe it to be his voice. - A. I do, I passed on my way, and they their way.</p>

            . I am an office of Marlborough Street office. On the 5th of January, my brother brought Quelch to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any communication that he made, did you that night apprehend the prisoners at the bar. - A. I apprehended Freeland, and my brother apprehended Withers, they were both brought to the watch-house that night, they were examined on the Monday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200007"/>the 7th. Withers was detained for a further examination Freeland was discharged upon bail to appear on a future day.</p>
               <p>Q. After Freeland had been discharged, did he come to you. - A. He did. On Monday, the 9th, he shewed me an anonymous letter which he said he had just received. That is the letter. - The letter read; directed, W. Freeland Broker, John Street, New Road, Paddington. To be left at the Duke of York, York Street. Post mark, January 9.</p>
               <p>"SIR - I can give you information that Mr. Quelch has told me this day, that a part of the property he stole, he has planted them in a coal vault, in the carcase of an unfinished house, Lisson Green, Paddington, that he meant to part with them one at a time. I give you this information, I do not like to see innocent men hunted for as thieves for other men's guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your brother go with Freeland to Lisson Green. - A. We did, we went to a carcase of an unfinished house. We found the watches in a pickle jar, the ground had been turned up, the mussle of the pickle jar was put in the ground, the sides of the jar and top were covered with bricks. This was in January, a very hard frost. The ground where the jar was buried was soft, it appeared that it had been turned up shortly before.</p>
               <p>Q.Could it have been in that state two days. - A I should think not, every other part of the vault was quite hard, and whatever water had flooded in was ice; the other bricks were frozen by the ice, these were loose I think it could not have been there many hours, if it had, it would have been frozen, the frost had been for several days, and it was a frost then. This is the watch I received at Mr. Dobree's, and here is, I think, sixteen watches and a watch case, Freeland went with me to that vault.</p>

            . Q. Did you go with your brother and Freeland to search this carcase of a house. - A. I did, we found the watches in the pickle jar, in the state he has described.</p>
               <p>Q. to Quelch. Did you ever see the watches after they were left at Freeland's. - A. Yes, I saw them at Marlborough Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them in the carcase of an unfinished house on Lisson Green. - A. No, I never did; nor did I ever tell any body of it. I had a few words with Freeland about fifteen shillings he owed me, I never wished him any ill.</p>
               <p>Wither's Defence. There is some part of Quelch's evidence that I cannot deny, and there is a great part of it false. As to his coming to my house, he did, in a drunken state indeed; he came into my house, I was in bed, he set himself down and snored till about four o'clock in the morning, my wife said,</p>
               <p>"Withers, get up and turn that man out, he has watered the house I believe;" and, I then got up and said</p>
               <p>"go," he said he wanted me to go along with him, I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall not go along with you, recollect my family, I will not do any thing that I ought not to do, my misfortunes has taught me better," I had the misfortune to stand at this bar fourteen years ago, I was capitally convicted, I received his Majesty's pardon, God restored him, from that day I never eat of ill begotten bread, I have worked hard for my living, God has blessed me with health and strength to work for my family, and from whence he must rest his infernal evidence I cannot say, except from my former misfortunes. He has said, he would do for Freeland, he was sorry for me, but he could not do any thing with Freeland without me.</p>
               <p>Freeland left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>SIMON. I am independant, I live in Mitcham Street, Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter. - A. These are the initials of my name that I put to it. Freeland brought it into a public-house, I was setting reading the paper, he read this letter by my side, he seemed much agitated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He asked you to put your name upon it. - A. Yes, that I should know it again</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when it was put in the post-office were you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- RICHEY. I am a taylor, 17, Newnham Street, Edgeware Road. About the beginning of November, I heard Quelch say he would be a match for Freeland.</p>
               <p>MR. PIERCE. I am a bricklayer, York Street, New Road. I have heard Quelch say two or three times, he would do for Freeland in a very short time.</p>
               <p>Freeland called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the night of the 13th of February, about a quarter before 12 o'clock at night, I went to bed, I was the last person up, the house was fast as usual, the doors and windows, I fastened them myself. About half past three o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the corporal and serjeant on guard I got up, there is a guard at the Canteen to protect my property. When I looked out of the window, they told me to come down. When I came down, they asked me if I had lost any thing out of my bar, I told them I could not tell, if they would lend me a light, I would examine it. I examined my bar, I found the bar-door open, it is a half hatch door, I had bolted it inside, I found it unbolted and left open. In one of the drawers that we always put copper in, I found five pound fifteen shillings had been taken away out of six pound fifteen shillings. We found ten shillings in the drawer, five shillings on the dresser, and five shillings on the floor, all the halfpence I had tied up in five shillings in paper the evening before. The serjeant of the guards told me, that he had got two pounds fifteen shillings, and the prisoner was in the custody of the corporal and the serjeant in the guardroom.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the guard-room from your house. - A, About thirty-five or thirty-six yards. I went to the guard-room, I saw some of my halfpence in his foraging cap on the guard-room table. The prisoner was in custody in the guard-room. The whole the we found of my property was two pounds fifteen shillings, they were part loose, and part tied up. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200008"/>were all tied up when taken away, I knew them in particular by the tie, and they are folded particularly, they are not tied up as others are. I lost about two quarts of rum, and some return tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your house afterwards. - A. I did, the person that got in, got in by the tap-room window, we could see the footsteps by the sawdust on the window-bench and on the window-ledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, of your own knowledge, know that that tap-room window was fast when you went to bed. - A. Yes, I fastened it the last thing myself before I went to bed. There were three parts of a pint pot of gin and peppermint that was not there when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is any person concerned with you in keeping the Canteen. - A. No person whatever.</p>

I sleep in the barracks, it is about sixty yards from the Canteens, I got up, and heard some one run down the stairs of the landing, into the barrack yard. I got up and put my great coat on, and went down stairs into the back yard, and there I saw the prisoner in custody of the centinel

               <p>Q. Were the stairs from which he came near the Canteen. - A. No, I heard the drum-major talking from his window, I asked him what was the matter, he said he did not know, I soon after seized the prisoner about two minutes after I heard the noise. I kept him till Watson came up, I asked him what he had been doing, he said, nothing, but if I would not split, he would give me half of what he had got, and on his hearing the drum-major come up, he strove very hard to go to the privy. I held him fast, the drum-major came up and said,</p>

            . I am a corporal in the first regiment of guards. I was on guard on the 14th, I posted the prisoner centinel at twelve o'clock, I relieved him again at two. About a quarter past three I saw him brought into the guard room by the drum-major, I saw him searched, I know no more than has been stated, except when he was before the adjutant, he acknowledged that he went through the window and entered the bar, and took the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he said that. - A. On the morning of the 14th.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martins, I took the prisoner into custody, going down Oxford Road, I asked him how he came to do it, he said he was unsettled in his mind, there was some difference between him and his wife, he did not know how he came to do it, he then asked me if it would hang him, I told him I could not say at that time whether it would or would not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

That is all I know about it, I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the portfolio afterwards. - A. It was taken into the bar, and my mistress locked it up. I know it is the same portfolio, because it was cut open, I did not see him cut it open.</p>

In the mean time three ladies came in, they wished to look at some out of the remnant basket, I took the remnant basket out with the remnants, and pushed it about three quarters of a yard from Swain and Price. At the time they were looking at the lace, Swain and Price were finding fault with the remnant which I had laid before them. The other three ladies took three pieces out of the basket and laid by the side of them, Swain laid her hand on two pieces of them, and got them in her hand. The ladies who made choice of the two looked round and could not find the two pieces, they said that Swain had got the two pieces, she turned her back to Price and made no answer. I did not take any notice at the time that I saw it done. Price found fault with the lace I had laid before them and asked Swain whether she liked the remnant, she made answer, that she would be a judge for herself, she knew nothing about it, and then they refused the lace and were going out,

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You have told us of three ladies being in your shop, had you your goods pretty much on the counter at the time. - A. No, nothing but a remnant basket full of bits of lace, only these two pieces were by the side of the prisoner. The prisoner was standing by the side of the counter, I did not see the handkerchief in her hand until she clapped her hand down with the handkerchief upon the lace.

I caught this man on the other side of Hampstead, with his load of hay, I passed him, I thought I saw a sack of corn on the load of hay, covered over with a cloth. I then came down to the middle of Hampstead town, enquired for a constable, and soon procured him. We came up to Burgers, I saw him speak to a man of the name of Giles, I asked him where the corn was that was on the hay, he said he had none, I said I was sure he had, I had seen it on the load of hay, I asked Giles if he saw the man unload a sack of corn, he said he knew nothing about it, I went into the house and Giles followed me, I said to Giles you may as well tell me where this corn is, I am determined to find it, he denied having it, I went into the yard, I could not find it, I saw a door which led to the cellar, I went down the cellar, there I found a sack of corn nearly full, and the sack that was not full was shot into a tub. I said to Giles,</p>

               <p>"this is my corn, I could swear to it almost," Giles said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, I bought it of this man, and gave him a pound note for it," I said,</p>
               <p>"why did not you tell me of this at first, I shall be obliged to send for another constable for you." I sent for another constable, and gave Giles in charge. I got in the load of hay, and found an empty sack, then the constables and myself set off with these men to a magistrate at Edgware, where the prisoner said, he was very sorry. I can swear to the sack so far, they are sacks that belong to the man that I hired to bring this corn for me.</p>

               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I am an officer. On the 3d of January, at night, the prisoner was in custody at Queen square office. In consequence of a pair of shoes being stopped at a pawnbrokers she had sold these shoes to a woman of the name of Greenfield; she then said that a young man whom she had never seen before had given her these shoes to sleep with her. On the 24th I had further information, I searched her apartment; I saw her hand in her pocket, she was endeavouring to give something to Greenfield. I took possession of that pocket which contained a little red pocket book; in that pocket book I found two duplicates for two pair of shoes, pawned on the 3d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. They were for the shoes for which the pawnbrokers have been examined - A. Yes. The prisoner said some young man had given her the duplicates.</p>

On the 5th of February I lost some bacon, the bacon was put on some tubs at the further end of the shop; the bacon was sixty pound weight. On the 5th of February, at eleven at night, I saw the bacon there; I fastened the shop door, and saw every thing was secure; nobody could go into the shop without breaking the pannel, which was done. I have a private entrance in the passage for the lodgers, they have no business with the shop. On the 6th, about the middle of the day, I missed the bacon, and about six in the evening the pannel in the passage, at the further end of the shop, I observed had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the shop in the morning - A. About seven o'clock. I was the first person that went into the shop, I did not perceive the pannel broken then, not till the candles were lighted; the boy went out in the yard in the evening, he told me that the pannel in the passage had been broken; I took the candle and examined it, and found the bacon had gone through that pannel; the marks of the bacon was upon it. The pannel had been broken open by an axe; the axe is here, the pannel had been split and then pushed in its place again, and my knocking about the tubs in the course of the day, had moved it out of its place. It had been put in its place, and that prevented me from seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it had been broken open by that instrument - A. Mr. Baxter matched this instrument with the place, it matched with it. The patrol found the axe in the bag, with the bacon in his possession in the street. I went to the watchhouse and saw it, I knew it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your house that night - A. I do not know that he was out; he told me the next night that he was out at his club.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I stopped the prisoner with the bacon on his back in Little Queen-street, Holborn, about a quarter past two in the night of the 5th; I asked him, where he was going; he said, home, just down here; making a motion, as if down Little Queen-street. I asked him what the bag contained, he said, meat; Bott, the watchman, asked him what meat; he replied, bacon, he had it out of the country, and had been to the Angel, St. Giles's for it, and the reason he had been out so late was, he had stopped with a friend. I told him that he and the bacon must go to the watchhouse. Bott took the bacon, and the prisoner made his escape from me. We took the bag to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper. This bacon was delivered to me on the morning of the 5th, between two and three o'clock, it was brought to the watchhouse. On that morning Mr. Pugh came and claimed it. I went to Mr. Pugh's house, examined it where the pannel had been broken open in the passage; my judgement was, that it must have been done by somebody in the house; I took the prisoner in custody that same night in Mr. Pugh's house. Bott followed me to the watchhouse with the prisoner, and when he came there I asked him if he knew the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200014"/>man, he made no reply; I told him to go for Branscomb; when Branscomb came he declared directly that he was the man that he stopped with the bacon.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark - A. It was very moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men disguised - A. They were; they were in light smock frocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing over their faces - A. I perceived one had something under his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they crape over their faces - A. No, they had not. They were on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their faces - A. I had, of one more particularly than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they came up to you - A. A something was uttered, but what I do not know. They took from me a silver hunting watch; they stopped me as I was passing on the road; they were going the same way that I was; they separated, and as I came up they both took hold of the bridle of the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what they said - A. No, I cannot positively say what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they demand your property - A. They said a something, and immediately a pistol was presented to me by the prisoner Pickmore, if he be the man, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the other - A. I am positive that Oldham is the other.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them presented a pistol - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. And demanded your money - A. They uttered something, I do not know what. I immediately begged that they would not ill use me, and told them that they should have every thing that I had; I put my hand into my pocket, and gave them three one pound notes, and some silver; I cannot positively say how much silver it was, from ten to fifteen shillings. I will not say what, but some silver I am positive; I believe there were some shillings, a half crown, and a crown piece, but I am not positive whether there was a dollar or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them any thing else - A. There was a bill that I had taken up at Masterman's, White Hart Court. I gave them nothing else. The prisoner Oldham drew my watch from my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chair out or not - A. The chain was out, and the seal and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing else from you - A. No, excepting a pocket handkerchief, but I am not positive, probably I might have lost it that afternoon; whether it was taken by the prisoners I cannot say; I have not seen it again since.</p>

               <p>Q. When they had taken that did they leave you - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not use you ill - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you in the whole - A. I cannot positively say, but a very short time; I think not scarce a minute; a very short time indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened - A. A little alarmed, not so much as I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see them again - A. I saw them at Bow-street office on the Saturday following, as they stopped me on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any of your property was found upon them - A. None I believe whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them on the Saturday at Bow-street did you know either of them - A. Yes, I knew the prisoner Oldham the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I think you tell us it was about seven o'clock - A. No, about six.</p>
               <p>Q. Two men were going the same way as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Their faces then were not towards you, you had therefore no opportunity, though it was moon-light, of observing their features untill you came up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to them they separated, and each seized both sides of your bridle - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which very much surprised you - A. Not so much at first. It did surprise me. I at first thought it was some of my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. They had their hats on - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You sitting upon your horse, I take it you were above them - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. The sight that you had of their faces must be a downward sight - A. No, I had a straight forward view, they were close when my watch was drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. It was scarcely a minute - A. I cannot say what time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were somewhat alarmed, though not much - A. Somewhat.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the men had something under his hat - which was that - A. The prisoner Oldham.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever that was contributed to shade the face - A. Very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, having asked you these questions, I put this to you, can you venture to swear positively to any man that you had never seen before in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200015"/>life can you swear positively to this man - A. I have sworn positively, my conscience will not allow me to say otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went to Bow-street I believe you went there for the purpose of seeing some persons that were apprehended for robbing, were you not - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there expecting to see them - A.I went there with an idea of seeing some prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. That had robbed you - A. I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the object that you went for - A It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was quite moon-light, were there no clouds intervening at all - A There were some clouds I believe. I can venture to swear that I could see a man one hundred and fifty yards before me at least.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. Monday January the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. A fortnight afterwards you saw them - A. No, on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you saw them do you remember whether the moon was shining in their faces - A. It was; the moon was behind me; it shone into their faces.</p>
               <p>JOHN UPTON. I am one of the Bow-street patrols. I was in company with Cross, Avery, and Lloyd, on Tuesday the 8th of January, passing by the Shepherd and Shepherdess public-house, going to the Shepherd and Shepherdess Fields, I met the prisoners Oldham and Pickmore coming before me. I saw Oldham pull his hat over his eyes. I seized Oldham, I asked him whether he had any pistols about him, he replied he had not; Cross said that Pickmore had thrown it over the sence.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Old Ford were they - A. This was near the City road, it might be two miles from Old Ford, I cannot exactly speak to that distance, Cross told Avery to go over, he did not find it then. We took the prisoner to the Shepherd and Shepherdess public-house, they got a light and went to look for the pistol; after they came back I saw the pistol in Cross's hands; I searched Oldham, I found a silver watch on him, a dollar, a few halfpence, and a box like a tobacco box, containing some gunpowder, and four pieces of lead, a flannel night cap, and an old silk handkerchief; I asked Oldham where he spent his afternoon, he informed me that he had been at the Angel, smoking his pipe along with Pickmore; I took them up to the Angel, I asked the waiter, I found they had. We took them to the public-office, where they were examined, and committed for further hearing.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday the 8th of January I was with Upton and Avery, I saw the two prisoners coming towards us, Upton took hold of Oldham, and I took hold of Pickmore. As soon as I took hold of him, to the best of my belief, he put his hand into his breeches, and throwed something over the fence; I called to Avery, he went over, he did not find it then; then I said I should take them to the Shepherd and Shepherdess. Upon my searching of Pickmore I took from him a silver hunting-watch, and this pocket-book, containing some shop bills, memorandums, and duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whose watch it is - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Has Mr. Cooper seen it - A. I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooper. That is not my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross At the Shepherd and Shepherdess I asked the landlord to lend me a lanthorn and candle. Avery and I went, and in searching I found a pistol about six yards from where he throwed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp You found nothing upon them belonging to Mr. Cooper - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find upon her - A. I cannot say that any thing was found upon her, she contrived to get into the corner of the room, and in the corner of the room was a chair; I desired the young man to call up a female servant to search her, on his return I desired her to walk into the room. While he was absent I had strong suspicion that she was endeavouring put down the goods that she had about her; as the servant came up stairs I desired her to walk into the middle of the room; I looked down underneath her chair, I there saw a pocket lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that pocket was there when she first came in the room - A. I am not certain, as I did not look. When I saw the pocket lay I took it up, I said, this is sufficient proof, this pocket contains our property. I did not examine the pocket untill

               <p>Q. What is the prime cost of these ribbons - A. About three pound ten shillings; we estimated them at three guineas, the lowest value.</p>
               <p>HENRY MAGG. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in, she asked me if I sold night caps; I told her, yes; she looked at ribbons, and bought ribbons to the value of nine shillings and ten-pence; she clapped a silk handkerchief over the ribbon drawer, which was quite open, that made me suspect her; she gave me two five shilling pieces, I gave her twopence change. I was half over the counter, going to take her to Mr. Steven's; she asked me if I sold narrow ribbon, I told her, yes; she looked out as much as came to one shilling and tenpence, and I gave her the change; then I took her into the back shop.

               <p>- BURTON. I produce the property, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was there any woman of your family in the room before the search - A. No, only myself. There are one or two pieces not marked, these three that are marked that I swear to are worth thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He put private marks upon them ribbons when the constable was in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that true - A. Yes; but these three that I swear to had marks before.</p>

               <p>Q. When was your room broken open - A. On the 7th of February it was broken open; I went out of an errand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in the room - A. No, nobody. I locked my door, but left the key in the entrance to my door, being dark I do not suppose that she saw it; she had forced it in, I was not absent ten minutes, when I returned I found the door open; my fright was so great I did not look to see whether it was unlocked or not. I missed this bundle of property that I had been entrusted with to wash.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went out - A Half past eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. A tablecloth, three shifts, six pocket handkerchiefs, a night gown, a flannel petticoat, a neck handkerchief, three napkins, two aprons, three towels, six dusters, a sheet, and a piece of old linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they all worth - A. I dare say I should be charged a couple of pounds for them</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the door - A The lock was forced, and they had not unlocked it. The bolt of the lock was out, I cannot say that the lock was very firm, there were three of the screws forced out, and one of the screws I picked up off the ground. These things were left on my chair, they were tied up in a tablecloth, and put in the basket. I went up stairs to my neighbour, and told him I was robbed of what was not my property, a bundle of linen; my neighbour went out and overtook this woman with the things.</p>

I examined the silver and said as there was foreign silver among it the utmost that I could give would be five shillings and sixpence per ounce; he said that was not sufficient, he expected five shillings and tenpence; I told him it was the most I could give, he asked me to weigh it for him that he might not be deceived in any other place he took it to; there were fifty one ounces four penny weights; he asked me what it would come to at that; I told him fourteen pounds one shilling and sixpence; he said he did not suppose he could do better with it, I should have it. I paid him the money and he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Atkins weigh the silver - A. Yes. I gave Kelly the ten pounds the next morning. Kelly said it should be fifteen or sixteen pounds that he ought to have had.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ounces did it weigh - A. Forty-seven ounces, as I understood, at four shillings and threepence an ounce. I gave Kelly the money, he gave me nothing for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You were taken up and charged with this were you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have come now from prison to here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell this story after you were taken up and charged - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time - A. Last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Three days ago - A. Three days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time that you told this story, when were you taken before the magistrate, as thief, you know - A. On the Thursday, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never told this story until the Monday night - A. No, I had no opportunity; I searched for advice, and I got advice of my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in service now - A. I do not know whether I am or am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your way into Mrs. Baron's house - A. I do, if I am shewed the door.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLERKE. I am a watchmaker. On Monday the 11th of February the prisoner Atkins came to my house and informed me he was going to purchase some foreign silver; a friend of his, a one legged lieutenant, was to introduce him to the person that had it to sell, it was to be sold at a public-house near Berkley-square; I cautioned him not to have any thing to do with it; I told him if the people had come honestly by it, they would go to a refiners, or to a silversmiths shop, where they could get more by it than he could afford. He borrowed my scales and weights, I lent them to him having known him about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. An hawker, or pedlar, during which time I have trusted him at several periods to the amount of forty or fifty pounds, he has been frequently in my shop, where valuable articles lay about, both of gold and silver; I had not the least doubt of his honesty. I also told him, after he had borrowed the scales, that he had better go to a silversmith's shop, and have it weighed, and valued, by which means he would not be wronged; he told me he could depend upon his friend the lieutenant. He returned the scales the next morning, I was not at home; I saw him in the afternoon, he told me he had made a purchase of the silver, and gave five shillings the ounce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you know where Atkins lodged - A. He told me in London-street, Fitzroy-square. I was present at the time of his apprehension, he was apprehended in my shop, he then acknowledged every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know when he was apprehended whether he gave all the information of the person of whom he purchased the different articles - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information he gave was the witness Blake apprehended - A. Yes, and Kelly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You did not go to the public-house where he bought the plate - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of Kelly - A. I do not.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, I live at No. 2, Little Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Sunday the 5th of February were you in St. Paul's Church-yard - A. I was, about seven in the morning, I was going into Cheapside, I there saw the two prisoners at the bar, they were a little separate they were talking to each other, and walking in one direction. I was in Cheapside, I saw them going towards Foster Lane, whether they came out of the Old Change or St. Paul's Church-yard I cannot say, Potter had a bundle under his arm in a cotton handkerchief, Potter stopped and looked up Foster-lane as if for a direction, Aaron went a little before making a sign to him to follow him; Potter followed him and I followed him, and I followed them both to watch them: they came to Gutter-lane, Potter made another stop as if to go down there, and immediately Aaron beckoned him on again, he followed him again to Wood-street. They went down Wood-street, Aaron taking the right-hand side, and Potter the left. The Jew went into Lad-lane, Potter stepped forward and over shot Aaron, he looked back and turned down Lad-lane after Aaron; when they both took down Lad-lane, I stopped at the corner, I heard Aaron say, there is somebody watching us, give me the bundle; Potter give him the bundle, and Aaron put it under his coat. Aaron said to Potter leave me, Potter did not leave him but kept a little behind, he separated and went on the opposite side behind, I kept close to Aaron - they took to King-street, along Cateaton-street, and then to the Old Jewry; they both then kept of the left hand side of the way, and went into the Poultry, they went through the Poultry up to Goodluck's in Cornhill, there they separated at the corner of the Bank buildings, Aaron took Cornhill and Potter the Bank-buildings, I kept close to 
               <persName id="t18110220-27-person294">Aaron</persName>
             all the way, he might have heard my steps if he was not deaf, his eyes were upon me all the way, when Aaron got to the Royal Exchange door he dropped the bundle, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was Potter in sight then - A. I saw him looking at the corner, and when I picked up the bundle he decamped. When Aaron saw that I picked up the bundle he went away quick down one of the alleys by the Exchange. I looked over my shoulder, and saw Potter at the corner of the Bank buildings, he saw me pick up the bundle, and I saw no more of him, he saw me pick it up. I found the bundle heavy, opened it and saw it was metal, which I afterwards found was silver. This is the handkerchief it contains the silver. On the next day I went to Rundle and Bridge, Ludgate-hill, and there I found the owner of the property I delivered it to Mr. Fox, their clerk. On Wednesday I went to their manufactory in Dean-street, I saw the prisoner Potter, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the person of Potter before you saw him - A. I did, Potter was sent into a yard where there were other persons; as soon as ever he made his appearance, I said, that is the man, I am positive he is the man I saw with this bundle. Aaron was taken up on the Monday following, I was present when he was apprehended in Crown-court, Wardour-street. Aaron perceived me looking at him he held his head down, when I saw his face, I was sure he was the man I saw with Potter.</p>

            ; our manufactory is in Dean-street, Soho. Potter was in our employ in that manufactory, and had been for four years.</p>
               <p>Q. For some time before this transaction was discovered had you missed silver from your manufactory - A. Yes, we had, I had no suspicion of Potter, he was our porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being brought to you by Mr. Smith, this that is produced here to day, were you confident it is your property - A. Yes, I am. The silver was in the possession of Mr. Smith, at Ludgate Hill; I went there and saw it, they are our patterns, we had some patterns peculiar to ourselves, the weight of it is one hundred and twenty seven ounces, the value is upwards of thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. These pieces that you have there are they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200020"/>called silver cuttings - A. Yes, they are, in the trade; they are our patterns. We never sell them in that state; we melt them down. I have no doubt of all of them being mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Smith came to you did he describe to you the person that he saw - A. He did, and upon that I sent Potter into the yard; Mr. Smith selected Potter immediately. Potter was taken into custody. When we walked out to his lodgings Foy the officer accompanied us; he confessed that he had stolen a few ounces of silver, which we should find at his lodgings; he denied the silver he was charged with. Afterwards, in consequence of something Potter said, I sent to Mr. Smith, and we had Aaron taken in custody.</p>
               <p>- FOX. I am clerk to Rundle and Bridge. I received them cuttings of Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Potter said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Aaron said nothing in his defence; called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             of the bank. The prisoner lived with him three months longer than that time, she was his niece.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night the 9th of February last did you go to the alms houses - A. In the evening I did, with four shillings as usual. When I knocked at the door the prisoner called who is there? I answered, it is me; the door was not opened at first; after I had been there sometime she opened the door about one third; she stood behind the street door, put her hand out and asked me if it was silver; I told her it was copper, she told me I could not come in, her uncle was unwell and dozing; I walked in, I approached the table; she then went on the other side of the table and endeavoured to conceal somewhat from me, she prevented me from coming round the foot of the bed; she treated me in that manner three times, as I moved she moved, to cover somewhat as I suppose. I then said, if it is unpleasant to you for me to bring the money, Miss Woodthorpe, you must come to my house for it. She had been to my house on the Thursday before, but did not inform my family; I asked her what was the matter with her uncle on the Thursday, she said no matter now. On the next morning my wife received this letter from her, I immediately came home and received this letter; I went there on the Sunday about one o'clock, I took an officer with me; when I entered the room I said to her, you have sent me a letter; she said, here is a copy of it.</p>
               <p>(The letter read, signed R. Woodthorpe.)</p>
               <p>"MR. HOLLOWAY.</p>
               <p>I am sore distressed; I gave my uncle a piece of cake and wine the last thing before I went to bed, I left the knife and piece of cake upon the night stool. In my first sleep he reached the knife, and cut his throat; it was unknown to me; I was awoke by a strong smell, and when I turned myself I found I was all in blood; it was about half past two in the morning, and I all alone. I am much distressed; my mind is hurt in doing for him, and now to have a painful end. I shall thank you come and advise me what to do.</p>

               <p>Yours, in great trouble, 
               <persName id="t18110220-28-person304">R. </persName>
            WOODTHORPE.</p>
               <p>Mr Holloway; Here is the identical bit of cake that was put on the night stool to cut. I told the prisoner. I believed she had cut her uncle's throat; she said to her friends,</p>
               <p>"do you hear what Mr. Holloway says, his words were always like swords and daggers to me." After this I went to the deceased, I found he could not articulate.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged man was the deceased - A. Eighty-three, a very infirm man; he was feeble all over his system; he could not walk about for the last two or three months, he was bed ridden. When I went to his bed side his wound had been dressed; I found he was unable to articulate; I asked him if he did this act to signify it by holding up his hand. I am sure he knew me, his eyes were open, he shook hands with me, he did not hold up his hand; I then asked him if his niece did it to signify it by holding up his hand. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the linen on the bed whether there was much blood - A. There was a deal of blood where he laid, but none where Miss Woodthorpe laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of sleeping with her uncle - A. So she informed me, on account of his infirmity. I returned the next day between four and five, before day light, then I examined the bed particularly, I found no blood on the side that Miss Woodthorpe slept; I found a small pen-knife in the bed; I then said to him, Mr. Crickett, did you do this act; he said, no. He could then articulate with sufficient clearness. I asked him if his niece did it; he said, yes: I was astonished when I heard him say so. There was no one present but the nurse that I placed there, her name is Johnson. I let him rest. It was much labour to say yes, he could say no; there was much wind issued from the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the throat at that time - A. I did not before I went to the magistrate; I asked him again, Mr. Crickett did you do this? he said, no. Did your niece do this? he said, yes. After that I went to the magistrate, the magistrate came there, I was present, the examination took place about two o'clock. On the evening of the same day, between eight and nine o'clock, I went there again, my daughter Boosey and her husband was present. When I entered the room I went to his bedside, I found he was more capable of articulating than I had seen him before; I then said to him, Mr. Crickett, did you cut your own throat; he said, with a peculiar emphasis, no; I then said, did your niece do it, he replied plainer than I had heard him before, yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At any of these conversations was the niece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200021"/>present - A. When the magistrate was there she was present, but no other time.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect at any period of his life whether he had been insane - A. In the middle part of his life he had been insane, I understand, and about seventeen years ago I thought I saw a little wildness in consequence of some little misfortunes, it soon went away; from that time to his decease I did not observe the least return of it. I saw the wound almost a day before he died; the windpipe was nearly cut through; some tapinda that he took came through it. I fetched Mr. Fox to dress the wound. The last conversation that I had with him was a few minutes before his death. Mr.

            . I live next door to the deceased. I have known Mr. Cricket four years, he had been confined to his bed about six months, he had not been able to cut his meat some time; the prisoner told me he could not help himself, she was obliged to assist him like a baby. On the Saturday night, about nine o'clock, I saw her, I believe she did not stop with me ten minutes. I saw her the next morning about eight o'clock, she came to me in great distress; she said, my uncle has cut his throat, about two o'clock in the morning, as nigh as she could guess; she was awoke with a great smell; she went round to her uncle, and said, uncle, what have you been doing; she received no answer, nor had not received any answer up to the time that she was speaking to me; I asked her why she did not call for assistance; her reply was, as her uncle was not dead she did not wish to disturb any body. I called my husband to go for assistance. He did. I went in on the Monday morning, and kneeled down by his bed side, I believe he saw me, I told him my name was Sarah Saunders; I said, Mr. Crickett, I am going to ask you a question, I hope you will resolve it; I said, Mr. Crickett, did you do this act yourself; his reply was, no, quite distinct; I asked him the second time, Mr. Crickett, are you sure that you did not do it yourself; he answered no; I then said, did your niece do it; after resting some time he replied, yes, distinctly. I asked the two persons in the room to give attention, they said the heard it; they are not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long had you known the deceased - A. Four years; my husband had known him forty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that the poor man was afflicted with insanity some years back - do not you know that he some years ago hanged himself - A. I have heard my husband say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner came to you in great distress, there was no one to take care of this old man out her - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did she take great care of him - A. So far as I know.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Mr. Holloway that has been examined; I live at No. 4, Spital-street. On Sunday morning, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the deceased's house, before the wound was dressed; Miss Woolthorpe was present and my husband; I uncovered the bed as soon as I went in; the wound appeared to be three inches in length across his throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the windpipe was cut - A. Mr. Fox put his finger in as he was laying on his right side; that side of the bed was very bloody, the other side was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the morning state what past - A. The prisoner met me at the door and said, I am glad to see you. I then went and uncovered the bed, he seemed to me to be done bleeding. I asked the prisoner how long it had been done; she said she awoke at about half past two in the morning and found herself all in blood; she said to him, uncle, what have you done; he made no reply; she got up and walked about the room till she was very cold, then she lit the fire; I said, why did not you send for assistance before now; she said, she wanted somebody to administer that advice. I asked her what he did it with; she said a table-knife; I said, let me look at it; she gave it me out of the closet; I said, you have wiped it; she said, she had on a flannel waistcoat that he had tied round his body; she had taken the waistcoat off his arms, and wiped the knife on that flannel waistcoat. She then produced me a copy of a letter that she had sent my father telling me that she writ that copy in case any thing should happen. I asked her where she found the knife, because she said her uncle did it, and she supposed he had flung it out of bed; she said she found it afterwards at the foot of the bed, by his side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Crickett - A. I have known him from my infancy. I was present when Mr.

            , he was then in a doze. At one o'clock I went to the house again; I saw him then, and conversed with him; I sat down by his bed-side. I said Mr. Crickett, I am Mr. Lemaire's son, your old acquaintance; he looked up, and put out his hand; I said, Mr. Crickett, did you do it yourself, he drawed his hands together, and said, no; he then put his hands together, his lips muttered; what he said I could not understand; he appeared to me to be in devotion, he appeared then rather saint; I suppose it was two minutes before I put another question to him, I then said, who did do it Mr. Crickett; he made no reply; I said, did your niece do it, Mr. Crickett; at that time his hands laid upon the sheet, he raised his hand and put it to his throat, but did not speak; I put the same question to him three times, every time he repeated the same motion by putting his hand to his throat, but did not speak. I know the prisoner was at Worship-street Office, I went there, and the magistrate came with me to the dying man's apartment. At seven o'clock in the evening, on the same day, I went to Mr. Crickett's house, I kneeled down by the bedside, he appeared to me to be more revived than when I had seen him in the middle of the day; I put my hand on his shoulder, he looked at me, I said my name is Lemaire. Did you do this rash act yourself, Mr. Crickett; he said, no, and that strong. Did you do it yourself, Mr. Crickett - no. At that time the air issued through the aperture of the windpipe, and he appeared saint, I gave him some wine, it issued out of his windpipe. I said as your dissolution is issuing, I hope you are prepared for where you are going; he turned his head upon the pillow and said, no; Mr. Crickett are you sure that your niece did it; he said, yes. Mr. Crickett are you sure that you did not do it yourself? no. Are you sure that your niece did it? Yes. They are the last words I heard him utter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. During the time that you have known Mr. Crickett do you know of your own knowledge of his being deranged - A. Yes; I know of his being confined in Bedlam, the first time 1777 or 78. I was then but young. I cannot say how long he was confined; he afterwards came out, he was restored to his faculties; in 1785 or 86 he was deranged again; after that I have heard that he was deranged a third time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever observed any appearance of derangement about him lately - A. No, but a great dissatisfaction about him, his salary being so small.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FOX. I am a surgeon, I live in Bishopgate-street. On Sunday the 10th I went to the deceased about ten o'clock in the morning, I found a wound across the throat, from two to three inches in length, and about one in depth; the windpipe was partly divided. I asked the deceased if he cut his throat himself; he said no. I asked him if his ce cut it, he made no reply to that. I afterwards dressed it; he appeared to have last a vast deal of blood. I have known him about eighteen months and frequently attended him; I have seen a mental variance in his understanding I never saw him of his bed for the time I knew him; I should suppose he was bed ridden.</p>
               <p>Q. From the infirm state he was in, he being bed ridden, was he capable of inflicting that wound himself - A. I should think not. In insanity I should; think he might possess more energy at that time; that wound was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley A momentary fit of insanity produces momentary strength - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And a man more advanced in life is more liable to it at that time - A. Certainly The large arteries were not cut, if they had been cut he would have bled to death; the smaller ones might stop The wound might be inflicted on the Saturday before; what time it is impossible for me to state.</p>

She asked me to go to ask Mr. Holloway of the bank to let her have twenty pounds; she said she was very much embarrassed, she wished to go into the country and leave her uncle; I asked Mr. Holloway if he would let her have twenty pound; he said no; I returned the same evening and acquainted her with Mr. Holloway's decision. She said she did not know what she should do; I told her if she was distressed it was a pity but what she should go in the country, and leave her uncle at once, we would take care of him. In our conversation I proposed his going into St. Bride's workhouse. I told her as he had fifteen shillings and nine-pence coming in he would be very comfortable there; Miss Woodthorpe seemed much pleased, and said that exactly met her idea. I then said to her, remember Miss Woodthorpe you will not have the goods; your uncle told me twenty years ago that he had willed them to Mr. Holloway of Hampton-court, and Mr. Holloway of the Bank. She then said, I do not know what I am to do now, Mr. Holloway will not let me have twenty pound, and I am not to have the goods; what am I to do, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200023"/>go into the country.</p>

            . I am a ticket porter, I ply at the Change. In December, I cannot ascertain the day of the month; I recollect a person applying to me to get a note cashed at the bankers. I verily believe the prisoner to be the person. I was on my stand at the Bank Buildings. I believe the prisoner to be the person, he put a paper in my hand, and enquired for St. Mildred's Court, I told him he had passed it; he took a twenty pound note out, and asked me to get two ten pound notes for the twenty pound. And he not asking my name, nor taking any notice of my number, I made a remark upon him. This is the check; I took the check of him; I said, I would do it; I presented it at Mr. Fry's banking-house, they gave me two ten pounds for it; I told them the circumstance that I had remarked; they took my name, and where I plyed; I returned with the two ten pound notes, and received a shilling of the prisoner, I believe; I returned the two ten pound notes to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200024"/>man who sent me. The prisoner said he was waiting for his master, he should have gone by rights himself, but he was afraid of missing his master. I believe upon my oath that the prisoner was the man.</p>

               <p>JOHN CHAMPION. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Newton, Birchin-lane. On Saturday the 5th of January the prisoner brought six one pound notes of the Clare bank.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take the number of these three - A. On account of the notice that we had at our office, that four one pound notes were included in that parcel, and three of those produced by the prisoner to me were three of those four notes; I gave to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110220-29-person333">Newton</persName>

               <p>Q. Was that before the lad took a memorandum - A. I apprehend it was, I gave them to Mr. Tolman.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the prisoner being apprehended did you signify for what he was taken - A. Certainly; he at first denied the fact, and then he confessed to have taken a few. They are our property. I should imagine the weight he took to be five hundred pounds and they are as late as 1806.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I readily acknowledge here, as I did before the Lord Mayor. I disposed of some as waste paper. I did not think it was a serious offence because my master ordered me to burn a considerable number of papers and books in the warehouse yard, I certainly should have asked my employer's leave. I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

            . I am an officer. On February the 9th, in the evening between six and seven, I stood in Aldgate High-street. I saw the prisoner and her son in company together, as she passed by she looked very hard at me; I had suspicion; I followed her and she looked back two or three times, and just as I got by her; I turned round upon my heel she delivered a parcel to her son, her son ran to the other side of the way; I crossed over and stopped him; he cried out for his mother. I asked him what he had got, he said he did not steal it his mother stole it, I took hold of him and going to the watchhouse, I delivered him up to my brother officer. I pursued the mother, and found her in a wine vaults, in Petticoat lane, I told her I had taken her boy, he was crying for her, she said she had no boy except what was in the workhouse, when I took her to the watchhouse, the boy owned her as his mother, she said she knew nothing about it. The boy told me he would shew me where it was taken from; I went with the boy to Mr. Kirkpatrick's, in Gracechurch-street; the boy shewed me the pile where his mother took it from; the boy being under nine years of age was discharged. This is the piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that your property - A. It is; I had twelve pieces of the same sort only the day before; the mark is cut off; I am satisfied it is my own. I would not swear that it was.</p>

            . Elizabeth Mayberry came to Bow Street office for a warrant, I and Limbrick went and searched the prisoner's room, in her box I found a bag of duplicates, there were nineteen duplicates at Mr. Chandler's, and sixteen of the other pawnbroker's. When I took them out of the box, she said,</p>
               <p>"give them to me, they are not my own."</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Look at these duplicates. - A. Fifteen of the duplicates correspond to the things I produce, and are the duplicates I gave to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday night, about half past six, I was in Bishopgate Street, I met the prisoner with this glass under his arm, I asked him what he had got, he told me a glass, he was going to get it new framed, I told him I thought it very odd to get a glass framed of a Sunday night, I took him into a house, I searched him, and found a crow and two picklock keys, and two or three matches upon him, I secured him and took him to the Compter. The prosecutor applied to me the same night, saying that he had been robbed of a glass, I never let him see the glass till he came before the Lord Mayor, there he described the glass, and claimed it as his property. Here is a nail with which the glass was fastened, I found it on the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this court from where you stopped the prisoner. - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the glass to be my husband's property, we have had it between twenty and thirty years.</p>

On Sunday I was out drinking all day, on my coming home at night, I met a man whom I formerly knew, he asked me if I would take a few things home with me, which was a glass, two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200028"/>keys, and a piece of iron about a foot long, he said he was going to have his things seized for rent, I consented, and was stopped by the officer and sent to the Compter. This is the first time I ever was tried, I am innocent of what I am charged with.</p>

On Tuesday the 5th of February, between five and six, I was standing in the shop, I observed a person go by whom I knew to be the person that had broken the window that day week, I said to a young man standing by, that I knew it to be the person that had broken the window that day week, that I had no doubt but they were then about it. On my standing in the shop, I saw a person in a white apron before the window, and I heard the window crack, and when I got nearer the window, I saw another person standing looking in at the door, whom I had also seen on the Tuesday before breaking the window, I then withdrew behind some packs of goods which were in the shop, and as soon as I saw the men go away I ran over the packs to the window, then I observed a person put a hand through a hole which had been made in the glass, and take a piece of handkerchiefs out, I cannot positively swear to the prisoner's face, it was rather dark, but his person and manner was seemingly the same, I ran out of the door, I saw the prisoner standing two yards from the window, putting something under his coat. After the window had been cut the Tuesday before, we took the precaution to put a string to the handkerchiefs, which string had gone out of the window. I saw a string hanging down under his coat, there were two others standing there with him, I believe there were two, one I am sure of, and seeing the string hang in front of his coat, I went in the front of him, I knew him to be the same man that took them out of the window, I took hold of him by the collar, he then immediately took them from under his coat and threw them on the ground, and asked me what I wanted with him, I told him that I was sure that he had taken the handkerchiefs out of the window, he immediately then pointed to the handkerchiefs on the ground, and desired a person to take them up, and in pointing to the handkerchiefs on the ground, the prisoner sprang from me, and ran away, I pursued him, I collared him again after he had ran about a dozen yards, my next door neighbour came to my help, we brought him in, the constable was then sent for, he was then committed to his custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear that I did take the handkerchiefs out of the window. - A. Yes, I can from your person.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state were the chests. - A. The lids were opened for shew. In consequence of information I watched the prisoner, towards the close of the day I observed him go into a room by himself, after the windows were shut, he staid there a minute or two, he returned towards me again, he went into the room again, the second time he staid there a short time, when he was coming towards me I perceived him rubbing his hands towards the waistband of his breeches, I then went to the Elder, and told him I had reason to believe he had tea about him, I made it known to Mr. Jones; the warehouse keeper. The bell was ringing, the prisoner was coming down stairs, I had Mr. Brooks with me, I called the prisoner of one side, he followed me into the store room, I said,</p>
               <p>"Churton, I have reason to believe you have some tea about you," he said, he had not, I began to unbutton the waistband of his breeches, there I saw this tea in this bag, the bag was tied to his waistband as a sob, and fastened behind, I took the tea out of the bag, this is the tea, there is twelve ounces of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there tea of this description in the warehouse where this man was working. - A. There was, Mr. Sannders asked the prisoner how long he had been at this work, he said no great while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been at work there. - A. About twenty years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you lose your watch without knowing it. - A. Because she put her arm round my neck, I did not feel it go away, the watch was taken from my fob, the notes were in a little bag in this side pocket, the money was wrapped up in a dirty rag, and a silver shilling of George the Second.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it. - A. No, but when I was coming away I searched, and found my property was gone, the officers searched her, they have got my watch, three dollars, and that new shilling which were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober. - A. I was rather the worse for liquor, but sensible, I knew what I did.</p>

            . I live at Watford. From the information of the last witness, I immediately went to Edgware, I heard from Burger's master, that he was gone to town with a load of hay. I followed the load of hay, and about a hundred yards before I came to Hampstead, I observed the end of a full sack of corn as I supposed it to be, the end was not quite covered with a cloth, the other part was. I went down Hampstead to get a constable, which I did, and then went to meet Burgers. When we got in sight of him, I saw him set his horses off from where Mr. Giles lived, he was talking to Mr. Giles, he was on the foot-path, I gave the constable charge of him, and asked him what he had done with the corn, he said he had none, I told him I was sure he had, I had seen one of the sacks when I passed him, I asked Mr. Giles if he knew any thing about it, he said he did not, I went into Mr. Giles's house, I asked him where the corn was again, he said he had not seen any, I told him I should insist upon finding it before I quitted the premises, I was sure it was there, I searched the ground floor, found nothing there, I went down stairs, and then I found the corn. I told

               <p>Q. Did you know the corn. - A. Yes, so far as any person can know corn, the sample from the bulk. Giles, the prisoner then told me that he bought it of Burgers, and gave him a pound note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the corn worth. - A. About a pound, or a guinea. This is the sack, it was one entrusted in my care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it, and gave a fair price, it was shot in an open town, where a number of people must have passed. I had no thought of a person offering to sell a stolen thing at that time of the day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you deliver over to him gold for the purpose of working up. - A. I did, fifty-nine ounces odd, from the time of his coming, to the 9th of February. He quitted my house on the 7th of February at dinner, and left word that he should return on Friday at dinner, I met him on the Friday in Fleet Market, I observed to him, I was surprized at his conduct in stopping away, and leaving the men in the shop, that he knew they wanted his directions, he said it was a dispute in the family, but he would be with me on the Saturday morning. He came on Saturday morning about nine o'clock, the usual hour I went up into the shop, he was busy about a pair of ear rings, his conduct appeared singular, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, I should like the account settled," he went into the accompting house, and the account was settled, and the deficiency appeared to be thirteen ounces, six pennyweights, and twelve grains of gold, of the quality of four pounds per ounce. I had two officers in my house, I said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, you have no objection of going with me to your lodging," he said,</p>
               <p>"no, but you have no occasion of giving yourself that trouble, there is nothing there. On our going to his lodgings, he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not blame you for going, you will find gold there, and a number of things that are not finished, but they are my own property. We went to his lodging, there was a board in his bed room, fixed the same as the boards we work at, on the side of that board was a small cabinet, and several drawers to it, the first drawer we opened, contained a sketch of the principal part of my drawings, which no person in the business has but myself, in the next drawer was an ingot of gold about two ounces, I said when the ingot was taken out,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wiltshire, could I suppose you had been so cruel a man," in the drawer we found another ingot of gold of a commoner quality, which had been reduced after being taken from my house, in the fourth drawer we found a paper containing four lumps of gold, they might weigh ten or twelve pennyweights a lump, in the same drawer we found a box containing some garnets and pearls, three of the garnets were taken from my drawer, I have the collets out of which they came. He was taken to St. Anns watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that gold per ounce. - A. Perhaps not more than three pounds, and that common ingot and the lumps about forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How many men had you at work in your house. - A. There is nine or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a waste in gold during the time it is worked. - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the commencement of this account take place, you say fifty-nine ounces odd, were delivered to him during the time he was there. - A. The commencement of this account took place on the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. All these men that were working in your shop, had the handling of this gold, and the working it. - A. I weighed it to the foreman, and he has to give it the workmen, he does not weigh it to them, it would be impossible, we gather the filings, put them into a pot for the purpose of bringing it into one body.</p>
               <p>Q. Now that would occasion a deficiency. - A. Perhaps ten pennyweights.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that as it is not the foreman's business to weigh the quantity of gold given to each man under him he had not the means of ascertaining whether each man used that gold that was not weighed to him, and it was not weighed when taken from the men. - A. It would be impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know in the course of your trade there would be a loss. - A. Yes, we allow for that.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you do not mean to swear to that gold. - A. I cannot swear to the form of that gold, I am confident it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Among other deficiencies, there is the sweepings. - A. I allowed him two ounces and a half for that.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you in your trade allow your foreman to carry on trade for himself. - A. No, never, a man with a salary of three guineas a week.</p>

            . These are the articles that I found in the prisoner's room. This case contains a dozen gold seals, here is several papers of gold and garnets, these are the three garnets, Mr. Musgrove said he could swear to being his property, the prisoner said it was all his property, he now and then got a light guinea, which he melted down for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am quite sure that these three garnets came out of this collet, they are worth about three shillings, I am confident they are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. BONNET. Q. You belong to Messrs. Cox and Merle, refiners. - A. I do. On the 8th of February I purchased an ingot of gold of the prisoner, it had been left on the 8th of February for the purpose of being essayed, in order to ascertain the quality. On the 8th the prisoner came to our accompting-house, I paid him for four ounces, sixteen pennyweights, fifteen grains, at fifty-five shillings an ounce, it amounted to thirteen pound, four shillings, and ten pence. Wiltshire, Charles Street, Long Acre, is the address he gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Those seals have been the work of my own time nights and mornings, I sold four ounces odd for money to purchase the garnets and pearls, I purposed leaving my master on the Monday, and going into business for myself.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not get away your watch. - A. No, they then walked away.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner did not run away. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing - A. No, I got up and followed them, and called out watch, then they walked on the other side of the road, I kept my eye upon them, they crossed over and came to the corner of Goudge Street, then I called out watch again, I told the prisoner that he tried to rob me of my watch, he struck me on the face then, and ran away, I ran after him, and the watchman and more people ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him - A. No, I lost sight of him, I did not see him until I saw him at the watch-house that same evening about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the men that were with him. - A. I did not see them any more, they ran away at the same time that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this man before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take sufficient notice of him so as to know him again. - A. Yes; he held his head over me at the time he was trying to pull my watch, I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was dressed in a drab coat, and a shawl handkerchief round his neck, a black handkerchief, and a pair of patent cord breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he any part of the dress now. - A. Yes, the drab coat is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the chain, seal, and key. - A. The seal and key cost me two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. What are you. - A. I am an apprentice to a taylor, I was going of an errand for my master.</p>

               <p>Q. The shops were all shut. - A. It was facing of Tottenham Court Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. That is darker still; you say there were ten men walking together. - A. There were eight or ten, they all came up together, the rest held me down while he pulled my watch chain.</p>
               <p>Q. We did not hear that before; you saw this young man at the watchhouse, and there you saw the colour of his clothes. - A. I saw his dress by the light of the lamps before.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your watch fastened to your pocket. - A. No, I had my hand in my pocket holding the watch in my hand, the watch chain was hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out. - A. I was going to cry out, one of them put his hand over my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. That we did not hear before, why did not you tell that to his Lordship; you say he stopped you, knocked you down, and while you were down, you were held down by the others, at which time he pulled at your chain. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they turned into Goudge Street. - A. They walked straight on, I called watch, directly I came up to him they crossed over to the other side of the road, and came to the corner of Goudge Street, they returned again.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore they returned to meet you, and then you charged them with a robbery. - A. Yes, and he hit me a slap on the face, there were eight or ten with him then.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went into Goudge Street, and he gave you a slap of the face, did they all run away together. - A. Yes the prisoner did not separate from the rest until he got to the corner of Windmill Street, the watchman hollowed out which is the man, some said this way, and some said the other, they tried to baulk the watchman, I had lost sight of him then, I did not see him afterwards, until I saw him at the watchhouse door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that saw you in possession of that watch. - A. My father is here, he knew I had a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father see you that evening. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been stopping at the corner of that chapel talking to two boys or two girls - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you come from. - A. From Mr. Pringle's in Wardour Street; I was going to Carmarthen Street, I was facing of Tottenham Court Chapel when they met me</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard any body talking about a 40 l. reward. - A. No, I do not know there is a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know if in case this man is convicted that you shall get a share of a 40 l. reward. - A No, I never heard any body say so neither in the watchhouse or elsewhere, this is the first time I have heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you laying down on the ground while you say the person was pulling at your watch. - A. About two minutes on the ground, I was upon my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people passing at the time. - A. I do not know that there was any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the same story at the watchhouse as you have here. - A. When the watchhouse people asked who gave charge, I said I give charge of him for robbing me of part of a steel chain, a seal, and a key.</p>
               <p>- MURPHY. I am a watchman, I heard the cry of watch, it was from five to ten minutes past nine, I did not know who it was, I saw the boy in the watch-house, it was better than a quarter after nine before I carried him to the watchhouse, when they all cried out stop thief, I followed him, some of them said this is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200036"/>man, and some said not, I took him to the watchhouse in consequence of the cry of stop thief, there was a great crowd about the watchhouse, Kennedy said the prisoner at the bar was the person that robbed him, the constable searched him, he found none of the things that were taken from the boy; the prisoner had the same coloured coat on then as he had now.</p>

In the meantime she was going out of the door, I missed one of the handkerchiefs which I had previously shewn her, I went out of the door and stopped her, one of the handkerchiefs dropped from her as she was before the window, not the one that I missed, then there dropped a second and a third, and the one that I missed came the fourth, and then a fifth dropped on the step as we were returning in; there were two other pieces dropped one with two in it, and the other three, they are not brought forward, the others were five single handkerchiefs, they dropped from between her legs, I believe the five handkerchiefs to be mine, I shall only swear to one that is six shillings, they cost me more, we sell them at eight shillings, that one has our mark to it. The prisoner was in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come to your shop on the 31st of January last. - A. Yes, near eight o'clock, there was another lad with him, the other lad asked for a halfpenny pickled cucumber, I served him, he paid for it, he asked the prisoner if he would have one, he said yes, I served the prisoner, I had suspicion that there was something out of the window, I heard his elbow against the boards, the prisoner stood by the window, I came round and looked, and saw the cake of wax between his thighs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were had it been laying before he came in. - A. In the window, I had seen it there in the course of the day; when I saw that I laid hold of the prisoner, I said, here is a pretty fellow to take the wax out of the window, he said he would beg me ten thousand pardons, I took him to Hatton Garden Office immediately, the wax was left at my shop, the officer came back and fetched it, I knew the wax, it was brought here last sessions, and I marked it at Hatton Garden, there is five pound and a half, it is worth sixteen shillings, it cost me that.</p>
               <p>Q. It was done privately, without your knowledge. - A. It was done without my knowledge, there was nobody in my shop but me, and the prisoner, and the other lad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Do you know that that little boy is trying for a capital offence. - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you heard his elbow, that excited your suspicion. - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was this window. - A. As high as windows generally are, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the bees wax falling, would make a noise. - A. It did not fall, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a noise that brought you round. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went round, you saw it, he was standing close to the window. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he left the bees wax in the shop, and went to Hatton Garden. - A. I left my wife in the shop, and a man.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces of bees wax had you in the shop. - A. Five or six, they were all laying together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that which you produce is the cake which you took from the boy. - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the boy pretend, when you charged him with it, that it had fell by accident, and he meant to put it up again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are all your cakes marked alike. - A. No, they are not, this was marked at Hatton Garden office, it was here last sessions. I should wish to recommend the prisoner to mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The bees wax fell down by accident, I catched it between my thighs, I did not intend to steal it.</p>
               <p>Court, Q. to Prosecutor. From what you saw could it be by accident that it fell down. - A. It was impossible.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that cheese again. - Yes, here is a mark that was put on immediately, and here is a V that was on it before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this cheese. - A. About fifteen shillings, prime cost.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take it. - A. No.</p>

            . On the 3d of December last, I went into Mrs. Simpson's for a porter, the prisoner followed me, I gave her the cloth, and a card where I live at Hackney. I asked her whether she could read, she said she could not, but she would ask, she should be sure to find it. I then walked on briskly when I got to the bottom of Wood-street, I turned round and saw her coming, I then walked on supposing she would follow me and bring the cloth. After I got home and waiting near an hour, I felt uneasy about my property, I returned back to Mrs. Simpson's in Noble-street and enquired if she knew the prisoner; she said the prisoner was recommended to her by Mr. Triggey to serve her with butter and eggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the woman - A. I believe she is so far, if she is the person that followed me out of the public house, I will swear that she is the person that had my property.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Nightingale. On the 2d of September, I went to the City road for twenty-four boxes, about ten minutes after six in the evening, as I was returning in Bishopsgate churchyard, I rested my boxes on the pitching block. The prisoner Holmes, as I suppose it to be, came and asked me the way to Moorfields, I directed him, then he asked me the way to Pitman's, I told him I believed it was two or three doors round the corner by the right hand, there was another man standing at the public house door, the prisoner says to the other man this is the way, and I saw no more of that man, I looked for two or three minutes to see which way Holmes went to see if he went right. I lost sight of him, when I turned round to look for my goods they were gone. I ran after Holmes, I could see no more of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get your boxes again - A. They have been recovered. I cannot swear to the prisoner's face, but he had on a velveteen jacket and small-clothes. This was on Saturday, on Wednesday I saw the boxes again.</p>

This one was carrying a large bundle, I was obliged to get close to the wall to let him pass; the other had nothing, he went before; I said to my fellow officer all was not right, I followed them up the court, he rushed into a house, and I after him, I took hold of the property and him, likewise I asked him how he came by that, he said that a man at the end of the court had given them to him to bring up to the first house in the court; I took him and his companion into custody, and took him to Whitechapel office.

I was standing in the market, the prisoner asked me if I wanted a job; I told him I did; I followed the prisoner, he desired me to take the sheep out of that shop; I did, and followed him; he went down Newgate-street, and took it of me, and told me I could not carry it; I thought he meaned, not to pay me; I told him I could carry two; he took me down Snow-hill, to Fox and Knot Court, there we had a quartern of gin in three outs.

We found the sack in the ship, but the pistols were not in the sack. The custom-house officer told us that Bravo took the pistols away in a handkerchief; I went to Bravo's lodgings, and took an officer; the prisoner denied having the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the pistols - A. Yes; about the 15th of January, in London Wall, at Mr. Read's.</p>
               <p>- MENDOZA. The prisoner was brought to my house by Lumbazy; he said, here is a young man, a mate of a ship, he has a pair of pistols to sell. I said I was no judge, I would shew them to the trade.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in a destitute and unfortunate situation. My passage to the British shore was totally unavoidable. I am a native of Sweden; owing to the conscripts made by the French government I left my home. I have no qualification for being a soldier, being subject to fits. My father proposed to send me to Philadelphia; having procured for me money he sent me to embark in an American vessel. Not being able to go in the American vessel I was recommended to take a passage on board a ship bound to England, from which it was told me that I might easily go to America. I am not only destitute of a communication to my father, but prevented from my voyage to America. Fortunately my destitute case is made known to a gentleman, this gentleman knows my father; it is from the kind munificence of this gentleman I am obliged to for my existence.</p>

I asked the child if they were for sale; she said, no, they were her mother's, that lived in Whitechapel; I said, I want to know who your mother is. The shawls were taken from the child and handed to me. The child went off, I followed the child; passing up the middle of Bishopgate-church yard the prisoner made a stand. The child began to cry, and said she had got them things from Mrs. Forster's; I said to the prisoner, is this your child? she said</p>
               <p>"no, I know her, I do not deny what I have done." I asked who was Mrs. Forster; the child took me to Mrs. Forster's. At Mrs. Foster's door she said, I am the mother, and this is Mrs. Foster's. I took the property; I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Foster said they were her property.</p>
               <p>MR. SAPWELL. I took the prisoner into custody. These are the shawls.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Smith. On the 4th of February, about nine at night, the prisoner came into the shop, she asked for a three halfpenny candle, I served her, I got on the steps, taking down some candles, I kept my eye upon her, she took a basket of candles and put it under her cloak, and went out of the shop, I pursued her and took her, she let the basket of candles fall on the stones, and then she said she had nothing but the three-halfpenny candle she had bought and paid for. They are my master's candles, the watchman took charge of her.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. On the 4th of this month, I stopped the prisoner at Battle-bridge, facing the White hart she was coming from Tottenham-court-road way, she had this hemp in this bag under her cloak, she stopped to rest, I asked her what she had got, she said hemp, she was going to take it to Mr. Griffiths's rope-ground, Hackney-road, and I might go with her, I should find it all right. I asked her where she brought it from, she said just above, I asked her whether it was Mrs. Cooper's which was close by, she said no, I told her I must detain her, and took her to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the hemp, and point out what you know to be yours - A. This dozen had been delivered out to her sister to spin on the Friday before, I am sure from the manner it is made up.</p>

When she had hold of me I imagine she put her hand behind me underneath my coat. I immediately went back to a lamp, knowing I had some silver in the other pocket I took it out to see whether I had mixed the gold with the silver, I found I had not; I ran up and down the City-road, I could not find the prisoner; I went into the public-house where the prisoner first accosted me; there I saw the prisoner at the bar drinking with some more people; a constable was in the house; the prisoner was searched immediately; he found a guinea and a half upon her.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of February I was called into a lodging house in Church-lane, St. Giles's; I shook the prisoner; the purse dropped down, it contained a one pound note, a dollar, and a shilling. When I came from searching the bed I went to search her again; she put down the watch. This is the watch and the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the watch - A. It is my watch, and this is my purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He laid the purse in my lap; I ask him whether he did or did not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That I cannot tell; I did not know whether I had the watch with me at the time.</p>

            . Q. You superintend the business of William Turner - A. Yes, on the 15th of February, I gave the prisoner a bill for two tons of potatoes, he was to take them them to Mr. Maclean, Young's Quay, Thames-street. In consequence of information, I got Mr. Rickards and Mr. Baker to watch the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOW BAKER. I am the master of a West Indiaman; I, with Mr. Rickards, watched the prisoner along Mile-end road; we were walking towards Bow, and he was coming from Stratford, when we got opposite Thompson's Nursery. The prisoner got up in the waggon, he continued at the tail of the waggon, the tail board was then down, he put the sack at the near side of the waggon; as he got out of the waggon the horses went on; the sack fell out of the waggon, the sack bursted in falling out, and he fell out of the waggon; about the fourth part of the sack of potatoes were scattered on the ground; he asked two persons to get the sack in the waggon again, and gave to them the scattered potatoes; he put that sack on the opposite side to where it was before; he put a full sack in the spot where the other sack was before; he drove on to the Coach and Horses, Mile End-road, he drove three doors from the public-house; he looked about seven or eight minutes, when an opportunity offered he got the sack on his back, and hurried into a passage to a stable belonging to the Coach and Horses.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the gentleman's name that keeps the Coach and Horses - A. Porter. I met the prisoner coming out; I went in and saw the potatoes in the passage, that led to the stable; I took off the name,

             upon the sack; I asked the prisoner what he was going to do with the sack of potatoes; he said he thought he had one too many, he wished to leave it there until he returned, he was going to take it back to his master. A constable was sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord upon that occasion - A. Yes. The landlord wished the sack to be restored again that there might be an end of the business; he called it a foolish piece of business; the man had made a mistake.</p>

On the Monday morning I went up to make his bed, the prisoner was not at home; on my turning the bed I found one brass cock between the two beds, I told my mistress of it. I went up of my own accord about an hour afterwards, I looked in the boy's great coat pocket, I found another brass cock. I took it down to my mistress.</p>

After master had done dinner I sat down to dinner alongside of the girl. We went to work and came home about six o'clock. I told master that I wanted to clean the harness; master has got a horse and two or three chaises; he said, very well; I went into the stable and cleaned the harness, he told me he wanted to go out shortly; I cleaned the horse, and was cutting his tail; I went to tea, and master went out. I went to make a finish of the horses tail, Mr. Armstrong came into the stable; Mr. Armstrong knows me well; he said, my lad, your master accuses you of stealing these cocks; is this your coat; I said yes. Your master has found these two cocks in your coat, tell me the truth; I said, before I would take away any thing from my master I would cut my head off. I was taken away; my friends would have known nothing of it if it had not been for Mr. Armstrong.</p>

I lost a great deal of property, and I did not know how I lost them; I sent Mrs. Palmer to buy a plate of tin, and a sauce-pan, with a view to see whether he would bring that money to accompt. This was on the 12th of January, about the middle of the day. I staid till she came back with the articles, then I went home; the prisoner was in the shop, I saw him; he throwed down two shillings; he said he had sold a three quart saucepan, and did a job in the bargain. That is all he gave account for. This was on the Saturday, on Monday he was taken up.</p>

            , dealers in coals, timber, and flour. On Thursday the 14th of this month I was going out with my master's team, the waggon was loaded with fourteen sacks of flour, a chaldron of coals; and I had some business to do, and the man that was with me drove my team on for me; I overtook the team between White Friers and Bunhill-row; I was shooting the coals at Mr. Allens; the prisoner came to me and said, you are shooting your coals without a measure; I told him I really did not know whether I was or no; I had a little business to do, I was obliged to leave the waggon; I laid down the case to him, and told him the particulars what I left the waggon for; he said he would be my friend, if that was the case. It was a particular friend of his that took the number, he would speak to him for me; I thanked him, and he went away; I did not see him again myself till seven o'clock the next evening; he then said he would settle it for a dollar, and a tankard of porter. I agreed to pay the dollar, and the expences they had been at: the prisoner and another man as a witness went to my apartment; I gave the prisoner a dollar and five shillings in silver; the prisoner wrote me a receipt, and gave it me. After the prisoner gave me the receipt I asked him what authority he had to do such a thing; he said he had authority from government, or by act of parliament to do it, I cannot say which; I then had him taken in custody, and the next day he was taken before the alderman.</p>

            . On the 15th of February, at seven o'clock I went to my brother's apartment, the prisoner and another man were there, they related the story that a friend of theirs had taken the number; but had told them to make it up; they said they thought my brother was a hard-working man, they would let him off as light as they could for a few shillings, and something to drink, my brother's wife was very much frightened at seeing them to and fro all the day; I advised them to go over the way to the public-house, and get a little beer till my brother came in. Soon after I went over to see if they had been there; they were at the public-house, and the man that they said had taken the number, he was there. My brother came out with a man of the name of Jackson. The man that they said had taken the number, spoke to me; he said, I will settle with you any where, but not with

             the coalman, he knows me. He said Smith and the other man were his men, they could settle as well. We went down to my brother, my brother paid down to the prisoner five shilling and a dollar, and they said they would pay for the liquor that they had; before my brother stopped one shilling they gave a receipt for the ten shillings. After the prisoner had got the money he sent for half a pint of gin, and after that he took the eight shillings and fourpence, put it in paper, and was going out my brother stopped him, and asked him what authority he had to come, and extort money from him; I understood he said he had authority from some Queen-square officer. When my brother charged the constable with him, he went back and flung the money on the table, said he would not have it, and owned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200052"/>himself in a fault.</p>

On the 19th of January the prisoner called at our house; he called for a glass of grog; it was near nine o'clock; he asked me if captain Armstrong or captain Selby had called there; I told him, no; he said, if they had not they would call that night, or early the next morning. He ordered two beds, two rooms, and two fires, and asked me to procure him a porter to go and fetch the luggage from Billingsgate; he then ordered some supper, and another glass of grog before he went out, that was eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for his grog - A. No, nor for his supper; he ate his supper, and went out with the porter and a gentleman. He turned back in a great hurry, said, can you give me change of a ten pound note, I have no change with me, or can you lend me any; I lent him a dollar and four shillings; he did not say the amount; he said he wanted some money to pay for the luggage. He went away to Billingsgate; the porter that went with him brought him back by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No.</p>

            . I am a navy agent. I happened to be in the coffee-room, I saw the prisoner, he was having beef steaks for his supper, a gentleman came in and had some turtle-soup; he said, I am very fond of turtle soup, let me have some. After supper he said he thought he knew me, he had lately come from Portsmouth, have you been on board the Royal William? I said, yes; he said, I have got a great many goods coming up from Gravesend, I am concerned that I have not got them; I am servant to captain Armstrong. I told him I knew there was such a captain in the navy; he said, he should take it as a particular favour for me to go along with him to get the things, he should be uneasy if he did not get them in his own room, where he was to sleep. I told him I would, and gave him a card of my address. We went out, he called me of one side, he said, it is very hard I cannot get change of a ten pound note; he asked me to lend him five or six shillings; I lent him a dollar. He took a coach in Cornhill; the prisoner Stubbs and me went to Billingsgate; we could find no goods in Darkhouse-lane belonging to captain Armstrong. He said to me, you had better give the coachman something to drink; I did. I said you had better discharge the coachman, he will charge for staying; he said, you had better discharge the coachman yourself, he will charge me more than you. I went to the coachman, I asked him what his fare was, he said, three shillings; I told the coachman he had two glasses of brandy, I thought two shillings would do very well; I paid him. The prisoner said, I want to pay the porter. I lent him half a crowns and then left him.</p>

            . I am a porter; I was at the Cross Keys Inn on Saturday evening the 19th of January, I saw a shabby kind of a man come in; I said to the landlord, what does this shabby man do here; he said, hold your tongue, Stubbs, he has brought a good order here. The first thing he called for a glass of ale, he ordered mutton chops and potatoes for supper, a gentleman came in and asked for a plate of mock turtle; the prisoner order a plate of mock turtle, and a glass of grog; he said he wanted a ticket porter to bring up five or six trunks, and two hat boxes; one of the trunks were so large it could not be got into a coach; he would wish to engage three or four ticket porters. I told him there were no ticket porters, if he would be ruled by me I would call a hackney coach, and I would bring as much as was in my power, which he agreed to. He wished to have the indulgence to smoke his pipe. After twelve o'clock he said, now I am ready to go. We took a coach at Cornhill, and drove to Darkhouse-lane for the goods in question. When we came to the Queen's Head there were no such goods, there we made every enquiry about the goods while he drank the grog; he could have escaped if he had been so disposed; he came to me; he said, porter, lend me five shillings; I lent him five shillings; he went out directly after I lent him the dollar; he took the last witness into a bye room and borrowed a dollar of him. Now my man said I pay the coachman; he said, no, I will ride home; Mr. Johnson paid the coachman. We had some grog; the prisoner and I walked arm in arm to the Cross Keys. We had a glass of grog, and while we were drinking it, he said, you must go with me to a musick shop in Cornhill, I must get the musick for captain Armstrong in the morning. We went to the musick shop in Cornhill, the watchman lighted us; he said as the musick shop is shut up Mr. Stubbs, this man has been very kind, what small change have you. I gave the watchman sixpence. The prisoner led led me down to the

            . I had suspicion but not strong enough to think him a vagabond. This was about half after one; he dragged me to St. Mary Axe by force. I got him into Gracechurch-street again, and coming by the passage that leads into Leadenhall-street he said, I wish you would stop, I want to make water. That moment he sprang from me into Leadenhall-market, not knowing the way of the market he stumbled against the butchers shambles; I took him; he gave me a crown, and said, do not call the watchman. I took it and said, I thought you were a rogue, I am sure of it now. I took him home, and from there to Bishopgate-street watchhouse.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Ford, trunk-maker, 110, Minories. On the 5th of November the prisoner and another man he called his steward came to my master's shop and asked if my master was at home, I told them he was not. He told me he wanted a dozen nests of trunks for the West Indies; I told him I would take the order and acquaint my master when he came home. He told me he was captain of the ship Swallow, lying in the London docks, and he lodged at Mr. Downing's, slop-seller, Upper East Smithfield. He then looked round the shop, he saw a red trunk at the door; he asked me to shew it him; I did. When I opened the trunk I found one within it; he said he would take them both; he asked me the price; I told him. He gave them to the man he called his steward, and told him to take them to his lodgings. I saw no more of him. In the afternoon the man that he called his steward came running into the shop, he said he wanted a trunk for the captain. When he came on shore there was one in the shop; I said, will this do; he said, yes, book it to the captain; I did. About a fortnight before that the prisoner came to my master's shop, he bought a trunk and paid for it. I thought him to be an honest man. I knew him again. I took that trunk to where he said his lodgings, were at Mr. Downing's.</p>
               <p>MR FORD. In consequence of the information that I received from my lad on the evening of the 5th of November I desired I might see the prisoner when he called again; the next morning he called and said he wanted to see the trunks, if they were ready. On my coming to him I asked him what his name was, he said

            , he was captain of the ship Swallow, lying in the London docks. He asked me if the nests of trunks were ready; I told him they would be ready in a day or two; he said he did not want them for ten days, get them ready, I will pay you when they are ready; I am of Miles's house in London, but I pay all these kind of things myself; he had looked out a trunk which he said he wanted to put his own clothes in, he begged me to send it down and to charge it in the bill with the rest; I told him I would. Mrs. Downing, the wife of the person that he lodged with, was with him at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge with Mr. Downing - A. He did, to their sorrow. About a week after that I had a medicine chest to make up for a gentleman, I took it down with me, and when I went to Mr. Downing he had ran away. He obtained goods of me to the amount of one pound two shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. HOOKER. The prisoner came to me, I made up goods for him in the upholstery way to the amount of seventy-nine pounds sixteen shillings and sixpence. He called himself captain Nonmus of the ship Swallow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They never sent the bills in, or else I would have paid them with pleasure. This gentleman said he would hurt me if he could.</p>
