                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, and live at 2, Hill Grove Road, West Hampstead—about 15th August last year I went to the seaside, and left my house in charge of a servant, Fanny York—on the 22nd I received a telegram, in consequence of which I returned home—I found that the front door had been forced open and the bolts wrenched off—there were marks of an instrument having been used—a wardrobe had been forced open, and I missed a number of articles of jewellery and plate, to the value of £20 or £30, among them some salt-cellars, some links, and a pin—I gave information to the police, with a list of the articles stolen—this pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) formed the centre of a cross, which belonged to my wife; it has since been made into a pin; it is a pearl and ruby—these two salt-cellars are my property, four were stolen—these links I identify, there is a peculiarity about them, one of the shanks comes through the link, the other does not; they are old and of no value—they were lying in the toilet-table drawer—I had had them a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lost more than thirty different articles—these links are very common, and could be bought at any shop for a few pence—I recognise this pin as the centre of a cross—I could not recognise the setting, it is the same shape, it is gold.</p>

On the 19th November I arrested Rawlinson on a warrant in Lambeth—I said, "There is a warrant for your apprehension for being concerned with a man named White in obtaining twenty-three waterproof coats from Abbott and Anderson, in Watling Street"—he said, "I don't know anybody of the name of White"—I said, "That may not be his right name, I mean the man I have seen frequently in your com<lb/>pany at the Rodney public-house—he replied, "I don't know anything about the coats; I never received any money for them"—on the way to the station he passed a key to a woman, and said to her, "Cut away home as soon as you can; you know what to do"—I took him to the station—I asked him his address, which he refused—I knew it, and I went there in a cab, and got there before the woman, and I subsequently apprehended her on another charge—I searched the house, but found nothing relating to this case—I could not find any indiarubber stamp—on one of the remands before the Magistrate I saw Rawlinson in one of the cells—he said he wished to make a statement, and he proceeded to say, "About three weeks ago I was at the Dog and Stile public-house in the Borough with a man named Ray, who I now understand is in custody at the Mansion House, and a man of the name of White; I saw him sell four waterproof coats to a man I knew as a horse-dealer, and who is now in Southwark for the unlawful custody of a waterproof coat for 25s.; I saw him take them away in a parcel; Ray showed me one sovereign and two half-crowns he had received for it"—I commenced to write this down, and he at once objected, and said, "I will not sign any statement, as it would only convict myself; I will swear on my oath to what I have said, if necessary."</p>

At one a.m. on 20th November Rawlinson was brought to the office by Sergeant Ward—the warrant was read over to him; he made no reply—I took him to Cloak Lane Station, where he was charged—I found on him fivepence and a pencil—he said he had been searched over the water—the same morning, as I was taking him to the Mansion House, he said, "It is one of the biggest mistakes they have ever made about the writing; I was four years at Hayes' Wharf, Tooley Street; there is plenty of my writing there if they wish to see it, but I know a little bit about it.

               <p>Newman—I know the prisoners—I lived with Rawlinson for eight days; White was living in the same house with Georgina Yates—I remember seeing Rawlinson write one day, at the beginning of October or November; he was writing on blue paper, a good-sized sheet, larger than these orders—he read out what he had written—it was, "Please to supply bearer with so many ladies' mackintoshes, also with cape, Mr. Goff"—no other name was mentioned—"White was present when it was read out, and he said, "That will do"—I could not speak to Rawlinson's writing; I cannot read—about twenty minutes past five that same day I saw both the prisoners together in Rawlinson's room—on the Friday I saw three ladies' waterproof mackintoshes behind the door—they said to me, "What do you think of these, Annie?"—I said they were very nice—they were none of these—they said they were going to pawn them—I afterwards saw some pawn-tickets on the shelf, with the name of Annie Newman on them—I asked Rawlinson what made him pawn them in that name—he said it did not matter; the first name that came would do—I took the tickets to Mrs. Yates and she read them—I afterwards saw my mother, and left the prisoner—I saw them together once afterwards in a public-house in Westminster Bridge Road; one had a light mackintosh on and the other a dark one—White had a brown paper parcel in his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, of 49, Penton Street, Clerkenwell—at the end of October or the beginning of November Harris and Nash took a room at the top of my house, as man and wife—Harris spoke very good English—Endleman called about twice, and Harris said that he should leave if I could not let Endleman have a room there—I was not able to do so—on 18th December I was in Mrs. Roberts' shop, a neighbour, and</p>

               <p>heard her say that some money was bad—Harris was there; he said nothing, but was biting the coin—on the same day I was in Mr. Shearman's shop, 10, Penton Street, close by, who showed me a bad florin—they left on the second day after because I could not accommodate Endleman—I gave information to the police, and on the 19th a detective came and examined the room they had occupied, and I saw him find some broken portions of a mould and some fused metal in the ashes—no one had occupied the room since they left.</p>

On 19th December I watched Harris and Nash, and on the 20th I went to 49, Penton Street—Fox pointed out a top bedroom, which I searched, and found in the ashes of the fireplace these pieces of a broken mould, and some fused metal—I went next day with Kidd to 22, Haberdasher Street—the door was locked, we forced it and examined a room there, and on the hob on the right side of the fireplace I found this mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and on the other hob another mould drying, and in a bag in a cupboard I found ten counterfeit florins of 1883, unfinished, corresponding with one of these moulds, some fused metal, a paper bag, a half-bag of plaster of Paris, a bag of silver sand, two spoons, and in a sack among some ashes, several pieces of what appeared to be broken moulds and fused metal—I compared them with what was found at Penton Street; they were similar—I found on a shelf two packets of cyanide of potassium, two boxes of nitrate of silver, four spoons, a knife smeared with plaster, and a file, with metal in the teeth—a few minutes afterwards Harris and Nash came in, and I told them I should take them into custody for having in their possession implements for manufacturing counterfeit coin—Harris said, "It was not me that made them, I can't make them"; and Nash said, "It is not him that makes them, it is another young man"—I searched Harris and found £1 in gold, 13s. 6d. in silver, and a farthing, all good—among it was a florin of 1872 and one of 1883—I charged them</p>

               <p>at the station, and told them what I had found in the ashes—Harris said he knew nothing about it; Nash made no reply—Harris made this statement at the station; I told him that I should take it down: "The man that made the money was up in my room this morning; I do not know what time; I was not at home; I met him where I had my dinner, and I was not there all day; it is a house in a court in Whitechapel, a Jew's restaurant kept by 1 shsky; his name is Alfred Davis; I went out about eleven this morning"—being asked how he came in possession of the coin, he said, "I do not know; I can't make money"—next day, December 22nd, I went to the house in Haberdasher Street and left, and returned about 10.15 a.m., and saw Detective Kidd struggling with Endleman on the floor, and he put up his fist and said, "I will kick your guts in," and kicked me in my hand, dislocating one of my fingers—I overpowered him with Kidd's assistance, and a uniform man who came—I searched him, and found in his left-hand jacket breast pocket six counterfeit florins of 1872 rolled up separately in tissue paper, and what is called a battery penny, copper on one side, and silver on the other, which they silver with, and in good money 10s. in gold, 11s. 3d. in silver, and 1 1/2 d.—there was a florin among the good money; it appears to have been the pattern coin; it looks white, and has plaster on the edge—I took him to the station and charged him—he said, "I found them as I was coming along this morning."</p>

I am married, and live at 22, Haberdasher Street—on December 20th the three prisoners came and wanted furnished rooms—I had only one, which I let to them—they left, and Harris and Nash came back with their boxes in about half an hour, and took possession—I could not accommodate Endleman, but he came on the Saturday morning and went up to their room—I did not hear them go out till the afternoon—I did not go up till the search, and then I saw the things found—the two men went out about 3 p.m., and came in about a quarter to eleven—I only had them there on Friday and Saturday.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 1st January, about eight, as I was leaving Wood Green Station, the prisoner came up to me and said, "My name is Eliza Whorlow; I have come to give myself up for murdering my little boy with a razor at 1, Granville Terrace '—I spoke to the acting sergeant, and from what he said I went to the house—the door was opened by Mary Whorlow—I spoke to her, and she called her brother—I went with them upstairs to an attic—I there saw a bed—I moved the counterpane, and a little girl got out of the bed—I saw blood on the bed—I then saw the deceased child lying across the bed, and another child lying asleep in the bed—that was the one that got out of the bed—I saw a wound in the neck of the deceased—he was about eight years old—I saw an open razor on the table with blood upon it—I at once sent for the doctor.</p>

I practise at Richmond Villa, Lordship Lane—on 1st January, about nine o'clock, I was called to 1, Granville Terrace, and on going up to the room, where the prisoner was, I saw the body of a child lying across the bed with its throat cut—it had apparently been dead two or three hours—I afterwards examined the body more carefully—the cause of death was loss of blood; the vessels of the neck were divided—there was no sign of any struggle; death must have been very rapid.</p>

I am a carman, of 510, Mile End Road—on December 19th, about 7 p.m., I was in Cemetery Lane, Bow—it is a lonely place; I went down Wellington Road and heard steps behind me; I went to the first lamp, which was alight, and made a full stop, turned round, and saw the prisoner and another man; I had seen them before very often—one of them gave me a blow under my ear with some instrument, which knocked me down—I screamed "Murder!" and "Police!"—one said, "Give him another one," and I got another blow on my head—the prisoner laid on top of me and tore my trousers pocket out, containing a sovereign and two half-crowns, which were safe there five minutes before I left home—they ran away through a passage—I got up, but lost sight of them—I gave information—on the 21st I saw the prisoner with five others outside the Royal Hotel, Mile End Road, and asked a constable to take him; the other sran away—I said, "This is the man who kicked me and punched me on the mouth, and took the money out of my pocket"—he made no reply—I was sober; I should know the other man if I saw him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 549). On 23rd December last I was employed as an auxiliary postman, attached to the N. W. District post office—I was dressed in plain clothes with an armlet on my right arm—on that evening I collected the letters from the Euston Road pillar-box, the Midland Station pillar and bracket boxes, the Phœnix Street Receiving-house, and the Charrington Street pillar-box—at Phœnix Street I had a registered letter and some foreign letters given me; those were in this green bag, and in this sack I had ninety-one letters; the bag and sack were tied together and over my shoulder, the green bag hanging in front, and the sack behind—I was going along Crowndale Road about ten minutes past five in the direction of the N. W. district office, Abbershot Road—I saw the prisoner and another man walking arm and arm—when I got level with them I stepped on to the edge of the pavement to allow them to pass—Smith butted me in the stomach with his head and sent me sprawling in the road—I did not let go of my bags—I jumped up on the pavement and told him that I was a postman, and that these were mail bags, and that they had better let me alone—Latridge at once dodged his head between my legs and tripped me up again, and we seized one another and struggled together in the roadway up and down several times; he got hold of the bags, trying to take them away—while we were so struggling Smith was trying to get Latridge away from me—Latridge tripped me up again, and we both fell and struggled together on the ground—Latridge got, for a second or two, the bags away from me, while we were on the ground, and Smith and the other man stood over us, and Smith struck me across the head with his belt, and the other man kicked me about the legs—I got up again, and shouted "Police," still struggling—Sergeant Ellerby came up in plain clothes, and I said, "Sergeant, these men have assaulted me, and they are trying to take these bags away"—the sergeant at once seized hold of Latridge, and I seized hold of Smith, and we took them to the station, where they were charged—this is Latridge's belt, and this is Smith's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have recovered now—when I first saw the prisoners and the other man they were coming towards me—it was getting dark, and a little foggy—my armlet was not very visible—the three men as they came towards me were arm-in-arm—they were not shouting or singing, but they were talking rather noisily—I heard them 20 yards off—I stepped to the edge of the pavement to allow them to pass, because there is just room enough for four level, not so much on account of their noisy conduct—I took no notice of them at the time—they were arm-in-arm, and took up nearly the whole of the pavement—I had a regular up and down struggle in the middle of the road with Latridge, the other two men assisting him and assaulting me—at the time he got the bags away from me for a second or two the other two were standing over me—I and the sergeant and the other constable who came up were all in plain clothes—the prisoners had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant Y</hi> 63). On 23rd December, about a quarter past five, I was passing through Crowndale Road, St. Pancras, in plain clothes—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the two prisoners with another man—Latridge had hold of the letter bag, or bags, and was trying to get them from Lancey—I knew Lancey after having a good look at him; he was covered with mud, his face and hair, from rolling in the mud—I said, "Is that Lancey?"—he said, "Yes, these men are trying to get the letter bags from me"—I said, "Hold on, this is a postman, and these are letter bags"—the man not in custody was about to strike Lancey from behind—I knocked him down, and saw no more of him—I went to Lancey's assistance, and took hold of Latridge—he became violent, and struck me several times in the face, and I called on Moore for assistance—Smith was standing behind with the third man striking at Lancey—Lancey is in my division; I should say he has been in the Force seven or eight years; he was at this station before I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Moore was with me when I came up—he is an old man, and his eyesight may not be so good as mine—he was pensioned, and not in the Force at this time—the Post Office authorities were represented at the Police-court at the first hearing—I made no written report to anyone—the charge on the charge-sheet was for assaulting the constable and me, and a charge in connection with letter-bags as well, attempting to steal them, I believe—the charge-sheet is not here—I think the charge first preferred against the prisoners was assaulting Lancey, and attempting to steal two letter-bags—I have given evidence in Court before—I said at the Police-court, as I have said here, that at the time I came up I saw that Latridge had hold of the letter-bags, and I thought he was trying to get them away; he did not do so—I have sworn before to-day that Latridge was trying to get them away. (<hi rend="italic">It appeared from the depositions that the witness had not so stated at the Police-court</hi>)—at the station the prisoners simply gave their names and addresses, and what they were—they were detained all night, as far as I know—I believe their mother came next day, and made inquiries about her sons—we are supposed to make ourselves acquainted with descriptions of criminals wanted, published in the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi> every day—I do not know how the name and address of the third man came into the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>—I won't swear it was from information given by Mrs. Latridge—I saw her at the station the next day—no one gave the name and address of the other man—she gave the name of a man, but no address—I cannot say what that man was—if we had known him we should have gone after him, but we had no description or address, nothing to go by—one of the prisoners gave a false address—Latridge gave the address, 95, Drummond Street, and said he was a coal-porter—no one is here from there, I believe—Smith said he lived at 13, Leicester Place, Leicester Square—I did not take that down at the time; I did some time after I was at the Police-court. (<hi rend="italic">It appeared from the depositions that the witness said at the Police-court the address was</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic">Leicester Place</hi>)—I did not call at 3 nor at 13, Leicester Place—Lancey told me it was 3, Leicester Place—Smith might have told me it was 13 or 3, but he actually lives at 3, Lancaster Place, Munster Square—I cannot actually say whether the address given was 3 or 13, Leicester Square—I was assaulted myself; I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioned police sergeant, and live at 20, Brick Road, Upper Holloway—at a quarter past five on the evening of 23rd December, I was with Ellerby in the Crowndale Road—I heard shouts of "Police!" and ran up and saw Smith had hold of Lancey—I pulled him off and held him—at the same time I picked up a brown felt hat from the road and put it on Smith's head—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "Who are you? what has it to do with you?"—I made no reply, but held him—he took the hat off and said, "That is my hat"—Ellerby was struggling with Latridge, who became very violent and struck Ellerby—Ellerby asked me to go to his assistance; Lancey seized Smith—I caught Latridge's right arm and held on by it, and assisted Ellerby; and Latridge said he would not go any further until he had dressed himself—he buttoned up his waistcoat and put a belt, which I cannot identify, round his waist—Ellerby and Latridge had the bags between them, struggling with them, when I came up, I was busy with Smith—Latridge and Ellerby were holding the bags in their hands, puling them—Latridge went quietly to the station—I was over thirty years in the police force—I am fifty years old next birthday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting-inspector of the North-Western District Post-office—on 23rd December Lancey was on duty as an auxiliary postman, and it was his duty to make the 4.40 collection from Phoenix Street and various pillar-boxes in the district, and take it to the Northwestern Office—these two bags were supplied to him, the green for registered and foreign letters, and the other for ordinary letters—these bags were brought to me in the office at a quarter to six on that evening, from Somers Town Police-station—the green bag contained one registered and seven foreign letters, and the canvas bag 91 ordinary letters—I saw Lancey at half-past six.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was 99 letters in all—there would be some correspondence as well as Christmas cards, and there may have been Christmas presents going by ordinary letters, as well as by parcels post.—part of the neighbourhood where Lancey collected is very poor—the only valuable boxes he would collect would be those at the Midland—this was Laneey's first day of employment—he started at 12 o'clock—there are printed notices on the boxes when they would be cleared, those hours are adhered to.</p>

I am a stockbroker, of 11 and 12, Clement's Lane—the prisoner was my clerk, and was under notice to leave—I last saw him on Tuesday, October 8th; he did not come back—I found my pass-book in my desk, and looked through it on the 11th, and saw an entry of £60 to my debit—I then went to my bank, and saw the sub-manager, and obtained the number of a cheque, and found that two cheques and their counterfoils had been removed from my cheque-book—there are two cheques on a page, and one page between 20,124 and 20,127 was gone—I had not torn them out, or given anyone authority to do so; nor did I sign either of the cheques which was torn out, or give them to anybody to sign; I do not sign cheques in blank—there are only three persons in my office with myself—the cheque-book was on my desk during business hours, and the prisoner could get access to it—this £50 note is endorsed "A. E. Kirke, 13, Size Lane," in the prisoner's writing—I did not give him this cheque—I lent him £15 to save his furniture from being sold, and he gave me an I O U for it, which I cannot find—that was not a portion of a larger sum to be lent—I did not make him a promise to lend him a little money.; I said I could not afford it—I have never been paid the £15—I heard the prisoner cross-examine George Pennell at the Mansion House, and the prisoner said, "I did cash that cheque there."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I have one cheque-book in the office, and one at home, which my wife and servants have access to, but they only represented one account at the bank—I always have my cheques returned; they are never filled in by anybody else—I sometimes left my office cheque-book on my desk for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour and went out, leaving you and Kempson there—you were with me from July to October—the office was never left to my knowledge—you said that you wrote for a paper called <hi rend="italic">Money,</hi> but it was not understood that you were to have a few hours every day to yourself; you were to do my work—I paid you £1 1s. a week—I heard that you were often out—I usually came at 10. 20 a.m., opened my letters, and went to Throgmorton Street to Messrs. Raine, and to Phillips and Gill's, but not for the whole—the key was left with the housekeeper at night, and I asked him for it in the morning—I am not a partner, in Rayne and Co.—only you and Kempson had power to obtain blank cheques—Rayne and Co. have a telegraph to John Shaw—I never had a partner, and if you say that you have seen a letter saying that my partner robbed me, you tell a lie—I have never torn counterfoils out of my cheque-book—I see that the counterfoil of cheque 20,129 is torn out—this is the first time I have noticed that—the cheque answering to it has not been presented to my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A</hi> 558). On Sunday, 22nd December, in the course of my duty, I attended, in plain clothes, a meeting of gas stokers on strike, in Hyde Park—it was a meeting organised in the usual way, with a number of processions, banners, and bands—they arrived in Hyde Park about twelve o'clock—there were six different platforms, at five of which speeches were made—I directed my attention to platform No. 4, at which a man named McCarthy was chairman—I saw the prisoner with others on the platform—there was an opening speech by the chairman, and then a resolution was moved; I took it down in shorthand, which I transcribed—this is it, "That this meeting condemns the endeavours of the South Metropolitan Gas Company," etc.—that was. seconded by the prisoner in a discursive speech—I took down a part of it in shorthand—the speech lasted about a quarter of an hour—this is what he said. (<hi rend="italic">The witness read his shorthand note, in which the following passage occurred</hi>)—"Mr. Livesey has got £40,000; remember that he got it out of the working men; I say it is a standing disgrace that he should be allowed to draw it out of you the sooner he is got rid of the better. I say that he has no right to live, and a man would be a hero that went to-night and murdered him"—(Cheers, and cries of "No")—after that McCarthy said something—I made a report to my superiors of what had occurred—on 27th December I was present with Inspector Greet when he arrested the prisoner on a warrant—he made a statement to the inspector, which he took down.</p>

I am house surgeon of Poplar Hospital—on 6th January, at half-past eight, the prosecutrix was brought in with four incised wounds: one on her left forearm, one on the upper arm, two on her forehead, and two on her face, by the side of her nose—the one on her forehead was deep, and went all across; and the one on her forearm was down to the muscle—all the others were skin wounds—we had no bed, and I sent her to the London Hospital—the wounds were inflicted with some sharp-edged instrument—a piece of glass would not account for them—they must have been done with something which was used as a weapon—it may have been a knife, or any sharp instrument—there were no pieces of glass in the wounds, and no scratches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 13, Vauxhall-Walk—I work at Messrs. Maudslays, engineers, in Westminster Bridge Road—on Sunday night, 22nd December, I was in the Lord Clive public-house, in Vauxhall Walk, with Frank Chambers, my landlord, and others—we went in at half-past ten and came out at ten minutes to eleven, just before closing—we walked across the road; Chambers was about three-quarters of a yard in front, when bang went a pistol off—he said, "George, I am shot!"—I only heard one report—I turned round to my right, and saw the prisoner trying to make his escape—he had not gone a yard before I had him on his back—I caught him by the throat and knocked him down, and I fell too—I saw the pistol in his hand—some persons came up, and the pistol was taken from him; then a constable came up—I went with Chambers to the hospital with the police—the prisoner was a stranger to me; I was never in his company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Italian Walk, Vauxhall, and am a labourer, working in the Phoenix Gas Works—on 22nd December I was in the Lord Give—the prisoner came in about a quarter to ten—he was speak-to Mr. Ryder—I heard him promise to give all the information to Ryder he possibly could, as to how the men were going on inside the works—Chambers was there; he took no part in the conversation, he went out with Trickett when closing time was called—before they got out I saw the prisoner deliberately put his hand in his right-hand coat-pocket, and pull something out, and I said, "Stand on one side, men, he has pulled out either a knife or a pistol from his pocket"—I immediately made off outside the house, and pursued him, and said to a constable outside, "Stop that man! he has got a revolver in his possession," and I and the constable made off over the road after him, and just as I got up the pistol went off—I only heard one shot—the prisoner was just outside the oilshop when he delivered the shot, there was nobody near him—I saw him shoot at Chambers, who was on the pavement, four or five yards from him—then ten or a dozen people made for him, and took the revolver from him—he was standing in the gutter when he fired, and Chambers fell into my arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a lot of Union men in the public-house—Ryder, the assistant-secretary, was there—I was on strike—I did not know the prisoner at all—I heard Ryder ask him whether there had been an accident inside, and whether he would give him information about the Gas Works, and he said he would every night throughout the week—he was not moving towards the door at the time—I did not hear a man say, "He is one of the bonus b—s"—it was when the prisoner was about a yard from the door that I saw him take something from his pocket—he ran out immediately with the revolver in his hand; I thought it was my place to stop him, and take it from him, if possible—about a dozen people followed him—he was not surrounded by anybody when he got outside—I have given an account of this before—I have said, "He was surrounded by three or four persons about a dozen yards from the public-house"—also, "At the time of the explosion the prisoner was on the ground, on his knees, half-way up"—that is right—he was running to get away, the others ran after him, he ran straight across the road—I did not not see him struck—I did not see his face cut open and his mouth bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am quite certain no blow was struck till after he had fired—he was knocked down after the shot was delivered—I don't know whether he was standing up or lying down—I did not see him fire, I saw the reflection of the shot—he was on his feet when he</p>

I am a tailor, and live at 59, Beak Street, Regent Street—on the Sunday night before Christmas I was in the Lord Clive, and saw the prisoner there in company with others—I heard him say he would give information—when we were leaving I got towards the door; the prisoner was behind me—I turned round, and he faced me—Barrow called out that he had got something in his pocket, and I saw the revolver in his right hand—he rushed out past me and a constable at the door, and ran about nine yards across the road—several ran after him, and about a yard before they got to him he turned round, with the revolver in his right hand, and shot one chamber out of the revolver—there was no one within a yard of him when he fired—he shot Chambers in the side—he was about seven yards from him, and then they were both on the ground—I did not know any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw several gas stokers speaking to the prisoner in the house, and asking him questions, whether he would give information as to what was going on inside, and he said he would, and meet any of them any night next week—everything was quiet and friendly—I was there three-quarters of an hour—I did not hear him laugh—he said he would give them a lot of information—he was not making towards the door at the time, not till "Time" was called—I did not get between him and the door purposely; I had my elbow up because there was a rush coming out, and I was looking for a friend—the prisoner was not struck—I could not say what made him rush from the house; there was no cause for it; there was nothing to be afraid of—he went out as fast as he could—he was followed, because he had been seen to take something from his pocket—we were not all rushing after him; I was about seven yards away from him when he fired—he fired before any one was on him—what I have said before was, "As they were going after him the revolver went off"—that is true—he turned round—I did not say, "I can't say what position he was in when it went off"—I saw him down just afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Richmond—on Friday afternoon, 27th December, I was with George Allen in the Marlborough public-house, about half-past eight—the prisoner was there—he was having an argument with another man about India,—Allen said, "I have been in India as long as you have"—the prisoner said, "I don't want to speak to you, kid"—Allen said, "Come outside, you dirty dog, I will make a kid of you"—they went outside—Allen took his coat off—I picked it up and said, "Don't be a fool," and gave it him—he threw it at the prisoner, and struck him in the face—the prisoner did nothing to deceased; he walked away—I and Allen followed him; we were going home—Allen kept saying to the prisoner, "Go home, and pay your poor old mother the £5 you robbed her of"—Allen had had a drop to drink—Beach said, "Come across the road; you have been upsetting me, and I will give you one"—Allen crossed the road, and again began to take off his coat—while he was doing so Beach struck him in the lip with his fist—I said, "Don't be a coward! let the man take his coat off"—he did take it off, and Allen took his hat off—they cuddled together and fell. Allen under, Beach on the top—Allen's head came against the rough stone wall at the side of the church; he lay there; Beach got up and stood beside him—at that time Inspector Walsh and a sergeant came up—the sergeant sat Allen up, and rubbed his head and ear—I took hold of him, and tried to get him along home, leaving Beach behind—on the way Allen complained about his leg being a bit stiff—I found I could not assist him alone; he was too heavy—Beach came up—I asked him to assist the man, and he did so, and we took him to his mother's house—Beach seemed to have had a little drink.</p>

I am resident medical officer at Richmond Hospital—Allen was brought there on Saturday, 28th, in an unconscious state; he appeared to be suffering from injury to the brain; he died at half-past eight in the evening—there was a lacerated wound at the right side of the scalp, about an inch long, also a slight wound on the lip—I made a post-mortem examination with Dr. Gardner—under the skull, corresponding to the wound, I found a blood clot and a rupture of a vessel on the brain, causing death—such a fall as described would cause the injury.</p>

Mrs. Taylor—after the milkman had come back, Head called for another pot of ale, and gave me a third sixpence—I noticed it was bad, and gave it to my mistress, who spoke to Head about it—a constable was sent for—when the prisoners were brought back, and they were charged with giving bad money by my mistress, Head said, "The money is not bad," and she picked up a pot and threw at Mrs. Taylor's head—it missed her—Ayling</p>

On 10th December I arrested the prisoner coming out of a stable in Carlton Grove, Peckham, about a quarter of a mile from Pomeroy Street, with a pony and cart—I afterwards on the same day went to the stable, and in the cart I found a sack containing short pieces of wood, and all the ironwork of a barrow and two side pieces—this is one; on it is "Wheeler, 87, Pomeroy Street"—I informed Wheeler, who accompanied me and identified the property—on the 17th I saw the prisoner, and told him I had found part of a barrow in the cart he was bringing out of the stable, and I said, "That has been identified as stolen from 87, Pomeroy Street, on the 2nd of this month; can you account for that?"—he said, "I had that off of the same man that I had the pony"—I said he had said he had not had any dealings with that man before, and asked him the price he gave—he said he really could not say then—he said he did not know the man from whom he bought the pony—at that time a man was at the Court, waiting for him to adhere to his statement, but he declined to do so—he was charged with stealing the barrow—he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty years of age—I have known the defendant a little over three years—I was on friendly terms with her up to March 25th, 1888—there was then a quarrel—I am an artist—I had a correspondence of a friendly character with her between 1888 and the date of this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I received it from Mrs. Martin on 26th October, 1889. (<hi rend="italic">This was the alleged libel, marked A</hi>). (A). "Dear Madam,—Your daughter Annie was seen last night between the hours of five and half-past with a person who is not a fit companion for her. The girl Illingworth was seen last Friday evening coming out of a public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189001130058"/>
               <p>with a low man, reeling drunk. Save your daughter's character, and rid her of such a vile companion.—A <hi rend="smallCaps">"WELL-WISHER. "</hi>—I know the defendant's writing, and should say most decidedly that it is hers—about five letters had passed between us before I received this—there is not a word of truth in the statement that I wrote it myself, or that I caused anybody to write it at my dictation—I should say that the envelope is also the defendant's writing; I have no doubt of it—I received this other letter (D) on 21st December, 1889, enclosed in the envelope which is attached to it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Maisonette, Balham. Agnes,—I am not going to delay writing to you, for I want to tell you about those letters. I know now the game is lost, the black cross has doomed me; I never thought my name would have been seen through it. The first letter I sent to myself to throw any suspicious person off their guard. I wanted to ruin you if I could, for I <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> you. One letter was not enough, the next was to Mrs. Martin, to try to get you kicked out of that house; the others were to yourself as letters of warning, then my card for your birthday. The other letter I wrote I wanted to ruin you and your daubing, so I sent a nice little note to Mr. Tricker, telling him you were a great impostor and forger in that branch of art. A few more words: will you forgive me <hi rend="italic">privately?</hi> I will never own to my sin in public; I will deny I ever wrote this letter, if you tell your friends of it. All I want is your forgiveness, and to say no more about the case. Will it be very hard? Think, oh, for God's sake, think of the love you once had for me, and in that thought forgive me.—<hi rend="smallCaps">FLORRIE HARRISON. "</hi>) I had received this letter before that, which is in the defendant's writing; to the best of my belief it was in an envelope. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Best wishes for thy misery, On this, thy natal day, I would most fervently express, But words cannot convey My heart's hatered, therefore I Content myself with this: I pray that curses from on High May make thy long life hell. "(<hi rend="italic">This was written on Miss Harrison's card, the name being obliterated by a black cross in ink.</hi>) There is no pretence for sayings that I wrote the letter D, or caused or procured anyone to write it—that is the letter with a seal on it—I had no seal in my possession which would cause that impression; it is "F. E. H. "; nor did I affix that impression of a seal to this letter, nor make any person do it with my knowledge—I received the letter by post, and opened it myself—the seal was affixed to it as it is now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known Miss Harrison for a year and a half or two years before March, 1888—I was very fond of her, and saw a great deal of her, and received a good many letters from her—I had the misfortune to suffer from blood poisoning, and was not quite right in my head for three or four months—the doctors called it hysteria—I know Maggie Moore; she was one of my pupils—I did not, in order to annoy her, write a letter to Miss Ellington, pretending that it came from Arthur Carter, nor did I show such a letter to Miss Elking-ton, and say that I intended to send it, nor did she say, "Surely you don't intend to send it, or I shall tell him who sent it"—it is not a fact that after that, I admitted that I had written to Maggie Moore and apologised—I did apologise, I bore the blame to screen a friend—on 14th December, before the Magistrate, I said this: "I know a girl named Maggie Moore, I never wrote to her and signed it in the name of Arthur Carter; I confessed to writing it, although I did not write it, and apologised for writing it, in order to get a friend out of trouble"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189001130059"/>
               <p>that is quite correct—it is not true that Miss Elkington had the Carter letter shown to her before I sent it, and that she said she would say who wrote it, and that afterwards I sent and apologised for it—I did apologise for it, but I did not say I had written it—I am not positive when I wrote to Miss Moore whether I said I was sorry I had written it, or that I was sorry that it had been written; I can't be sure which it was, but I did apologise; I took the blame—that was to screen Miss Nellie Buchanan; she had written to Miss Elkington—she did not say if I sent it she should tell Maggie Moore who wrote it—I never remember that being said—the quarrel of March, 1888, was smoothed a little, and I went on knowing her a little, but not so intimately, and in January, 1889, there was a breach again—I heard that Miss Harrison had received an anonymous letter, which was said to be concocted by me, and I went to see her about it—this is it—between March, 1888, and October, 1889, I had spoken, to her, but the intimacy had very much cooled—we had a little walk occasionally; afterwards it was very much cooler still—I called and said, "I hear you have received a letter which you think I wrote; will you show it to me?"—she did show it to me—I did not say, "I believe that is my brother-in-law, he will do anything"—I said to Mrs. Elkington, he might have sent it for a joke—she is the mother of Miss-Elkington; it did not strike me as anything but a joke—that was about October 24th, and on 25th Mrs. Martin handed me the letter which is the subject of this indictment—I think I employed Mr. Norman, the solicitor, between October 24th and November 7th—I live at Upper Tooting, and my father went up to Mr. Norman—I saw a copy of the letter addressed to Mr. Norman on November 7th—this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated,</hi> "I beg to say I have never written to Miss Martin in my life; I know her only by name; the letter written in my name is a forgery, and therefore I cannot apologise").—Miss Harrison went into the witness box-in support of every syllable of that letter—I received letter B on 13th November, a week after Miss. Harrison had denied the forgery—this of the 15th is on one of Miss. Harrison's cards; she admitted that at the Police-court—I am an artist, and possess Indian ink—I did not paint Indian ink over this—I never had one of Miss Harrison's visiting cards in my life—she has never left one with me—on 27th November I laid information at Wandsworth Police-court—my father acted in the matter—a summons was granted on. December 4th—Mr. De Rutzen the Magistrate, suggested there should be a reconciliation, and adjourned the case for it—all we required was a public apology—Miss Harrison said in terms that she did not write the letter—she did not say to me that she had never written any letter libelling me, and she did not believe I deserved the libel—the case not being settled, it came on before Mr. Mead on December 19th, and was adjourned to January 2nd—I cannot say whether this is a genuine seal put on to another envelope—I received letter E on 27th December ("Agnes Illingworth—What is the meaning of your silence? does it mean that you have already betrayed me? Have any of your friends seen my letter of last Saturday? Show it them, and I will deny it, and make you appear as the forger. Fool that I was to ever confess to you! If you dare to betray me, I will ruin you in a way you may never dream of, or know how the blow will come. Curse you!</p>

"</hi>—"A warning—Hate is strong. You are enjoying a long course of freedom with your well hands. Beware of hate! one night it will do you; you, the rising dauber, curse you. Love is weak, hatered is strong.") I did not write that letter, nor did I use a crayon pencil to imitate Miss Harrison's writing, leaving the marks under the ink—my sight is very good, but I cannot see any trace of crayon pencilling in the word "that" on page 4 of letter D, nor in the signature Florrie—my solicitor had a lot of letters at the Police-court which she had written—on December 30th I received this letter, purporting to come from Dr. Ridley Hilder, my medical man—I do not think he is here—I am quite sure I did not direct that to myself and make it up myself—it says: "The powder to be taken one hour before leaving on Thursday; it will carry you through"—I have not opened the powder—I was not going away for my health—I received letter G, purporting to be written by Annie Martin, who is here. ("Guildford Lodge, Monday. Dear Agnes—My mother wishes me to write you a few lines. Miss Harrison called to see us one day last week, and we believe her to be deeply wronged. My mother declines to have anything more to do with the case, and it is also her wish and mine that you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> call here anymore.

Do not trouble to call about this note, as we shall decline to see you.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. BEAGLE. "</hi>) I know that that letter was not written by Mrs. Beagle, nor the other by Mrs. Martin—I did not write them myself—I was not aware that the prisoner did not know Mrs. Beagle's name—the seal which is said to have been transferred was not called to the Magistrate's attention—I met the prisoner coming out of church on December 1st—I do not know whether the summons had been served on her then—I said, "Florrie, will you speak to me?"—she said,"Certainly not"—this letter (M) bears my writing on the envelope; it was not registered—I did not put a sixpence inside; that was in one sent separately; I think you have the wrong envelope—this (P) is also my writing, though not belonging to the letter—I sometimes make mistakes in spelling—the matter of Frank Carter was over six years ago—I was ill, and treated for hysteria in 1888, and a doctor attended me, and since January last year Mr. Hilder attended me for blood poisoning—I have no memory as to my losing my head at that <hi rend="italic">time.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I am single, and live with my parents at Maisonette, Balham—I made Miss Illingworth's acquaintance about three years ago—she is very excitable and imaginative—she professed the deepest love towards me—those professions were unusually strong before March, 1888—then there was a breach, after which the intimacy was renewed, and she professed just the same feelings towards me—in January, 1889, there was a further breach, and though I used to meet her sometimes, I never went to her house, but she very much wanted the friendship to be continued—I did not keep aloof, but I did not give her the same opportunity of expressing her intense love for me—I received this letter (L) on Monday, the 21st, and have no doubt at all that it is in her writing—I formed that opinion directly I received it—she called on me on Thursday, the 24th—I did not go with her to her brother-in-law, but I knew she was going there, and I met her there half-an-hour afterwards, and showed her the letter, and said, "I believe you wrote this yourself"—she said, "I did not"—I found she was going to Mrs. Elkington's, so I went there, but did not take the letter with me—she said there that she had suspicions who had sent it—Mrs. Elkington said, "Who do you suspect?"—she replied, "My brother-in-law, because he has a spite against me," and I think she said, "Or he may have done it in a joke"; I am not sure—she said, "Will you give me the letter (L)?" and of course I said, "No"—letter L begins, "The person who was seen to enter your house last Tuesday afternoon, etc., was seen reeling drunk"—I understood that to mean Miss Illingworth—I have never written or said a word imputing drunkenness to her, or anything derogatory of her—it says, "cursing you and yours"—I never heard Miss Illingworth curse anybody—this is the envelope; the word "Maisonette" is misspelt—I believe it to be Miss Illingworth's writing—I have always had that belief, and have never changed it—after the interview at Mrs. Elkington's, I heard no more about "A Well-wisher" till after Mrs. Martin took it to Mrs. Illingworth—until Mr. Norman's letter came I heard nothing more about anonymous writing—this is it.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I wrote this letter (J) as far as I know, but this one has been so well copied, perhaps that one was—I have no doubt it was written by me—I do not suggest for a moment that it is forged—I have no recollection of having written it—I occasionally sealed my letters to Miss Illingworth—the envelope is my writing, and this is my seal—I have no doubt the letter was sent in this envelope, which is marked "May 10, '88"—I was on very affectionate terms with her then.

               <p>but not afterwards—it is very like my writing, but some parts are not so much like, and it is very shaky—I have never said anything to Miss Illingworth about drunkenness, nor have I accused anybody else of it, nor has she actually accused anyone, but she has mentioned it to me—I suggest that the black seal on letter D has been cut off another letter and stuck on; you can see the other paper underneath—I do not think I have any note-paper like some of these letters which I dispute—if the letters put in bear the same water-mark as my admitted letters, I should say that the paper was got from the same shop—I suggest that Miss Illingworth concocted all these letters, and entered into this foul conspiracy because I refused to renew our former intimacy—our friendship was broken off because she tried to cause mischief between a mutual lady friend and myself—I was very angry with her, and would not speak to her again; if she had not been rude to me, and sent me this insulting letter (P <hi rend="italic">dated February</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1889), I would have passed over it—in my opinion all the letters of a scurrilous character have been written by Miss Illingworth,. and nothing will change my opinion.</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, and a fac-similist—I am employed by the Government—I have had cases of persons writing libels which they attributed to others; I had a case yesterday in the High Court of Justice—I did not differ from Mr. Netherclift on that occasion—prior to 17th November, at the request of the defendant's father, I went to the Police-court, and looked at the letters and envelopes A and B, and the black cross card C—I had not then seen letter L—I was at Wandsworth Court when Mr. Netherclift gave his evidence; I saw that letter in Court, but had nothing to do with it then, that was before I was engaged—in my opinon A, B and C are all written by the same person—I have seen M and P, the admitted writing of Miss Illingworth, M is a piece of poetry—I have compared M and P with the libel A, and in my opinion they are written by the same party, and not by Miss Harrison—looking at N and O, the admitted writing of Miss Harrison, it is my opinion that she did not write A, but I find the similarity very strong between it and the poetry written by Miss Illingworth that I did not come to the conclusion that Miss Harrison wrote it—my opinion is that it was not written by Miss Harrison; there is a strong similarity between it and the prosecutrix's writing—letter D was first handed to me on the 6th January, the day of the committal, at the Police-court, and taken away; I was not able to examine it well—the letter which Miss Elkington says is shaky, is an imitation of Miss Harrison's writing—I find under the ink, traces of pencilling, the Magistrate's clerk drew my attention to it first—I daresay some of them are obliterated now (<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out to the Jury pencillings under the ink in letters D, H, and others</hi>)—in my opinion the writing is subsequent to the pencilling—I believe letter D is not Miss Harrison's writing; it is an imitation; it is very shaky—I attribute the shakiness to the imitation—I made a minute examination of the seal subsequent to the case being sent for trial last Monday in Court here—the seal is not the hot wax dropped on the envelope; there are seven patches of wax round the edge of it, so as to cover the deception, and there is the mark of fingers—here is a sketch, where you can see it—(<hi rend="italic">handing in an enlargement</hi>)—the letter Miss Elkington was cross-examined upon is also a good imitation of her writing—E is a better imitation than D, and I find pencilling there as well—I should have said at the Police-court that there was a great similarity between the writing of the anonymous letter and the defendant's letter, if I had not seen in her letters great similarity between the defendant's and the complainant's letters.</p>
